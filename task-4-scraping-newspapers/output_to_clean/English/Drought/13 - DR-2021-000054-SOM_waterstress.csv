The Middle East and many parts of Africa are arid regions with long experience of drought. However, anthropogenic climate change threatens to significantly exacerbate these challenges. In 2017, the World Bank noted that, “while population and economic growth will increase water demands, climate change will be the primary driver for the most pronounced changes in surface water stress across” the Middle East. The UN has projected that temperature increases in the Sahel will be 1.5 times higher than the global average. Multiple studies indicate that the risks of prolonged, severe drought will be higher as the global climate shifts. Climate change is not the only problem: Population growth, economic development, unsustainable agricultural policies, poor infrastructure, and other factors contribute. Nonetheless, climate change will intensify all of these factors.

Increased drought conditions and more variable rainfall patterns will present many challenges to the Middle East and Africa. One of those challenges will be the way that water stress intersects with conflict and violent extremist groups. While there is statistical evidence that climate change increases the risk of conflict, it is often difficult to draw clear causal links between drought and conflict. In any conflict, there are multiple factors that contribute to violence. Drought puts stress on existing fractures in a society and increases the risk of conflict by exacerbating problems such as inequality, unemployment, migration, food shortages and governance failures. Drought diminishes a society’s overall resilience.

Conflict over water in the Middle East and Africa is as old as civilization, but climate change and population growth are compounding age-old problems. In some cases, water shortages lead to direct forms of conflict. Tribes, local communities and even countries can dispute and contest access to water sources. On a national level, upstream states can take steps that threaten downstream states’ basic access to water, leading to disputes that increase the risk of war — reflected in recent concerns about potential conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt.

More often, drought and water shortages contribute to conflict indirectly by weakening societal and governing structures and putting more stress on existing divisions. Drought can increase competition for food and push food prices higher, with destabilizing effects. Water shortages undermine faith in governments, putting strain on societies that are already struggling with weak governance and benefiting insurgent or extremist groups. War can damage water infrastructure — as it has in Yemen and Syria, for example — which puts further pressures on vulnerable populations. These factors contribute to feedback loops that erode a country’s or a community’s stability.

In many cases, prolonged droughts so badly damage agricultural communities that they lead to migration to urban areas, as has happened in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Such migration from an unusually severe and prolonged drought clearly contributed to the factors behind the Syrian civil war.

Water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. Kerry Boyd Anderson

Another negative impact of the increased risk of drought is that water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. At the most basic level, there are examples of extremist groups attacking farmers and stealing their food supplies in the midst of drought or famine, as Al-Shabaab reportedly did in Somalia during the 2011 famine. Such actions contribute to humanitarian disaster and conflict cycles.

In other cases, violent extremist organizations take somewhat more sophisticated approaches to exploiting water shortages. They can benefit from a sense that governments are unable to meet people’s basic needs. There are examples from countries such as Iraq and Mali of extremist groups recruiting boys and men who can no longer survive from farming or herding due to severe drought. Daesh used control of limited water resources to charge taxes to fund its operations and try to present itself as a governing authority. Extremist groups have exploited migrants who have been forced to move due to drought and have used control over water resources to reward allies and punish enemies.

Throughout history, many actors have weaponized water, but Daesh took such actions to a new level. Its brief control of the Mosul Dam threatened many communities as well as opposing forces. Both Daesh and Al-Shabaab used water tactically, diverting it to block opposing forces. They have also attempted to use water to reward allies and punish opponents.

The intersections of climate change, drought, and conflict and violent extremism are complex and vary from country to country. Therefore, solutions to these problems must also be both multifaceted and tailored to the specific conditions in a country or locale. Recognizing that there are links between climate change, drought and floods, and conflict and violent extremist groups is an important start.

Solutions could include shaping aid policies and counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies to take water scarcity into account. Ensuring access to water for displaced populations is an important step. Aid programs can help provide farmers with more efficient farming techniques and tools, such as drip irrigation, and can help build infrastructure that wastes less water. All governments should work to mitigate global climate change.

Governments can also take steps to enforce norms against weaponizing water. There are some international agreements, such as Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions, which can be used to hold actors who weaponize water accountable. Military operations should seek to avoid any direct or collateral damage to water infrastructure, thereby reinforcing a norm against weaponizing water and helping prevent conditions that feed into the conflict cycle. Access to water is a basic human need that should not be a part of warfare.

1,1,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Climate shifts and rising demand leave Turkey battling growing water stress - Global Banking And Finance Review,https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/climate-shifts-and-rising-demand-leave-turkey-battling-growing-water-stress/,"By Jennifer Hattam

ISTANBUL (Thomson Reuters Foundation) – Last winter, the massive dams and reservoirs that supply water to Istanbul’s 15 million residents fell to critically low levels, sparking fears of shortages.

Late-arriving snow and rain ultimately gave Turkey’s largest city a reprieve.

But water and climate experts say the country’s water worries are far from over – and more dams are part of the problem.

“Instead of trying to reduce our water demand, or decrease the amount lost through broken pipes and leaks, we are just focused on creating more supply by building new dams,” said Akgun Ilhan, a water management expert at the Istanbul Policy Center.

Turkey has built more than a thousand new dams over the last 18 years, with 90 more expected to be completed this year, according to the country’s General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI).

But “these big hydraulic projects have a large impact on ecosystems and societies” including by displacing communities and destroying forests and farmland, Ilhan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Figures from the DSI show that available water in Turkey has been dropping steadily over the past two decades, from about 1,650 cubic meters per person in 2000 to less than 1,350 in 2020.

The United Nations defines a country as water stressed if it falls below 1,700 cubic metres per person, and water scarce if it reaches 1,000 cubic metres.

Population growth, urbanisation, climate change and – critics like Ilhan say – poor water management all are straining Turkey’s water supplies.

As that happens, shared water has become an increasing source of political tension between Turkey and its downstream neighbours Iraq and Syria.

“There is no difference between protecting our water and protecting our homeland,” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in March, at a ceremony inaugurating a new parliamentary Water Council.

At the event, Erdogan promised 5.2 billion lira ($645 million) in water investments including new dams, water-treatment plants and improved irrigation.

Agriculture – largely reliant on irrigation from dams and groundwater – accounts for nearly 75% of Turkey’s annual water consumption, said Sara Marjani Zadeh, a regional water quality officer for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

So far, water-saving drip and sprinkler irrigation are used on less than a third of Turkey’s 6.7 million hectares (16.5 million acres) of irrigated farmland, according to the FAO.

Efforts to get farmers to shift to water-saving – but also energy-demanding – irrigation methods so far have yielded “no major change,” said Gokhan Ozertan, a professor of economics at Istanbul’s Bogazici University.

“Farmers don’t want to pay for the electricity and maintenance required,” he said. “And because (farm) subsidies aren’t targeted – farmers just receive the money no matter what they are growing or how – there’s no incentive to switch.”

The lack of inducements to conserve water has left many farmers growing unsustainably thirsty crops like sugar beets and cotton in dry areas even in the face of declining water availability, he said.

CLIMATE RISKS

Turkey’s water troubles are likely to intensify as the effects of climate change increase in frequency and severity, said Ilhan, the water management expert.

“Turkey has been facing droughts every four or five years since the late 1980s, and climate projections show that precipitation levels will further diminish,” she explained.

The Turkish government has repeatedly pledged to fight climate change, announcing a new 14-point strategy in February which includes boosting solar and wind power capacity and reducing fossil fuel use in buildings by 25% by 2023.

But climate impacts like drought and flooding are intensifying, and may cut yields of key Turkish export crops like hazelnuts, apricots and wheat by as much as 40% in the coming decades, according to Ozertan’s projections.

Many farmers who struggle to make a living end up relocating to big cities like Istanbul, the capital Ankara and the Aegean port city of Izmir, putting further pressure on water supplies there.

“This continuous growth in population obliges urban municipalities to keep finding new sources of water,” Ilhan said.

Often that means more large infrastructure projects like dams and pipelines – and building these can require evacuating rural villages, often driving more urban migration.

“And then the water consumption level in cities rises, so we build more dams,” Ilhan said. “It’s an absolute vicious cycle.”

NEW VISION

The growing municipality of Izmir, in western Turkey, is trying to break that cycle for residents of the city and its surrounding areas.

The river basins that provide water to the city have become strained in part by the growing production of water-intensive forage for cattle, said Guven Eken, an advisor to Izmir Mayor Tunc Soyer.

So the municipality has begun using targeted subsidies, buying guarantees and marketing support to encourage farmers to take up less-thirsty crops and growing methods, he explained.

That includes focusing on more high-value foods like olives and goat’s cheese that were traditionally produced in the region and are better suited to its dry climate, as well as swapping to more efficient irrigation, Eken said.

With support, “we are already seeing producers shifting back to the original agricultural ways that they had abandoned because they weren’t making enough money”, he added.

Izmir officials also are shoring up infrastructure to reduce water waste in urban areas.

Nationwide, nearly half of Turkey’s drinking water is lost to leaks before it reaches the tap, according to a 2020 report published by the Water Policy Association, an Ankara-based non-governmental organisation.

In March, Izmir hosted a summit for mayors and other officials from 22 cities led by Turkey’s political opposition, representing about 65% of the country’s population.

The mayors signed a manifesto pledging to better manage water, in line with some of the strategies Izmir is now pursuing, and called on the national government to do the same.

“Finally, we heard the mayors say things that academics and activists have been talking about for years,” said Ilhan.

“The manifesto has no legal obligations, but it’s on the right track,” she said. “Even putting 10% of it into practice would make a great change.”

2,2,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Drought is Leading to Instability and Water Weaponization in the Middle East and North Africa – Homeland Security Today - HSToday,https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/drought-is-leading-to-instability-and-water-weaponization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/,"Water stress is a growing problem worldwide. Overuse, population growth, and climate change are contributing to desperate conditions and violent extremist organizations (VEOs) are turning scarce water into a weapon. Nowhere is this trend more visible than in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region of critical importance to U.S. national security interests. The MENA region has long been prone to both cyclical and discrete periods of droughts. There is mounting evidence suggesting that climate change, by driving significant winter precipitation decline, is increasing the frequency and severity of these events.

Climate change impacts that affected Syria could be a harbinger for other countries in the region. The connection between climate change and Syrian instability was first raised by our colleagues Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell in 2012, and confirmed by climate scientist and Center for Climate and Security Senior Fellow, Colin P. Kelley, and his colleagues, who linked the consequential 2007-2010 drought to a long-term warming trend in the eastern Mediterranean (finding that the drought was made 2-3 times more likely due to climate change).. Drought conditions as well as poorly-designed and discriminatory water policies implemented by the Assad regime and the Alawite elite were also factors that contributed to societal instability at the onset of the Syrian civil war. The regional climate model ALADIN corroborates previous studies projecting that the MENA region will continue to be a global hotspot for drought into the late twenty-first century.

Declining water security in MENA is expected to stem not only from climate change impacts but also from other factors such as pollution, population growth, government corruption, and unsustainable utilization of existing water sources. Over the next 20 to 30 years, threats to water security in the region will be further exacerbated by continuing transboundary disputes over access to water resources as described in a July 2020 memorandum by the U.S. National Intelligence Council on how water affects economic and political stability. Countries of particular concern include Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

Water and Conflict: A Vicious Cycle

In MENA and Africa there is correlation between the spheres of influence of VEOs—groups that support and perpetrate ideologically-motivated violence—and areas of dry land or sparse vegetation.

Where extremist groups are active, the correlation between climate-based water stress and the onset of violence can be viewed in terms of a water conflict cycle which Marcus King (one of the authors of this article) described in a series of case studies of Syria and Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia. In all three cases, water stressors such as increases in temperature, water scarcity, extreme weather, and depletion of groundwater led to detrimental local systemic outcomes. Climate shocks weaken state resiliency on multiple fronts. As a result of these stressors, people experience strains on rural livelihoods that accompany decreases in the productivity of agricultural systems. In each case, farmers responded through internal and external mass environmental migration, where in many cases they fell prey to violence perpetrated by VEOs.

Cross-border migration can also have cascading impacts on international security in a region as volatile as MENA. Somali migrants have fled to Yemen, another state embroiled in chaos, further complicating the delicate human security conditions in that country. Migrants from Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia—all epicenters of water weaponization—continue on their way to Europe, and ethnonationalist political forces, by stoking fear of migrants, have exploited this humanitarian crisis to gain political power. The next stage of this vicious cycle is the loss of foreign investment and development assistance due to ongoing conflict which in turn hinders water infrastructure development. Domestic resources that could be used for this purpose are diverted to combat terrorism.

Water Weaponization

State and nonstate actors already at war have taken advantage of water stress to weaponize water as detailed in the three case studies featuring ISIS, Al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram. These VEOs have weaponized water in distinct ways depending on their capabilities and the characteristics of these ongoing internal wars. These cases prove that water can be used as a strategic or tactical weapon or as a means to terrorize, coerce, and subjugate local populations. For example, ISIS weaponized water on the strategic level by capturing the Mosul Dam on August 7, 2014. The group also wielded water as a tactical weapon against Iraqi forces, and collaterally flooded several villages. a In an article in the Washington Quarterly by one of the authors of this article, Marcus King, it’s argued that water weaponization was essential to the warfighting strategy of ISIS

Aside from outright weaponization, water has also been used by parties to conflict in MENA as a political lever. Mark Zeitoun coined the phrase hydro-hegemony to describe this behavior. As the upper riparian in the Tigris-Euphrates River System, hydro-hegemony places Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government in a position to leverage water resources against “Federal Iraq” which lies downstream. The construction of dams in Turkey and Iran, including in Ilisu, Daryan, and Sardash, are further decreasing water supplies.

As water becomes more polluted and scarce there is a perception in southern Iraq that the Kurds are overusing the waters of the Tigris and other rivers. This perception alone could be enough to destabilize relations, further eroding a frayed working relationship between Erbil and Baghdad. A treatment by Marcus King of the hydro-politics of Iraqi Kurdistan, including how climate change has impacted water resources, can be found in the volume Water and Conflict in the Middle East.

Today, as impacts of climate change are growing more intense, ushering in micro level water conflicts throughout Iraq, there is a sobering possibility that water stress will play into dissatisfaction with the national government manifested by popular support for a resurgence of ISIS in many areas.

Take the situation in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Upstream damming has decreased water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers which converge in this area. This issue paired with decades of water mismanagement, climate-induced heatwaves, increased pollution, and seawater intrusion have limited access to electricity and clean water for drinking and sanitation leading to continued popular dissatisfaction and instability. Tensions exploded in 2018, as violent protests erupted after 100,000 fell sick from polluted waters. In January 2020, similar protests in Basra were met with violent reprisals by national authorities. Severe desertification in this area has caused farmers to abandon their livelihoods; some turning desperately towards theft for survival. In recent years, the worsening of desertification has correlated positively with increasing instances of crime such as armed robbery and human trafficking in Basra.

In 2020, the country faced scorching, record-high temperatures that reached 125.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In July 2020, government cuts to electricity left households throughout the country with few ways to combat unbearable temperatures. Again the Iraqis saw their upstream neighbors as the culprits while the increasingly delegitimized government in Baghdad did nothing. This raises the questions of what will happen as we approach another sweltering summer in Iraq.

Recommendations

Climate-driven environmental scarcity contributes to hydro-hegemonic behavior by nations and repeated, systematic, and unprecedented water weaponization by VEOs. Today, there is rising concern that Islamic State in West Africa is now extending its reach into Burkina Faso and that it may choose to leverage access to water over subjected populations to build allegiances, much as their brethren did in Syria and Iraq. Despite recent growth in water weaponization, we must not allow it to be normalized in modern warfare, and we must recognize and combat the role climate change has played in enabling such weaponization.

Overall, nations need to appreciate water as a potential tool for terror, and that it needs to be safeguarded as such. Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the destruction of drinking-water installations, supplies, and irrigation works. Another agreement, the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), prohibits action such as the deliberate destruction of infrastructure to kill civilians or to flood enemy positions. While climate has been addressed as a contributor to instability, there is a need for more robust legal remedies at the national and international level.

Development assistance from the United States and other multilateral actors that builds resilience to climate change will alleviate climate-induced water stress and reduce instability that could lead to violence across the MENA region. However, development assistance is a long-range strategy that is hard to implement during ongoing conflict. The Global Fragility Act, passed by Congress in 2019, provides funds to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent violence globally, including through development assistance, but it fails to mention climate change in any capacity as impacting state fragility.

The Biden Administration now has the opportunity to address this gap. In MENA, addressing water stress through development assistance can be a tool toward stability and conflict prevention and therefore form an integral part of counterinsurgency strategies against violent extremist organizations.

The purpose of this document isto provide updated information on the progress of the Gu season to facilitate contingency and response planning. This Somalia Seasonal Monitor is valid through April 30, 2021 and is produced in collaboration with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Food Security andNutritionAnalysis Unit (FSNAU)

Start of the 2021 gu rains marked by delayed and below-average rainfall

The 2021 gu rainfall season, which typically begins between late March and mid-April, has yet to be effectively established across many areas of Somalia. Somalia received little to no rainfall in March and poorly distributed rainfall between April 1 and 20. To date, rainfall has performed relatively better in the South than in central and northern Somalia. According to CHIRPS preliminary remote sensing data for the period of April 11-20, localized rainfall ranging between 10 and 75 millimeters (mm) fell in most of Bay and Lower Juba regions and in localized areas of Hiiraan, Bakool, Gedo, and the Shabelle regions. Conversely, the central regions received only 10-25 mm while the Northwest received less than 25 mm of rain and the Northeast received less than 10 mm (Figure 1). In comparison to the long-term average, rainfall amounts were 10-50 mm below average across much of the South and in parts of the Northwest but were considered climatologically average in most of the Northeast, central regions, and localized areas in the South.

According to the most recent FAO SWALIM river station gauge data, water levels in the Shabelle River remain below average and water levels in the Juba River range from near average to slightly above average. Currently, the risk of flooding along both rivers is low.

In the Northwest, the rainfall season has yet to be fully established in most pastoral and agropastoral livelihood zones in Awdal,

Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sool, and Sanaag regions. During the period of April 11-20, only localized light to moderate rain occurred in Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed and localized areas of Hawd Pastoral and Golis Pastoral livelihood zones in Togdheer region. However, localized flooding was reported in parts in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone in Lughaya district of Awdal due to moderate rainfall in the Golis Mountains. In Sool and Sanaag, little to no rainfall has been reported. As a result, meteorological drought is present and pasture and water availability remain significantly below normal in most regions, adversely affecting livestock condition and productivity.

In the Northeast, most livelihood zones in Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug regions received little to no rain during the period of April 11-20. In Bari, only localized, light to moderate rainfall occurred in parts of East Golis Pastoral livelihood zone of Caluula and Qandala districts. In Nugaal and northern Mudug, only localized light showers were reported in Hawd Pastoral and Addun Pastoral livelihood zones of Burtinle and Eyl districts. Meteorological drought exists across this area and rangeland conditions range from below normal to poor, especially in Northern Inland Pastoral livelihood zone where rainfall in the preceding 2020 deyr season was also poor.

In central regions, rainfall onset was delayed across Galgaduud and southern Mudug regions. However, widespread moderate to heavy rainfall was reported on April 20 in both regions, marking the onset of the gu season. The exceptions are most of Galkacyo and Hobyo districts in southern Mudug, which remained dry. Although the recent rain has alleviated water stress and reduced reliance on water trucking, rangeland conditions remain well below typical levels with negative impacts on livestock conditions and productivity.

In the South, the onset of the gu varied during the period of April 1-20. Most livelihood zones in Bay, Lower Juba, and Lower and Middle Shabelle regions received localized, moderate rainfall early in the month. In mid-April, light to moderate rainfall was more widespread. However, according to ground reports, Southern Rainfed Agropastoral and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones received little to no rainfall through April 20. Between April 1 and 20, rain gauge stations recorded 141.6 mm in Qansahdhere (Bay),

64.5 mm in Jamaame (Lower Juba), 45 mm in Beledweyne (Hiiraan), 42.5 mm in Hudur (Bakool), 30.5 mm in Baidoa (Bay), and 30 mm in Sakow (Middle Juba). No flood risk was reported from the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Given these below-average amounts, the rains have benefitted rangeland conditions but are not yet sufficient to support optimal crop development.

According to the satellite-derived eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period of April 11-20, 2021, negative vegetation anomalies are widespread in southern, central, and northwestern parts of the country (Figure 3). Negative anomalies are attributed to below-average precipitation in late 2020, the hotter-than-normal jilaal dry season in early 2021, and delayed or poor gu rainfall in April. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center's seven-day weather forecast through April 30 predicts heavy precipitation of up to 100 mm across most of the Northwest, while eastern-central Somalia and some parts in the South (including most of Hiiraan and Bakool and localized areas of Bay) are forecast to receive 15-40 mm of rainfall. However, much of the Shabelle, the Juba, and Gedo regions and much of the central and northeastern regions will likely receive little to no rainfall.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564529-somalia-gu-seasonal-monitor-20210423-final.png?itok=ssOsoAmc,"['season', 'mm', 'monitor', '23', 'livelihood', 'regions', 'juba', 'gu', 'localized', 'pastoral', 'received', 'rainfall', '2021', 'seasonal', 'somalia']", 
4,4,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Transitioning to innovative green energy can help Somalia alleviate poverty - Horn Observer,https://hornobserver.com/articles/929/Transitioning-to-innovative-green-energy-can-help-Somalia-alleviate-poverty,"



Nearly seven out of ten Somalis live in poverty, according to World Bank data, the sixth highest rate in the region. Poverty is both widespread and widespread, and unless the right policies are implemented, persistent and vulnerable poverty will hinder future economic and social development.







Without preemptive approaches, these factors can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and reduce people's livelihood options, which in turn may have adverse effects on stability and security in this Horn of Africa country.





More frequent and severe droughts and floods undermine food security and negatively affect disadvantaged groups, fuel grievances, increase competition for scarce resources, and worsen aggravating the existing stress and vulnerability of the communities.





Renewable energy projects in many African countries have demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed to create businesses and jobs. Renewable energy technology can also contribute indirectly to poverty alleviation by providing energy for cooking, space heating and lighting.





A recent study by the African Development Bank found that Somalia has the highest resource potential of any African country for land-based wind power and can generate between 30,000 and 45,000 MW. Solar power can generate in excess of 2,000 kWh/m2. It is estimated that only about 16% of the population has access to electricity. Somalia has a higher tax rate than neighboring countries Kenya and Ethiopia. Only 1% of rural communities have access to electricity and 35% in urban areas. An estimated 2.4 million households in Somalia are without electricity.





The current installed power generation capacity in Somalia is about 106 megawatts. While most power companies rely on diesel generators for power generation, there is growing interest and investment in hybrid systems using solar and wind energy sources.





Somalia's electricity sector faces significant challenges, including a lack of adequately trained workers, a weak regulatory environment, high investment costs, and scarce energy supplies and poor infrastructure. Due to the absence of traditional project finance, along with local Islamic financing practices, Somalia has developed its own funding mechanisms for growing infrastructure projects and development projects. The companies have successfully raised significant amounts of money from the expatriate community in the United States and beyond for energy projects. Despite the recent major steps taken by the private sector to increase electricity production and distribution.





If Somalia establishes a well-managed renewable energy sector with defined laws, the country can use renewable energy to reduce poverty, improve energy security, increase access to energy, and reduce poverty. Climate change mitigation and transitioning to renewable energy can help reduce poverty, by creating good jobs that the poor people can do.





In rural communities including nomads need a very sustainable energy so that their standard of living can improve. Using solar energy for cooking instead of firewood and coal, and solar lights for lighting and to educate nomadic children can be a small and affordable step. Renewable energy will not run out and maintenance requirements are completely lower and it saves money. In this way, using renewable energy for farming can improve food security and access to clean water for the most vulnerable communities.





So if Somalia wants to alleviate poverty, we must turn to renewable energy.

When she’s not in classes, she searches for firewood and water, walking 3 km to fetch 10 litres of water carried in a bucket.

Drought conditions are spreading throughout the country against a backdrop of high levels of forced displacement. According to an OCHA report, more than 1.3 million Somalis were displaced in 2020, and 112,000 have been displaced in the first three months of 2021, about 34 percent of them due to drought conditions. Scientists have linked the frequency and severity of natural disasters to climate change.

Women and girls bear the brunt

UNFPA Representative in Somalia Anders Thomsen said the drought conditions are impeding services, especially to vulnerable women and girls. “Already, many girls and women are poor and disenfranchised,” he said. “They cannot access essential health care services.”

UNFPA has distributed 3,620 dignity kits, which contain basic hygiene necessities including soap and detergent, a toothbrush and toothpaste and underwear and menstrual pads, throughout Somaliland and Puntland. Ms. Khalif said the kit reduces stress and anxiety: “The items provide me with freedom and time.” Still, “I miss my father. The [camp] is helpful, but it does not provide me with a sense of home.”

During the distribution of the kits, women and adolescent girls receive information on how to protect themselves from gender-based violence. UNFPA has also deployed eight mobile teams to deliver gender-based violence, protection and reproductive health services and is treating rape survivors in both IDP camps and host communities.

Awaiting better days

In the absence of humanitarian assistance, a Food Security Analysis System report published by the United Nations in February indicates that up to 2.7 million people across Somalia are expected to face food disruptions or depleted resources including crops and livestock through mid-2021. Drivers of acute food insecurity include the compounding effects of poor and erratic rainfall, flooding, desert locust infestation, socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and conflict.

As the majority among the poor in Somalia, women – especially heads of households and those with disabilities – bear the brunt of a situation completely out of their control. So they wait for the skies to open up and the relief the rains might bring.

STUDY OBJECTIVES & METHODOLOGY

This report presents the results of the 2020 annual Post-Distribution Monitoring (PDM) of UNHCR’s urban basic needs cash assistance programme in Jordan. Through an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) banking network equipped with iris scan technology, the agency disburses over 5.5 million United States Dollars (USD) per month to about 33,000 vulnerable refugee families across the country. UNHCR Jordan’s population of concern consists mainly (90%+) of Syrian refugees, but the organisation also assists refugees from other countries such as Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen. Assistance is designed to allow refugees in urban environments in Jordan to meet their basic needs.

A survey was administered via phone to 600 respondents across the country, ensuring representativeness among both Syrian and non-Syrian refugee beneficiaries of UNHCR Jordan basic needs cash assistance. The survey covers the receiving and withdrawing journey from the beneficiary perspective. It also contains indicators relevant to satisfaction and potential problems encountered, spending patterns, and impact in different dimensions ranging from food security to coping mechanisms. The quantitative data was complemented by qualitative Focus Group Discussions (FGDs).

KEY FINDINGS: SEVEN MESSAGES

1. Use of cash to meet essential household needs

As intended, almost all respondents use the cash to meet their running essential household needs: rent and food. To a lesser extent, the cash is used to pay for utilities, health, and water. The percentage of respondents spending their cash assistance on food has steadily increased since 2018. Different governorates exhibit distinct cash expenditure patterns with Amman and Zarqa appearing to be considerably pricier environments. Only 4% of respondents use cash to reduce debt, a significant decrease from the 16% reported in 2019 and a testament to the increased challenges brought by 2020, and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)’s impacts. The proportion of refugee households holding debt has remained steady between 2019 and 2020 (88% and 87% respectively).

2. Negative coping mechanisms remain common

Through regular post-distribution monitoring, UNHCR aims to monitor the degree to which basic needs cash recipients rely on negative coping strategies. This study finds that these remain common, with non-Syrian refugees in particular scoring poorly on the weighted reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). Data shows a trend of declining levels of food security for non-Syrian refugee PDM respondents since 2018, while for Syrian refugee respondents, levels of food security appear to have increased slightly since mid-2020. Emergency level coping strategies like begging and exploitative labour were reported by fewer than 2% of all respondents, but coping is at crisis-level (as shown by the need to reduce non-food expenditure) for almost half of all respondents. Coping mechanisms differ between Syrian and non-Syrian refugees. The former were found more likely to borrow money, while the latter appear more likely to be forced to move to lower-quality shelters. Syrian and non-Syrian cash recipients displaced similar frequencies for all emergency-level coping strategies.

3. Debt as a coping mechanism and opportunities for financial inclusion

Another coping mechanism for many refugee households in Jordan is debt. The proportion of cash recipients interviewed for this study who hold debt decreased slightly since mid-2020, which might point to difficulties in accessing credit. Syrian refugee households appeared more likely to resort to borrowing than their non-Syrian peers. Given the importance of debt as a coping mechanism for UNHCR’s population of concern, it is recommended that UNHCR continue to work towards the financial inclusion of, and access to credit for, its population of concern. The rising use of mobile wallets for cash distribution is an important first step here, but there is a need to raise awareness on the benefits of the use of digital cash (rather than simply withdrawing), as well as continuing efforts to promote digital cash among FSPs and supporting the government in strengthening the digital finance ecosystem.

4. Cash assistance contributes to urban refugees’ living conditions

The contributions of UNHCR’s basic needs cash assistance to the living conditions of urban refugees are clear. Although the cash does not appear to be a solution to all problems, reportedly failing to have an impact on access to livelihoods opportunities and health in particular, it is found by almost all respondents to improve their quality of life and reduce feelings of stress. Nonetheless, nine respondents out of ten continued to be concerned about the future of their household. Negative unintended consequences are not apparent in the data: The overwhelming majority of respondents note that their relations with the host community was good, and indeed for some was better thanks to the assistance. Close to one in five of the interviewed refugees agreed that their relationship with the local population had changed since they started receiving cash assistance, but only 6% note that the impact had been negative. This suggests that there are indirect benefits of the cash assistance to the Jordanian host population.

5. Service delivery has remained efficient despite challenging circumstances

Service delivery remained efficient in 2020, although accessing the locations of withdrawal was sometimes difficult for the population of concern, especially outside of Amman. Most respondents received the assistance on the day they were expecting it, but exceptions were more common in 2020 than one year prior: 17% of interviewees did not receive the cash on the day they were expecting it, compared to 6% in 2019. Beneficiaries facing difficulties using the ATM decreased slightly from 2019. Like in past years, the most common difficulty remained multiple attempts to scan the eye on the iris scanner. Over half respondents reported that it took them from four to seven attempts for iris scanning authentication to withdraw assistance. Two-thirds of the respondents did not need help to withdraw the cash. Travel time to withdrawal points increased significantly since last year, likely a result of COVID-19 related movement restrictions. UNHCR’s helpline remains universally well-known, albeit slightly harder to reach than in previous years (likely due to increased demand for COVID-19 emergency assistance).

6. Awareness raising is needed on the benefits of iris authentication

While biometric authentication remains the safest mechanism against fraud, this is not necessarily appreciated by a beneficiary population eager to have the flexibility of appointing an alternative cash collector as needed. Further communication on the benefits of iris authentication and on the options available for those who are not able to withdraw the cash in a given month would fill an awareness gap among the iris-scanning cash recipients. When asked concretely about safety aspects of a given withdrawal type, some 40% of respondents agreed that iris scans were the best options. Over half maintained that using an ATM card would be safer.

7. UNHCR remains at the forefront of innovation in cash delivery in Jordan, with an extensive learning agenda

In 2021, it is recommended that the operation proceed with a review of the logframe and monitoring framework of the urban basic needs cash operation. It is also recommended to add a panel study component to the PDM exercise (tracking the same cash recipients over time). In a context where self-reliance in exile and improved livelihoods prospects are of relevance for a significant share of those in seeking asylum in Jordan, the cash programme would benefit from data-driven insights pertaining to the pathways via which cash recipients’ lives evolve in Jordan over time and may eventually allow them to thrive without the cash assistance.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1566427-UNHCR_Jordan_PDM_annual_2020%20final.png?itok=h95nab20,"['recipients', 'population', 'coping', 'jordan', 'respondents', 'report', 'distribution', 'refugee', 'purpose', '2020', 'refugees', 'assistance', 'monitoring', 'multi', 'cash', 'syrian', 'post']", 
7,7,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,"Nile dam 'existential issue' for Egyptians, envoy says - Arab News",https://www.arabnews.com/node/1854161/middle-east,"CAIRO: Motaz Zahran, Egypt’s ambassador to the US, has sought Washington’s support for the mediation process under the leadership of the African Union president, in order to reach a binding agreement on the rules for filling and operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) as soon as possible.

He said it will protect security and stability in the region and safeguard the US strategic interests with the three countries involved: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia.

Ethiopia started building the dam, which is 1.8 kilometers in length, in 2011. However, Egypt fears the GERD will threaten its supplies of water from the River Nile. Sudan, meanwhile, is concerned about the dam’s safety and water flows through its own dams and water stations.

During a seminar at the American National War College, Zahran said Egypt will not be complacent about its water security, warning that unilateral management of the process of filling and operating the dam could result in the exacerbation of water poverty in Egypt.

He said it could magnify the negative effects of climate change in a manner that cannot be contained, causing massive environmental, social and economic damage.

Zahran also said the issue of Nile water in both Egypt and Sudan is too dangerous to be left to Ethiopia, due to its significant consequences for the people of the region.

Both Cairo and Khartoum stress the need to reach a binding and comprehensive deal that guarantees the rights and interests of the three countries.

Zahran said it was the successive Ethiopian administrations that deliberately pursued policies based on fueling Ethiopian public opinion regarding issues of Nile water and its internal trade. This came in an attempt to contain the internal tensions in Ethiopia, instead of seeking to reach a compromise that secures the common interest of the people of the region.

The ambassador said there was a solution on the negotiating table in Washington last year that would allow generating electricity as efficiently as possible from the dam, as well as guaranteeing Ethiopia’s right to establish future projects under the umbrella of international law. But the Ethiopian side was absent from the meeting to sign the agreement, given its preference for unilateral action without being bound by international law, and without any prior coordination or consultation regarding dam projects.

“This is the systematic policy pursued by Ethiopia with its various neighbors, which has caused Lake Turkana in Kenya to be on the verge of extinction, as declared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,” he said. “It also inflicts severe damage on the inhabitants of the Juba and Shabelle rivers in Somalia.”

Zahran stressed that Egypt cannot allow the repetition of such unilateral Ethiopian practices in the Nile Basin as well, and that this is an existential and fateful issue for the Egyptian people.

Negotiations between Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over the GERD have so far failed to reach a binding agreement.

Talks were held in early April in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa, with representatives from Cairo and Khartoum voicing their fears over the potential negative effects of the dam on the Nile and its dependents downstream.","Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2021/05/05/2605866-951912262.png,"['gerd', 'water', 'issue', 'egypt', 'envoy', 'ethiopian', 'existential', 'reach', 'sudan', 'unilateral', 'dam', 'ethiopia', 'nile', 'egyptians']",

KEY MESSAGES

From March to mid-April, the seasonal rains across the Horn were largely well below average, around 40-60 percent of average, across most of the region. However, a few areas over the western sector recorded average to above average rainfall.

Rangeland resources have declined driven by the cumulative adverse impacts of the poor 2020 short-rains, hotter-than-normal conditions since January, and cumulatively below-average rainfall, particularly over the predominantly pastoral and marginal mixed agricultural areas of the eastern Horn.

Due to the significantly delayed onset (20-30 days) of the seasonal rains in belg/gu/long-rains dependent areas, most planted crops are in the emergence to early vegetative crop stages. However, in some belg dependent areas, planting has not taken place. There are increasing concerns of crop water stress and limited crop growth and development due to the anticipated subsiding of the seasonal rains in May.","Sat, 01 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565239-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_April_2021-Final.png?itok=ibVgR9nI,"['areas', 'belg', 'water', 'africa', 'rains', 'east', 'monitor', '2021', 'crop', 'poor', 'dependent', '30', 'western', 'average', 'seasonal', 'somalia']",

1. We, the Foreign and Development Ministers of the Group of Seven (G7), and the High Representative of the European Union, are meeting today at a critical juncture for our people, our planet, our security and our future prosperity. Democracy is under pressure globally; the pandemic continues to pose acute global challenges; new technological threats are mounting; and the catastrophic effects of climate change are increasing. We commit to strengthening open societies, shared values, and the rules-based international order. We affirm that free and fair trade, and the free and secure flow of capital, data, knowledge, ideas and talent is essential to our long-term prosperity. We affirm that liberal democracy and free and fair markets remain the best models for inclusive, sustainable social and economic advancement. We commit to tackling threats jointly and committing our resources to achieve shared security. We will promote respect for, and protect, human rights for all individuals, regardless of where they live and whatever their identity, faith, gender, disability or race. We commit to working with the international community to further advance gender equality; and reaffirm the importance of focusing on educating girls, empowering women, and ending violence against women and girls.

2. We affirm the need to take collective action on the most pressing foreign and security challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored that global challenges require global collaboration. We reaffirm that investments in health systems will strengthen economic growth and our ability to respond to future pandemic threats. We reaffirm our commitment to working with developing partner countries, especially in Africa, to achieve a green, inclusive and sustainable recovery from COVID-19, aligned with the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, including urgent equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. We commit to supporting developing partner countries to tackle and prevent the interlinked threats of conflict, climate change, poverty, food insecurity, and the health, humanitarian, human rights and economic effects of COVID-19; and building back better so that we are more prepared for future pandemics. We are deeply concerned that the pandemic has further set back progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We commit to making increased efforts towards achieving the SDGs by 2030, and commit to ensuring that no-one is left behind.

3. We commit to renewing global cooperation, including strengthened G7-Africa partnerships and greater engagement in the Indo-Pacific. We welcome Australia, India, the Republic of Korea and South Africa to the Foreign and Development Ministers’ meeting as guest countries to take forward shared priorities ahead of these countries’ participation in the G7 Leaders’ Summit in June. We welcome the involvement of the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers’ Meeting in our discussions.

II. Foreign and security policy

Russia

4. We are deeply concerned that the negative pattern of Russia’s irresponsible and destabilising behaviour continues. This includes the large build-up of Russian military forces on Ukraine’s borders and in illegally-annexed Crimea, its malign activities aimed at undermining other countries’ democratic systems, its malicious cyber activity, and use of disinformation. We express full solidarity with all partners affected by actions connected to Russian intelligence services against their interests and security, which will continue to be met with the staunchest resolve. We note with regret the deterioration in Russia’s relations with Western countries, and stress the importance of respecting the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations as the essential foundation of diplomatic relations between states.

5. We recall our joint statement of 26 January on the arrest, sentencing and detention on politically-motivated charges of Alexey Navalny, as well as our condemnation of his poisoning on Russian territory with a military-grade chemical nerve-agent of the “Novichok” group. Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and contravenes international norms against the use of such weapons. In light of Russia’s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, we urge Russia to investigate and credibly explain the use of a chemical weapon on its soil without further delay. There must be accountability for those that use chemical weapons.

6. We remain deeply concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia, and the systematic crackdown on opposition voices, human rights defenders, independent civil society, and media.

7. We reiterate our interest in stable and predictable relations with Russia. We nevertheless will continue to bolster our collective capabilities and those of our partners to address and deter Russian behaviour that is threatening the rules-based international order, including in the areas of cyberspace security and disinformation. We will continue to engage with Russia in addressing regional crises and global challenges of common interest such as climate change; arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation; and peaceful, sustainable economic development and environmental protection in the Arctic.

Ukraine

8. We recall our statement of 12 April and call on Russia to de-escalate the situation on Ukraine’s borders and in the illegally-annexed Crimea. We reaffirm our support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders including its territorial waters. We call on Russia to uphold the OSCE principles and commitments it has signed up to on transparency about its military forces and activities, including by addressing the specific concerns and questions raised under Chapter III of the Vienna Document. In this regard, we regret that Russia failed to provide a substantive response and its failure to meet with Ukraine is wholly inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the Vienna Document. It is critical that Moscow now fully withdraws its forces and takes the necessary steps to help alleviate tensions. We express our deep concern over Russia’s actions to block access to parts of the Black Sea, including near illegally-annexed Crimea and the Kerch Strait, impeding access to Ukraine’s ports in the Sea of Azov. We commend Ukraine’s posture of restraint and diplomatic approach in this context. We underline our continued support for France’s and Germany’s efforts through the Normandy Process to secure full implementation of the Minsk agreements, as a diplomatic path for a political solution to the conflict and to lasting peace. We welcome the OSCE’s role within the Trilateral Contact Group and in this regard call on Russia and the armed formations it backs to recommit to the ceasefire. We remain fully committed to implementing sanctions, recalling that the duration of international sanctions is linked inter-alia to Russia’s complete implementation of its commitments under the Minsk agreements and to the return of Crimea to Ukraine. We unequivocally denounce Russia’s temporary occupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. We welcome in principle Ukraine’s initiative to establish an International Crimean Platform. We condemn violations and abuses of human rights on the peninsula, particularly of Crimean Tatars. We support efforts to strengthen Ukraine’s democracy and institutions, and encourage Ukraine to make further progress on the reform agenda, namely on the rule of law, judicial reform, corporate governance, and in combatting corruption to strengthen their democracy, promote economic growth, and fulfil commitments to international donors and partners and to the citizens of Ukraine. We reiterate our full confidence in the G7 Ambassadors’ Group in Ukraine and acknowledge the role of this group in monitoring and supporting the implementation of reforms.

Belarus

9. We are deeply concerned about the political and human rights crisis following the fraudulent August 2020 presidential election in Belarus. We call on the regime to implement the recommendations resulting from the OSCE’s independent expert mission, release all those who have been unjustly incarcerated for expressing their democratic aspirations, and end the ongoing repression of human rights and fundamental freedoms. We denounce the continuing repression of journalists and human rights defenders, and call on the regime to respect the right to peaceful assembly. We further call on the regime to enter into meaningful dialogue with all sectors of society, including genuine leaders of the opposition and civil society, and to accept the OSCE Chair’s offer of mediating such a dialogue as the means to resolve the political crisis. We call on the regime to hold new, free and fair elections conducted under international observation. We are committed to supporting the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people and to holding those responsible for human rights violations to account.

Western Balkans

10. We reaffirm our shared commitment to the security, economic recovery and European perspective of the six Western Balkans countries as a crucial investment for peace and stability. We emphasise the importance of advancing the necessary internal reforms, in particular on rule of law, including tackling organised crime, illicit finance and corruption, with tough action taken against the most egregious cases. We therefore support the formal opening of EU accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. We support further progress on regional cooperation especially through the Common Regional Market, Green Agenda for the Western Balkans and Berlin Process. We urge Kosovo and Serbia to engage constructively in negotiations in the framework of the EU-facilitated dialogue and to normalise fully their relations through a comprehensive and legally-binding agreement which contributes to regional stability. We support the implementation of the reform agenda related to the EU accession negotiations with Montenegro and Serbia. We call on the countries in the region to expand domestic political space and improve the environment for civil society and independent media. Unwarranted speculation about border changes along ethnic lines is no solution to the challenges faced by the region. Such changes would constitute a threat to regional security. We firmly reject any attempt to undermine the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We urge all parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to agree, and to implement, electoral and limited constitutional reforms, to implement European Court of Human Rights judgments, and to work closely with the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Venice Commission to move the country closer to realising its democratic aspirations. We welcome the candidacy of Christian Schmidt as High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The Indo-Pacific

11. We welcome our discussions with Foreign Ministers from G7 guests from the Indo-Pacific region and ASEAN. We reaffirm our support for the centrality of ASEAN and the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and commit to explore concrete cooperation in line with the Outlook. We acknowledge that strengthened cooperation between the G7 members, ASEAN and other regional stakeholders is vital as we build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic and pursue a sustainable recovery to address the pressing demands of climate change.

12. We reiterate the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific which is inclusive and based on the rule of law, democratic values, territorial integrity, transparency, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the peaceful resolution of disputes, and underscore our intention to work together with ASEAN and other countries on these endeavours through a wide range of activities. As a priority, we underscore the importance of improving regional connectivity through quality infrastructure development and projects consistent with the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, and the highest standards of transparency, green and digital transition. We recognise the need to incentivise private capital.

China

13. We encourage China, as a major power and economy with advanced technological capability, to participate constructively in the rules-based international system. It is in all of our interests, including China’s, to take action that addresses global challenges including climate change and biodiversity loss, to promote economic recovery from COVID-19 and to support the fight against the current pandemic and prevent future ones. We look for opportunities to work with China to promote regional and global peace, security and prosperity.

14. In line with its obligations under international and national law, we call on China to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. We continue to be deeply concerned about human rights violations and abuses in Xinjiang and in Tibet, especially the targeting of Uyghurs, members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, and the existence of a large-scale network of “political re-education” camps, and reports of forced labour systems and forced sterilisation. We agree the importance of tackling instances of forced labour through our own available domestic means, including through raising awareness and providing advice and support for our business communities. We strongly support independent and unfettered access to Xinjiang to investigate the situation on the ground. We continue to call therefore for such access for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

15. We recall our statement of 12 March and remain gravely concerned by China’s decision fundamentally to erode democratic elements of the electoral system in Hong Kong. We call on China to act in accordance with its international commitments and its legal obligations, including those enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, and to respect Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms. We call on China and the Hong Kong authorities to end the targeting of those who defend rights and freedoms and democratic values, to uphold the independence of the judicial system and to ensure cases are not transferred to the mainland.

16. As nations that support open societies and free and fair trade conducted within a system of transparent and predictable international rules and standards, we are united in our concern regarding practices that undermine such free and fair economic systems, including on trade, investment and development finance. We will work collectively to foster global economic resilience in the face of arbitrary, coercive economic policies and practices. We urge China to assume and fulfil obligations and responsibilities commensurate with its global economic role.

17. We encourage China to uphold its commitments to act responsibly in cyber space, including refraining from conducting or supporting cyber-enabled intellectual property theft.

18. To strengthen global cooperation on issues of concern to all we believe it is vital to ensure inclusive processes in international organisations. We support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in World Health Organisation forums and the World Health Assembly. The international community should be able to benefit from the experience of all partners, including Taiwan’s successful contribution to the tackling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

DPRK

19. We remain gravely concerned about the documented accounts of human rights violations and abuses in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), including in the regime’s extensive network of political prison camps. We urge the DPRK to respect human rights for all and to cooperate with all relevant UN bodies; to allow access by the UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights Situation in DPRK; and to resolve the abductions issue immediately. Following the closure of the DPRK’s borders, and in light of the lack of information about conditions in the country, we are deeply concerned about the welfare of vulnerable communities, in particular their access to adequate nutrition, clean water, and medical facilities. Humanitarian assistance should be delivered in a manner consistent with UNSC resolutions and humanitarian principles. We urge the DPRK to facilitate access for international humanitarian organisations and for independent assessment of humanitarian needs as soon as possible. We remain deeply preoccupied by the precarious humanitarian situation in the country, which is the result of the DPRK regime’s choice to prioritise its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programmes over the welfare of its own people.

20. We call on the DPRK to refrain from provocative actions and to engage in a diplomatic process with the explicit goal of denuclearisation. We remain committed to the goal of complete, verifiable and irreversible abandonment of all of the DPRK’s unlawful Weapons of Mass Destruction and ballistic missile programmes in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). We welcome the readiness of the United States to continue its efforts in that regard and we remain committed to providing support. We regret that the DPRK has not taken concrete, verified actions towards denuclearisation, and urge the DPRK to comply with all of its international obligations. It is critical that sanctions which target the DPRK’s unlawful weapons development remain in place while its programmes exist. The G7 is committed to working together to ensure the full implementation of all related UNSC sanctions which call upon the DPRK to abandon its WMD and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. We further commit to countering the DPRK’s sanctions-evasion tactics, particularly its illicit maritime activities including ship-to-ship transfers and the continued use of overseas workers. We call on the DPRK to return at an early date to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and to join the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). We are concerned by reports of expanded malicious cyber activities, including financial crime and the targeting of sensitive industries, and call for greater international co-ordination to counter DPRK cyber activity which funds its illicit programmes. We call on all states to fully implement relevant UNSCRs. We note with urgent concern that some countries still fail to implement these resolutions, as documented in the latest report of the Panel of Experts established pursuant to UNSCR 1874. We intend to continue our co-ordination on capacity building, counter-proliferation and proliferation financing. We support the peaceful resolution of tensions on the Korean Peninsula and call on the DPRK to resume inter-Korean dialogue.

Myanmar

21. We condemn in the strongest terms the military coup in Myanmar. We call upon the military immediately to end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government and to release all those arbitrarily detained, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, human rights defenders, journalists, civil society members, academics, teachers, medical staff, religious leaders and foreign nationals. We condemn the violence committed by Myanmar’s security forces and their violent repression of peaceful protesters. The military and the police must immediately cease the violence, exercise utmost restraint and respect international law, including international human rights law. Those responsible for violations and abuses of human rights and international human rights law must be held accountable.

22. We call on the military to restore Myanmar to the path to democracy. We reiterate our solidarity with all those advocating for and working towards an inclusive democracy. This includes efforts by the Committee Representing the Union Parliament (CRPH) and other pro-democracy leaders, along with the National Unity Government (NUG), the civil disobedience movement and others. We welcome the 24 April ASEAN Leaders’ Meeting in Jakarta and the leadership of the ASEAN Chair to bring parties together towards resolution of the crisis in Myanmar. We welcome the consensus on the need for immediate cessation of violence; commencement of constructive dialogue among all parties concerned; the appointment of a special envoy of the ASEAN Chair to facilitate mediation of the dialogue process, who must be able to engage all parties in Myanmar; ASEAN humanitarian assistance; and a visit to Myanmar by the Special Envoy. We are committed to constructively supporting ASEAN’s efforts including the work of the ASEAN Special Envoy, and we urge implementation as soon as possible. We reiterate our support for the ongoing dialogue efforts undertaken by the Myanmar Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General and her efforts with all parties.

23. We are deeply concerned at the worsening human rights and humanitarian situation in Myanmar since the coup. We stress the importance of all people in need, including Rohingya and other minority groups, having rapid, safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance and reiterate our demand that the military grant immediate and unrestricted access to the UN to meet the critical needs of vulnerable populations. We call on the military junta to respect the safety of medical facilities and staff. We stress the need for the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of refugees from Bangladesh and elsewhere in the region, and those internally displaced within Myanmar, when conditions allow. We continue to advocate for the rights and protection of persons belonging to minority groups.

24. We reiterate our readiness to take further steps if the military does not reverse its course. In that regard we commit to continuing to prevent the supply, sale or transfer of all weapons, munitions, and other military-related equipment to Myanmar and the supply of technical cooperation. We commit to exercise due diligence in conducting business relationships with military-affiliated conglomerates, and call on others to do likewise. We will also cooperate to prevent our development aid from supporting the military-led regime and to ensure it benefits the people of Myanmar, especially those who are most in need in accordance with humanitarian principles. We call on all states to adopt similar measures.

East and South China Seas

25. We remain seriously concerned about the situation in and around the East and South China Seas. We underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues. We reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that could escalate tensions and undermine regional stability and the international rules-based order and express serious concerns about reports of militarisation, coercion, and intimidation in the region. We emphasise the universal and unified character of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and reaffirm UNCLOS’s important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and the seas. We consider the 12 July 2016 award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal under UNCLOS as a significant milestone and a useful basis for peacefully resolving disputes in the South China Sea.

Afghanistan

26. A sustainable, inclusive political settlement is the only way to achieve a just and durable peace that benefits all Afghans. We support the continuation of the peace negotiations in Doha and efforts to convene a high-level conference on Afghanistan in Istanbul. It is important that countries in the region continue to work together to support efforts for peace. We call on all Afghan parties to renew their full engagement with the peace process. We continue to advocate for the meaningful participation and inclusion of the voices of women, young people and those from minority groups in all discussions regarding Afghanistan’s future. We also endorse mechanisms that allow the negotiating parties to include the diverse perspectives of Afghan civil society.

27. We will work to protect the rights that all Afghans, including women, young people and minority groups have fought for and come to enjoy and value. We support the desire of Afghans to live in peace and prosperity, building on the positive economic, social and political achievements of the last 20 years. G7 members commit to using international development assistance, advocacy and diplomacy to support the people of Afghanistan’s aspirations. Current and future support to the Afghan government relies on the adherence to the principles set out in the Afghanistan Partnership Framework and progress towards the outcomes in the Afghanistan National Peace and Development Framework II as decided upon at the November 2020 Geneva donors’ conference.

28. We call for an immediate end to attacks on civilians, including the targeted campaign of killings against women, journalists, and human rights activists, for which the Taliban are primarily responsible. We call for a significant reduction in violence as a pathway to a comprehensive ceasefire. We urge all parties to allow safe, unhindered humanitarian access to those in need.

Libya

29. We welcome the progress achieved in Libya since the start of the Berlin Process, including the recent endorsement of the interim Libyan Government of National Unity (GNU) and Presidency Council. We welcome the adoption of Security Council Resolutions 2570 (2021) and 2571 (2021) that reflect our shared priorities and objectives and urge the Libyan authorities and institutions to implement them in full. We call on the GNU to make the necessary preparations for inclusive, transparent and credible national Presidential and Parliamentary elections on 24 December 2021, as set out in the roadmap agreed by the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum; to improve the delivery of basic services to the Libyan people; to respect human rights, and ensure the protection of refugees and migrants; and to ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation and protection of women and youth. We emphasise the importance of unifying Libya’s institutions and protecting Libya’s national oil infrastructure, ensuring that oil revenues are transparently budgeted and distributed for the benefit of all Libyan people.

30. We recognise the risks to international peace and security from violations of Libyan sovereignty, including from the presence of foreign fighters and mercenaries. The conflict in Chad, where rebel groups launched their offensive from southern Libya, serves as an acute reminder of this. We call on all Libyan parties to ensure full implementation of the 23 October 2020 ceasefire agreement and strongly urge all countries to respect and support its full implementation. This includes full compliance with the arms embargo and the full withdrawal from Libya without delay of all foreign forces and mercenaries.

31. We welcome the request in UN Security Council Resolution 2570 for the UN Support Mission in Libya to provide support to the 5+5 Joint Military Commission and the Libyan-owned Ceasefire Monitoring Mechanism (LCMM), with the aim of implementing in full the 23 October 2020 ceasefire agreement. We commit to support the LCMM and UNSMIL’s wider efforts to support the Libyan political transition process. We underline the need to plan for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of armed groups, and all relevant non-state armed actors. We highlight the need for security sector reform and the establishment of an inclusive, accountable, civilian-led security architecture for Libya as a whole. We also call for transitional justice and reconciliation. We welcome the decision of the United Nations Human Rights Council to create a fact-finding mission to Libya. We call on the Libyan authorities to continue their cooperation with the mission and to grant it full access.

Syria

32. The crisis in Syria is now in its eleventh year with an estimated 13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. We condemn the Assad regime and its backers’ ongoing atrocities against the Syrian people and attempts to disrupt regular and sustained humanitarian access into and within Syria, and condemn the politicisation of aid access and delivery. We call for the full, unhindered humanitarian access into Syria that is vital for alleviating the impact of the crisis. We strongly support the reauthorisation of cross-border humanitarian assistance later this year so that those in need can get the assistance they require.

33. We welcome the fifth Brussels Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region as a strong expression of engagement and support for the people of Syria and support for a political solution to the Syria conflict in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2254.

34. In line with UNSCR 2254 and 1325, we urge all parties, especially the regime, to engage meaningfully with the inclusive UN-facilitated political process to resolve the conflict, notably the Constitutional Committee, to include the release of detainees and the meaningful participation of women. This includes a nationwide ceasefire and a safe and neutral environment to allow for the safe, voluntary and dignified return of refugees. It should pave the way for free and fair elections under UN supervision, ensuring the participation of all Syrians including members of the diaspora. Only when a credible political process is firmly under way would we consider assisting with the reconstruction of Syria.

35. We urge the regime to adhere to its obligations under UNSCR 2118; and strongly welcome the decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Conference of the States Parties to suspend Syria’s rights and privileges under the Chemical Weapons Convention, until it completes the steps set out in the OPCW Executive Council Decision of 9 July 2020 and refrains from further use of chemical weapons. We are firmly committed to accountability for those responsible for the use of chemical weapons and violations of international law, including international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as applicable, and pledge support for the work of appropriate international criminal justice and investigative mechanisms and transitional justice mechanisms.

Iran

36. We are committed to ensuring that Iran will never develop a nuclear weapon. We welcome the substantive discussions between JCPoA participants, and separately with the United States, to accomplish a mutual return to compliance with the JCPoA by the United States and Iran. The JCPoA remains the best way to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. It is vital that Iran preserves the space for these discussions by avoiding any further escalation. The latest Iranian actions are very serious developments and a matter of deep concern. They have no credible civilian requirement and have particularly grave implications. We strongly support the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its crucial monitoring and verification work to help ensure Iran’s compliance with the NPT-related safeguards obligations, as well as its other commitments. A restored and fully implemented JCPoA could also pave the way to further address regional and security concerns, including in support of the non-proliferation regime. We condemn Iran’s support to proxy forces and non-state armed actors, including through financing, training and the proliferation of missile technology and weapons. We call on Iran to stop all ballistic missile activities inconsistent with UNSCR 2231, refrain from destabilising actions, and play a constructive role in fostering regional stability and peace. We support efforts to ensure a thorough and credible investigation into the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 tragedy to hold Iran accountable. We are deeply concerned by the continued human rights violations and abuses in Iran, including those affecting the exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association, freedom of religion or belief, and freedom of expression. Foreign and dual nationals and human rights defenders have faced arbitrary arrest, detention and lengthy prison sentences and should be released.

Iraq

37. We remain fully committed to Iraq’s stability, sovereignty, and pluralism, which will be strengthened by free and fair elections in October 2021. We welcome continued efforts, led by the Government of Iraq and supported by the Global Coalition against Daesh, to continue the fight against Daesh and to stabilise and to restore essential public services to liberated areas. We also welcome the activities carried out, at the request of the Government of Iraq, by NATO Mission Iraq, helping to strengthen security forces and military education institutions so that Iraqi forces can prevent the return of Daesh. We support the Government’s efforts at economic reform for sustainable and inclusive development, and to pursue a foreign policy aimed at balanced relations with regional and international partners. We are concerned by the continuing volatile security situation in Iraq and the humanitarian situation of the country’s 1.2 million internally-displaced people (IDPs).

Yemen

38. The ongoing conflict in Yemen, with its repercussions on the unity of the country and its independence, continues to be a cause of serious concern. We reiterate our support for UN Special Envoy Griffiths and call on all parties in Yemen to agree to UN proposals for an immediate ceasefire, the free flow of imports through Red Sea ports, the reopening of Sana’a airport, and the resumption of inclusive political talks, with meaningful participation of Yemeni women and youth. We condemn the Houthi cross-border attacks on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and their continued Marib offensive, which threatens at least one million IDPs, must stop. We call for accountability for human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law. We emphatically stress the need for all the parties to the conflict to provide full humanitarian access and to ensure the protection of civilians. We reiterate the need for humanitarian aid and commodities, especially fuel, to flow unimpeded into and throughout the country. Noting the grave threat posed by the SAFER oil tanker, we call on the Houthis to facilitate urgently the access of the UN mission.

G7-Africa Partnership

39. We reaffirm our determination to strengthen partnerships with African countries, regional organisations and the African Union, building on the progress made under recent Presidencies. We will work with them to boost prosperity, economic inclusion, and stability for all. In that context we particularly welcome the ratification of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area Agreement, and commend the bravery of African peacekeepers across the continent. Our commitments on global health security and systems, strengthening open societies, gender equality, girls’ education, support for adaptation to climate change, and famine prevention will have tangible impact on the continent. We will look for opportunities to work closely with our African partners on shared challenges throughout our Presidency year.

Ethiopia

40. We recall our statement of 2 April 2021 about the situation in Tigray, and remain deeply concerned about the continued violence and the worsening humanitarian and human rights crises. We condemn the killing of civilians, rape and sexual exploitation, and other forms of gender-based violence, destruction and looting of religious and cultural heritage sites, and the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of Tigrayans and Eritrean refugees. We welcome the agreement between the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate human rights violations and abuses. We call on all parties to cease hostilities immediately, ensure the protection of civilians and respect human rights and international law as well as media freedom and access, and hold those responsible for human rights violations and abuses, including sexual violence, accountable. We urge parties to the conflict to provide immediate, unhindered humanitarian access, given the worsening food insecurity. The presence of foreign forces in Tigray is deeply disturbing and destabilising. We acknowledge the announcement from the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea that Eritrean forces will withdraw from Tigray but remain concerned that this has not yet commenced. The process of withdrawal must be swift, unconditional and verifiable. We call for the establishment of a clear inclusive political process in Tigray. We remain committed to the unity and territorial integrity of Ethiopia. We also call for a broader inclusive political process in Ethiopia to enable credible elections and wider national reconciliation.

Somalia

41. We are deeply concerned about the political impasse in Somalia, recent violent clashes between government and opposition-aligned forces, and the humanitarian consequences. We were dismayed by the decision to extend the mandates of Mohamed Farmajo as President and of the Somali Parliament by two years which is not a solution to the ongoing impasse on the electoral process, but instead undermines the credibility of Somalia’s leadership, threatens the progress of Somali institutions, and risks the safety and future of the Somali people. We welcome Parliament’s 1 May endorsement of a resumption of talks between the Federal Government and Federal Member State leaders aimed at finalising the electoral model based on the 17 September agreement. We underline our opposition to any further initiatives leading to an extension of prior mandates without broad support from Somali stakeholders and oppose any parallel processes or partial elections. We urge Somalia’s leaders to show restraint and refrain from any further unilateral actions that could escalate political tensions or violence. It is vital that all parties remain calm and protect Somalia’s stability and security. We welcome the decision of the African Union Peace and Security Council to appoint a Special Envoy and we stand ready to support these efforts. We urge Somalia’s leaders to uphold their responsibilities to the people of Somalia by returning to talks immediately. We ask that they engage in constructive dialogue, find practical solutions and reach consensus on remaining issues. Failure to do so will lead the international community to change its approach to Somalia.

Sudan

42. We commend the efforts of the transitional government to deliver peace, prosperity and democracy in Sudan following the revolution of 2019. This includes the implementation of key economic reforms that will help pave the way to debt relief, progress towards a comprehensive peace agreement, and the continued and meaningful inclusion of women in the transition. The G7 are supporting this progress, politically and financially, and urge continued attention and assistance from the international community to ensure the transition is a success and delivers lasting change for the people of Sudan.

Chad

43. We condemn the killing of President Idriss Déby Itno and the recent violence and loss of life in Chad. We underscore our commitment to the territorial integrity and stability of Chad. In support of the African Union, we call on the Transitional Military Council to create the conditions for an inclusive national dialogue and a peaceful, civilian-led and timely transition to democratic, free and fair elections. In this context, we note that the appointment of a civilian government including members of some opposition groups is an encouraging step. We count on the Transitional Military Council, the government and the security forces to avoid violence and respect human rights, including the freedom of peaceful demonstration, and condemn the recent repression of protests.

Sahel

44. We are concerned by continuing instability, increasing violence, and the deepening humanitarian crisis in the Sahel. We welcome enhanced efforts, led by African partners and supported by the Sahel Coalition and others, to tackle the drivers of instability in the region. In particular, we underline the importance of the Sahel Coalition’s Roadmap as a means to bring greater coherence to our efforts, support mutual accountability between international partners and governments in the region, and deliver a shift towards a more integrated approach to stabilisation with a strong focus on civilian and political dimensions, including through the Partnership for Stability and Security in the Sahel. As part of this, we welcome the commitments of the governments of the G5 Sahel to implement the “civil surge” agreed upon during the N’Djamena Summit in February 2021 and structural reforms to address the rule of law, anti-corruption and inclusive governance. We welcome the work of the Sahel Alliance to support development efforts led by the G5 Sahel governments, in particular its work to enhance mutual accountability and political dialogue, and its Integrated Territorial Approach. We underscore the need for all actors in the Sahel to respect human rights, including the right of women to participate in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes, and international humanitarian law as applicable. We call for improved humanitarian access, including better co-ordination between civilian and military actors. We call for the continued implementation of the Peace Agreement in Mali and credible and inclusive elections to achieve a timely return to a democratically-elected government that meets the needs of all Malians. We commend the efforts of MINUSMA, the G5 Sahel Joint Force, and Operation BARKHANE to deliver greater security in the Sahel.

Mozambique

45. We are deeply concerned by the escalating conflict in Cabo Delgado, and the increasing terrorist attacks by an ISIS affiliate. We urge Mozambique to hold accountable those responsible for human rights abuses and violations in Cabo Delgado. We encourage Mozambique to continue to work with the international community to resolve the humanitarian impact of the insurgency and to tackle the root causes and drivers of conflict and instability, and to prevent a further escalation of violence. In this regard, we welcome the Government of Mozambique’s work to respond to the humanitarian and security situation in the north and for the Government’s timely consideration of international support. We express our solidarity with the Government of Mozambique and its people in standing up to violent extremism.

Maritime security

46. We reiterate our commitment to promoting a cooperative system of international governance for the ocean and seas and to maintaining the rules-based maritime order based on international law. We reaffirm UNCLOS’s important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and seas. We reaffirm the need for all states to act in good faith, to build trust and ensure security on the oceans and seas, and to commit to the peaceful management and settlement of disputes in accordance with international law, including through internationally recognised legal dispute settlement mechanisms, including arbitration, without using the threat of force or coercion. We reiterate our commitment to the freedoms of the high seas, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, and to other rights and freedoms, including the rights and jurisdiction of coastal states, and other internationally lawful uses of the seas. We welcome the progress achieved by the states bordering the Gulf of Guinea in the implementation of the Yaoundé Maritime Security Architecture, in particular in combating piracy and other criminal activities at sea, and the European Union pilot case of the co-ordinated Maritime Presence in the Gulf of Guinea. We encourage the states of the region and other states and international organisations concerned to address further the root causes of piracy, including within the co-ordination framework of the G7++ Friends of the Gulf of Guinea. We welcome the Global Counterterrorism Forum’s Initiative on Maritime Security and Terrorist Travel.

Non-proliferation and disarmament

47. We underline the essential role of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The G7 priority is to have a meaningful outcome at the NPT Review Conference (RevCon) that advances the NPT’s implementation across all three of its pillars. We are committed to the ultimate goal of a world without nuclear weapons with undiminished security for all. We urge all states to counter the threat of disease being used as a weapon, including by strengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention at the RevCon. We also reaffirm the unique and valuable contributions of the G7-led Global Partnership (GP) of 31 states, which supports vulnerable countries around the world to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to prevent the proliferation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons (CBRN) and related materials.

III. Open societies

48. We believe that all people can benefit from a more open world, where democracy, respect for human rights, effective and accountable governance, and the rule of law can thrive; and where the benefits of prosperity are shared by all, through free and fair trade and global growth. We commit to work collectively to strengthen the foundations of open societies, promote human rights and inclusive connectivity. We commit to protect in a coordinated way against threats, including from disinformation and information operations, surveillance, malicious cyber activities, censorship, corruption, illicit finance and the closure of civic space. We also commit to reinforcing inclusive democratic institutions that protect the rights and freedoms of all persons: including safe and vibrant civic spaces, promoting digital inclusion, and supporting independent media. We support the important work undertaken by our Interior Minister colleagues on anti-corruption, addressing online harms and on working with the technology industry on public safety in system designs in protecting open societies online. We welcome and support the initiative of the United States to convene a Summit for Democracy. We commit to the following measures on media freedom, Internet shutdowns, cyber governance, freedom of religion or belief, the Rapid Response Mechanism, arbitrary detention. We look forward to Leader-level discussions on Open Societies with Australia, India, the Republic of Korea and South Africa at the G7 Summit in June.

Media freedom

49. We commit to championing media freedom as a vital part of upholding democracy and human rights around the world. We condemn intimidation, harassment and violence against journalists, noting that women, and those in marginalised and vulnerable situations, are disproportionately targets, both online and offline. We recognise the importance of diverse voices in shaping public debate, promoting transparency and ensuring accountability.

50. We welcome the work of the Media Freedom Coalition alongside other international initiatives and mechanisms, such as the Partnership for Information and Democracy, in striving to improve the media freedom environment globally and domestically. We welcome all efforts to defend media freedom through concerted diplomacy, advocacy and assistance. We ask our diplomatic missions to co-ordinate locally, including through the Coalition, to increase support to and engagement with journalists and independent media under threat. We each commit to lead by example, by undertaking domestic action, such as developing National Action Plans or similar measures, where appropriate, to improve the safety of journalists, access to information and sustainability of the media.

51. We recognise the importance of improving media sustainability, increasing access to independent and diverse media and supporting journalists, in the context of SDG 16.10. We commit to providing practical, technical and programmatic support to journalists and media, including through voluntary contributions to the Global Media Defence Fund where possible. We also commit to improving the effectiveness of our support to media by working together and with others to track, co-ordinate and share best practice in this area.

Internet shutdowns

52. We are concerned about actions by states to intentionally disrupt their own populations’ access to, or dissemination of, information, knowledge, and data online. Internet shutdowns and network restrictions undermine civic space, online and offline and unjustifiably limit access to information and the rights of peaceful assembly, association and freedom of expression online. We reaffirm our commitment to a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance and urge all countries, in accordance with their international legal obligations and commitments, to refrain from intentional disruptions that render Internet and mobile network services inaccessible or unusable, thereby undermining the exercise of individual rights and freedoms. We will improve our co-ordination, together with likeminded countries, civil society and the private sector, to address and respond to Internet shutdowns as they occur. We welcome the Freedom Online Coalition’s Joint Statement and Accompanying Good Practices for Government on State-Sponsored Network Disruptions.

Cyber governance

53. We commit to work together to further a common understanding of how existing international law applies to cyberspace, and to build on the work of the Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (OEWG) and the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security (GGE), as well as the acquis of the G7, including the Dinard Declaration on the Cyber Norm Initiative, the Lucca Declaration on Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace and the Ise-Shima G7 Principles and Actions on Cyber. Our commitment to Open Societies extends to societies online, including the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet as set out in General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 69/166. We will continue to promote Internet freedom at the UN and other international fora including through the Freedom Online Coalition.

54. We reaffirm a shared commitment to uphold international law, which is an essential and binding element of the framework for state action in cyberspace, and applies to state behaviour in cyberspace just as it applies to activities in any other domain. We encourage all states to share their national positions on how existing international law applies to state behaviour in cyberspace. We will enhance efforts toward the promotion of this approach at the UN and other international fora.

Freedom of religion or belief

55. As inclusive and rights-respecting nations, engaged in creating a safer, more stable, and more inclusive world, we are committed to promoting freedom of religion or belief for all. We strongly encourage all states to treat every person equally under the law regardless of their religion or belief. We commit to co-ordinated action, messaging, and targeted support, where possible, to defend freedom of religion or belief for all, which includes the right to change one’s religion or to have none, including through promoting and protecting freedom of expression and combatting all forms of hatred and discrimination. Where appropriate we commit to sharing information, data and research on this agenda through existing coalitions, stakeholder networks and multilateral organisations. Within existing fora, the G7 will enhance efforts toward the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or belief globally. This includes but is not limited to efforts at the UN, the OSCE, and through informal platforms such as the International Contact Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief. We resolve to continue working on these issues throughout the Presidency year.

Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM)

56. We reaffirm our commitment to the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) as part of our ongoing shared efforts to defend our democratic systems and Open Societies from foreign malign activity. By working together, we will deter those who target our democratic institutions and processes, seek to undermine public confidence in the integrity of our democracies, and attempt to interfere in the information space. We commit to bolster our collective capabilities by joining up with the valuable work of other organisations and forums, including NATO. We commit to improve our analytical capability to increase our shared understanding of the threats to our democracies and enhance our ability to respond in a co-ordinated way. We will work towards a shared understanding of what constitutes malign activity in the information space, including vaccine disinformation. We will continue to share best practices and develop common approaches to issues such as tackling foreign interference, safeguarding our elections, responding to disinformation and information manipulation and engaging with social media platforms.

57. We reiterate our commitment to working through a whole-of-society approach, engaging closely with civil society and other relevant stakeholders and to supporting partner countries in their own efforts to tackle these challenges. As part of this, we will ask the RRM to produce annual thematic reports on different aspects of the evolving threat landscape and possible responses.

Arbitrary detention in state-to-state relations

58. We reaffirm that arbitrary arrests and detentions are contrary to international human rights law. We recognise that persons in marginalised and vulnerable situations, as well as human rights defenders, journalists and civil society activists are more often arbitrarily detained, and that persons who are arbitrarily detained are vulnerable to other human rights violations.

59. We further reaffirm our support for the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations adopted in Ottawa on 15 February 2021. We call on states that engage in the practice to stop immediately, and to respect their international obligations and commitments. We stand in solidarity with those states whose nationals are so detained, as well as the individuals themselves.

60. We commit to work together and with likeminded partners to deter those who conduct arbitrary detention to compel to action, or to exercise leverage over a foreign government, by amplifying the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations. We further welcome the Partnership Action Plan Against Arbitrary Detention in State-to-State Relations and invite countries that have endorsed the Declaration and other likeminded partners to actively consider taking part in the voluntary areas of cooperation and engagement outlined in the Partnership Action Plan.

IV. Sustainable recovery

61. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving an inclusive and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for all. We recognise the far-reaching economic, social and political impact of the pandemic on vulnerable countries and populations, and the significant rise of hunger and malnutrition. We recognise the compound threat of COVID-19, conflict, climate change and biodiversity loss, and the need to act with urgency. The pandemic has exacerbated gaps in gender equality. Women are at the frontlines of the response in many countries, and are often excluded from economic opportunities. We are steadfast in our commitment to intensify cooperation on the health response to COVID-19, including through enabling global and equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and through ensuring that we take concrete action to build better health systems. We commit to reinforcing the central role of the WHO in global health. We commit to achieving more resilient health and education systems, and better pandemic prevention and preparedness against future threats. We are determined to focus on sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and to accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, we welcome the work of Climate, Environment, Health and Finance colleagues to support a global, green and resilient recovery.

Enabling equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs)

62. We affirm our belief that commitment to an open, transparent and multilateral approach is essential in responding to the global health impacts of COVID-19. A global health emergency on this scale requires co-ordinated action and global solidarity. We reaffirm our support for all existing pillars of Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), including its COVAX facility. We recognise that equipping the ACT-Accelerator with adequate funding is central. We support the strengthening of health systems, and affordable and equitable global access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, and we will further increase our efforts to support affordable and equitable access for people in need, taking approaches consistent with members’ commitments to incentivise innovation. We recall in this regard the Charter for Equitable Access to COVID-19 Tools. We recognise the importance of effective and well-functioning global value chains for VTD supply and will work with industry to encourage and support on a voluntary basis and on mutually agreed terms, including licensing, technology and know-how transfers, contract manufacturing , transparency, and data sharing, public-private costs and risk sharing. We recognise the need to enable a sustainable environment for local, regional and global productions, beyond COVID-19 products for long-term impact. We welcome the collective G7 commitments of over $10.7 billion USD to date in funding to these initiatives and encourage all partners to increase their support as the next critical step in controlling the pandemic and strengthening health security. In this context, we look forward to the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) Summit to be co-hosted by Gavi and Japan following the COVAX AMC One World Protected Event co-hosted by Gavi and US.

63. We commit to the G7 Foreign and Development Ministers’ Equitable Access and Collaboration Statement to help accelerate the end of the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We commit to supporting COVAX financially, including by encouraging pledges to the Facility, including at the COVAX AMC Summit in June, disbursing as soon as possible, providing in-kind contributions, and coordinating with and using COVAX, which is the key mechanism for global sharing of vaccines to supplement its own direct procurement, to enable the rapid equitable deployment of vaccines.

64. We support the work of G7 Health Ministers and continued G7 efforts to work with partners to improve pandemic preparedness and global health security, with WHO as the leading and co-ordinating authority, to strengthen health systems, develop solutions that embed a One Health approach, tackle antimicrobial resistance, and accelerate progress towards universal health coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. We welcome the establishment of the One Health High Level Experts Panel supported by WHO, FAO, OIE and UNEP. We are determined to ensure that lessons are learned and applied from the pandemic. We look forward to the forthcoming G20 Global Health Summit in Rome and to its Declaration, and to further close cooperation on strengthening the global health architecture, including longer-term considerations such as exploring the potential value of a global health treaty, to strengthen global pandemic preparedness and response. We will deploy our foreign and development policies and programmes to build a more resilient world that is better protected against health threats, including encouraging new public health guidance in consultation with national and relevant international organisations on international travel by sea or air, including cruise ships, and supporting an expert-driven, transparent, and independent process for the next phase of the WHO-convened COVID-19 origins study, and for expeditiously investigating future outbreaks of unknown origin. Together with G7 Health Ministers, we commit to work in partnership with low- and lower-middle income countries by improving coordination of G7 support for, and collaboration with, public health and health security capacities and their regional bodies in Africa, Asia and other regions, building on the G7 commitment to support implementation of and compliance with the International Health Regulations (IHR) in 76 countries, taking into account the recommendations from the IHR Review Committee. We will align with and support national and regional health priorities and leadership to improve public health. We look forward to the publication of the G7 Carbis Bay Progress Report on global health and what we can learn from its conclusions on G7 commitments to strengthening health systems to advance universal health coverage and global health security.

65. We note the continuing need to support health systems and health security and secure sustainable financing, together with partner countries’ domestic resources, to help accelerate global vaccine development and deployment, recover and then sustain access to essential health and nutrition services and health commodities, including in humanitarian settings and for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and to bolster the global health architecture for pandemic preparedness, including through stronger rapid response mechanisms. We look forward to working with G7 Finance Ministers to build consensus on practical actions to facilitate access to existing global financing sources to meet demands for access to COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as how best to tackle the ACT-A funding gaps, with the aim of shortening the lifespan of the pandemic and with particular focus on the needs of vulnerable countries. In this regard, we look forward to the outcomes of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) initiated by the WHO, and the High Level Independent Panel on financing the global commons for pandemic preparedness and response (HLIP) established by the G20.

Gender equality

66. We reaffirm the G7’s continued global leadership on gender equality and the promotion and protection of the rights of women and girls, in all their diversity. We recognise the importance of focusing on three intersecting goals as we build back better from COVID-19: educating girls, empowering women, and ending violence against women and girls. We are committed to advancing the Women, Peace and Security agenda. We commend and are committed to close alignment with the goals of the Generation Equality Forum (GEF) this year, convened by UN Women and co-chaired by Mexico and France, and its six ambitious Action Coalitions, and welcome the inclusion of Women, Peace and Security and Humanitarian Action Compact. We also look forward to the Italian G20 Presidency Ministerial Conference on Women’s Empowerment in August.

Educating girls

67. We recognise that COVID-19 has been the largest disrupter to education in modern history, affecting all children, but especially girls and those already left behind. We reaffirm that education is a fundamental human right, and a bedrock of gender equality and poverty reduction. We commit to rebuilding education systems that are better, fairer, and more resilient.

68. We note that millions of poor, teenage girls around the world have been forced out of school because of the pandemic; many of these girls are also affected by conflict, crisis, and displacement, and are already out of school as a result. With less than 10 years to achieve SDG4 by 2030, we call upon all governments and the global community to work together as never before to unlock progress to achieving 12 years of safe and quality education for all children. We commit to two new global ambitious milestone objectives to accelerate the achievement of SDG4, and call upon the international community to also adopt and rally behind them:

a. 40 million more girls in school by 2026 in low and lower middle-income countries; b. 20 million more girls reading by age 10 or the end of primary school in low and lower middle-income countries, by 2026.

69. We endorse the approach to meet these objectives as outlined in the Girls’ Education Declaration annex to the G7 Foreign and Development Communiqué. We commit to mobilise financial and technical resources, including through the Global Partnership for Education, and to work with national governments to protect domestic spending on education.

Empowering women

70. We recognise that women and girls have always shouldered the majority of unpaid care work and are more likely to be in informal, unstable employment with less access to finance. The COVID-19 pandemic has further damaged women’s economic opportunity and participation. We recognise the importance of affordable and quality care services, including childcare, and inclusive social protection for all, in order to respond to the specific risks facing women and girls.

71. We recognise that women’s rights organisations strengthen women’s and girls’ inclusion in public life and play a vital role in ensuring their issues are heard and amplified, and their needs are met. We affirm our commitment to SDG 5.5, and call for the full, equal, active and meaningful participation and leadership of women and women’s rights organisations at local, national, and international decision-making in the COVID-19 recovery. This includes meaningful participation and leadership in COVID-19 taskforces, the development, delivery and review of gender-responsive recovery action plans and initiatives, climate action and initiatives, and humanitarian response and crisis management.

72. We recognise universal access to quality and affordable comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, including comprehensive sexuality education, as life-saving and critical to achieving universal health coverage. The G7 reaffirms our full commitment to the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of all individuals. We further recognise their right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, which should be enjoyed free from discrimination, coercion, exploitation and violence. We commit to working together to prevent and address the severe impacts on SRHR from the pandemic. We commit to intensify our efforts, including by working with other countries and civil society, to accelerate progress towards the universal enjoyment of SRHR, with specific attention to the most marginalised and inadequately-served groups, including adolescents, those belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups, and LGBTQI+ individuals.

73. We recognised that we must act specifically to support women as they recover from the damaging economic impact of COVID-19. Following the success of the first 2X Challenge launched at the 2018 G7 Summit in Charlevoix, we welcome a new target by our Development Finance Institutions working with others to invest USD $15 billion to provide women in developing countries, including those who are at risk and marginalised, with improved economic opportunities over the next two years (2021-22). An expanded group of Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) will support businesses, financial institutions and fund managers to mobilise finance and support women with decent work and quality employment opportunities, access to leadership opportunities, financing, more flexible workplace practices, and affordable products and services.

Ending violence against women and girls

74. We note with concern that COVID-19 has increased all forms of gender-based violence (GBV) and that women and girls facing multiple forms of discrimination are often at greatest risk. Stronger political will, greater resources and accountability are urgently required to address this issue. Evidence, including from the UK’s What Works to Prevent Violence Programme and the Spotlight Initiative, shows that this violence is preventable. We commit to preventing, eliminating, and responding to GBV through scaling-up support and implementation of evidence-based, survivor- and victim-centred policies and programmes.

75. We reaffirm the Whistler Declaration on Gender Equality in Humanitarian Action, and as partners of the Call to Action on Protection from GBV in Emergencies, commit to work together to strengthen the response to GBV in conflict, humanitarian and other development contexts, including preventing and responding to conflict-related sexual violence.

Sexual exploitation and abuse, and sexual harassment in the aid sector

76. We acknowledge our collective responsibility as G7 members to beneficiaries, their communities, victims and survivors to do more to address sexual exploitation and abuse in the humanitarian and development sector. We recall the UNSG’s Zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment, and the 2018 London Summit and the 2019 OECD Development Assistance Committee Recommendation. We call for all others involved in the delivery of aid to adhere to the DAC Recommendation on Ending Sexual Exploitation, Abuse, and Harassment in Development Co-operation and Humanitarian Assistance.

Famine prevention, humanitarian crises and food insecurity

77. We are gravely concerned by the UN’s reports that over 34 million people are already facing emergency levels of food insecurity, are one step from catastrophe or famine, and that almost 80 million have been forcibly displaced and 237 million need humanitarian assistance. We note that Yemen, South Sudan and north-east Nigeria face immediate risk, while Tigray in Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and the Central Sahel, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria and Haiti are of particular concern. We are concerned that the humanitarian system is under immense strain and that the scale and severity of needs is growing while the UN’s response plans are increasingly underfunded. We believe that armed conflict is a primary cause of the food insecurity crisis, including as a result of obstructions to humanitarian access and a lack of compliance with International Humanitarian Law. We note that this situation is compounded by climate change and socio-economic shocks, including the impact of COVID-19.

78. We endorse the work of the G7 Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Crises Panel and the Compact which aim to prevent famine in 2021 and begin to stem the growth of humanitarian need. We commit to: provide assistance, and seek to broaden and diversify the donor base, including from the private sector and foundation resources, required to address the critical funding challenges to prevent famine; promote humanitarian access and protect civilians; scale-up anticipatory action to prevent crises deteriorating further; partner with the World Bank Group to strengthen crisis preparedness and response through countries’ own national systems; and support the co-ordinated data gathering and analysis required to get aid to those who need it most when they need it. Recognising that chronic hunger is also rising, we reaffirm our commitment to the Broad Food Security and Nutrition Development Approach agreed by the G7 in Elmau (Germany) in 2015. We reaffirm our commitment to the work of the Food Security Working Group, and stress the importance of coherent multilateral action in light of the upcoming UN Food Systems Summit and Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit later this year.

Climate change adaptation and resilience

79. We note with grave concern the impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable communities and welcome the progress made at the UK-hosted Climate and Development Ministerial on 31 March 2021. We commit to continue scaling up finance contributing to adaptation action, taking into account the priorities and needs identified by ambitious adaptation plans at local, national and sub-national levels, and adaptation communications.

80. We reaffirm our commitment to the collective developed-country goal of jointly mobilising US$100 billion annually through to 2025 and reaffirm our aim, in line with the Paris Agreement, that the provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation, taking into account country-driven strategies. We welcome the commitments already made by some of the G7 to increase finance contributing to adaptation action and look forward to new commitments from others well ahead of COP 26 in Glasgow. We commit to increase the effectiveness and accessibility of our climate finance, including nature-based solutions. This finance will strive to advance gender equality and inclusion and reflect the needs and voices of marginalised groups, indigenous peoples and women and girls. We call on the Multilateral Development Banks and other public and private finance institutions to increase finance for climate and nature and set ambitious plans for delivery. We welcome the Principles for Locally Led Adaptation and recognise the need for vulnerable communities to shape the decisions that affect them.

81. We recognise the important role businesses and investors must play to support vulnerable countries, including Small Island Developing States (SIDS), to adapt to climate change. We emphasise the need for greater public-private collaboration to achieve enhanced private finance mobilisation and domestic market creation for adaptation and resilience solutions and further efforts to incentivise increased private sector commitments. We welcome the work of the Collaborative on Accelerating Investment in Adaptation and Resilience and the additional G7 Development Finance Institutions that have joined this year. We are pleased G7 participants of the Collaborative have put forward practical plans to collectively pursue mainstreaming and substantially increasing investment into adaptation and resilience, and will develop specific detailed actions on managing climate risk before COP 26, with an initial focus on agriculture. We welcome the positive progress since the Collaborative was established at the Finance in Common Summit in 2020 and look forward to further progress by the 2021 Summit which will focus on agriculture. We call on major agri-food firms to improve the sustainability, and reduce the climate impacts, of their operations and supply chains and will work with G7 agri-food firms to take further steps to achieving this.

82. We welcome progress on disaster risk finance following the G7 Summit in Elmau in 2015. We note the ambition of vulnerable countries to mobilise risk finance to better assess and manage climate risk. We encourage partner governments to commit to strengthening and expanding coverage of national social protection programs as part of managing their ex-ante and ex-post risk. We recall our previous commitments to support preparedness and early action in developing countries and welcome the significant and important protection that these investments have provided to poor and vulnerable people. We recognise opportunities for the global risk finance architecture to develop, including in the depth and breadth of the risk pools, as well as in terms of mechanisms for the targeted sustainable provision of premium subsidies where appropriate. We welcome the intention of individual G7 members to make further ambitious financial commitments by the time of the June Summit. We will aim to improve the impact of this funding by establishing best practice principles by COP 26 in co-ordination with the InsuResilience Global Partnership. We support early action, climate and disaster risk finance and insurance on climate-linked disasters initiatives such as the InsuResilience Global Partnership and Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership (REAP). We support the G7 ambition of covering 500 million poor and vulnerable people by 2025 through such solutions, in line with the InsuResilience Global Partnership’s Vision 2025 and contributing to REAP’s target to make 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025.

83. We welcome the important work of the members of Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. We recognise the need to strengthen international risk forecasting, prioritisation and advice to vulnerable countries on contingent finance. We call on the existing disaster risk finance initiatives and key international institutions to increase collaboration and to improve synergies. We recall the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ commitment to strengthen the global risk monitoring, including by further integrating natural disasters, climate, environmental and other high-impact tail risks more systematically into the global risk monitoring and preparedness. We welcome the intention of individual G7 members to work with vulnerable countries, including SIDS and Least Developed Countries, and partners to explore options to strengthen disaster risk forecasting and to publish the findings of this work before COP 26.

84. Finally, we call on all states and encourage non-state actors to cooperate to enhance adaptation, including through the Adaptation Action Coalition and the Race to Resilience campaign and showcasing the activities undertaken within the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action. We affirm our commitment to building resilience to the water-related impacts of climate change and to mobilising the global agriculture research system to help the world recover from COVID-19 and addressing the climate change impacts on and of food systems. We commit to leveraging the power of national and multilateral research institutions, such as the One CGIAR (formerly Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research), and the public and private sectors. This is critical to generate knowledge, strengthen innovation systems, and ensure partnerships accelerate the pace and scale of innovation required to make food systems resilient and stable, and transform food systems to adapt to a changing climate while delivering nutritious, affordable food to growing populations in an inclusive way as well as protecting water and land resources.

Development finance

85. In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, we will take concrete action to address priority development finance challenges, and take note of the policy options developed through the Financing for Development in the Era of COVID-19 and Beyond Initiative, co-convened by Canada, Jamaica and the UN Secretary General. We welcome the partnership with our Finance and Health Ministers, as well as international and philanthropic organisations, to help mobilise urgent financial support for vulnerable countries as well as sustainable financing for vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics and pandemic preparedness. We welcome the International Monetary and Financial Committee’s call for the IMF to make a comprehensive proposal on a new Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) general allocation and to explore ways for voluntary post-allocation channelling of SDRs to support the recovery efforts of vulnerable countries. We also welcome the G20’s commitment to support a further and final extension of the G20/Paris Club Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) by 6 months, through end-December 2021. We welcome the current work to implement the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, to address debt vulnerabilities on a case-by-case basis. This will help ensure that debt treatment is co-ordinated between Paris Club and emerging G20 creditors for the first time, and that other official bilateral and private creditors participate in line with the comparability of treatment principle.

86. In the context of the IMF projecting a financing gap for Africa of around $425 billion 2021-2025, we welcome the work of Finance Minister colleagues and the International Financial Institutions to mobilise additional urgent financial support for Africa. We urge our G7 Development Finance Institutions towards greater collaboration in order to unlock private investment opportunities and support a sustainable recovery in Africa. We also recognise the far-reaching impact of the pandemic on Africa, the need to enable equitable access to vaccines, and to support African plans for VTD production, while supporting the development of resilient health systems. We will encourage African governments to set the optimal conditions to increase trade, attract investment and create sustainable and decent jobs.

V. Conclusion

87. We recognise we are meeting in an exceptional and fast-changing context. We commit to working together, with partner countries and within the multilateral system, to shape a cleaner, freer, fairer and more secure future for the planet. We resolve to keep working on tangible issues and outcomes together and in partnership with many others. We eagerly anticipate the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Carbis Bay in June. We look forward to making further progress on these issues at the second G7 Foreign and Development Ministers’ meeting later in the year, which will welcome the participation of African Foreign Ministers.","Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L800xH400/visuel_defaut_une_fd-44916.jpg?1614684393,"['including', 'international', 'g7', 'support', 'meeting', 'rights', 'welcome', 'development', 'health', 'foreign', 'commit', 'ministers', 'global', 'communiqué', 'humanitarian', 'london', 'human', '2021']",

But there was so much more to life than shutdowns, PPE, and vials of vaccines.

The World Press Photo Foundation recognized this with its 2021 contest and yearbook by Lannoo Publishers. Winners and finalists spanned 28 countries, and though quite a few did document the tremors of the pandemic, many continued the drumbeat of coverage around pressing issues like climate change, life with disabilities, and disaster relief. The PopSci picks below bridge human crises and creativity with wildlife interactions and conflicts.

“This was the first hug Rosa had received in five months. In March, care homes across the country had closed their doors to all visitors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, preventing millions of Brazilians from visiting their elderly relatives. Carers were ordered to keep physical contact with the vulnerable to an absolute minimum. At Viva Bem, a simple invention, ‘The Hug Curtain’, allowed people to hug each other once again. The new coronavirus had first appeared in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, and by January 2020 had begun to spread around the world. On 11 March, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The disease—transmitted mainly via close contact, respiratory droplets, and aerosols—could be fatal, and people over the age of 70 were one of the groups considered most vulnerable to the disease. Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed claims about the severity of the pandemic and the danger posed by the virus, undermined quarantine measures adopted at state level, and encouraged Brazilians to continue working to keep the economy afloat. Brazil ended 2020 with one of the worst records globally in dealing with the virus, with some 7.7 million reported cases and 195,000 deaths.”

Locust swarms devastated large areas of land, just as the coronavirus outbreak had begun to disrupt livelihoods. Photo: Luis Tato/The Washington Post

“In early 2020, Kenya experienced its worst infestation of desert locusts in 70 years. Swarms of locusts from the Arabian Peninsula had migrated into Ethiopia and Somalia in the summer of 2019. Continued successful breeding, together with heavy autumn rains and a rare late-season cyclone in December 2019, triggered another reproductive spasm. The locusts multiplied and invaded new areas in search of food, arriving in Kenya and spreading through other countries in eastern Africa. Desert locusts, Schistocerca gregaria, are potentially the most destructive of the locust pests, as swarms can fly rapidly across great distances, traveling up to 150 kilometers a day. A single swarm can contain between 40 and 80 million locusts per square kilometer. Each locust can eat its weight in plants each day: a swarm the size of Paris could eat the same amount of food in one day as half the population of France. Locusts produce two to five generations a year, depending on environmental conditions. In dry spells, they crowd together on remaining patches of land. Prolonged wet weather—producing moist soil for egg-laying, and abundant food— encourages breeding and producing large swarms that travel in search of food, devastating farmland. Even before this outbreak, nearly 20 million people faced high levels of food insecurity across the East African region, challenged by periodic droughts and floods. COVID-19 restrictions in the region slowed efforts to fight the infestation as supply chains of pesticides were disrupted.”

“Animal-assisted therapy, also known as pet therapy, is used in many clinical environments, especially in psychological therapy and palliative care. Animals appear to be able to reduce anxiety and stress, and also to have physical effects, such as lowering blood pressure, improving heart rate, or helping in pain management. In hospices, the aim is to use the natural bond between humans and animals to provide comfort, peace, and companionship to terminally ill patients. Horses seem particularly suited for palliative care as they are especially in tune with their surroundings. Peyo works with his trainer Hassen Bouchakou at Les Sabots du Coeur, an organization devoted to animal-assisted therapy, and to scientific research into the subject. He supports around 20 patients each month, and scientists are now studying his instinctive ability to detect cancers and tumors.”

Nominee. A curious California sea lion swims towards a face mask at the Breakwater dive site in Monterey, California. Photo: Ralph Pace Ralph Pace

“California sea lions are playful animals, native to western North America. With COVID-19 lockdowns in place across California, outdoor and natural beauty spots with plenty of wildlife became a popular focus for local travel. In many countries the wearing of face masks outdoors was obligatory. Similar destinations around the world became littered with abandoned masks. The BBC reported an estimated 129 billion disposable face masks and 65 billion throwaway gloves being used each month through the pandemic. Such personal protective equipment (PPE) can be mistaken for food by birds, fish, marine mammals, and other animals. PPE also contains plastic, and so contributes to the eight million tons of plastic that end up in the oceans every year. According to World Animal Protection, every year an estimated 136,000 seals, sea lions, and whales die from plastic entanglement. Surgical masks break down into millions of microplastic particles over time, which are eaten by fish and other animals, and therefore carry contamination back up the food chain, potentially also affecting humans.”

Nominee. Farida Batool, a student at the middle school in the village of Karith, high in the mountains on the Pakistani border, has helped build several ice stupas, together with her fellow students. Photo: Ciril Jazbec/National Geographic

“As Himalayan snows dwindle and glaciers recede, communities in the Ladakh region of northern India are building huge ice cones that provide water into summer. Ladakh is a cold desert, with winter temperatures reaching -30°C, and an average rainfall of around 100 millimeters. Most villages face acute water shortages, particularly during the crucial planting season in April and May. In 2013, Sonam Wangchuk, a Ladakhi engineer and innovator, came up with a form of glacier-grafting that creates artificial glaciers in the form of conical ice heaps, resembling Buddhist religious stupas. The ice stupas store winter meltwater and slowly release it for the growing season in spring, when it is most needed for crops. The stupas are created in winter, when water is carried down from higher ground in underground pipes. The final section rises vertically, and the difference in height causes water to fountain outwards, in subzero temperatures, freezing to form a stupa. Stupas were established in 26 villages in 2020, and a pipeline is under construction to create 50 more. Stupa creator Wangchuk says that the stupas stand for a final attempt of Himalayan mountain communities to fight the climate crisis, but should not be considered as a solution to the challenge: that remains the responsibility of national governments, and people adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles to reduce emissions.”

Nominee. Basia paints a new doll, in Olesnica, Poland. It takes a great deal of patience and attention to detail to paint the vinyl so that it looks like human skin. Photo: Karolina Jonderko

“‘Reborn’ babies first appeared in the 1990s. Each is unique, carefully crafted by artists known as ‘reborners’. The hyper-realistic reborn babies are created with such details as birthmarks, veins, implanted hair, pores, tears, and saliva. More sophisticated reborns are equipped with electronic systems capable of reproducing the heartbeat, breathing, and sucking of a real baby. Most of the dolls are made of vinyl, though the more realistic ones are made from silicone. Human hair is used for eyelashes, and completed dolls are sometimes perfumed with a ‘new baby’ smell. Reborn babies are available whole and in kit form, and can be purchased online and at fairs. The process of buying a reborn can be done in such a way as to simulate adoption: dolls come with ‘adoption’ or ‘birth’ certificates. Reborn babies have been used in pediatric training to teach students practical childcare skills, and the use of the dolls in care homes has been shown to help reduce disruptive behaviour in people with dementia. While most reborn owners are doll collectors, others have experienced miscarriage, neonatal deaths, have no means for adoption, or suffer from empty nest syndrome, and may use the doll as a substitute for a child.

The photographer wished to explore the phenomenon of how artificial babies evoke genuine emotional response in adults. Each woman portrayed in this project has a personal motivation for having a reborn baby. Some who cannot have, or who have lost, a baby, give their love to an artificial one, looking after them, changing them, and buying them clothes. For some, the dolls are a means of dealing with loss or anxiety; for others they provide companionship.”

A Rothschild’s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) is transported to safety in a custom-built barge from a flooded Longicharo Island, Lake Baringo, in western Kenya, on December 3, 2020. Photo: Amy Vitale/CNN

“Rothschild’s giraffes are a subspecies of the northern giraffe, and are classified as endangered. The giraffe is the world’s tallest land mammal and the Rothschild’s giraffe is one of the loftiest subspecies, growing up to six meters in height. Longicharo Island was once a peninsula. Rising water levels in Lake Baringo over the past ten years have cut the peninsula off to form an island. Particularly heavy rainfall in 2019 caused further floods, stranding nine giraffes. The local community worked with conservationists from the Kenya Wildlife Service, the Northern Rangelands Trust, and Save Giraffes Now, to build the barge and transport the marooned animals to a sanctuary in the Ruko conservancy on the shores of the lake. The rains had also led to an abundance of food on the island, so edible treats could not be used to entice the giraffes onto the barge. Instead, the giraffes had to be tranquilized, which is a dangerous procedure given their anatomy, as they are at risk of choking on their own saliva, and changes in blood pressure can cause brain damage. A vet was on hand to immediately counteract the drug; the animals were then hooded and led onto the barge with guide ropes.”

“The Florida panther is a subspecies of Puma concolor (also known as mountain lion, cougar, or puma) and, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, represents the only known breeding population of puma in the eastern United States. Listed as an endangered species in 1967, Florida panthers are gradually making a comeback, growing from fewer than 20 panthers in the 1970s, to more than 200 today. Florida panthers feed primarily on white-tailed deer and wild hogs, but also smaller mammals such as raccoons, armadillos, and rabbits. Ranches are vital to panthers, because few public lands are big enough to support even one adult male panther, which may require up to 500 square kilometers of territory in which to roam and hunt. Audubon’s Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary is too small to supply the full territory needs of one panther, yet serves as part of the home range for several. The panthers are caught in a race between the need for territory, and increasing land development as a result of Florida’s rapidly growing population, with some 400 square kilometers of their habitat being lost each year.”

“Nymphargus wileyi is known only from examples discovered around the Yanayacu Biological Station, and so is listed as ‘data deficient’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The species inhabits primary cloud forests. Individuals can be found on leaves at night. Females deposit eggs in a gelatinous mass on the dorsal surface of leaves hanging above streams, near the tip. A male can fertilize up to four clutches of eggs in a breeding season. The whitish embryos, between 19 and 28 per clutch, will develop for a few days until they are ready to drop into the water to continue their metamorphosis.”

“A pair of feral pigeons befriended the photographer’s family, who were isolated in their apartment in Vlaardingen, the Netherlands, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ollie and Dollie, as the family named them, were regulars in the house, their daily visits a reminder that humans are not alone on this planet, even while living isolated in urban areas. Feral pigeons are descended from the rock dove, which naturally inhabits sea cliffs and mountains. They find the ledges of buildings to be substitutes for sea cliffs, have adapted to urban life and surroundings, and now live in urban areas on every continent except Antarctica, with a global population in the hundreds of millions. Rock doves were the first birds to be domesticated, between five and six thousand years ago, in Mesopotamia. They were bred for food, and later trained to carry messages. Birds escaping or released from a domestic environment became the first feral (or city) pigeons. Although they are believed to be vectors of diseases, the evidence is to the contrary. It is rare for city pigeons to transmit a disease to humans, and while they do transmit contagions such as Salmonella and avian mites, infecting mammals is rare.”

“According to the Small Arms Survey—an independent global research project based in Geneva, Switzerland–half of all the firearms owned by private citizens in the world, for non-military purposes, are in the USA. The survey states that the number of firearms exceeds the country’s population: 393 million guns to 328 million people. Gun ownership is guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, which dates from 1791 and has long been a controversial issue in American legal, political, and social discourse. Those who argue for the repeal of the Second Amendment or introduction of stricter gun control say that the Second Amendment was intended for militias; that stronger regulation will reduce gun violence; and that a majority of Americans, including gun owners, support new restrictions. Second Amendment supporters state that it protects an individual’s right to own guns; that guns are needed for self-defense against threats ranging from local criminals to foreign invaders; and that gun ownership deters crime rather than causes more crime. According to the independent Gun Violence Archive (GVA), the US has had more mass shootings than any country on the planet, with 633 mass shootings in 2020 alone.”

“Bouldering entails climbing on small rock formations and boulders of usually no more than six meters in height, without ropes or harnesses. Historically, it began as a training activity for more ambitious climbing and mountaineering pursuits, but has evolved into a sport in its own right. Rock-climbing gyms and sports facilities in Munich were closed as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, so athletes had become creative in their training methods.”

“Saeed Ramin is a professional traceur (practitioner of parkour) living in Gachsaran, Iran. Seven years ago, Saeed fell in a parkour competition, injuring the spinal cord in his neck. The aim of parkour is to get from one point to another in complex—usually urban—environments, without assistive equipment and in the fastest and most efficient way possible: running, vaulting, swinging, climbing and all manner of other movements, sometimes in dangerous situations such as between high rooftops. The discipline was popularized in the late 1990s and 2000s through films, video games, documentaries and advertisements, and it became popular in Iran after two Iranian traceurs appeared in the documentary, Jump London. Saeed’s injury when he fell was so severe that he could only blink, and doctors said he wouldn’t even be able to sit in a wheelchair. Saeed couldn’t afford extended hospital treatment, but with the help of his family, he improvised rehabilitation equipment in his yard, and despite the doctors’ predictions, was able to regain the mobility of his hands. Saeed regained more of his abilities, and is now able to manage a wheelchair. He still likes to do things other people are afraid of.”

“A wildfire began in Oliveira de Frades, about 100 kilometers from Porto in eastern Portugal, on 7 September, and spread some 30 kilometers west, to Sever do Vouga, and 40 kilometers southwest, to Águeda, in the neighboring district. At least 300 firefighters, 100 land vehicles and ten firefighting planes battled the blaze in a landscape dominated by eucalyptus trees. The uncontrolled spread of eucalyptus trees—which supply raw material for an economically important pulp industry, but which are extremely flammable—are a major factor in the rapid spread of wildfires. Portugal has a wildfire season lasting from June to September. Its hot climate, consistent warm winds coming off the Atlantic, and a well-forested landscape make it particularly susceptible to fire. Extreme temperatures and severe drought contributed to the 2020 fire season. A 2020 report released jointly by the Portuguese Association of Nature and the World Wide Fund for Nature states that Portugal is the European country worst affected by wildfires: more than three percent of its forest burns every year.”","Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.popsci.com/app/uploads/2021/05/07/sealion-mask-ralph-pace.jpg,"['locusts', 'water', 'photos', '14', 'world', 'pandemic', 'food', 'animals', 'used', 'stupas', 'captured', '2020', 'covid19', 'hypnotizing']",

Camel is the notable varied species of animal within the arid areas of Asia and Africa, significantly within the arid lowlands of countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, and Djibouti.1,2 The camel population in the world has been estimated as about 35 million and more than 95% of these were found in developing countries.3 Ethiopia has about 2 million camels and most of them were kept in southeastern pastoral areas of the country.4 Camel production is the major livelihood of most people in the Somali, Afar, and Oromia regions. The camel is the most effective domesticated animal for changing fodder into work, transport, milk, and meat.5 Within the desert areas, camels could be important animals to the existence of individuals as the supply of food means that of transportation and most significantly its milk is used as drugs for various ailments.6

Camel husbandry is the primary source of living for millions of pastoralists in the arid and semiarid zone in Ethiopia and the country stands third in camel production in the world.3 Camels have a multi-purpose role within the drylands of Ethiopia like transporting grain, water, salt, and for production of milk and meat. Moreover, throughout drought conditions camels are the animal less likely affected and remain a consistent means that of transport; thus referred to as the ship of the desert. Like bovine, camel supports a range of resources (milk, meat and hide), they are a type of investment, and that they play a crucial role in pastoralist culture. They sustain the lifetime of pastoralists in those harsh environmental conditions as a result of they are the foremost economical animals in changing fodder into energy for work expendable products like meat and milk.7 Moreover, the camel is relatively less prone to several of the devastating disease; that affects different species like render pest, contagious pleuropneumonia, and foot and mouth disease; nevertheless, they are littered with several other diseases.8

Trypanosomosis is a serious pathogenic disease in camel caused by Trypanosoma evansi and it is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas.9 Camel trypanosomosis is the most prevalent disease in Ethiopia (22%) and serious economic loss results from morbidity (30.0%) and mortality (3.0%) of camels in the country.1 Camel trypanosomosis or Surra is one of the major problems worldwide and it can attack camels at any age, even fetuses. In Ethiopia particularly in the Borana zone, the disease is widespread reducing thus the camel production and productivity.10 Usually, trypanosomosis in camel results in anemia, weight loss, pale mucous membranes, enlarged lymph node, loss of milk and meat, and abortion.11

The principle for the management of camel trypanosomosis was dependent on reducing the contact between camel and vectors. To effectively control camel trypanosomosis, it is crucial to know the magnitude and associated risk factors of the disease in the areas. This study helps to implement appropriate control and prevention methods. However, a little study is available that determines the occurrence and associated risk factors of Trypanosoma infection in the camel of study areas. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the magnitude and associated risk factors of camel trypanosomosis in study areas.

Materials and Methods

Study Areas

The study was carried out in two districts namely, Yabelo and Gomole districts which are located at 570 and 530 km from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, respectively. Gomole district is situated at 40km North of Yabelo district. Gomole district is located at attitude 1857 meters above sea level, 4°52ʹN 38°5ʹE latitude and 4.884°N 38.082°E longitudes while Yabelo district was located at 4°53ʹN 38°5ʹE latitude and 4.883°N 38.083°E longitudes. The areas have bimodal (two seasons) rainfall patterns with a mean annual rainfall of 558mm and a mean annual temperature of 19.0°C. January and August were the driest months with very low precipitations while April has high precipitation (average of 158 millimeters). The warmest period in the year is from March to May months, while the lowest annual minimum temperatures occur in November and January. The landscape is marked by gently sloping low lands and flood plains vegetated predominantly with grass and bushland. The general vegetation type is Acacia of savanna vegetation types dominated by bush and acacia trees. The people in the area are kept livestock as a major activity, based on the traditional pastoralist system. Borana Zone has 1,416,180 cattle, 776,870 head of sheep, 126, 2782 goats, and 23, 7250 camels.4 The pastoralist also grows some crops for their use in the valley area (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Map showing study areas (Yabelo and Gomole districts).

Study Population

The study population was dromedary camels including all sex, different age groups, and body conditions in Yabelo and Gomole districts. The study comprised a recording of age, sex, and body condition of camels in the areas to determine the prevalence of camel trypanosomosis and associated risk factors using parasitological techniques. The age of camels was categorized as less than 4 years were considered as young and above 4 years were categorized as an adult.

Sampling Procedure and Sample Size Determination

A cross-sectional study design was conducted in the Yabelo and Gomole districts of the Borana zone from December 2018 to December 2019 to determine the magnitude and associated risk factors of camel trypanosomosis. Yabelo and Gomole districts were selected purposely based on the number of camel populations. A total of eight pastoral associations (PAs) were selected randomly from the two districts (four PAs from each district). Similarly, a total of sixteen villages were selected from those PAs using the lottery method. Olla (local language – Afan Oromo) is characterized by the clustering of households with proximity houses in a pastoral campy. Each village is traditionally administered by a village chief, Abba Olla, who is an important contact person in facilitating cooperation among camel owners. Sampling frames of individual camels were obtained from Abba Olla in each respective villages. A random sampling technique was employed to select camel herds from each village. A simple random sampling was conducted to select individual camels from each herd. To estimate the sample size 95% level of confidence (CL), 5% desired absolute precision, and the expected prevalence of 50% was used. The sample size was determined by using the formula given by Thrusfield.12 Therefore, a total of 384 camels were needed to demonstrate the prevalence of camel trypanosomosis.

Sample Collection and Laboratory Examination

Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein of each camel with the help of a sterile lancet after disinfecting the site with 70% alcohol. Then, a blood sample was drawn by a heparinized capillary tube. The collected blood samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes immediately in a hematocrit centrifuge and read under microhematocrit to determine package cell volume (PCV) for each sample. The camel with PCV ≤ 24% was assumed as anemic.13,14 The contents of the capillary tube (above 1mm and below the buffy coat) were tested using the buffy coat technique to identify the Trypanosoma parasite under magnification 40x light microscope.15,16 Thin blood smears were prepared from Trypanosoma positive samples and prepared samples were dried and fixed with methanol on the day of preparation for five (5) minutes to avoid all possible deteriorations. The prepared samples were immersed in the Giemsa stain solution for 40 minutes. Then, the slides were tested using ×100 magnifications with an oil immersion microscope. Trypanosoma species were identified based on the morphology of the Trypanosoma parasite like the size of the parasite, shape of the posterior end, size and position of the kinetoplast, and presence or absence of the flagellum following the procedure of Murray et al.15

Data Management and Analysis

The collected data during the study were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The prevalence of camel trypanosomiasis was computed by dividing a positive sample by a total sample collected. The confidence interval at 95% was calculated for each prevalence using Epitools online.17 The Student’s t-test was conducted to compare the mean PCV of the infected camels with that of the non-infected camels. The presumptive risk factors of the Trypanosoma parasite in camel were tested using the logistic regression model.18 The variables were tested for multicollinearity and interaction effect using collinear matrix index and cross-product term respectively, after univariable logistic regression analysis. Then, variables with p≤0.05 in univariable analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression analysis. The potential risk factors of camel trypanosomosis were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The fitness and validity of the model were assessed by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test and ROC curve, respectively.18,19 All analyses were performed using STATA version 13.0 software. In all cases, a p-value of 0.05 and a 95% confidence interval (CL) were used for significance.

Results

Prevalence of Camel Trypanosomosis in Study Areas

From a total of 384 camels tested, 15 were positive for Trypanozoon using wet blood film (thin) and the Giemsa-stained technique. The overall 3.91% of camel trypanosomosis was recorded in the areas. Trypanozoon was the Trypanosome subgenus documented in camel in the study areas. The Trypanosoma infection was higher in Gomole (4.46%) than in Yabelo (3.30%) districts (Table 1).

Table 1 Distribution of Camel Trypanosomosis in Gomole and Yabello Districts

Hematological Finding

Trypanozoon infection causes anemia with a mean PCV infected camel of 20.73±1.91 and non-infected camel (27.07±4.35) with statistically significant difference (P=0.0001) as stated in Table 2.

Table 2 Association Between Anemia and Trypanosomosis in Camels

Univariable Logistic Regression Analysis of Risk Factors of Camel Trypanosomosis

The number of positive camels to Trypanozoon that originated from Gomole district (4.46%) was higher than those from Yabelo district (3.30%). However, there was no difference (P=0.340). Likewise, a lower prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was observed in males (2.98%) than females (4.63%) with a statistically insignificant difference (P=0.410). Even though a higher prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was noted in adults (3.76%) than young (3.98%), no significant difference was observed (P=0.914). Similarly, a higher prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was recorded in the wet season (6.21%) than in the dry season (2.51%) (P=0.079). Nevertheless, an insignificant difference was observed between seasons in univariable logistic regression analysis (P=0.079). The highest prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was recorded in camel had poor body condition (7.75%) following by medium (2.75%) and good body (1.37%) condition. Poor body condition camel had the highest odds (OR=6.1) of trypanosomosis compared to good body condition camel with statistically significant difference (P=0.022) as indicated in Table 3.

Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis of Risk Factors of Camel Trypanosomosis

The explanatory variables with p≤0.25 in univariable analysis with no multicollinearity were further analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. No significant interactions were detected between variables. The model was fitted the data well as indicated by the Hosmer–Lemeshow test (χ2=1.244, p=0.871) and the area under ROC (0.748) was also revealed that the model had a good predictive ability. The final multivariable logistic regression model showed that a camel with poor body condition was 6.8 times more likely to be exposed to Trypanosoma infection compared to a good body condition one. Similarly, the camel had higher odds (OR=3.1) of trypanosomosis in the dry season than wet season (Table 4).

Discussion

An overall 3.9% prevalence of camel trypanosomosis recorded in the present study agreed with the prevalence stated by Kassa et al8 4.4% and Tadesse et al20 3.5% in the Fentale district and Jijiga zone, respectively. Comparable prevalence of trypanosomosis was also documented by Gerem et al2 and Gerem and Hamid21 4.5% in selected districts of the Afar region. The low prevalence observed in the current study and previous ones may be related to regular treatment and avoiding the movement of camel herds to insect challenges areas. Camel herders were aware of the seasonality and ecology of the biting flies and this could reduce the disease challenge.22 Moreover, the transmission of camel trypanosomosis was varied based on agroecology and density of biting flies.23 This might lead to the low recorded prevalence of the current study. However, the present prevalence was lower compared to the findings of Hagos et al24 12.1% and Megersa25 10.5% and Abdurkadir et al26 10.2% in Ethiopia and prevalence of 8.3% Swai et al27 from Tanzania and 11.5% in Bhutto et al28 from Pakistan. Similarly, a higher prevalence of trypanosomosis than the present finding was also reported 21% in Ethiopia,29 28% in Kenya,30 68.7% in Somalia,31 and 20.6% in Egypt.32 This difference may be related to the difference in the ecosystem, distribution, and uses of the trypanocidal drug and the seasons when the studies were conducted in which distribution of biting flies are either increase or decrease.

In the present study, Trypanozoon was the Trypanosome subgenus that causes camel trypanosomosis in the areas which is in agreement with a study done in Somalia33 who found 5.3% of infection was due to Trypanozoon, whereas only 0.06% of the infections were due to T. congolense and T. vivax. Infection caused by Trypanosoma congolense is expected in tsetse fly-infested areas whereas T. vivax can occur anywhere as far as biting flies and parasites exist. In the Borana area, however, only biting flies exist and the occurrence of Trypanosoma congolense is less likely. Tabanus and Stomoxys genus are the most important biting flies that transmitted Trypanozoon infection in this area.30,34 Similar to this, various studies in tropical areas showed that the occurrence of Trypanozoon infection was associated with the number of biting flies.8,30 The presence of biting flies in all seasons ensures that the transmission of the parasite occurs wherever that co-existence of the reservoir and susceptible hosts.30

The present study showed that Trypanozoon infection was associated with anemia as the mean PCV of infected camel (20.73±1.91) was significantly (P=0.0001) lower than non-infected camel (27.07±4.35). The infected camel with PCV less than or equal to 24% was assumed as an anemic.13,14 Thus, Trypanozoon infection may be reduced the PCV of a diseased camel. There was also a non-infected camel with PCV <24%. This may be due to delayed recovery of anemia condition after treatment and anemia also caused by nutritional deficiencies, helminthiasis, blood parasite, and other infectious diseases.35 The infected camel with PCV >24% was also recorded in this study. The reason for this may be some camel able to control PCV within the normal range or they were recently infected camel. The current result is consistent with previous results in the country36–38 and elsewhere,35,39 who reported that the mean PCV of trypanosomosis infected camels were significantly lower than non-infected camels.

The current study indicated that body condition was significantly associated with the occurrence of camel trypanosomosis. The odds of trypanosomosis were 6.8 times higher among camels with poor body condition than those in good body condition. This may be due to trypanosomosis results in progressive emaciation of infected camel,; however, non-infected camel under good condition have well-developed immune status that can respond to any foreign protein better than those of non-infected camel with poor body condition.11,40 This finding is in line with previous results,38,41 which stated that the occurrence of camel trypanosomosis was associated with the body condition of the camel. The season was another risk factor that has shown significantly associated with the occurrence of trypanosomosis in the camel. Camel had three times (OR=3.1) odds of Trypanosoma infection in the dry season than the wet season. This might be camels were overcrowded at a watering point during the dry season which facilitated the transmission of parasites among camels.42 Our result agrees with the findings of32,43 who stated that season was associated with the occurrence of Trypanosoma infection in camel.

Even though a higher prevalence of trypanosomosis was recorded in the Gomole district than in the Yabelo district, an insignificant difference was noticed between districts. This might be associated with the agroecology of the Gomole district which has several animal watering points and the presence of different size trees and shrubs along with year-round natural or artificial lakes and ponds. In agreement with the present finding, Gerem et al2 found a statistically insignificant difference between the districts. Even though a statistically insignificant difference was observed between age groups, a higher prevalence of camel trypanosomosis was recorded in young camel. This might be due to having less immunity to resist and more susceptible to the protozoan than that of the matured ones. This finding significantly differs from the previous report from Mauritania which reported that young camel (<1 year age) was less likely to be infected with Trypanozoon infection.44 Surra can attack camels at any age, even fetuses.10 This is because that is impossible to control of biting fly which is found everywhere and there is an equal chance of bite by flies in both adult and young. Similar to this finding, Kassa et al8 stated a higher prevalence in young than an adult in the Afar region. This result is in line with the findings of Sobhy et al32 who found a low prevalence of Trypanosoma parasite in adults than young camels.

In the current study, a higher prevalence of trypanosomosis was recorded in female than male camels,; however, the difference was statistically insignificant. This result is in line with previous findings in Pakistan and Egypt which reported a higher prevalence of trypanosomosis in female than male camels.28,32 This also agrees with the findings of Olani et al45 and Shah et al46 who reported a higher prevalence of trypanosomosis in females than male camels. This might be due to stress during pregnancy and lactation, which could decrease resistance in female camels and render them more susceptible to Trypanosoma infection. In agreement with this finding, a previous study also reported as Trypanosoma infection was high during pregnancy and lactation this reduce the resistance and increase susceptibility to the disease.47

Conclusion and Recommendations

The present finding showed that trypanosomosis was a common disease in the camel herd of the most district of the study areas with a higher prevalence in the Gomole district. Camel had poor body condition was at increased risk of acquiring Trypanosoma infection. Similarly, the occurrence of trypanosomosis in the camel was influenced by season. Trypanozoon was the Trypanosome subgenus that causes camel trypanosomosis in study areas. Anemia is one of the characteristics of camel trypanosomosis. Camel trypanosomosis was an impediment to camel production in the study areas. Therefore, control and prevent methods considering seasonality, different ecology is necessary to design and implement. Moreover, a further study involving more sensitive molecular techniques should be conducted on camel trypanosomosis and its vectors.","Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.dovepress.com/assets/img/addon/og_logo.png,"['areas', 'preva', 'infection', 'yabelo', 'camel', 'gomole', 'study', 'camels', 'trypanosoma', 'prevalence', 'districts', 'ethiopia', 'trypanosomosis', 'higher']", 
14,14,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Chronic Stress Inhibits Hair Growth by Prolonging Follicle Stem Cells' “Resting Phase” - Psychiatry Advisor,https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/home/topics/general-psychiatry/chronic-stress-inhibits-hair-growth-by-prolonging-follicle-stem-cells-resting-phase/,"Sustained stress exposure inhibits hair growth, wrote authors of a study published in Nature. In rodent models, increased systemic levels of stress hormone corticosterone were found to prolong the “resting phase” of hair follicle stem cells (HSFCs), thus preventing hair turnover.

Conversely, following adrenalectomy to prevent secretion of stress hormones, HSFCs underwent more frequent regeneration throughout the life course. These results outline the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress may inhibit hair growth and provide a framework for future studies.

While the relationship between stress exposure and tissue homeostasis is well-documented, the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. To better determine the impact of chronic stress on hair growth, investigators manipulated the secretion of corticosterone — the rodent equivalent of human hormone cortisone — in mouse models.

To assess hair growth in the absence of systemic stress hormones, the investigators performed adrenalectomy (ADX) in C57BL/6 mice to remove both adrenal glands, the source of corticosterone. ADX mice and control mice were then shaved and monitored for hair coat recovery over a period of several months.

In separate trials, investigators tested the impact of increased corticosterone levels in 2 sets of mice: (1) mice supplied supplementary corticosterone via drinking water; and (2) mice exposed to stress triggers, such as cage tilts or sudden light-dark changes. In all trials, blood corticosterone levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); hair cycle phases were determined visually and confirmed histologically. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FASC) of dorsal skin samples was used to identify the cells through which corticosterone acts to regulate HFSC quiescence.

The surgical removal of both adrenal glands was found to activate HFSCs and enhance their proliferation. In ADX mice, hair follicles were longer at the same stage of anagen compared with control mice.

Over approximately 16 months post-adrenalectomy, ADX mice underwent an average of 10 synchronized hair cycles. By comparison, sham mice only completed 3 hair cycles in the same time period, within which phase entry was inconsistent. Over time, the telogen phases became progressively longer in sham mice, and entry into anagen “sporadic and asynchronized.” In ADX mice, however, telogen phases consistently lasted just 2 weeks, and entry into anagen afterwards was consistent. Percent regrowth was significantly greater in ADX vs sham mice at 66 and 74 days after shaving (both P <.0001).

By contrast, exposure to systemic corticosterone was observed to profoundly inhibit hair growth. Corticosterone-fed mice experienced prolongation of the telogen phase compared with controls. When corticosterone was removed from the drinking water, however, mice were able to enter the anagen phase, suggesting that the effects of stress on hair growth are reversible.

In mice exposed to external stressors without corticosterone supplementation, results were similar. Stressed mice displayed extended telogen phases, though this effect was also reversible following adrenalectomy.

Per FACS analyses, corticosterone was found to act on the dermal papillae to regulate HFSC quiescence. Specifically, corticosterone was observed to inhibit the expression of Gas6, a gene which encodes the secreted factor growth arrest specific 6. Inhibition of Gas6 expression forces HFSCs to remain in prolonged quiescence, thus explaining poor hair growth in mice with high corticosterone levels.

By contrast, Gas6 was found to be significantly upregulated in the dermal papillae of ADX mice. Further, intradermal injection of Gas6 was found to induce anagen at injection sites. Gas6 overexpression was also found to counteract stress-induced inhibition of hair growth; mice injected with Gas6 then exposed to corticosterone feeding or stress triggers were able to maintain HFSC activation.

Per these results, long-term stress substantially impacts hair growth via inhibition of Gas6 expression in the dermal papillae. Reversal of this effect was achieved by the reduction of stress or the overexpression of Gas6, providing potential insight into the process of hair regeneration. While rodent models provide only a preliminary look into human mechanisms, these data describe the processes which underlie hair growth and regeneration under stressful conditions.

“Our findings not only reveal important regulators of HFSC quiescence and activation at both local and systemic levels, but also identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which chronic stress influences the hair cycle,” the investigators wrote. “Moreover, we demonstrate that the tissue-regeneration capacity of HFSCs remains robust even after significantly increased rounds of anagen entry throughout life.”

15,15,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,At sea with UAE female boat captain Patricia Caswell: 'Have confidence in what you do' - The National,https://www.thenationalnews.com/lifestyle/at-sea-with-uae-female-boat-captain-patricia-caswell-have-confidence-in-what-you-do-1.1218819,"“Good morning, Captain.” The greeting hails Captain Patricia Caswell as she walks through the brand new $35 million, 780-tonne, 53-metre long Gulf Craft Majesty superyacht languishing in the waters of the Arabian Gulf off Umm Al Quwain.

It’s a boat she’ll soon be taking out to test, pushing it to its very limits before the owner takes possession, and with this in mind, the engineers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers and cleaners quickly get back to work as she passes through.

The marble-inlaid bathrooms, cool, contemporary cabins and coffee-coloured corridors are gleaming new as she heads past million-dollar details such as the glass lift and the on-deck pool towards the bridge. Here, a bank of monitors, gauges and controls stretching the breadth of the sleek black console, quietly beep and flash under her watchful gaze.

To an outsider, it all looks slightly more complicated than the deck of the Starship Enterprise crossed with that of a modern nuclear submarine. But for Caswell, who has been on boats since she was 17, it’s her equivalent of opening a laptop and checking her email.

Patricia Caswell has been at seas since she was 17. Pawan Singh / The National

“Captain” is a greeting the 42-year-old Australian has been hearing for 21 years now, ever since she became qualified to use the title at 21. An age she admits is tender, not only for the industry as a whole, but also for a woman in a male-dominated field.

“Twenty-one is young to become a captain, and back then there were only two other females who had done it before me in Australia,” she says. “They were my idols. One went to Antarctica, the other went over to superyachts, and I was like: ‘These chicks are amazing. This is cool, I need to be involved in this’.”

‘I got seasick my first day’

Growing up in Brisbane, Queensland on Australia’s west coast, by her own admission Caswell was a “determined teenager”. One who left home at 16, got her own place and a job at a bank straight out of high school, already exhibiting the kind of independence and self-reliance that would befit a young woman about to embark on a life at sea.

An invitation when she was 17 from her mother to visit her in the Whitsunday Islands in the heart of the Great Barrier Reef where she owned a travel company, proved the hook that set her on her path.

“My mum sent me out sailing for the day on this 80-foot [24-metre] yacht and I was like, this is awesome,” she recalls. “I never went back to Brisbane. I had someone pack up my bags and send them on to me.”

Her first job wasn’t all plain sailing.

“I started on a catamaran as a stewardess. I got seasick my very first day and they gave me the nickname ‘Chucky’,” she laughs. “It was horrible. I went back the next day and the captain said: ‘Really? You want to have another go at this?’ And I was like: ‘Yeah, let’s have another go’, and I stayed.

“As a stewardess, you’re serving drinks, making sandwiches and taking care of guests, but I only lasted a few months because I wanted to be on deck, I wanted to be sailing with the boys, so I started learning to sail.”

‘I got a job… I’m going to the Caribbean’

Sailing around Australia and New Zealand in her early twenties sounds like the stuff inspirational Instagram accounts, which of course didn’t exist then, are made of.

Trips out to watch the America’s Cup, diving in Cairns and sailing around the crystal clear waters of Papua New Guinea were all in a day’s work for Caswell, who, after a stint working for a New Zealand family, finally saved up enough money to go where she had always intended to head: Europe.

Once you get a taste of it, you know there’s a big world and you want to see it. I also wanted to move onto superyachts

“I wanted to travel and I had always wanted to go to Europe,” she says. “Once you get a taste of it, you know there’s a big world and you want to see it. I also wanted to move onto superyachts.”

Caswell, who had to convert her Australian credentials to the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) licences, went back to school, this time to a maritime college in Southampton, where a phone call from an old friend from proved a game changer.

“She called me and said: ‘Where are you?’ I said: ‘I’m in England.’ And she said: ‘We need a first mate, are you available?’” Caswell says. “I flew to the south of France to meet the manager of the boat and when I flew back to the UK, I said to my friends: ‘Funny story, I got a job and I’m going to the Caribbean tomorrow.’”

Of the post she took of first mate on the 300-tonne, 36-metre boat, Caswell says: “That’s how I managed to save up to go back to school to do the chief mate, so I could be second in charge of larger vessels.”

Bananas and superstitions

Back beyond the 19th-century, women on boats were considered to bring bad luck for an array of superstitious reasons, from angering the sea gods to distracting the sailors. Conversely, their wood-carved, often bare-chested presence as figureheads at the bow was thought to calm the sea. And the perceived bad luck of women onboard didn’t stop sailors from naming their boats after females or referring to their vessels as “she”.

I won’t have bananas onboard. If guests arrive with bananas in hand, I make them eat them on the deck before they come aboard

For her own part Caswell is an adherent to the age-old superstition of not allowing bananas aboard her boats, a ritual that dates back beyond the 1700s and the belief that at the height of the trading empire between Spain and the Caribbean, the majority of ships that disappeared had been carrying cargos of bananas.

“I won’t have bananas onboard,” she says. “If guests arrive with bananas in hand, I make them eat them on the deck before they come aboard.”

These days, the presence of women on boats is growing. The vast majority are in roles such as stewardesses and deck hands, although the numbers becoming first mates and captains is increasing. Caswell’s qualification of Master 3000 means she can command a craft of up to 3,000 tonnes.

“I qualified just as I turned 30,” she says. “That was my goal, I wanted to have my Master 3000 by the time I was 30 and I got it in the February after my birthday in December.

“Females only make up something like 2 per cent of captains for superyachts globally,” she adds. “When I first qualified, there were only a dozen or so at my level. Of course, it’s grown now and there are many females coming through, but it’s still a tiny percentage. It’s coming but it takes time.”

‘Whatever guests want, you find’

Capri, St Tropez, Antibes. The mere mention of some of the most glamorous places on earth conjures up images of sun, luxury and money, plenty of it. But for Caswell, these destinations are usually about reverse parking a 60-metre superyacht with just metres to spare on either side while trying to avoid other floating palaces.

“The Mediterranean can be intense in high season,” she says of the celebrity summer destination of choice. “There’ll be lots of people on the dock milling around taking photos, wanting to see whose boat it is. And if you have high-profile guests onboard then you’ll have the paparazzi there too, all while your team is on the microphone in your ear, saying: ‘Two metres this side, one metre that side’.”

Captains are also not just captains, they also take on the role of uber-concierges.

“Over the years you get to know the best chauffeurs, marinas, and hotels,"" she says. ""If guests want privacy or if they want to be spotted by the paparazzi, whatever they want you have to be able to arrange these things.”

From movie stars to cannibals

“The first big movie star I met was Sean Connery, I was so excited,” Caswell says. “He came on the boat for dinner with the owner. I was first mate, and it was really fresh to me.

“I had this periscope that had been given to me as a present. Everyone was in the main dining room and I crawled along the side deck and put this periscope up to the window to see what was happening at the dining table. The Italian owner saw what I was doing and he was laughing. He came out later and said: ‘This is cool, right?’ And I was like: ‘Yes!’

You can just go to the most out of the way places and meet the most interesting, amazing people

“The following year, I met Pierce Brosnan. He came onboard while filming Mamma Mia! and I was like: ‘I’ve met another Bond!’”

But over the years, who has been her favourite guest?

“I’ve had Rihanna on my boat a few times,” she smiles. “She’s amazing, one of my favourites for sure. She’s very, very cool.”

However, when it comes to her favourite passages, Caswell names the South Pacific, specifically the Marquesas Islands and French Polynesia.

“If I could, I would just go from Pacific island to Pacific island,” she says. “I had Christmas dinner with a cannibal once, the chief of the village in the Marquesas. We arrived on a sailboat and this big guy came down. He brought us fruit and was telling us old stories about the old cannibals eating their enemies. The last person they ate was in the 1960s, it was wild. This was at Christmas dinner, I was like: ‘You don’t say? What are we eating now?’

“That is one of the great things about being on boats that you can just go to the most out of the way places and meet the most interesting, amazing people.”

The difficulties faced at sea

As you would expect from someone who has spent 25 years at sea, Caswell has run into both bad weather and pirates from time to time, although it’s difficult to tell which force of nature is the most unpredictable.

“The time of year when we’re all moving towards the Caribbean is around the tail end of hurricane season,” she says. “And as the weather’s coming in, you learn to drive to deal with it. On one occasion, we ended up turning south and going for two days to outrun it before coming back.”

However, outrunning pirates is a different matter altogether.

The Gulf of Aden in the Indian Ocean between Yemen and Somalia has often been in the news for the piracy which became prevalent in the area, most famously for the Maersk Alabama hijacking which was later turned into the Tom Hanks film, Captain Phillips.

Patricia Caswell admits to being nervous during her first few runs at sea. Pawan Singh / The National

“My first few runs through the Gulf of Aden I was nervous,” Caswell says. “We’ve stopped in Djibouti and I’ve stopped in Yemen to refuel, that was pretty wild. You have the coalition warships that work in grids all through the Gulf of Aden, so you travel with these convoys. Boats use water cannons and keep all their fire hoses charged. Some put rolled up barbed wire around the sides as they’re coming through.

“We’d travel with armed security onboard. You pick them up in Egypt and the Suez Canal and a lot are ex-SAS and former military.

“You’re trained to deal with it and you put all the measures in place that you can,” she reasons. “You have to have confidence in the systems you’ve put in place and your emergency procedures if something were to happen. You can’t stress about it because you have to guide your team through it.”

A first in the UAE

Caswell came to the UAE in 2015 after securing a job for a high-profile local family who were looking for a female boat captain.

“As a female captain, you have good access around different family members,” she explains. “On a boat, if the women are in private areas, as a female I can enter, and it works a lot easier for the family.”

This followed five-and-a-half years of travelling the globe.

“They were a lovely, respectful, kind family,” she says. “I would go to sea when the boss and family went to sea. Sometimes I would go ahead to set things up for them and make sure everything was ready.

Patricia Caswell has joined Gulf Craft Inc, a luxury yacht and boat manufacturer in Umm Al Quwain. Pawan Singh / The National

“One of the last runs I did, we picked up a boat in North Carolina and drove it down to Florida, put it on a ship to have it delivered here. Then we pull it off the ship and set it all up, put the personal items of the owner onboard so it’s ready to go.

“As a captain, you’re responsible for multi-million dollar assets. You run the budgets, the training, maintenance, everything.”

While Caswell is still years away from hanging up her captain’s hat, her new role at Gulf Craft Inc, a luxury yacht and boat manufacturer in Umm Al Quwain where she now lives, means more time spent on land.

“I joined Gulf Craft towards the end of last year,” she says. ""It was an exciting time because they were just pulling the new 175ft super-yacht out of the shed which for me was like Christmas.

“It’s a big change from being at sea every day. I have a team of 19 and together we checked every system installed in the boat. Then I got to do the very first sea trial, and that for me is the rush. We turned everything on for the first time and left the dock. We pushed everything and tested and ran everything, that’s the fun part. Like playing with a new toy.”

Abeer Al Shaali is deputy managing director at Gulf Craft Inc. Her father, Mohammed Al Shaali established the company in 1982, says that the industry is in her blood: “I think there’s something intrinsically calming about the sea that speaks to an unconscious part of ourselves. It’s scary, mysterious and otherworldly and if you have a passion for it it’s hard to stay away.

“When the team first came to me and said they had found Patricia they were so excited. ‘Planetary alignment’ was the term they used,” she says . “Patricia has the depth of knowledge we were looking for and was difficult to find locally and of this calibre in the region. She’s a great personality, a team player and very knowledgeable.""

A Captain’s advice

So, what makes a good captain? With 25 years at sea and 21 years in the role, Caswell has had plenty of time to ruminate on the attributes that make a successful skipper.

“You’ve got to have confidence in what you do. You have to be able to lead your teams and do it in a confined space,"" she says. ""You might be at sea for six months with the same 14 people living within 50 metres of one another, so you’ve got to be able to brush off the little things. Have a good ear to listen to people’s problems, but not take things to heart. Get on with the day and gently guide everyone.”

Patricia cites confidence and not sweating the small stuff as key attributes for being a good captain. Pawan Singh / The National

Getting used to life on dry land has its advantages. It's meant more time with her husband, Lee, but there’s also more of the day-to-day things that those on land take for granted.

“I only just started getting my utility bills,” she laughs. “I never used to get them, ever. I was like: ‘Who pays for water?’ Luckily Lee has always helped with land-based operations.”

As far as her achievements go, she's happy to help lead the way for a new generation of women who would like to follow a similar path.

“I have to be proud,” she says. “I hope it gives confidence to young women coming up through the ranks, that it is achievable and possible to do.”","Sun, 09 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenationalnews.com/image/policy:1.1218811:1620543309/PS2804-%20PATRICIA01.jpg?f=16x9&q=0.6&w=1200&$p$f$q$w=008b953,"['confidence', 'uae', 'went', 'female', 'sea', 'patricia', 'gulf', 'women', 'captain', 'boats', 'caswell', 'boat', 'wanted', 'onboard']",

BERLIN (Reuters) -Germany's vaccine committee, known as STIKO, plans to recommend Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine only for people over the age of 60, German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday, citing no sources.

Europe's drug regulator approved J&J's vaccine last month after examining cases of a rare blood clotting issue in U.S. adults who received a dose. But it left it up to the European Union's member states to decide how to use it.

A spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases said the institute expects STIKO to make a recommendation on J&J's vaccine next week. She declined to comment further.

Germany limited the shot from Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca to people over 60 after post-vaccination monitoring found rare - and sometimes fatal - cases of blood clotting, with younger women disproportionately affected.

Health Minister Jens Spahn announced on Thursday that Germany would make AstraZeneca available to all adults, regardless of age, to speed up its vaccination campaign.

The decision by the federal government follows moves by several German states to make AstraZeneca more widely available and comes as the pace of giving shots of mainstay vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna picks up.

But President Mohamed has extended his mandate despite the international criticism.

Somalian President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has signed a controversial law extending his mandate for two more years despite international criticism.

In a statement, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken warned that ""such actions would be deeply divisive, undermine the federalism process and political reforms that have been at the heart of the country's progress.""

It also jeopardizes ""partnership with the international community, and divert attention from countering Al-Shabab.""

Blinken further said the US was ""deeply disappointed"" and warned that President Mohamed's actions could erode the progress toward peace made in tandem with the international community.

The top US diplomat said the implementation of the law would compel his country to consider sanctions or other steps such as visa restrictions.

European Union's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also threatened ""concrete measures"" without an immediate return to talks on holding elections.

The United Nations Mission in Somalia (UNSOM), in a joint statement with EU nations, regional IGAD bloc, and the United Kingdom, said it was ""deeply concerned"" and would not support the extension.

In Mogadishu, political and constitutional expert Aweys Salat, said the extension of the president's term was unconstitutional.

""It seems the president ignores that every resolution or law requires approval of both houses of parliament, the senate and the house of representatives,"" Salat told DW. ""The residents in the capital Mogadishu are tired of war, and they are asking politicians to respect the constitution.""

Regional observers have also warned that Somalia's current political crisis could deal a blow to efforts to stabilize the fragile state after decades of civil war and an Islamist insurgency.

Somalia hits back at 'foreign allies'

Somalia has accused some of its foreign backers of undermining its sovereignty amid the threat of sanctions.

""While we appreciate the concerns of our friends and international partners for Somalia's stability and security, it is regrettable to witness champions of democratic principles falling short of supporting the aspirations of the Somali people to exercise their democratic rights,"" the country's Foreign Ministry said.

""Inflammatory statements laden with threats, which undermine the political independence and sovereign rights of national institutions, will only serve to embolden terrorist organizations and anti-peace elements in Somalia,"" the ministry's statement added.

Somalia's president, best known by the name Farmajo, and the leaders of the country's five semi-autonomous federal states had reached an agreement in September on indirect parliamentary and presidential elections in late 2020 and early 2021.

But it fell apart over how to conduct the vote, and multiple rounds of talks have failed to break the impasse. The new law paves the way for a one-person, one-vote election in 2023, the first such direct poll since 1969, the year dictator Siad Barre led a coup before ruling for two decades.

A presidential election was due to have been held in February. It was to follow a complex indirect system used in the past in which special delegates chosen by Somalia's myriad clan elders pick lawmakers, who in turn choose the president.

A 'constitutional crisis'

Abdi Hashi Abdullahi, the senate speaker, has slammed the move as unconstitutional and said it would ""lead the country into political instability"" and pose security risks.

A coalition of opposition presidential candidates in a joint statement called it ""a threat to the stability, peace and unity"" of the country.

""There is now a constitutional crisis in the country as the senate, or upper house speaker, rejects the extension for the president and the lower house. The fear of chaos, suspension among the politicians, is too high now in Mogadishu and other parts of the country,"" Salat, the constitutional expert, told DW.

Somalis speak out

While some in Mogadishu welcomed the extension of Abdullahi Mohamed's government for another two years, others are apprehensive that the extension could plunge the country into a political crisis.

""I think the two-year extension is needed. The president has done a lot of good things in the past four years. The president tried to hold the elections, but some politicians and regional states have crippled the process. If all political actors agree, we hope to have popular elections or a one-man-one-vote election in the next two years,"" Ilyas Nor told DW.

But for Shub'eyb Omar ""the extension for the president and parliament is unacceptable.""

""The president failed to have elections in the country under his legitimate four-year term. Both the president and the parliament need to rethink about this unlawful power extension,"" Omar said.

Jamuria Ahmed, a mother of two, told DW: ""I'm happy with the extension for the president and the parliament by two years since the regional states and the central government were unsuccessful in ending the impasse on the clan-based indirect elections. We need to participate in the one-man-one-vote elections. There are political spoilers in the country who do not want to let our nation move forward.""

""My message to the Somali leaders and intellectuals in Mogadishu is to calm down and compromise for the interest of the people and solve all issues through dialogue. There are significant improvements and developments in our country, especially in Mogadishu, and we need to seize this opportunity, which is for everyone's interest,"" Nor Hassan, another Mogadishu resident, told DW.

Somalia's complex politics

Somalia has not had an effective central government since the collapse of Barre'smilitary regime in 1991, which led to decades of civil war and lawlessness fueled by clan conflicts.

The country also still battles Al-Shabab, an al-Qaida-linked Islamist militant group. The group controlled Mogadishu until 2011 when African Union troops pushed it out.

Al-Shabab retains parts of the countryside and targets the government, military and civilians in attacks in Mogadishu and regional towns.

Somalia still operates under an interim constitution, and its institutions, such as the army, remain rudimentary, backed up with international support.

The 59-year-old President Mohamed was wildly popular when he came to power in 2017. The veteran diplomat and former prime minister, who lived off and on for years in the United States, had vowed to rebuild a country that was once the world's most notorious failed state.

However, observers say he became mired in feuds with federal states in a bid for greater political control, hampering the fight against Al-Shabab, which retains the ability to conduct deadly strikes both at home and in the region.

In February, some opposition leaders attempted to hold a protest, which led to an exchange of gunfire in the capital.

18,18,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Leaf-inspired homeostatic cellulose biosensors - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabe7432,"An incompatibility between skin homeostasis and existing biosensor interfaces inhibits long-term electrophysiological signal measurement. Inspired by the leaf homeostasis system, we developed the first homeostatic cellulose biosensor with functions of protection, sensation, self-regulation, and biosafety. Moreover, we find that a mesoporous cellulose membrane transforms into homeostatic material with properties that include high ion conductivity, excellent flexibility and stability, appropriate adhesion force, and self-healing effects when swollen in a saline solution. The proposed biosensor is found to maintain a stable skin-sensor interface through homeostasis even when challenged by various stresses, such as a dynamic environment, severe detachment, dense hair, sweat, and long-term measurement. Last, we demonstrate the high usability of our homeostatic biosensor for continuous and stable measurement of electrophysiological signals and give a showcase application in the field of brain-computer interfacing where the biosensors and machine learning together help to control real-time applications beyond the laboratory at unprecedented versatility.

The high performance of CS on various locations of human skin could be verified by measuring representative EP signals [here electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG); Fig. 1B , ii] ( 2 ), and the CS stability and robust quality are demonstrated below for a direct, real-time control application using machine learning ( 31 , 32 ) ( Fig. 1B , iii).

In our endeavor to imitate the architecture of the leaf system, the biosensor components include a surface designed to absorb, store, and diffuse water; a supporting structure to protect and support the surface from the outside; and a gate structure regulated by pressure ( Fig. 1A ).The key mechanism to construct a homeostatic interface between the skin and sensor surface is shown in Fig. 1B . In this mechanism, ions and water molecules inside the mesopores of the swollen CM spontaneously permeate into the inner layers of skin through the pores of the stratum corneum by diffusion gradient, thereby noninvasively increasing the contact surface area with the skin (fig. S1, A to E). When changes such as sweat secretion occur in the skin, the sweat penetrates into the CM pores by diffusion, keeping a stable conductive path between the skin surface and CM (fig. S1, A to C).

We have therefore analyzed properties that change in mesoporous cellulose membranes (CMs) ( 29 , 30 ) during the absorption of saline solution, which is harmless to the skin. This analysis revealed that the CM markedly transforms its properties to become a homeostatic material of self-regulation at approximately 85% of the swelling ( 27 , 28 ) process. In addition, we verified the long-term biosafety of CM based on in-depth dermatological tests.The performance of cellulose biosensors (CSs) is shown to compare well to that of conductive gel sensors (GSs) ( 7 , 8 ) that can establish a reliable conductive interface on the skin in the presence or absence of hair layers.

Cellulose is the main component of the cell wall of a leaf ( 24 – 26 ). The presence of cellulose enables cells to reversibly swell as a result of water absorption ( 27 , 28 ). Thus, wet cellulose exhibits a unique combination of excellent flexibility, self-healing capability, and outstanding biocompatibility.

To develop homeostatic materials, which are the core component of the homeostasis system, a few studies proposed complex synthesis techniques ( 22 , 23 ). However, we explore hints for the most natural homeostatic material within the leaf system.

To pursue this goal, the botanical leaf is adopted as a useful reference. A leaf system consists of three main tissues: epidermis, mesophyll, and vascular tissue. The epidermis contains cuticle ( 17 ) and stomata ( 18 ). Leaf homeostasis maintains the water content inside the plant by regulating stomata against abiotic stresses such as flooding and drought ( 18 – 21 ). We will, in the following, exploit and mimic these properties of leaves to construct a homeostatic biointerface that is compatible with the human skin.

The skin ( 15 , 16 ) is vital for aspects of homeostasis ( 14 ) that include protection, regulation of body temperature, water balance, absorption of materials, and others. Accurate measurement of EP signals on the skin can be increased by an in-depth understanding of the complex structure and function of the skin ( 1 , 13 ).

Continuous monitoring of human physiological signals on the skin is critical in diverse fields ranging from medical aspects such as disease diagnosis, rehabilitation, and recovery to neurotechnology, gaming, and entertainment ( 1 – 6 ). Existing noninvasive electrophysiological (EP) biosensors ( 7 – 12 ) have shown impressive performances, but they do not consider skin homeostasis ( 1 , 13 , 14 ). Furthermore, long-term biosafety has not been verified dermatologically ( 1 , 15 , 16 ).

RESULTS

Figure 1C presents a schematic illustration of the CS. The structure consists of a reservoir for saline solution, an Ag/AgCl electrode, a glass fiber membrane (GM) that supports and preserves the CM, and the CM with a perforated pore. Figure S2 (A and B) shows the surface detail and cross-sectional morphology of both the CM and GM.

To reveal the underlying mechanism of the observed CM swelling, comprehensive analyses are performed. These include the change of surface morphology and thickness as a function of relative humidity (RH) using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) (33, 34), the change of dry/wet adhesion strength in an adhesion test, and the variation of ionic conductivity under a function of RH (35).

Immersion of a CM in saline solution leads to infiltration of two types of hydrated ions and water molecules between cellulose nano- and microfibril sheets (Fig. 1D, i). Cellulose is an organic polymer whose chains are linked via hydrogen bonding, and water or ion molecules participate in the binding sites, causing the polymer volume to increase. This results in swelling. The saline solution permeates inside the CM by changes in the contact angle according to drop volume (fig. S2C, i and ii). The diffusion rate at which CM diffuses the electrolyte is about 0.41 ± 0.05 μl/min.

We determined the changes of thickness of the CM in an ESEM chamber, where the RH around the dry specimen has increased from 40 to 100%. As shown in the ESEM images of the CM (Fig. 1D, ii), the CM underwent a drastic thickness change as the environmental humidity reached approximately 85% by absorbing water molecules. The more detailed ESEM imaging results are shown in fig. S2D.

Wet adhesion (7.18 ± 1.79 kPa) of the CM on hairy skin is observed to increase by nearly 100-fold (Fig. 1D, iv, and fig. S1, F and G). The swollen CM displays pronounced adhesive capability under wet conditions on hairy skin without leaving a trace after detachment through an effortless peel-off procedure.

Morphology changes of the perforated pore inside the CM show little change in the pores until an RH of approximately 80% (fig. S3, A and B). At RHs ≥85%, the self-healing effect of CM on the pore becomes evident (Fig. 1D, iii), and at 100% RH, the pore is mostly closed. This pore reopens or recloses because of the external (contact pressure) or internal pressure (swelling)—a concept similar to the leaf stoma (18). Using this property of the CM, a controllable releasing mechanism is devised based on the self-healing gate capable of discharging a small amount of electrolyte by contact pressure (fig. S3, D and E).

At an RH of 40%, the CM is nonconductive (36) with an electrical resistance of 109 ohm·cm (Fig. 2A). At RHs between 60% and 80%, the electrical resistance slowly decreases to 1.0 × 105 ohm·cm in a stepwise manner (35). At an RH of approximately 85%, the CM thickness markedly expands to 22 ± 1 μm and resistance significantly decreases to 5.2 × 104 ohm·cm (Figs. 1D, ii, and 2A). This electrical resistance level, which is lower by roughly four orders of magnitude (1.9 × 104 times) compared to the initial value, is conveniently the same level as that of a conductive gel (CG). At RHs ≥85%, the resistance reaches saturation level (Fig. 2A).

Long-term conductivity and electromechanical stability under bending deformations are critical requirements for applications in skin electronics (11, 12). When investigating the ionic conductivity of the CM (swollen for 8 hours), the CM exhibits considerably improved electrical properties (Fig. 2, A and B). In particular, the conductivity value of approximately 9.23 × 10−5 S/cm was approximately four times higher than the value of CG (fig. S10) (37). In addition, the electrical conductivity of the CM was studied in a bending experiment: Bending by up to 1.0 mm (fig. S3G) yields no observable change in conductivity, whereas a 2.0-mm bending radius showed a decrease by approximately 2%. Long-term stability of the CM was evaluated by measuring the conductivity during 10,000 repeat bend-and-release cycles at RH >90% (fig. S3F). The conductivity remained unchanged even after 10,000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 3.0 mm (Fig. 2C). The findings provide evidence of the excellent flexibility and durability of the CM.

In vivo and in vitro biosafety test data of the CMs are essential for biosensor applications (1, 13). Multiple dermatologic tests are required, including in vivo animal testing, in vitro cell culture, proliferation analysis, and skin biosafety testing. A representative image of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained tissue around the implant site of the CM could establish the absence of inflammatory responses (Fig. 2G). In vitro, most human keratinocytes on the CM were alive and spread uniformly. Furthermore, the CM showed excellent cell viability compared to the control samples (Fig. 2H and fig. S1H). These results confirm that the CM can be used for biosensors without any biosafety issues.

Electrochemical stability was also assessed. During the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test, contact impedances of CSs maintained an average of ≤6.0 kilohms at frequencies ranging from 10−1 to 103 Hz (Fig. 2D). The CSs also showed a level of phase stability similar to that of GSs. Furthermore, in the open circuit potential (OCP) test of polarization voltage stability, average equilibrium potentials of Ag/AgCl and CS oscillated at a similar small magnitude (fig. S4, C and D). The findings indicate that the structures of CS have a negligible effect on the polarization voltage.

In general, the performance of biosensors is only considered reliable and robust when it generalizes across a wide range of experimental paradigms and individuals with different skin and hair types, lengths, and scalp properties (7). Homeostatic CSs have a homeostatic function based on the diffusion-based self-regulation and the self-healing gate–based releasing mechanism to quickly construct a conductive path on any normal skin and maintain it continuously. To demonstrate this robustness, we measure high-quality EEG at low impedances of approximately 10 kilohms (fig. S4, E to G) on both Westerners and Asians, independently of individual differences in the thickness and density of hair. Specifically, the evaluation of the CSs comprises 52 individuals with dense hair layers, including women with long hair, and overall, a highly sensitive conductive interface with a grand average impedance of 8.18 ± 5.1 kilohms is observed (table S1).

The impedance stability for long term is important because the measurement period for high-quality EP signals depends on the impedance stability (38). In the average results of an 8-hour continuous recording daily for 7 days, during 1-hour monitoring, both CSs and GSs provided high-quality EEG data (Fig. 3, D and E), with a very low impedance (6.64 ± 0.95 and 6.90 ± 1.06 kilohms, respectively) and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (Fig. 2E and fig. S5E). There was no significant difference in the two-sample test (P = 0.5866). Power spectral density (PSD) and spectrogram detected clear alpha rhythm features at approximately 10 Hz for both sensors (Fig. 3F and fig. S5, F and G).

After 8 hours, high-quality EEG measurements were still obtained with the CSs with a very low impedance (5.71 ± 2.44 kilohms) and high SNR (6.41 ± 2.58), similar to the initial value. In contrast, only low-quality EEG measurements were obtained using the GSs, with a high impedance and low SNR (Figs. 2E and 3E and fig. S5E). The difference in the two-sample test was highly significant (P = 0.0001).

Variation in the impedance of CSs over an 8-hour period was very small (2.09 ± 1.39 kilohms), whereas that in the impedance of GSs was excessively large (Fig. 2F). In spectrogram analysis, the CSs still displayed clear alpha rhythm patterns, which were not detected anymore with the GSs (Fig. 3F and fig. S5G). These findings confirmed that CS maintained unprecedented sensitivity with high temporal resolution of brain activities for a long time.

The effect of artifacts associated with relative motion depends on how intimate the interface between the sensor surface and skin is (1, 2, 7). We analyzed the influence of the stability of the homeostatic interface on the occurrence of severe artifacts by repeatedly detaching the sensor from the scalp (Fig. 3A and movie S2) (39). The initial impedance of CS was, on average, 5.78 ± 1.87 kilohms, which increased slightly to an average of 6.67 ± 1.76 kilohms after a total of 180 detachments for nine individuals (Fig. 3C). However, the impedance of GS exceeded 100 kilohms after only seven detachments, and further measurements in our system were impossible. An analysis was performed of the recovery time needed for successful remonitoring of normal EEG. When the detached sensor was reset on the skin, the average recovery time of CSs was 2.04 ± 0.65 s (Fig. 3B). A recovery time could not be determined for GSs following few detachments (fig. S7). The findings confirm the reliable stability of homeostatic CSs against severe artifacts.

Accurate measurements of EP signals of the central and peripheral nervous systems are in general use for medical diagnosis (2). Thus, we performed simultaneous as well as single measurements (12) of EP signals to demonstrate the accuracy, reliability, and broad usability of the proposed biosensor. In the single measurements, the CSs clearly captured EP signals (Fig. 3G, i) similar to those of GSs (Fig. 3G, ii, and fig. S6, A to C).

Multichannel decoding analysis of EEG and ECG measured simultaneously from the CSs in the awake state could clearly reveal the appearance of a beta wave in the EEG (40), and ECG-generated waveforms of approximately 0.77 s associated with cardiac systole-diastole cycle (Fig. 3, H and I) (41). In the drowsy state, as to be expected, alpha activity was captured in EEG (40), and the ECG waveforms became longer with cycles between 0.87 and 0.89 s [Fig. 3, H and I, and fig. S8; ECG cycles in the drowsy state were, on average, 0.07 ± 0.04 s longer than those in the awake state; (41)].

In the EEG time domain analysis of movement intention (fig. S6D), movement-related cortical potentials (42), which reflect cortical processes in movement planning and execution, were clearly generated approximately 1.5 s before EMG onset (Fig. 3J). The potential began to decrease negatively approximately 0.3 s after the cue sound and returned to baseline after a peak negativity at approximately 0.8 s, all in line with neurophysiological literature. These findings show exemplarily a usefulness of CSs enabling accurate simultaneous recording of EP signals across various human cognitive states.

Noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) (3–6, 31), which measure EEG related to brain activities using sensors placed on the scalp and process the signals using machine learning (43–45), provide a direct communication pathway between a brain and external devices. In the motor imagery (MI) paradigm (46, 47) (fig. S6E), grand average event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization (ERD/ERS) patterns (43, 46, 47) were clearly generated from C5 and C6 of the CSs (Fig. 4A). In addition, the ERD/ERS pattern changes appeared according to topographic maps of certain intervals (45). In case of the SSVEP (steady-state visually evoked potential) paradigm that allows the transfer of information for control by decoding frequency-locked brain states (fig. S6F) (46), the PSD was significantly activated at target frequencies (12, 8.57, 6.67, and 5.45) (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Text).

Monitoring faint EP signals that are easily obscured in dynamic environments that encompass various types of environmental noise, body noise, movement artifacts, and sensor misalignment is a very challenging issue (1, 5, 48). As a robustness test of our novel biosensor, we perform SSVEP paradigms while the volunteer pedals an exercise bike (Fig. 1E and movie S1) (49). Without the use of artifact removal algorithms and an abrasive skin preparation gel, the CSs were able to continuously maintain low impedances and a decoding accuracy of SSVEP (Fig. 1E, ii). Furthermore, the SNR of alpha rhythms somewhat increased on the sweaty scalp (50). This effect occurs because the CSs have a stable equivalent circuit model against a sudden change in skin conductivity, such as that caused by sweat secretion, and the variation in CS impedance within a 4 to 8 pH range is very small (1.0 ± 1.1 kilohms) (fig. S9 and Supplementary Text) (51). The homeostatic interface thus has established itself as very stable and robust in dynamic environments, forming more intimate contact with the skin through sweat (fig. S1B and Supplementary Text).

Last, computer games are used as a further demonstration of BCI as they are inherently safe and attractive to a layperson (6). Thus, we applied the CSs to a real-time BCI avatar control game established as a benchmark for our previous real-world BCI competitions (Fig. 4C) (6). Eight users successfully completed the avatar race in a reasonable average time of 177.83 ± 32.52 s using the classifiers trained by deep learning (52) (see Supplementary Text and movie S3). These findings establish that the CSs are able to continuously and robustly capture high temporal resolution brain patterns as a robust measurement basis for a subsequent real-time application system.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabe7432/F1.large.jpg,"['impedance', 'cellulose', 'ep', 'leafinspired', 'homeostatic', 'skin', 'cs', 'cm', 'biosensors', 'css', 'signals', 'fig', 'eeg']",

NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - Brazilian sugar production should fall sharply in the new season that started in April, as unfavorable weather continues to hurt sugar cane growth across the center-south region, Asian commodities trader Wilmar WLIL.SI said on Tuesday.

Wilmar expects Brazil's center-south cane crop to fall to 530 million tonnes in 2021/22, compared with 605 million tonnes in the previous season, with sugar production dropping to 31 million to 33 million tonnes from 38.5 million tonnes.

The trader's projection is the smallest among traders and analysts so far. Most were expecting lower sugar production in Brazil after the record set in the last season, but most estimates were around 35 million tonnes.

Raw sugar prices jumped more than 3% in New York this morning, underpinned by bad weather for crops in Europe and in Brazil.SOF/L

""We flag the possibility of a further reduction in our crop forecast should rainfall not improve quickly continuing the period of water stress for the crop,"" Karim Salamon, head of sugar market analysis at Wilmar, said in a note.

The company also projected a sharp reduction in ethanol production in Brazil's center-south in 2021/22 to 23 billion to 25 billion liters, from 27.8 billion liters in the previous season.

Salamon said that with a potential recovery in transport fuel demand and ethanol consumption expected in 2021, there may be an ethanol deficit of more than 5 billion liters.

""It is likely that sugar and ethanol have to compete (with) each other fiercely as we are heading toward a global shortage of sugar equivalent (sucrose) by nearly 12 million tons,"" the analyst added.

In 2003, three American college friends set out for Uganda. As they traveled through the north of the country, they were so moved by the suffering caused by the conflict between the government and the warlord Joseph Kony that they started an NGO called Invisible Children to spread awareness about the crisis and raise money for relief projects. Their work eventually drew the attention of Shannon Sedgwick Davis, a young Texas lawyer and CEO of the Bridgeway Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Bridgeway Capital Management, a multibillion-dollar hedge fund with investments in oil, pharmaceuticals, and consumer products. For years, Davis had been troubled by the limitations of charity, which she likened to “putting Band-Aids on bullet holes.” In January 2009, she was nursing her 1-month-old second child when she read a report from Human Rights Watch, a Bridgeway grantee, about a series of massacres committed by Kony’s forces. Having fled Uganda, they’d stormed through a cluster of hamlets in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, abducting children and killing their parents. Davis was so outraged that she resolved to seek a new approach to Bridgeway’s work. Documenting atrocities would no longer be enough. The foundation would now endeavor to stop them, militarily.

Davis funded Invisible Children to lobby the Obama administration to pass the 2010 Lord’s Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, which called for the development of a military strategy to end the crisis. She then flew to Uganda and persuaded the country’s senior military commanders to host a contingent of US Special Forces troops to help them track Kony down. After Invisible Children’s YouTube video “KONY 2012”—in which cofounder Jason Russell explains why Americans need to take a stand against Kony—was retweeted by Rihanna, Oprah, and other stars and watched by over 100 million people in six days, Congress swiftly passed a series of bills that allocated more funding to the joint US-Uganda mission to kill or capture Kony.

That mission failed, and after the Pentagon had spent more than $780 million on it, President Donald Trump quietly shut it down in 2017. But now the Bridgeway Foundation appears to be luring the Biden administration into another, far more dangerous Central African venture on the basis of evidence that may have been extracted under torture, or at least the threat of it. As the Kony mission was winding down, Laren Poole, one of Invisible Children’s founders and now chief operations officer of Bridgeway Foundation, formed a relationship with officers from Uganda’s security forces who’d been warning for years that a Congo-based rebel group known as the Allied Democratic Forces, or ADF, received weapons and training from radical Islamist groups and was planning to turn a swath of central Africa into a caliphate.

Scholars who have studied Congo’s enormously complex violence have long been skeptical about Uganda’s claims, but in March, Bridgeway’s Poole, in collaboration with researchers from George Washington University’s Program on Extremism, released “The Islamic State in Congo,” a report claiming that the ADF has aligned itself ideologically with the Islamic State and was receiving material assistance from the group. Later that month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken designated the ADF—or ISIS-DRC, as the State Department calls it—a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The label opens up Pentagon funding lines that could be used to train and equip the Congolese military to fight the rebels. US troops, recently deployed to help the Mozambican army go after rebels allegedly linked to the IS, could be pulled in to pursue the ADF as well.

Most of the new information in the Bridgeway/George Washington University report is based on interviews carried out by Bridgeway staff and Ugandan officials with alleged ADF members. But Ugandan security forces are notorious for kidnapping and torturing Ugandans, including opposition supporters, writers, and even a legislator. For years, a unit within Uganda’s Chieftancy of Military Intelligence known as the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force—whose director appears to be involved in Bridgeway’s research—has also been kidnapping and torturing Ugandan Muslims and forcing them to confess to belonging to the ADF. Why is Bridgeway, a foundation that claims to be working to end crimes against humanity, involved with one of Africa’s most ruthless security agencies? And is the Pentagon preparing to inflame yet another dangerous foreign quagmire on highly dubious grounds, even as it tries to extricate itself from Iraq and Afghanistan?

The ADF was created in Uganda during the 1990s by Muslim youths who were angry about the corruption of Uganda’s strongman leader Yoweri Museveni. After Ugandan forces attacked the group’s training camps, it fled into the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, eventually settling down in Beni territory, home to an unexploited oil field on the edge of a region rich in gold and coltan, a material used in computer chips. For years, the ADF operated as a sort of local mafia in Beni territory. It carved out settlements in the forest; planted bananas, coffee, cassava, and rice; excavated small gold mines; harvested timber; and ran shops, pharmacies and transport businesses. The ADF could be fierce—forcing locals to work for it and killing or kidnapping those who crossed it or failed to pay their bills—but, at least until 2011, local Congolese tended to view it as less wantonly destructive than the notoriously corrupt Congolese army. But after Congolese and UN forces launched a series of assaults on the ADF, first in 2005, and then in 2010, 2013–14, and 2019, the group committed gruesome reprisals, murdering soldiers and villagers and kidnapping children, much as Kony did in Uganda.

As the ADF crisis escalated, the Ugandans amplified their warnings about the group’s links to militant Islam. Then, in 2019, the story took a dramatic turn when ADF leader Musa Baluku pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and the IS began claiming credit for attacks believed to have been committed by the ADF. Later that year, officers from the US Africa Command, or AFRICOM, met with senior officers from the armies of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi to plan a possible anti-ADF offensive. Current Issue View our current issue

Those who study the region were apprehensive. United Nations investigators have been unable to find evidence that the ADF’s operations had significantly changed since 2019, or that the group had received significant material assistance from the Islamic State. In pledging allegiance to the IS the ADF may be reaching out for solidarity with other beleaguered Islamist groups who see themselves as victims in the West’s War on Terror—which they see as a war on Muslims; the IS, in claiming credit for ADF attacks, may similarly be attempting to aggrandize itself as it loses ground in Iraq and Syria. In its messaging to local communities, the ADF has made it clear that its attacks would stop if government forces withdrew. This suggests that the ADF’s aim—unlike that of the IS—is not to conquer territory and establish Sharia law but to be left alone. In any case, only about 2 percent of Congo’s population is Muslim; convincing millions of Christians to live under Sharia law seems unrealistic, even for a group as ambitious as the Islamic State.

Around the time the Kony mission was closing down, Bridgeway’s Poole began working with Ugandan authorities to gather more information about the relationship between the ADF and the IS. Much of this effort involved interviewing former ADF members, some of whom may have been granted amnesty by the Uganda government, which often involves cash payments in exchange for collaboration; others were apprehended in Uganda, allegedly carrying out errands for the ADF, or were caught attempting to cross the border to join the group. Most of the new information in the Bridgeway/George Washington University report is based on these interviews, and summaries of some of them leaked to journalists. Sources told the interviewers that the ADF runs a strict Sharia program with penalties such as the cutting off of hands and beheadings for adulterers; some spoke of shady money transfers from Turkey, Kenya, and the UK. Others described a vast recruiting network throughout eastern Africa. One said he’d transported mysterious chemicals for the group, whose purpose he didn’t know.

Some of the interviews with ADF informants were carried out by staff from Bridgeway and another nonprofit called the Virunga Fund; others were conducted by Ugandan officials reporting to “DCT,” the official Ugandan abbreviation for “director of counterterrorism.” The DCT heads the notoriously brutal Joint Anti-Terrorism Taskforce, a unit within Uganda’s Chieftancy of Military Intelligence. The summaries of the Ugandan officials’ interviews conclude with the words, “For Interrogation,” or “For Joint Interrogation” in bold type. At first glance, it’s not obvious what this means—unless you know something about the methods of the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force.

Since 2006, the Joint anti-Terrorism Taskforce has been arresting and torturing Muslims inside Uganda and forcing them to sign confessions saying they are working secretly with the ADF. Poole, Davis, and US State Department officials should know this, because in 2009, Human Rights Watch documented 106 such cases, and there have been many more since. Typically, a suspect would be apprehended by armed men—sometimes uniformed, sometimes not—and then thrown into a vehicle, blindfolded, and driven to what Ugandans call a safe house but is actually a state-run torture chamber. Suspects were then ordered to draft confessions, and if they refused—as most did, having no idea what the officers were talking about—were beaten with whips, canes, chairs, shoes, and other objects. Some were electrocuted, others doused in water; some were forced into stress positions so they couldn’t sleep, and some had chili peppers rubbed into their eyes. Several of these “ADF suspects” were killed, including Saidi Lutaaya, according to a nurse at the hospital where he died. Another nurse told Human Rights Watch that Lutaaya “had a hole in his foot and the bone of his lower leg was out.” He’d also clearly been hit in the head with a hammer, and blood was oozing out of his body.

Uganda’s foreign aid donors largely ignored these abuses. In 2014, both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized Museveni for signing a harsh anti-homosexuality law, which was quickly overturned. When Human Rights Watch released its 2009 report on the torture of ADF suspects, the State Department noted it in its annual Human Rights report, but nothing was said publicly. During the Obama years, Museveni’s regime would receive billions of dollars in aid, including $270 million in military assistance.

This blind-eye diplomacy is probably explained by Uganda’s long-standing security relationship with the United States. In 2006, Museveni was the first African leader to volunteer troops to the African Union-sponsored—but largely US- and European Union–funded—mission against Al Shabab in Somalia, and Ugandans also serve under US command in Iraq, reducing the Pentagon’s reliance on American soldiers there.

So the torture continued. Beginning in 2015, a spate of high-profile murders occurred inside Uganda. Masked men on motorcycles assassinated a senior prosecutor, a senior police officer, and several Muslim sheiks. In the aftermath of each killing, dozens of Muslim men were rounded up and accused of masterminding the murders on behalf of the ADF. But when the defendants arrived in court, they claimed to have been tortured.

The purpose of the torture is unknown, but it may have to do with Museveni’s interest in gathering fake evidence to persuade the international community that the ADF’s dastardly plans justify continued support of his regime. It’s also worth noting that the ADF operates on territory Museveni may want to control. In 2006, around the time the Joint Anti-Terrorism Taskforce began rounding up Muslims, the Irish exploration firm Tullow struck oil in western Uganda, just over the border from Beni. Uganda’s reserves are estimated to be worth billions of dollars, but the oil is thick and waxy, and pumping it to the East African coast for export will require a heated pipeline, whose construction will be considerably more cost effective if it carries oil from linked reserves on the Congo side of the border. Eventually, Tullow sold its stake in Uganda to the Franco-American oil company Total, which has conducted seismic testing in precisely the area of Beni territory where most of the violence over the past decade has been concentrated. Since 2016, the French military has also been training the Ugandan army in mountain warfare techniques along the border with Beni, purportedly to defend against terrorists, including the ADF.

In their “Islamic State in Congo” report, Poole and co-authors claim that all their interview subjects were treated well, but they don’t explain how they can be so sure none were bribed, tortured, or threatened with torture. And Bridgeway did not respond to multiple interview requests. Its report also displays remarkable naïveté about their Ugandan partners. For example, it describes a dramatic 2018 Ugandan security force raid on Kampala’s Usafi mosque where ADF suspects were allegedly stockpiling weapons. But Ugandan newspapers report that many Ugandans viewed the raid as a sting operation designed by Ugandan spies to lure gullible dissidents into joining what they thought was the ADF. The Usafi mosque had for years been run by a quiet, scholarly imam who was replaced, against the wishes of many of its members, by the far more radical Abdul Rahman Faisal, who openly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, urged all Muslims to help build the caliphate in Congo, and proclaimed that anyone who hadn’t killed a non-Muslim wasn’t a real believer. Faisal even criticized Museveni on the mosque loudspeaker, an offense that is typically met with jail, torture, or worse. This went on for years. Related Article The US Turns a Blind Eye to Uganda’s Assault on Democracy Helen C. Epstein

“I have no doubt in my mind that Abdul Rahman Faisal has been working with the state,” a senior sheikh told a Ugandan reporter, a view shared by numerous other sources. But in their report, Bridgeway’s Poole and colleagues describe the Usafi mosque as if it were a real ADF cell.

The ADF has certainly been responsible for many atrocities, but much of the violence attributed to it, including at least one instance described in the Bridgeway/George Washington University report, was almost certainly carried out by other armed groups, and Congolese army officers have themselves led massacres that were blamed on the ADF. The mayhem is so bewildering that even seasoned Congo experts can’t agree on what’s going on.

Most organizations working in developing countries deliver health services, build schools, or advocate for human rights. But Bridgeway’s unusual approach is in line with ideas advanced by supporters of muscular humanitarianism around the turn of the 21st century who claimed that some atrocities, such as genocide, are so evil that they justify an armed response. In 2005, the United Nations unanimously endorsed this concept, calling it the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P.

The problem with R2P is that it doesn’t include a prior obligation to understand the conflicts waded into. What might look from Washington, D.C., or Texas like a simple contest between good and evil will inevitably be a more complicated fight on the ground. This is something the Pentagon should have learned the hard way in Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on.

Washington would make the best use of international aid dollars if it stopped pouring money into the coffers of corrupt and manipulative dictators like Museveni, spent less on meddling in conflicts it doesn’t understand, and urged nonprofits like Bridgeway to go back to health care, education, and reporting human rights abuses, no matter who commits them.","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FARDC-soldier-gt-img.jpg,"['bridgeway', 'uganda', 'nations', 'ugandas', 'report', 'search', 'ugandan', 'state', 'forces', 'adf', 'congo', 'islamic', 'bewildering']", 
22,22,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Earth Day: Go Green with Clean Energy ETFs - Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/earth-day%3A-go-green-with-clean-energy-etfs-2021-04-21,"In the spirit of Earth Day, investors can turn to environmental responsibility-themed exchange traded fund strategies.

Environmental responsibility refers to our responsibility to use natural resources carefully, minimize damage, and ensure these resources will be available for future generations. Creating a sustainable environment means tackling global issues surrounding climate change, biodiversity, water stress, and toxic spills and releases, to name just a few.

For example, according to ETF Database, ETFs can be ranked based on their exposure to sustainable impact solutions. An ETF's exposure to sustainable impact solutions is the portfolio-weighted average of each company's percent of revenue generated by sustainable impact solutions goods and services. Sustainable impact solutions exclude revenue from companies with negative externalities, which are very severe and severe ESG controversies. Sub-categories include ESG Ratings of CCC and B, direct involvement in predatory lending, involvement in controversial weapons, generating more than 5% revenue from conventional weapons or firearms, and realizing more than 10% revenue from alcohol or tobacco production.

The top ETFs based on sustainable impact solutions percentages include:

Investors can also look to clean energy ETFs, which invest in stocks of companies involved in providing goods and services exclusively to the clean energy industry. The largest broad clean energy themed ETFs include:

The growing popularity of socially responsible investment strategies continues to grow unabated. In response to the rising demand within the investment community, money managers have come out with countless new strategies to help investors target sustainable market sectors.

For instance, among the new launches in 2021, Global X has launched the Global X Clean Water ETF (AQWA), which tries to reflect the performance of the Solactive Global Clean Water Industry Index. AQWA seeks to invest in companies advancing the provision of clean water through industrial water treatment, storage and distribution infrastructure, as well as purification and efficiency strategies, among other activities.

BlackRock also recently launched two active sustainable ETFs for the transition to a low-carbon economy. The BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTU) and the BlackRock World ex U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTD) invest in large- and mid-cap companies. BlackRock systematically overweights or underweights individual companies relative to their benchmark based on their low-carbon economy transition readiness score for the two new funds.

The two BlackRock ETFs seek to outperform their benchmarks over the long-term by investing in companies that may be better-positioned for the transition to the low-carbon economy. To capitalize on the energy transition, BlackRock’s Sustainable Investing unit has developed and managed a proprietary strategy with institutional investors since 2018.

23,23,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Nigeria Police Contingent in Somalia - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104270193.html,"SOME Nigerians have been raising concerns over the despatch of a contingent of 144 officers of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, to terrorism-wracked Somalia to help in efforts to stabilise security and restore the rule of law and order.

Their grouse is that this is ironically coming at a time that the police force is perceived as displaying gross inability to protect the lives and property of our people. They also cannot understand why with the myriads of security challenges posed by Boko Haram in the North East, bandits of the North West and parts of North Central, armed herdsmen in the Middle Belt and entire South and the emerging menace of the Unknown Gunmen in the South East and South-South, Nigeria is still playing the African Big Brother and sending a police contingent to Somalia.

To underscore the shortfall in police personnel, the new Inspector General of Police, Usman Baba Alkali, has only recently asked the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to return all its officers from the rank of Chief Superintendent of Police, CSP, and above attached to it due to ""operational requirements"".

It simply means that the Force is mopping up officers posted outside its framework at this trying time that police personnel are being targeted and killed and its stations destroyed by some aggrieved hoodlums in the East.

We, however, do not see anything wrong or unusual in the Federal Government authorising the sending of our police contingent to Somalia to assist in efforts to restore order. The group is part of the African Union's Mission in Somalia, AMISOM.

According to Daniel Ali Gwambal, the contingent's Coordinator, apart from mentoring the Somali Police Force, SPF, the contingent will also help to conduct patrols, man checkpoints, perform guard duties and engage in general policing.

This is in tune with Nigeria's obligation as a foremost member of the African Union, to play leading roles in promoting peace, stability and progress on the African continent.

The Nigerian contingent is just one among others drawn from countries throughout the continent.

Nigeria has always performed this sacred role through the police and armed forces since independence.

No matter the challenges we are facing in terms of security, 144 personnel less for the short period they will be away should not undermine our internal crime control efforts.

Besides, exposure to international assignments such as the AMISOM mission is a prerequisite part of the training and experience that our policemen require to have in order to enrich their capacity to perform their constitutional mandates back home.

We hope that the officers focus strictly on their professional call of duty and promote Nigeria's image as they usually do while on international duties. We also hope they return home better than they left.

Micrometer- and nanoinclusions with facets (Figs. 1, F and G, and 2) strongly suggest the presence of original fluid; facets formed from irregular interface (Fig. 1E) by dissolution and precipitation of calcite in fluid make the interfacial energy smaller, and finally, negative crystals (Fig. 1G) are formed. The calcite-water interface with the minimum energy is {104} based on atomistic simulations (13) and is different from {001} observed in the present inclusions (fig. S2). This could be due to the CO 2 -bearing fluid, which may change the interfacial energies. Sulfate grains (fig. S3) might precipitate in such a fluid. Fluid easily escaped from inclusions along cleavages and/or twin boundaries by mechanical disturbances during the long history of the meteorite (~4.5 billion years). Large faceted pores along calcite-matrix boundaries (P in B-B′; Fig. 1D) might also have originally been fluid-filled. Nanosized inclusions have a good chance to preserve fluids because of their small size and large numbers, although the probability is not large because we found fluid only in one inclusion among the seven examined samples.

The origin of CO 2 in the CO 2 -bearing fluid is probably (1) oxidation of organics and (2) CO 2 ice (1). The former contribution should be very small because strong oxidants are required and the maximum amount of CO 2 is expected to be only ~0.1 weight % (wt %) in CCs (1). In addition, the degree of thermal metamorphism of the present sample is so low that the formation of a sufficient amount of CO 2 is not expected from organics. In contrast, CO 2 ice was abundant in the early solar system and is one of the major C-bearing molecules in comets (CO 2 /H 2 O ~0.03 to 0.3) (14).

The observed CO 2 ice and/or CO 2 hydrate assemblage is reasonable at temperatures <~218 K with the molecular CO 2 /H 2 O ratio >~0.15 based on the phase diagram of CO 2 -H 2 O (9), indicating that the CO 2 /H 2 O ratio of the fluid is ~0.15 or larger. Selective escape of H 2 O and enrichment of CO 2 in fluid inclusions in terrestrial quartz have been reported (15). However, this possibility can be eliminated because we did not observe any void in the inclusion (Fig. 2C). The mean CO 2 /H 2 O ratio of ice originally present in CCs was estimated to be 0.012 for 45 CM chondrites (Sutter’s Mill not included) from the 13C/12C ratio of carbonates (calcite and dolomite) (1). However, this ratio is dependent on the assumption of the isotope ratios of CO 2 ice and an unknown C-source. The large CO 2 /H 2 O ratio (>~0.15) is appropriate at least for Sutter’s Mill ice because the ratio is based on the phase diagram (9).","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabg9707/F1.large.jpg,"['primitive', 'chondrite', 'altered', 'fluid', 'ratio', 'present', 'carbonaceous', 'ice', 'based', 'large', 'aqueously', 'bearing', 'h', 'co2bearing', 'inclusions', 'fig', 'discovery']",

Science ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Heising-Simons Foundation.

Since she fell ill with COVID-19 around Thanksgiving, Pamela Furr has been waiting for her old self to return. A radio news anchor in Tennessee for more than 10 years, she now sometimes finds herself stuck midsentence grasping for simple words; she is prone to forget events and conversations if she doesn’t write them down. “I’m not the same person that I was before COVID,” she says. “I kind of miss me.”

The true prevalence of cognitive problems in COVID-19 survivors is elusive, and the underlying causes of lingering symptoms are the subject of ongoing studies. But it’s now clear that trouble thinking, concentrating, and remembering can be among the most debilitating “long-haul” symptoms and can persist for months. As more and more people seek help to overcome their brain fog at clinics set up for post–COVID-19 care, researchers and physicians are turning to treatments developed for stroke and traumatic brain injuries. And a few are setting out to test cognitive training video games they hope will expand the reach of therapy.

“Even if it’s a fairly small percentage [of survivors] who report cognitive problems, the number of overall people in that category … represents a tremendous problem,” says James Jackson, a clinical psychologist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine’s ICU Recovery Center, where Furr will participate in a support group for COVID-19 long haulers.

Cognitive impairment is common after serious illness. It’s among the symptoms of a condition called post–intensive care syndrome that can follow the isolation, immobility, and sedation of a hospital stay. And severe COVID-19 can itself damage the brain during its acute phase. SARS-CoV-2 may rarely invade brain tissue directly; most neurological damage is thought to stem from the indirect effects of infection, such as inflammation, stroke, and lack of oxygen.

“I’m not sure that what we’re seeing post-COVID is different” from impairments after other serious respiratory illnesses, says Faith Gunning, a neuropsychologist at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM). She and colleagues reported in February that of 57 recovering COVID-19 patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation before hospital discharge, 81% had cognitive impairment. Most experienced problems with attention and executive function, which includes skills like planning, organization, and multitasking.

And such symptoms aren’t limited to people who wound up hospitalized. The majority of people visiting post–COVID-19 outpatient clinics had a relatively mild acute phase of illness, says Igor Koralnik, a neurologist at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. He oversees the Neuro COVID-19 Clinic at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, which has seen more than 400 patients since it opened in May 2020. Among the first 100 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections whose symptoms lasted at least 6 weeks, 81 experienced “brain fog,” the most common neurologic symptom, Koralnik’s team reported last month in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology .

After brain injury, cognitive rehab typically involves testing to identify cognitive weaknesses and training to help patients navigate daily life. Often, the focus is on compensating for deficits, not eliminating them outright. Jackson’s team at Vanderbilt recommends a rehabilitation program called goal management training, originally developed to manage impairments after stroke, traumatic brain injury, or age-related decline. It trains patients in “metacognitive skills” such as observing their own thought processes, identifying situations where they’re prone to make cognitive errors, and reflecting on how to approach a new task.

It can be “a game changer” for patients, Jackson says. He expects such training to benefit people with post–COVID-19 impairments—but only if their primary care physicians refer them as they would people who had a stroke or traumatic injury. For now, that happens rarely, he says.

Any time you’re developing a treatment, you need to understand the mechanism. But we can’t afford to wait. We need to do something now. Ana-Maria Vranceanu, Harvard Medical School

Complicating matters for doctors is that the nature of the injuries is often far from clear. “We don’t really know what happened to them,” says Serena Spudich, an infectious disease neurologist at the Yale School of Medicine. When cognitive dysfunction appears after mild COVID-19, it raises the possibility that an immune response that was protective in the acute phase has become overactive and triggered continuing inflammation, she says. Spudich leads a study using brain imaging along with analyses of spinal fluid and other biological samples to look for signs of inflammation and other abnormalities in patients with persistent post–COVID-19 neurological symptoms.

There are other possible explanations for cognitive impairments. “Things like sleep and exhaustion, pain and stress and depression—all of these nonneurological issues also play a role in our cognitive functioning,” says Renee Madathil, a rehabilitation neuropsychologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Cognitive impairments rooted in depression or stress aren’t any less “real” than those caused by direct injury to the brain, Madathil and others stress. But different causes may call for different therapies.

“Any time you’re developing a treatment, you need to understand the mechanism,” says Ana-Maria Vranceanu, a clinical health psychologist at Harvard Medical School. “But we can’t afford to wait,” she adds. “We need to do something now.” In prepandemic studies of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors, her team found that elevated emotional distress spelled a slower recovery. Her team developed a training program to help ICU survivors and their families manage distress, anxiety, and depression, which she aims to adapt for COVID-19 recovery.

To help people who neither live near rehabilitation centers nor have access to specialists, a few researchers are exploring a newer category of potential treatments: cognitive training through video games played at home.

In response to what he calls “a tsunami of patients with Long COVID,” Radboud University Medical Center professor of surgery Harry van Goor, with Radboud physical therapy researcher Bart Staal, is testing a virtual reality platform and a set of games that involve physical activity, cognitive skills, and mindfulness. A pilot study in 48 people recovering from COVID-19 suggests the puzzlelike cognitive games were highly motivating, the researchers say; they next hope to launch a controlled trial of the approach versus traditional rehab.

Meanwhile, Jackson’s team at Vanderbilt and Gunning’s at WCM are gearing up to test a “digital treatment” developed by Akili Interactive, which last year became the first company to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a video game as a prescription therapy.

The technology, so far approved for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), “is not just a blunderbuss approach” to treat any condition that involves cognitive dysfunction, says Anil Jina, Akili’s chief medical officer. Instead, it’s designed to improve attention—for example, by having players multitask to collect items in the game while avoiding obstacles. A study of more than 300 children with ADHD published last year showed that those who played the game showed greater improvements in computerized attention tests and on parent and clinician assessments than those who used an educational video game.

Gunning’s study, set to launch next month, aims to include 100 participants who have lingering cognitive deficits after COVID-19; Jackson’s group expects to include more than 50 people with such symptoms. In both studies, half the participants will be assigned to 6 weeks of at-home play. Half will serve as controls but will have access to the game after the assessment is complete.

The brain-training industry has a checkered reputation when it comes to science. In 2016, Lumos Labs, the company behind the popular program Lumosity, agreed to pay the Federal Trade Commission $2 million to settle false advertising charges after promoting its games as a way to stave off Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions without adequate evidence.

In studies of cognitive decline accompanying aging, puzzles and cognitive games haven’t proved as effective as physical activity and an active social life, Vranceanu notes. “If you’re doing Sudoku, you’re getting good at Sudoku,” she says, “but that doesn't necessarily translate to you getting better at not misplacing your keys.”

And in rehabilitation, the transfer of skills from games and exercises in the clinic to everyday life “does not occur easily,” cautions Edward Taub, a behavioral psychologist at the University of Alabama, Birmingham (UAB). He and UAB rehabilitation psychologist Gitendra Uswatte are recruiting post–COVID-19 patients with cognitive impairment to a small pilot study of “constraint-induced cognitive therapy,” based on techniques Taub and colleagues first developed to help patients after strokes. It includes a video game that challenges a player’s processing speed, as well as training on daily activities, such as making a shopping list or organizing medications, and monitored homework to help patients apply skills from the game to their lives.

Jackson knows brain training has its limits. But he argues that emerging evidence supports its value for building attention and processing skills, which he suspects are at the heart of many post–COVID-19 patients’ impairments.

Spudich, too, says she would welcome a web- or app-based attention-training game to help patients take charge of enduring COVID-19 symptoms against which they feel powerless. “Frankly, I think those things will make a difference on outcomes, even if they’re not proven in a clinical trial,” she says. “The hopelessness people feel in this situation is really palpable.”","Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/main_brainfog_1280p.jpg?itok=dIrfXM8k,"['fog', 'treatments', 'cognitive', 'causes', 'help', 'game', 'search', 'brain', 'inspires', 'skills', 'patients', 'covid19', 'training', 'symptoms', 'games']",

With at least 34 million people said to be one step away from famine, and hundreds of aid organisations warning this week that “these people are not starving, they are being starved”, the stakes couldn’t be higher as the UN builds towards its first-ever Food Systems Summit.

Conference organisers and participants hope the September gathering will dramatically transform the production and consumption of food, helping the world learn how to feed itself in a way that is less ineffective, less unequal, and less environmentally destructive.

At a glance: What's in store?

First world summit ever to look at farm-to-fork food issues due in September.

It aims to tackle the converging pressures of food consumption, food production, and climate change.

The role of agribusiness at the gathering is already under fire.

Humanitarian actors are being urged to widen their “lens”.

Consultations are underway on a broad-based approach before a July pre-summit.

The idea, they say, is to look at the interlinked issues of food insecurity, climate change, and conflict through a “food systems” lens, examining topics from famine to obesity, from degraded lands to depleted oceans.

The main event will take place – in person, it is hoped – on the sidelines of UN General Assembly meetings in September, but a three-day “pre-summit”, scheduled for July in Rome, is expected to set the tone and ambitions for those discussions.

The landmark summit comes against the backdrop of growing hunger around the world, with food prices rising, job losses soaring, and a widening gap between humanitarian funding and needs.

More than 250 aid groups and civil society organisations assisting people facing hunger in hotspots around the world called this week in an open letter to global leaders to “act now” and come up with $5.5 billion in emergency food assistance funding.

“These girls and boys, men and women, are being starved by conflict and violence; by inequality; by the impacts of climate change; by the loss of land, jobs or prospects; by a fight against COVID-19 that has left them even further behind,” the letter said.

Agribusiness takeover fears

The run-up to the event has been marred by tensions around the aims, the main players, and the anticipated outcomes. Some farming organisations and human rights groups, accusing others of a “corporate takeover”, are calling for a boycott and saying they are making plans for parallel discussions. Some food-focused NGOs are also sceptical and want more details.

“What is the main goal of the summit and what would be the outcome? So far, we do not have any concrete elements,” Pauline Verrière, head of the food systems and climate crisis division at Action contre la Faim (ACF), told The New Humanitarian. “We are really afraid the summit is driven by [the] private sector, with technical solutions, especially regarding agriculture.”

Technology-based solutions that benefit bigger farms and companies shouldn’t be the only options on the table, said analyst and summit adviser Olivier De Schutter.

“For small-scale farmers working in the most difficult environments, with weak connections to markets, those technologies will deliver much less and we need other solutions for them,” said De Schutter, co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food).

Critics say that if agricultural technology is unchecked, less affluent farming communities could lose their “food sovereignty” – control over the way food is produced, traded, and consumed – to private corporations. This could further impoverish farming families who already struggle to make a living.

Agnes Kalibata, the summit’s special envoy, denied that agribusiness is running the summit behind the scenes.

The process, Kalibata told The New Humanitarian, is meant to build “stronger, healthier, more inclusive, nutritious, and resilient food systems” over the next decade that could change the lives of nearly 700 million people who are going hungry, and reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions.

Farmers and civil society organisations make up about a third of the groups leading the summit’s five work streams, while the rest are academics, researchers, government representatives, and youth organisations.

A new crunch, a new lens

Global hunger levels have been rising since 2014, and things are getting worse.

“Never before have we faced a humanitarian crisis of this magnitude,” Cathy Bergman, director for food security and nutrition at Mercy Corps, told The New Humanitarian. “Extreme poverty is on the rise for the first time in two decades… We may well see a historic decline in peoples’ abilities to feed themselves and their families in the months and years to come.”

“Between COVID-19, protracted conflicts, and the seemingly unstoppable march of the climate crisis, food production and distribution is being affected in ways we’ve never seen before.”

After years of decline, the World Bank expects the number of people living in extreme poverty to have risen by at least 143 million by the end of 2021 due to the pandemic. Food needs dominate the costs of humanitarian funding appeals, and the UN has said one in 33 people worldwide require humanitarian assistance this year, the highest in decades.

Meanwhile, the world’s food systems are responsible for 34 percent of the global emissions heating up the planet, according to a recent study by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and the FAO, the UN’s food and agriculture agency.

“Between COVID-19, protracted conflicts, and the seemingly unstoppable march of the climate crisis, food production and distribution is being affected in ways we’ve never seen before,” Bergman said. “The global community needs to get serious about taking a different approach.”

The five “action tracks”

Ensure access to safe and nutritious food for all.

Shift to sustainable consumption patterns.

Boost nature-positive production.

Advance equitable livelihoods.

Build resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stress.

A “food systems” approach looks at all the interlinked issues rather than just farming or trade.

“Food production impacts water consumption; water consumption impacts energy interests; energy issues impact labour; labour impacts health; health impacts productivity, and so-on,” explained Chris Hegadorn, secretary of the Rome-based Committee on World Food Security (CFS), a UN grouping.

The summit is organised around five interconnected themes. These include: ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all; and building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stresses. Experts such as De Schutter and Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) in Bangladesh, have been assigned to lead consultations and dialogues that have been going on since late last year.

“I’m not a food systems person,” said Huq, who co-chairs the resilience track. “I’ve been working on communities and countries most vulnerable to climate change and, as it happens, they are almost the same in terms of vulnerability to food systems and to COVID-19.”

Shifting humanitarian responses

Using a food systems approach also means aid agencies combatting food insecurity would need to shift their focus, said Christophe Bene, Colombia-based senior policy expert with the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.

The image of poor, isolated farmers and communities going hungry because they cannot produce enough food is incomplete and outdated, said Bene, who led a recent study on COVID-19’s impacts on hunger. “Even a community in the valley of Afghanistan… they also depend on the local food system to produce, transport, supply that food.”

Mercy Corps’ Bergman said any summit would be “toothless” unless it came up with commitments to instigate systemic change in food systems, accountability for such commitments, and mechanisms to measure progress.

Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, said aid agencies need to make the right to food more central in guiding humanitarian assistance, for example by building supply chains that are fair, transparent, and support local markets and food producers. He also said they needed to be watchful of the long-term implications of emergency food aid.

“Famine has always been a problem of political failure, not lack of food, unavailable food or inadequate supply,” Fakhri told The New Humanitarian. “The issue is never a matter of supply. It's always a matter of politics.”

A difficult beginning

As well as allegations that agribusiness is in the driving seat, the choice of Kalibata, a former Rwandan agriculture minister, as summit envoy has come under fire. One critic accused her of having pushed Africa towards unsustainable and environmentally-damaging agricultural practices as president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA).

Farmers’ group La Via Campesina (LVC), meanwhile, commented that the summit had been prompted by the World Economic Forum, “a private sector organisation representing global corporate interests”, instead of an intergovernmental decision.

“This summit – the way it has been launched, developed, promoted – it’s not the space or conversation that we think would go in the direction we are putting forward,” said Paula Gioia, a small-scale farmer from Germany and member of LVC’s International Coordination Committee.

“The issue is never a matter of supply. It's always a matter of politics.”

In February, the Civil Society and Indigenous Peoples’ Mechanism (CSM), a group of more than 500 organisations, including LVC, laid down conditions for their participation. Martin Wolpold-Bosien, coordinator of the CSM Secretariat, said in an email, “The CSM cannot jump onto a train that is heading in the wrong direction.”

Verrière from ACF, which is also part of the CSM, said the process has not been inclusive, and pointed to the lack of translation of documents and at events as a small but concrete example. “Not every organisation has the capacity to have people who are able to follow such discussions in English,” she said. “It could be seen as a detail, but actually it's really important.”

Groups such as CSM fear the summit will not adequately address the role corporations play in causing many of the current problems in food systems, said Fakhri.

Kalibata welcomed the opportunity to meet with the CSM: “The ideas and opinions of so many women, youth, Indigenous groups, civil society groups, and many vulnerable or marginalised communities have been historically ignored and overlooked,” she said. “The summit cannot change the past, but it can help to shift us into a better, more inclusive course for the future.”

‘Innovative format’

These pre-summit disagreements have received plenty of attention, but both De Schutter and Fakhri stressed that they don’t necessarily denote failure.

“It's not a bad thing that the summit organisers and participants have this external pressure,” said De Schutter. “It places the bar high, as it should be,” and strengthens the hand of those within the process to push for more progressive solutions, he added.

“My worry is if, after the summit, one of the new relationships that comes out is that the business sectors have more control over the agenda of the food systems,” warned Fakhri.

Both expectations and fears are running high, and there is suspicion on all sides, not least because the summit is embarking on an “innovative format”, according to ICCAD’s Huq.

Instead of government representatives negotiating over a text, they are holding dialogues at national, regional, and international levels and soliciting solutions from everyone.

“The premise is that the negotiation between governments has already been assumed to have been completed with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris [Climate] Agreement, so it's about looking at how to build on those agreements in terms of actions and things to do,” Huq said.

“We do listen to the governments, but the governments don't tell us what to do. We also have to listen to farmers, fishers, [the] private sector… and a variety of different stakeholders, which is what we have been doing,” he added. “Hopefully, [the outcome] will be a set of interesting and new ways of doing things and new coalitions of people. If we can pull it off, it will be a game-changer.”

(Paris) – French police summarily expel dozens of unaccompanied children to Italy each month in violation of French and international law, Human Rights Watch said today.



To enable the returns, the police frequently record on official documents different ages or birth dates than the children declared. The authorities have also summarily returned adults, including families with young children, without telling them they had a right to seek asylum in France.



“The French border police have no legal authority to decide who is and who is not under 18,” said Bénédicte Jeannerod, France director at Human Rights Watch. “Instead of making snap judgments based on appearance or caprice, border police should refer young people to child protection authorities for appropriate care.”



In late November 2020, Human Rights Watch interviewed six unaccompanied children pushed back to Italy who said they had told French police they were under 18. In every case, even though the children stated their age and in some cases offered documentary evidence, the French authorities had recorded birth dates to suggest they were adults. Human Rights Watch also spoke with 27 adults who had been summarily expelled from France. None of the children or adults interviewed were told by French authorities that they could seek asylum in France.



Human Rights Watch also conducted in-person and remote interviews between November 2020 and April 2021 with volunteers and staff of aid groups, lawyers, and others working on both sides of the French-Italian border.



Many of these returns take place at the border crossing between Menton, a French town about 30 kilometers from Nice, and the Italian town of Ventimiglia, on the Mediterranean coast. Police take children and adults found to have entered France irregularly to the French border post at the Saint-Louis Bridge and direct them to walk across to the Italian border post.



Such experiences are common, nongovernmental groups working on the French-Italian border told Human Rights Watch. Staff with Diaconia Valdese and WeWorld, Italian organizations that provide legal support for migrants in Ventimiglia, said they see such cases nearly every day.



In the first three weeks of February 2021, volunteers with Kesha Niya, a community kitchen in Ventimiglia offering meals and the opportunity to recharge phones to people who have been expelled from France, recorded accounts from more than 60 unaccompanied children who said they had been pushed back from France. The staff also recorded at least 30 such accounts from children in each of the previous three months, as well as in March and April.



In each case, the children showed them entry refusal forms on which French police wrote false birth dates. Human Rights Watch viewed many of these forms, including for two Sudanese boys who gave their ages as 17 and 16, but whose ages French police listed as 27 and 20 respectively.



People apprehended in the evening, including children, are often detained overnight in one of three prefabricated units, each about the size of a shipping container, before being pushed back to Italy. Children and adults said they were often hungry and cold in these cells.



The close quarters offer no possibility for the social distancing advised by French Covid-19 public health guidance. French authorities do not provide detainees with masks or other protective equipment, children and adults interviewed said.



Some children and adults also said the French police did not return all of their belongings before expelling them, including documents, phones with contact information, and, in a few cases, money.

The Conseil d’État, France’s highest court for matters of administrative law, acknowledged in an April 23 decision that conditions of detention in the prefabricated units were “likely to undermine human dignity” but concluded that this risk did not meet the high legal bar required to order their immediate closure.



French law allows border police to use an expedited procedure known as “refusal of entry” to return people arriving from Italy while intra-EU border controls are in effect. France reestablished EU border controls in November 2015, just before a series of bombings and shootings in Paris killed 131 people.



Because Italian border agents do not accept unaccompanied children, French border police should transfer unaccompanied children to French child protection authorities. French border police are obligated to offer anyone, including unaccompanied children, the option of applying for asylum in France if they so request.



Groups working in Ventimiglia said that French authorities pushed back between 80 and 120 people each day between July and the end of October, including both adults and children. When Italy and France imposed renewed restrictions on movement in late October in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of summary expulsions fell to an average of 50 to 70 per day, they said. In the months since, the groups have seen considerable variation in daily expulsion numbers, with summary expulsions exceeding 100 on some days. Unaccompanied children are among those pushed back nearly every day, they said.



The French government has received repeated warnings in recent years that pushbacks frequently breached French law and international human rights law. In October, a joint report by Amnesty International and 10 other nongovernmental organizations found numerous cases in which French police wrote incorrect birth dates on entry refusal forms and then expelled youths who told police they were under age 18.



France’s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights has also documented police use of false birth dates to expel unaccompanied children from Menton to Ventimiglia. French courts have on occasion ordered police to allow children to reenter France upon finding that officials had written false birth dates on expulsion documents.



French authorities should direct border police to comply with French law and accept a person’s declared age if there is a reasonable possibility that the person is a child. They should be transferred to the care of French child protection authorities.



French authorities should also ensure that border detention facilities for adults meet minimum human rights standards, including by providing conditions that are safe, sanitary, and consistent with human dignity. Unaccompanied children and families with children should not be detained in border cells.



Italian authorities should ask people pushed back from France if the information on their entry refusal documents is accurate and should offer those who state they are under 18 and unaccompanied the option of transfer to the care of Italian child protection authorities or return to France to be placed in the care of the French child protection system, Human Rights Watch said. The Italian authorities should also ensure that anyone pushed back from France, adults as well as children, have food, shelter, clothing, and necessary medical care while they are in Italy.



“Detention conditions in Menton’s border cells are abusive for people of any age. For children, they can be traumatizing,” Jeannerod said.

The Human Rights Watch researcher interviewed migrant children and adults in English, French, and Italian, according to their preference, assisted in some cases by a translation application. For instance, a 17-year-old Somali boy answered questions verbally in English after hearing the questions in English and reading them in Somali; similarly, Human Rights Watch checked its understanding of the account given in English by a man from Azerbaijan by using the application to translate follow-up questions into Russian. All names of children have been changed to preserve their privacy.

The prefecture of the Alpes-Maritimes department, which oversees the border police in Menton, did not respond to Human Rights Watch’s request for comment on these findings.



French Police Falsify Birth Dates



Asif F., 17, from Pakistan, said that he had registered as under 18 with Italian authorities in Sicily. “When the French police stopped me, I said I was underage,” he said. Nonetheless, French police wrote his date of birth as 2000 – three years earlier than the date he gave them – on the entry refusal document, held him overnight, and then expelled him.



Two Afghan boys, both 15, said that French police recorded their ages as 18 and 19, then sent them back to Italy. Tawfiiq M., 17, from Somalia, said French police disregarded his efforts to explain that he was not an adult and wrote on his entry refusal form that he was 20. Human Rights Watch viewed the entry refusal forms for two Sudanese boys who gave their ages as 17 and 16, but saw that French police had recorded as 27 and 20.



Such cases are common, Human Rights Watch heard. Costanza Mendola of Diaconia Valdese, the legal assistance group in Ventimiglia, said that her organization had recorded more than 50 summary expulsions of unaccompanied children in October, “almost all with false dates on the refus d’entrée.” WeWorld, the other legal assistance organization interviewed, has also documented such cases.



In the first half of November, volunteers with Kesha Niya, the community kitchen, which operates daily at a roadside site near the border post, saw at least 14 unaccompanied boys who said they were between 14 and 17. Among them, one from Côte d’Ivoire, another from Guinea, the third from Sudan, and the fourth from Tunisia said they had registered in Italy as under age 18 but that Italian authorities did not check the database after French police summarily expelled them. Three boys from Côte d’Ivoire said French police disregarded the photos of their birth certificates they showed. Two others said the police did not return their birth certificates before summarily expelling them.



Over three days at the end of November, Kesha Niya volunteers saw 12 unaccompanied boys who gave their ages as under 18. One group of six Afghan boys said French border police did not return documents showing that the boys had given their ages as under 18 to authorities when they arrived in Austria. The other boys – from Côte d’Ivoire, Iran, and Sudan – all said that French police wrote down inaccurate birth dates on their entry refusal forms.



Kesha Niya volunteers saw at least 30 unaccompanied children a month in December, January, February, March, and April who had been summarily expelled from France. On a single day in late February, volunteers spoke with 9 unaccompanied boys who had been summarily expelled that morning.



Groups working in Ventimiglia began to see significant numbers of such summary expulsions after January 2018, when rulings of the Nice Administrative Tribunal found that French border police were not observing child protection safeguards. That year, the Association for Legal Studies on Immigration (Associazione per gli Studi Giuridici sull’Immigrazione, ASGI), Diaconia Valdese, and Oxfam described the summary expulsions of unaccompanied children as “systematic.”



Human Rights Watch has documented such practices elsewhere along the French-Italian border, but not with the frequency reported in the Alpes-Maritimes department.



Italian authorities have sometimes checked their database to verify whether a person registered as a child upon arrival. In such cases, they have refused to accept the child from French authorities. In one case, however, when Human Rights Watch accompanied a WeWorld representative to the Italian border station to notify them that a child had been improperly expelled, the officer in charge said that they treat as accurate the date of birth French authorities provide unless the person has a birth certificate or other proof of age.



Jacopo Colomba, a legal adviser with WeWorld, said: “Most of the time when we take a minor back to the [Italian] border station in cases like this one, the police agree to do a fingerprint check. They’ve taken the minor back to the French side if the fingerprint search shows he registered [in Italy] as underage. After Covid, though, we’ve seen a change. They often refuse to check the database.”



Although there is no obvious reason why the pandemic would affect Italian authorities’ ability to check their database, Colomba said that they seemed to use Covid-19 as a pretext to refuse.



If efforts like these are unsuccessful, lawyers in France have obtained court orders directing French police to accept unaccompanied children whom they have previously expelled. The legal process can take several weeks.



Because children do not always give their true ages on arrival in Europe, verification of age through the Italian database alone is insufficient. For instance, Jamal I., a 17-year-old from Sudan, told Human Rights Watch he said he was an adult when he arrived in Italy, believing that he would be able to travel and work more easily if authorities believed he was 18. Others may give incorrect answers or be misunderstood if authorities interview them without competent interpreters.



Locked Up Overnight in Crowded Cells Without Food



After 7 p.m., when Italian border officials stop accepting those who are refused entry to France, French officials hold people apprehended and transferred to Saint Louis border station overnight. Adult men are held in prefabricated “modular units,” temporary structures about the size of shipping containers. France’s Inspector General of Places of Deprivation of Liberty observed during a 2017 visit that the modular units were each 15 square meters (160 square feet).



Women and children, including unaccompanied children, should be held in a separate cell inside the border station, but boys whom French police deem to be adults spend the night with adult men. Tawfiiq M., a 17-year-old Somali boy, said he spent most of the night in a detention cell for adult men. “They didn’t give us any food,” he said, adding that he spent much of the night in tears from the stress of being locked up with men he did not know.



Describing the detention cells for adult men, a 19-year-old Tunisian man said: “It’s cold. There’s not much food. There’s no place to sit.” A 29-year-old man from Mali said, “It’s like you imagine a bank vault might be. It’s not big. There were at least 20 of us inside. There’s not enough space to be able to keep apart, there is no possibility of social distancing. It is not safe.”



“Young people can spend up to 13 hours in this place, with no blankets, no beds, no lights at night, no electrical outlets to charge phones,” said Zia Oloumi, a lawyer based in Nice. “On average, people spend five-and-a-half hours in this place, deprived of their liberty and without any knowledge of their rights.”



“When they are detained, there is no interpreter and no information about rights,” said Emilie Pesselier, who follows developments at France’s borders with other EU countries for the nongovernmental organization Anafé. “If they ask to call a lawyer or a relative, ask for medical care, ask to seek asylum at the border, most of the time these requests are ignored.”



Children and adults held in the detention cells said they did not receive medical care when they requested it, and other groups said the same thing. “People who ask for doctors or lawyers can’t see them,” said Agnès Lerolle, who manages Cafi, a joint migrants’ rights initiative of Amnesty International, La Cimade, Médecins du Monde, Médecins sans Frontières, and Sécours Catholique.



“If they want to get medication from their own luggage, they can’t get access to it,” a Kesha Niya volunteer said. A November 30 Nice Administrative Tribunal order noted the lack of access to medical care for people held in the cells, among other shortcomings.



A 2018 review of the Menton border cells by France’s Inspector General of Places of Deprivation of Liberty observed that both the prefabricated units and the room for women and unaccompanied children “do not benefit from basic equipment (lighting, heating, air conditioning, chairs, mattresses, blankets).” Similarly, a 2018 briefing paper by ASGI, Diaconia Valdese, and Oxfam noted that adults and children had been detained “in crowded conditions, without food or water, without blankets or mattresses, without any information on what is happening” before their expulsion to Italy the next morning. France’s National Consultative Commission on Human Rights called for the closure of the prefabricated units in 2019.



From the accounts Human Rights Watch collected, little appears to have changed in the intervening years. A November video of the interior of one of these cells viewed by Human Rights Watch and subsequently posted on Kesha Niya’s Facebook page shows people seated and lying on metal benches with no blankets or mattresses, conditions corresponding with the inspector general’s 2018 observations.



A Nice Administrative Tribunal judge ruled in July 2017 that people should not be detained for more than four hours in the prefabricated units, the maximum time allowed under French law for authorities to hold a person to verify identity. The Conseil d’État, France’s highest court for matters of administrative law, upheld this finding. “These are not lawful places of detention for longer periods. Juridically speaking, they are a black hole,” said WeWorld legal adviser, Colomba.



In an apparent effort to avoid having to apply the court ruling, the French authorities now describe the cells as places of “shelter” (mise à l’abri) rather than of detention. This euphemistic sleight-of-hand is legally baseless, said Zia Oloumi, the lawyer in Nice, an assessment shared by other lawyers who spoke with Human Rights Watch. “At the end of the day, we can plainly see that it is detention,” said Pesselier, of Anafé. “The people held there are not free to leave.”

“For people who are in a fragile psychological state, detention in these conditions can be especially hard,” Lerolle said.



French Police Confiscate Documents, Phones, Money



Human Rights Watch heard from six adults who had been summarily expelled from France that French police did not return their identity documents. Their accounts are consistent with other reports of similar experiences.



A 21-year-old Nigerian man who had applied for asylum in France said that when French police apprehended him as he returned from a short visit to Italy, “the police took my letter showing I had an asylum case.”



“It’s quite common for French police to take these papers,” said Colomba. “We also hear that French police have taken identity cards and residence permits from Italy and other EU countries.” Amnesty International, Anafé, La Cimade, Médecins du Monde, Médecins sans Frontières, Secours Catholique, and other groups have also reported confiscation and destruction of identity documents by French police in and around Menton.



Four people, including one 17-year-old boy, said that the police had confiscated and failed to return their phones, money, or other personal possessions. In one such case, an adult man from Azerbaijan said the French police took his money and phone when they apprehended him while he was walking along the train tracks between Ventimiglia and Menton. “The phone had all my contacts,” he said.



Limited Services for Migrants in Ventimiglia



A reception center in Ventimiglia managed by the Red Cross, the Roya camp, stopped accepting new arrivals in May 2020 to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The camp closed in July. Since that time, children and adults who are pushed back to Italy have often had to sleep on the streets in Ventimiglia.



The limited services for migrants in Ventimiglia are largely initiatives of religious or humanitarian groups. A shelter for families with children operates in a building owned by the local Catholic parish. Kesha Niya’s community kitchen is a volunteer initiative supported by donations. Save the Children and Caritas opened a day center for unaccompanied children and families at the end of February.



Consistent with the human right to an adequate standard of living and the recommendation of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers that states “should recognise, in their law and practice, a right to the satisfaction of basic material needs of any person in a situation of extreme hardship,” Italy should ensure that children and adults summarily expelled from France have access to adequate food, shelter, clothing, and medical care, including in Ventimiglia.



Exceptional Border Checks; Refusal of Entry



Free movement within the European Union means, in principle, that people who travel between Italy and France are not subject to border checks. But France reestablished border controls in November 2015, just before attacks in Paris killed 131 people. The authorities initially justified these controls as a precautionary measure in advance of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. They have regularly renewed border controls at six-month intervals since then, using other rationales. People found to be in France irregularly may be subject to an expedited procedure, “refusal of entry” (refus d’entrée), if they are stopped by police within 10 kilometers of the border with another EU member state while the reintroduction of land border controls is in effect.



A reform of the immigration and asylum laws in September 2018 eliminated a procedural protection known as the jour franc, which gave people detained at or near the border for immigration violations a day to seek legal assistance before their expulsion.



In addition, French authorities can conduct immigration checks within 20 kilometers of a land border with another EU member state as well as at international train stations, marine ports, and airports. People found to be in France irregularly should not be refused entry if they are more than 10 kilometers from the border, but French authorities can apply a separate “readmission process,” under a contested bilateral agreement between France and Italy known as the Chambery agreement, to send them to Italy. All of those interviewed appeared to have been expelled under the entry refusal process.



The entry refusal process relies on the legal fiction that people who are on French territory within 10 kilometers of the border have not “entered” France, much in the same way that French law considers people detained at French airports to be in “transit zones” (zones d’attente) awaiting legal entry to France, even if they are transferred to hospitals or hotels. In theory, people who are refused entry have the right to request asylum in France.



Prior to February 2018, French police turned people back without following any procedure. After the inspector general of places of deprivation of liberty recommended in September 2017 an “immediate end” to what she concluded were “illegal practices of refoulement [forcible return],” the prefecture ordered that anyone apprehended for possible immigration violations must be taken to the Saint-Louis border post for an investigation and, if warranted, the issuance of an entry refusal document.



Before refusing entry, authorities should issue a written refusal to a person found to be in France irregularly, using a language the individual understands, and should inform the person of the right to seek asylum and the right to appeal the refusal of entry, among other rights. Children may be refused entry, but they should be appointed a guardian. This protection does not appear to be observed in practice.



Under the EU Asylum Procedures Directive and the EU Dublin III Regulation, unaccompanied children who have applied for asylum in France should not be returned to Italy. In addition, unaccompanied children with family members in France have the right to family reunification under the Dublin III Regulation, meaning that those children should also not be returned to Italy.



In July 2020, the Conseil d’État, France’s highest court for administrative matters, confirmed that people who request asylum should not be refused entry until their asylum applications can be considered.



The children and adults interviewed by Human Rights Watch were not informed of their right to seek asylum, nor were they afforded an opportunity to do so. “People who say they want to apply for asylum are turned away in the same way as everybody else at the border,” said Mireille Damiano, a lawyer in Nice. “In the overwhelming majority of cases, the police response is that people coming from Italy should have applied for asylum in Italy,” she said.



“In practice, nobody is able to claim the right to asylum,” Lerolle said.","Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2021/05/202105crd_france_migrantchildren.jpg,"['watch', 'rights', 'italy', 'expelling', 'children', 'border', 'unaccompanied', 'france', 'french', 'human', 'migrant', 'authorities']",

29,29,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,DEAD-box helicases modulate dicing body formation in Arabidopsis - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabc6266,"Eukaryotic cells contain numerous membraneless organelles that are made from liquid droplets of proteins and nucleic acids and that provide spatiotemporal control of various cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation and rapid stress-induced alterations of these organelles are relatively uncharacterized. Here, we investigated the roles of DEAD-box helicases in the formation and alteration of membraneless nuclear dicing bodies (D-bodies) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We uncovered that RNA helicase 6 (RH6), RH8, and RH12 are previously unidentified D-body components. These helicases interact with and promote the phase separation of SERRATE, a key component of D-bodies, and drive the formation of D-bodies through liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPSs). The accumulation of these helicases in the nuclei decreases upon Turnip mosaic virus infections, which couples with the decrease of D-bodies. Our results thus reveal the key roles of RH6, RH8, and RH12 in modulating D-body formation via LLPSs.

In this study, we explored the new components of D-bodies and analyzed their roles in D-body formation. We found DEAD-box helicases RH6 (RNA helicase 6), RH8, and RH12 as previously unidentified components of D-bodies that modulate the formation of D-bodies and demonstrated that D-body accumulation decreases upon viral infection. Our results reveal the key roles of DEAD-box RNA helicases in modulating the formation and stress-induced dynamics of D-bodies and potentially other membraneless organelles.

An important nuclear membraneless organelle in plants is the dicing body (D-body), in which microRNAs (miRNAs) are processed ( 13 ). D-bodies contain at least three key components: the ribonuclease (RNase) III enzyme DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), the double-stranded RNA binding protein HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1), and the zinc-finger protein SERRATE (SE). Increasing amounts of evidence show that, in addition to their crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development, miRNAs are involved in plant antiviral defense ( 14 ). For counterdefense, viruses have evolved RNA silencing suppressors that inhibit host small interfering RNA and/or miRNA biogenesis and functional machinery, including D-body components ( 14 – 16 ). The constitutive expression of some RNA silencing suppressors in transgenic plants leads to developmental aberrations resembling mutants with hypomorphic mutations in D-body components ( 17 , 18 ). These observations indicate that viruses may generate phenotypes resembling D-body mutants by interfering with D-body accumulation. However, the molecular mechanism of D-body formation and the dynamics of D-body accumulation upon stress treatments are still poorly understood.

Viruses are obligate intercellular pathogens that produce a massive amount of viral RNAs and proteins in a short time, which causes severe cellular stresses to cells that they invaded. Viral RNAs and proteins are targeted by host membraneless organelles to attenuate virus proliferation. Triggered by viral infection and other environmental stresses, SG, a translationally silent membraneless organelle, deactivates the translation of the majority of mRNAs to conserve nutrients and energy for cell survival ( 6 – 9 ). Upon viral infection, SGs also sequester proteins that are critical for viral replication and translation ( 6 ). Likewise, P-bodies are cytosolic membraneless organelles that are normally required for mRNA storage and translation repression ( 10 ) and degrade viral RNAs to confer virus resistance upon viral infections ( 6 – 8 ). To achieve a robust and productive replication, viruses have evolved different strategies to repress the formation and function of membraneless organelles ( 6 – 9 , 11 ). For example, some viruses encode proteins that interact with nucleator of SGs, such as Ras-GAP SHB domain-binding proteins (G3BPs), through the Phe-Gly-Asp-Phe (FGDF) motif to block SG assembly ( 12 ). Viruses can also inhibit P-body assembly by degrading or dispersing P-body components ( 8 , 9 , 11 ). However, for most membraneless organelles, the nature of their dynamics upon viral infections and the corresponding functions of the virus-induced alterations have not been determined.

In addition to membrane-bound organelles, such as nuclei, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes, eukaryotic cells contain numerous membraneless organelles, such as nucleoli, Cajal bodies, processing bodies (P-bodies), and stress granules (SGs). It has been proposed that the components of membraneless organelles with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) control the formation of these membraneless organelles through liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPSs) ( 1 , 2 ). For example, yeast DEAD-box RNA helicases Dhh1 and Ded1 drive the formation and turnover of P-bodies and SGs through LLPS in yeast ( 3 – 5 ). Lacking a lipid-rich barrier, membraneless organelles are highly dynamic macromolecular assemblages that can quickly form, undergo turnover, and exchange contents with the cellular milieu or other membraneless organelles in response to stress ( 1 ). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying and functional consequences of the rapid formation and turnover of most membraneless organelles remain elusive, especially those that occur in response to various biotic or abiotic stresses.

RESULTS

Plant homologs of Dhh1/DDX6 are novel components of D-bodies To identify novel components controlling the assembly of D-bodies, we analyzed D-body–associated proteins via immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) (IP-MS) in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–tagged HYL1 (HYL1-YFP) (13). In addition to HYL1, a total of 81 unique proteins were detected in the IP fractions of HYL1-YFP samples but were absent in the fractions of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged hemagglutinin (HA) controls (table S1). Among these proteins, RH6, RH8, and RH12 were particularly interesting, as they are homologs of yeast Dhh1 and human DEAD-Box Helicase 6 (DDX6) (fig. S1 and tables S1 and S2) and Dhh1 is known to control P-body assembly and turnover in yeast (3, 5). To test whether RH6, RH8, and RH12 are novel components of D-bodies, we first verified the physical associations of these three DEAD-box helicases with D-bodies. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays between RH6, RH8, or RH12 with the three key known D-body components HYL1, DCL1, or SE were first performed. Strong granular YFP signals were detected in the nuclei of Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells coexpressing RH6-cYFP, RH8-cYFP, or RH12-cYFP with DCL1-nYFP, HYL-nYFP, or nYFP-SE but were absent in epidermal cells coexpressing these helicases together with histone 2A (H2A) control proteins (Fig. 1A and fig. S2, A to B). Notably, these fluorescent granules resemble D-bodies (13). We also analyzed the colocalization of RH6 and RH8 together with HYL1 in the root tip elongation cells of 1-week-old A. thaliana transgenic seedlings stably expressing pRH6::RH6-3FLAG/pHYL1::HYL1-YFP or pRH8::RH8-3FLAG/pHYL1::HYL1-YFP. Immunofluorescence assays with FLAG and HYL1 antibodies showed that both RH6 and RH8 colocalized with HYL1 in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). In N. benthamiana epidermal cells, transiently expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)–SE also colocalized with RH6-HA–cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), RH8-HA-CFP, and RH12-CFP as punctate structures in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). The interactions of RH6, RH8, and RH12 with DCL1, SE, and HYL1 were then validated by co-IP assays in N. benthamiana leaves. When RH12-FLAG was coexpressed with DCL1-YFP or 3HA-GFP, RH12 specifically coprecipitated with DCL1-YFP but not with 3HA-GFP (Fig. 1D). When IP with anti-FLAG antibodies RH12-CFP, RH6-HA-CFP, and RH8-HA-CFP was detected in the SE-FLAG and HYL1-FLAG fractions but not in the control Membrin 12 (MEMB 12)-FLAG fractions (Fig. 1, E to F, and fig. S2, C to F). These interactions were further validated in the leaves of 2-week-old A. thaliana transgenic plants stably expressing pRH12::RH12-3FLAG, which showed that RH12-3FLAG coprecipitated both SE and HYL1 (Fig. 1G). Direct interaction between RH12 and SE or HYL1 was evaluated by a pull-down assay using glutathione S-transferase (GST)– and 6×His-tagged recombinant proteins. A strong RH12 signal was detected from the GST-SE beads but not from the GST control beads, and a weak RH12 signal was detected from the GST-HYL1 beads (Fig. 1H). Together, these results suggest that RH6, RH8, and RH12 are previously unidentified components of D-bodies that physically associate with known D-body components. Fig. 1 Plant homologs of Dhh1/DDX6 are novel components of D-bodies. (A) BiFC analyses of N. benthamiana cells coexpressed with NLS-mCherry.

RH6, RH8, and RH12 are required for D-body formation Yeast Dhh1 and human DDX6, which are homologs of RH6/RH8/RH12, drive P-body assembly via LLPS (3, 5). This prompted us to investigate whether RH6, RH8, and RH12 also influence D-body formation. To this end, we first examined D-body dynamics on the basis of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) by bleaching the fluorescence of a punctate structure with a laser. In both N. benthamiana leaves that transiently expressed DCL1-YFP or RFP-SE and stable transgenic A. thaliana plants expressing HYL1-YFP, fluorescence signals of the bleached punctata rapidly recovered after photobleaching (Fig. 2A), suggesting that D-bodies are membraneless organelles that can quickly exchange contents with their surrounding cellular environment. Fig. 2 RH6/RH8/RH12 is required for D-body formation. (A) Representative images and fluorescence recovery curves of D-body components. Leaf epidermal cells of N. benthamiana (inoculated with DCL1-YFP/RFP-SE for 72 hours) and root tip cells (elongation region) of 1-week-old A. thaliana (pHYL1::HYL1-YFP) plants were analyzed. The region of interest is highlighted with a red circle. Scale bars, 2 μm. The intensity was normalized against the average prebleach fluorescence. n = 3 for each group.

Photo credit: Ningkun Liu, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. To determine the possible functions of RH6, RH8, and RH12 in the formation of D-bodies, A. thaliana transferred DNA (T-DNA) insertion mutants of these helicases were obtained (fig. S3, A and B). Of the three single mutants, only rh12-1 exhibited obvious developmental abnormalities, e.g., smaller plant size and rosette leaf, under neutral-day conditions (12-hour light and 12-hour dark photoperiod; Fig. 2B and fig. S3C). The rh6-1/rh8-2 double mutant exhibited no obvious phenotypic changes, whereas rh6-1/rh12-1 and rh8-2/rh12-1 produced relatively small leaves. To verify that the observed phenotypes are due to loss of function of these helicases, the rh6-1/rh12-1 double mutant was transformed with either pRH6::RH6-3FLAG or pRH12::RH12-3FLAG. Both RH6 and RH12 were able to reverse the developmental defects of rh6-1/rh12-1 (fig. S3, D to E). Likely because of embryonic lethality, we were unable to obtain homozygous rh6-1/rh8-2/rh12-1 triple mutant. Therefore, we generated transgenic plants expressing an artificial miRNA (amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12) that can simultaneously knock down all three genes (fig. S3, A to B). The resulting transgenic lines were substantial smaller than the double mutants and produced severely wrinkled and downward-curling leaves (Fig. 2B and fig. S3C) under neutral-day conditions. Under long-day conditions (16-hour light and 8-hour light photoperiod), the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 transgenic plants also exhibited strong developmental phenotypes, but the single and double mutants exhibited no obvious phenotypes (fig. S3, F to G). The accumulation of amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 in 4-week-old transgenic plants under neutral-day conditions was higher than that under long-day conditions, while the transcript levels of RH6, RH8, and RH12 and the protein level of RH12 are in opposite trends (fig. S3, H to J), suggesting that the enhanced phenotypes of amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 transgenic plants at neutral-day conditions are likely due to higher level of amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 expression. The roles of RH6, RH8, and RH12 in the formation of D-bodies were then determined in amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 transgenic plants. Immunofluorescence assays with DCL1 antibodies showed that nuclear D-bodies in the inflorescence cells were less frequently formed in the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 transgenic plants compared with the Col-0 wild-type (WT) plants (Fig. 2C). Similarly, nuclear D-bodies were eliminated in the root tip elongation cells of pHYL1::HYL1-YFP plants transformed with the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 construct (Fig. 2D and fig. S4A). In addition, YFP-SE signals became uniformly distributed in the leaf epidermal cells of amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12/pSE::YFP-SE transgenic plants, whereas they were unevenly distributed in the control plants (Fig. 2E and fig. S4B). These results suggest that the RH6/RH8/RH12 helicases are required for D-body accumulation. Since the transcript and protein levels of other D-body components (i.e., DCL1, HYL1, and SE) were not decreased in the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants (fig. S4, C to F), it is unlikely that these helicases facilitate D-body formation by regulating the abundance of other D-body components. Therefore, we reasoned that the RH6/RH8/RH12 helicases may play a more direct role in D-body formation.

RH6, RH8, and RH12 promote the formation of D-body via LLPS We then tried to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying RH6/RH8/RH12-mediated D-body formation. An in silico prediction using IUPred2A (19) indicates that RH6, RH8, and RH12 contain an IDR at their N termini (fig. S5A). FRAP assays were conducted in N. benthamiana plants transiently expressing RH6-HA-CFP, RH8-HA-CFP, or RH12-CFP. Both RH6 and RH12 are conspicuously localized in nuclear speckles, whereas RH8 displayed less puncta (Fig. 3A and fig. S5B). The RH6-HA-CFP, RH8-HA-CFP, and RH12-CFP signals quickly recovered after photobleaching, indicating that RH6, RH8, and RH12 proteins rapidly redistribute between membraneless speckles and the surrounding protein pools. To further determine the phase separation characteristics of these helicases, A. thaliana transgenic plants expressing RH12-eGFP under its native promoter (pRH12::RH12-eGFP) were generated (fig. S5C). The GFP signal of the RH12-eGFP (enhanced GFP) granules in the nuclei of root tip meristematic cells of 1-week-old pRH12::RH12-eGFP plants also quickly recovered after photobleaching (Fig. 3A and fig. S5D). Like Dhh1 and DDX6 (3), the RH6, RH8, and RH12 proteins purified from Escherichia coli cells phase-separated into liquid-like droplets following the addition of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (polyU) and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) (Fig. 3B and fig. S5, E to F). In contrast, RH12, RH6, and RH8 remained dispersed in the absence of RNA or ATP, indicating that these helicases at high concentrations can undergo phase separation in an RNA- and ATP-dependent manner in vitro. Fig. 3 RH6/RH8/RH12 drives D-body formation through LLPS.

In silico prediction via IUPred2A suggests that SE also contains long IDRs (fig. S5G). A recent study showed that SE contains an intrinsically unfolded region and undergoes degradation via the 20S proteasome to secure the functionality of folded and functional SE (20). Hence, we suspected that RH6, RH8, and RH12 may facilitate the phase separation of SE during D-body assembly. We purified prokaryotically expressed SE protein (fig. S5H) and tested its phase separation capacity in vitro. The SE proteins underwent phase separation in the absence of ATP and RNA (fig. S5I), and miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) promoted their phase separation in vitro (fig. S5J). A study published while this study was under review also reported the phase separation property of SE (21). In contrast, phase separation of RH12 is ATP and RNA dependent (Fig. 3B). The purified SE protein was then mixed with varied concentrations of RH12 protein in the absence of ATP. As expected, RH12 remained dispersed in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3C), whereas the size and number of SE droplets increased along with the amount of RH12, suggesting that RH12 promotes the phase separation of SE in the absence of ATP in vitro.

RH6, RH8, and RH12 promote the accumulation of miRNAs Given the important role of RH6, RH8, and RH12 in D-body formation and that D-bodies are where miRNA processing occur (13, 22), we hypothesized that these helicases may contribute to miRNA biogenesis. Therefore, we compared small RNA (sRNA) expression profiles between the aerial parts of 4-week-old amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants and Col-0 WT plants with two replicates each. After removing adapter sequences and low-quality reads, we obtained 13.5 million to 18.5 million clean sRNA reads for each of the four samples (fig. S6A). In total, 13,155,146, 11,955,793, 13,598,138, and 15,264,650 reads were mapped to the A. thaliana genome. After removing the reads that mapped to structural RNAs [ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)], 8,196,598, 7,350,497, 8,146,914, and 9,117,670 perfectly matched reads remained, representing 1,644,096, 1,449,140, 1,488,037, and 1,684,795 unique sequences, respectively (fig. S6A). The accumulation of sRNAs from each library was normalized to the number of reads per million. Both 21- and 24-nucleotide (nt) sRNAs accumulated to lower levels in the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants compared with the Col-0 WT plants (fig. S6B). Plant miRNAs typically start with a uracil (U) at their 5′ termini (23–25). sRNAs (21 nt) with a 5′-U were less abundant in the amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants than in the Col-0 WT plants (fig. S6C). The results of the miRNA profiling analysis (fig. S6D and table S3) and Northern blot of several well-studied miRNAs (Fig. 3D) further confirmed that malfunction of RH6, RH8, and RH12 inhibit miRNA accumulation. In addition, compared to Col-0 WT, the tested miRNA/miRNA* (the passenger strand of miRNAs) levels were also lower in rh6-1/rh12-1 and rh8-2/rh12-1 double mutants but not in single mutants or rh6-1/rh8-2 double mutants (fig. S6E). As expected, the transcriptional and translational levels of the miRNA target genes increased in the rh6-1/rh12-1, rh8-2/rh12-1, and amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants (fig. S6, F to G). miRNA genes are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as hairpin-containing primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs), which are subsequently processed by dicing complexes into mature and functional forms (22). The transcription and processing of plant pri-miRNAs are tightly coupled (22, 26, 27). To elucidate the mechanism through which RH6, RH8, and RH12 regulate miRNA biogenesis, the accumulation of pri-miRNAs in different genotypes was measured. The transcripts of examined pri-miRNAs were less abundant in rh6-1/rh12-1, rh8-2/rh12-1, and amiR-RH6/RH8/RH12 plants than in Col-0 WT plants but were not obviously altered in single mutants or rescued lines (Fig. 3E and fig. S6H). Chromatin IP (ChIP) coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were then performed with Pol II–specific antibodies in 2-week-old Col-0 WT and rh6-1/rh12-1 seedling plants. The association of Pol II with miRNA-encoding genes was attenuated in rh6-1/rh12-1 mutant plants (fig. S6I), suggesting that these helicases may facilitate the binding of Pol II to miRNA-encoding genes and promote the transcription of pri-miRNAs.

Accumulations of D-bodies and nuclear helicases decrease upon Turnip mosaic virus infection Viral infection often results in alterations of membraneless organelles, such as P-bodies, SGs, and small interfering RNA bodies (6–9, 11, 28). Therefore, viral infection provides an excellent opportunity to study the dynamics of D-bodies upon stress treatment. Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) is one of the most extensively studied members of the family Potyviridae, the largest family of plant RNA viruses (29). When N. benthamiana leaves were coinfiltrated with pDCL1::DCL1-YFP, p35S::RFP-SE, p35S::RH6-HA-CFP, or p35S::RH12-CFP together with TuMV (30), nuclear punctate structures labeled by DCL1-YFP, RFP-SE, RH6-HA-CFP, or RH12-CFP were significantly decreased (Fig. 4, A to C, and fig. S7, A to E). We also inoculated pHYL1::HYL1-YFP and pRH12::RH12-eGFP transgenic A. thaliana plants with TuMV or buffer. Nuclear punctate structures labeled by HYL1-YFP in A. thaliana root tip meristematic cells also significantly decreased in TuMV-infected plants (Fig. 4, D to E, and fig. S7F). In contrast to the localization patterns of RH12-eGFP in cells of 1-week-old A. thaliana roots (Fig. 3A and fig. S5D), RH12-eGFP in nuclei of 4-week-old A. thaliana roots were unevenly distributed, but punctate structures were rarely observed (Fig. 4D). The uneven distribution of RH12-eGFP in the nuclei of A. thaliana root tip meristematic cells decreased upon TuMV infection (Fig. 4, D and F). A time course further confirmed the decrease of D-bodies labeled by RFP-SE in epidermal cells of N. benthamiana leaves during TuMV infection (fig. S7, G to H). No significant alteration of the nuclear and perinuclear punctate structures was observed upon the infection of TuMV-GDD (31), a replication-defective clone of TuMV (fig. S8), suggesting that massive replication of TuMV per se is required for reduced D-body accumulation. Moreover, the infection of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV; another well-studied plant virus) did not significantly alter the punctate structures of these D-body components in nuclei, suggesting that the decrease of D-body accumulation is not an artifact of the viral infection process (fig. S9). Fig. 4 TuMV infection leads to decreased accumulation of D-bodies. (A to F) Diffusion of the punctate signals of D-body components in the nucleus. (A) N. benthamiana plants were coinoculated with buffer (Mock)/TuMV with DCL1-YFP/RFP-SE. Fluorescence was observed at 72 hpi.

(G and H) qRT-PCR analysis of selected pri-miRNAs in 6-week-old A. thaliana plants treated with Mock/TuMV. Systemic leaves were collected at 14 dpi. EF-1α was used as an internal control.

Student’s t test, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001; for the others, P ≥ 0.05. The decreased D-body accumulation upon TuMV infection intrigued us to study the function of TuMV on miRNA biogenesis. Similar to that in rh6/rh8/rh12 mutant plants (Fig. 3E and fig. S6H), pri-miRNA transcript levels but not control mRNA levels were decreased in the Col-0 WT plants after TuMV infection (Fig. 4G). In contrast, the transcript levels of pri-miRNAs did not further decrease in response to viral infection in the rh6-1/rh12-1 mutant plants (Fig. 4H), which indicated that these helicases play important roles in pri-miRNA decrease in Col-0 WT plants upon TuMV infection. The accumulation of mature miRNAs did not significantly decrease during TuMV infection (fig. S10A), which is likely due to P1/HC-Pro, a well-studied TuMV-encoded RNA silencing suppressor that promotes the accumulation of miRNAs (32). The observations that RH6, RH8, and RH12 control the formation of D-bodies and play important roles in mediating pri-miRNA decrease upon TuMV infection implied that TuMV infection may reduce the accumulation of these helicases to a level below the threshold insufficient to trigger LLPS to form D-bodies. However, we found no significant decrease in the abundance of the three RNA helicases or the major D-body components DCL1, SE, and HYL1 in TuMV-infected plants compared to control plants (fig. S10, B to J). The accumulation of these helicase even increased in the TuMV-infected N. benthamiana plants (fig. S10, H to J), likely because of the RNA silencing suppressor function of TuMV P1/HC-Pro proteins (32). However, although the total abundance of RH6, RH8, and RH12 did not decrease upon TuMV infection, the accumulation of these proteins in the nuclei may differentially drop to a low level. We found that protein levels of RH6 and RH12 significantly decreased in nuclei and increased in the cytoplasm of TuMV-infected N. benthamiana plants compared to control plants (Fig. 4I and fig. S10K). The accumulation of RH12 protein also decreased in the nuclei but not in the cytoplasm of TuMV-infected A. thaliana plants (Fig. 4J). TuMV-induced decrease of RH6 and RH12 accumulation in the nucleus may lead to insufficient amount to trigger LLPS and formation of D-bodies. Therefore, viral infection most likely decreases the accumulation of D-bodies by reducing their formation efficiency. Moreover, under TuMV infection, punctate structures labeled by RFP-SE disappeared quickly compared to those inoculated with buffer (fig. S10L), which implies that TuMV infection may also promote the turnover of D-bodies.","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabc6266/F1.large.jpg,"['deadbox', 'rh8', 'body', 'cells', 'infection', 'dbodies', 'dicing', 'formation', 'rh12', 'modulate', 'helicases', 'dbody', 'arabidopsis', 'fig', 'plants', 'rh6']",

A new space mission is helping researchers solve one of the most enduring mysteries of our Sun: why its wispy atmosphere is nearly 200 times hotter than the surface below. An analysis of observations made last year by the European-led Solar Orbiter mission, presented today at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) meeting, suggests tiny flares just above the Sun’s surface, dubbed “campfires,” could be enough to heat the atmosphere to its prodigious temperature. Other research at the meeting supports the long-held suspicion that small flares, not large ones, may do most of the heating.

The Sun’s heat comes from nuclear fusion in its core, and temperatures should decline moving outward. However, in the 1930s scientists discovered that the Sun’s atmosphere, or corona, had a temperature of 1 million degrees Celsius, far hotter than the 5500°C temperature of the surface. They’ve puzzled over the mystery ever since. “It’s still one of the major unsolved problems in solar physics,” says Sarah Matthews of University College London.

A prime suspect is the Sun’s turbulent magnetic field. The corona consists of plasma, a gas so hot that atoms fall apart, producing a roiling soup of ions and electrons buffeted by magnetic fields. Solar telescopes can see active regions in the corona where magnetic fields loop up from the surface, channeling superhot plasma up into the atmosphere and back down in arcs visible from Earth. Occasionally, active regions produce flares, eruptions of radiation and high-energy particles that sometimes reach Earth. Researchers think these flares likely erupt when twisted, stress-filled magnetic loops snap and link up with other loops in a lower stress configuration, a process known as magnetic reconnection that releases huge amounts of energy.

But researchers realized in the 1960s that the loops and flares they could see did not provide enough heat to keep the corona cooking. So they proposed that the corona is peppered with loops and flares with a wide range of sizes, most too small to see, that provide the missing heat through a wealth of smaller contributions. Over the years, researchers have developed some “very slick ways of studying the very smallest flares” via their collective effects, says James Klimchuk of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. But until now, solar telescopes only had sharp enough vision to see the largest ones.

Enter Solar Orbiter, which launched just over 1 year ago with six telescopic instruments and four sensors of its local environment. In May 2020, while still in its instrument-testing phase, the spacecraft swung halfway between the Sun and Earth. From a distance of 77 million kilometers, the team working with spacecraft’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) expected to see some small flares, says David Berghmans, a solar physicist with the Royal Observatory of Belgium and EUI principal investigator. But, “We didn’t expect them to stand out so clearly,” he says. In quiet areas of the surface, he says, “it’s like a palm tree at the North Pole.”

Researchers got a second close look at the campfires when Solar Orbiter approached the Sun again in February, and the team is still analyzing those data. In December, testing will be over, and researchers will unlock the true power of Solar Orbiter by studying the Sun with multiple instruments at the same time. The real job is to work out the statistics, says Daniel Müller of the European Space Agency, principal investigator of the mission. “Are [campfires] enough to power the quiet Sun on average?” Müller wonders. “Indications are that they could.”

Some of those indications are coming from theory. A team led by Yajie Chen of Peking University and Hardi Peter of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research used an existing model of the Sun’s turbulent surface to calculate how the corona above it would behave in conditions like those observed by Solar Orbiter in May 2020. The model produced “brightenings” that were remarkably similar to the larger campfires in size and duration, they report today at the EGU meeting. “Everything we checked matched,” Peter says. The model also suggests the brightenings are the result of magnetic reconnection, produce million-degree temperatures, and contribute significantly to coronal heating.

Other instruments are helping tackle the problem. Researchers at India’s Tata Institute of Fundamental Research have used the Murchison Widefield Array, an array of many thousands of wire antennas spread across 3 kilometers that is exquisitely sensitive to long-wavelength radio waves, to look for evidence of small flares in the quiet parts of the Sun. During a 70-minute observation of the Sun, the team saw a multitude of bright flashes, each lasting a second or less, they told the EGU meeting. “It jumped out of the data,” says Tata’s Surajit Mondal. The team logged about 20,000 flashes. Mondal acknowledges the difficulty of estimating the energy of a flare from its radio signal alone, but, “If there is this number of flares, it can maintain coronal heating,” he says.

The mystery of the corona’s heating isn’t solved—there could be other processes adding to the heating in addition to small flares—but over the next few years solar physicists have their best chance yet to crack this problem, with Solar Orbiter starting work as well as NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, launched in 2018, and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii, now being commissioned. “Campfires are a tantalizing prospect,” Matthews says. But we need more data, she says, to pin down how many there are and how much heat they produce. Peter is looking forward to 2022, when Solar Orbiter will begin to observe with all its instruments working in concert and carrying out joint observations with telescopes on or near Earth. “It will be an exciting year.”","Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/main_sun_1280p.jpg?itok=t_yeW1qt,"['suns', 'surface', 'solar', 'campfires', 'scorching', 'orbiter', 'magnetic', 'corona', 'atmosphere', 'flares', 'temperatures', 'heat', 'researchers']", 
31,31,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Fishers' response to temperature change reveals the importance of integrating human behavior in climate change analysis - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabc7425,"Abstract Climate change will reshape ecological dynamics. Yet, how temperature increases alter the behavior and resource use of people reliant on natural resources remains underexplored. Consequent behavior shifts have the potential to mitigate or accelerate climate impacts on livelihoods and food security. Particularly within the small-scale inland fisheries that support approximately 10% of the global population, temperature changes likely affect both fish and fishers. To analyze how changing temperatures alter households’ fishing behavior, we examined fishing effort and fish catch in a major inland fishery. We used longitudinal observational data from households in Cambodia, which has the highest per-capita consumption of inland fish in the world. Higher temperatures caused households to reduce their participation in fishing but had limited net effects on fish catch. Incorporating human behavioral responses to changing environmental conditions will be fundamental to determining how climate change affects rural livelihoods, food production, and food access.

INTRODUCTION Climate change reduced global marine fish catch by 4.1% from 1930 to 2010 (1). Future warming projections threaten an additional 3 to 13% fall in global fish harvest by 2050 (2). These realized and projected declines in fish catch could have staggering global consequences for the availability of fish for human consumption and detrimental impacts on global access to critical dietary nutrients supplied by fish (3). Moreover, falling fish catch could jeopardize the well-being of people most reliant on fisheries: 10% of the population in low and middle income countries relies primarily on fisheries for their incomes, food security, and nutrition (4, 5). In particular, the livelihoods of small-scale fishing households, which comprise 90% of global fishers and are concentrated within developing nations, will be acutely affected (5). Existing models of climate effects on fisheries highlight foreboding ecological effects of global temperature rise (2). Yet, the ultimate consequences of climate change for fish-dependent people reflect not only these ecological changes but also how households respond to these changes. Whether rising temperatures and new weather patterns drive people to fish lakes, rivers, and coastlines more intensively; leave fishing for more lucrative livelihoods; or adjust fishing methods or target species will shape both the ecological ramifications of climate change and the consequences for people’s incomes and access to nutritious fish. Fish catch is a function of ecological conditions that determine the availability of fish and the adaptive behavior of fishers who harvest those fish with varying degrees of effort and efficiency (Fig. 1). Our analyses disentangled these two pathways. The behavioral pathway reflects household adaptation to changing weather conditions and was captured using data on decisions about whether to fish at all and, if so, hours spent fishing and gears used. The ecological pathway includes the effects of rising temperature on fish populations and, in turn, fish catch. We indirectly captured the ecological effects of temperature on fish catch by controlling statistically for the temperature effects that are attributable to human behaviors. The climate change literature on fisheries has largely focused on ecological effects without explicitly considering human behavior, which simultaneously affects fish populations and responds to climate stimuli. We show that accounting for the behavioral pathway is imperative to accurately estimate climate change impacts on fishing communities. Fig. 1 Ecological and behavioral pathways from temperature to fish catch. Climate change projections typically focus on the ecological pathway and how temperature affects fish populations and thereby shapes fish catch. Our analysis also examined a behavioral pathway, through which changing temperature affected (1) fishing effort, including (a) fishing participation (any fishing in the previous week), (b) time spent fishing (person-days), and (c) gear choice (active or passive), to ultimately affect (2) fish catch. Adjusting for multiple dimensions of fishing effort, we then measured how changing temperature and rainfall shapes (3) fish catch to indirectly isolate the ecological effect of temperature on fish populations. Dashed lines represent unobserved phenomena. While the ecological impact of climate on inland, freshwater fisheries remains relatively underexamined relative to marine systems, we expect climate change to exacerbate demands on inland fisheries and fundamentally alter aquatic ecosystems (6, 7). Inland fisheries often rely on shallow, hydrologically distinct water bodies, which may be particularly susceptible to warming and limit adaptations for fish that cannot easily migrate between isolated inland waters as temperatures become unfavorable (8). Under climate change scenarios, evaporation and erratic rainfall may increase eutrophication (9), while human demands for and conflict over freshwater may restrict fish habitat (10). Freshwater aquatic species across the world already face overlapping threats from human impacts, low warming tolerances, high extinction and species invasion rates, and low evolutionary rates compared to their marine counterparts (11, 12). At the same time, current thermal conditions may not predict fish species’ capacity to acclimate (13), and nonlinearities or threshold effects at temperatures outside currently observed ranges may exist. Primary productivity may also benefit from increased CO 2 concentrations and higher temperatures, and some fish populations have thrived under warming temperatures (1). Thus, the net effect of warming temperatures on fish populations and aggregate catch is ambiguous. Likewise, for people dependent on freshwater fisheries, the behavioral implications of climate change may take many forms. These behavior changes have complex drivers, including how temperature affects people’s perceptions of fishery viability, effectiveness and the desirability of fishing activities, and demands and opportunities within alternative activities (e.g., agriculture and wage labor). Small-scale fishers are often simultaneously engaged in other activities and may alter their livelihood portfolios by leaving fishing altogether in favor of other activities (14, 15) or shifting time spent fishing, gears, or fishing grounds (14, 16, 17). Limited evidence from small-scale fisheries already suggests worrisome climate impacts on fisher behavior. In West Africa, small-scale marine fishers report traveling further in response to climate change (18), and Ugandan fishers perceived climate change effects on their fishing activities (19). Commercial marine fishers have long coped with changing fish availability by adjusting gears or fishing grounds and are projected to respond to climate change through poleward shifts (20). Further, recent evidence shows that climate variability reduces commercial fishing employment (15). Inland fishers’ behavior is geographically and technologically limited relative to their marine and industrial counterparts (21), increasing their vulnerability. How small-scale and inland fishers respond to climate change is critically important because dependence on inland fish resources is particularly high within poor and food insecure communities around freshwaters (22, 23). Even as the extent of inland fish harvest is systematically underestimated (24), national economies are acutely vulnerable to climate change impacts on fisheries (25). Just 16 countries harvest nearly 80% of inland fish globally, 13 of which are low or middle income and half of which are in Asia (26). Our study focuses on Cambodia, which has the fifth largest global inland fish harvest (509,350 tonnes) and highest per-capita inland fish catch (16 to 35 kg) (26). The highly diverse fisheries feature nearly 500 fish species that are targeted with highly specialized gears, including those that require active effort to rake mud, cast nets, or spear fish, and passive traps and nets that fishers set and return to harvest (27). Fishers in this setting also make use of diverse habitats, including rice fields, flooded forest, streams, tributaries, and the Tonle Sap Lake (28). Among Cambodian households, rice farming and other agricultural activities are often primary, and off-farm opportunities are growing (29). Given both its livelihood diversity and heavy dependence on fisheries, Cambodia provides an ideal setting to examine the responses of freshwater fishers and fisheries to warming temperatures. We disentangled empirically how temperature changes affected the behavioral pathway and indirectly affected the ecological pathway, with both pathways contributing to small-scale fishers’ catch. We used observed, longitudinal, and household-level fish catch and fishing behavior data. Our approach highlights the importance of household responses to warming temperatures and their influence on fish catch and, ultimately, on livelihoods and well-being in changing fisheries. To capture the complexity of the monsoon-driven, flood pulse fishing system in Cambodia’s rice field fisheries, we used a unique, high-frequency dataset containing the catch and fishing activities of 414 fishing households in the Tonle Sap Lake basin across 19 bi-monthly time points from 2012 to 2015. We also used monthly temperature and rainfall aggregates from remotely sensed data. As seasonal changes in water levels across the floodplain are the well-established primary drivers of fishery productivity and fishing activities in this setting, we controlled for rainfall, flood extent, and month to isolate the temperature effect. Our analyses focused on temperature impacts because modeling analyses of the region consistently predict rising temperatures, while predictions about precipitation patterns are inconsistent (7). We used fixed effects, and correlated random effects distributed lag regression models fit to repeated observations (see Materials and Methods) (30). This approach provided strong controls for time invariant household characteristics, allowing us to identify the causal effects of exogenous temperature changes within the observed range while controlling for seasonality, spatial, hydrological, and rainfall variation, and the delayed and nonlinear effects that temperature may have on fish catch and fisher behavior. To account for the way temperature and rainfall in previous periods affect current period fish populations and, thereby, fish available to catch, we include lagged temperature and rainfall variables. Our selection of a 2-month lag structure was based on a time series analysis diagnostic process; sensitivity analyses demonstrated highly similar results with varied lag structures (see Materials and Methods). Our analysis disentangled the behavioral effects of temperature on fish catch via fishing effort, as distinct from the ecological effects of temperature on fish catch via shifting fish availability. We statistically identified the relationships between air temperature and multiple dimensions of fishing behavior (Fig. 1), including (1a) fishing participation (any fishing in the previous week), (1b) time spent fishing (person-days), and (1c) gear choice (active or passive) and (2) fish catch. We then examined (3) fish catch while holding all dimensions of fishing behavior constant to indirectly isolate the net ecological effects of sustained warmer temperatures on fish catch. Our analysis thus triangulated the causal effects of temperature change on both fishing behavior and fish catch by isolating the behavioral effects and indirectly isolating the ecological effects induced by shifting environmental conditions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The behavioral pathway analysis demonstrated that fishers responded to higher temperatures primarily by opting out of fishing (Fig. 2). The magnitude of the effect on fishing behavior differs at different temperatures (e.g., larger effect at higher temperatures), so we present marginal effects, which show the varied effects of a 1°C temperature increase across the temperature distribution. An increase in air temperature from 28° to 29°C, sustained over 2 months, reduced the probability of fishing in a given period by 6%, while a sustained increase from 29° to 30°C reduced the probability of fishing by 8%. These effects are additive, so a sustained 2° rise from 28° to 30°C decreased the probability of fishing by 14%. Among those who fished at a given time point, we found no clear effect of higher temperatures on time spent fishing or use of active gear. Fig. 2 Effect of temperature on fishing participation, effort, and gear use. Temperatures above the current mean of 28°C reduced (A) fishing participation (any fishing in the previous week), although there is no impact of rising temperatures on (B) fishing effort (person-days) or (C) whether a household used active gear. Plots depict the estimated marginal effect of sustained, single-degree temperature changes across the temperature distribution, accounting for lags and polynomial terms (table S2, models 1 to 3). Dashed lines show 95% confidence intervals. This plot represents a marginal effect rather than a trendline; therefore, this and subsequent plots are interpreted as follows, using (A) as an example: The value at 28°C represents the estimated change in probability of fishing participation when temperatures increase from 28° to 29°C (6% reduction). The value at 29°C represents the change in probability of fishing when temperatures increased from 29° to 30°C (8%). The probability of fishing participation under a two-degree temperature increase from 28° to 30°C is the sum of each single-degree change (14%). We next examined the implications for fish catch. To indirectly identify the ecological effect, we estimated the net causal effect of temperature on fish catch in two steps. First, we directly estimated the effect of temperature on fish catch and found a negative but statistically insignificant relationship (Fig. 3A). Second, we added controls for multiple dimensions of human behavior (fishing participation, time spent fishing, gear choice, and flooding) to statistically isolate the ecological pathway from the behavioral pathway. We found a positive and statistically significant association between temperature and fish catch after accounting for multiple dimensions of human behavior (Fig. 3B). Our findings apply within the observed temperature range, where the majority of temperatures were under 30°C. A sustained temperature increase from 28° to 29°C was associated with a 13% increase in fish catch. A sustained 2° increase was associated with a 30% increase in fish catch. Measuring fish catch while holding fishing behavior constant can be interpreted as analogous to an increase in catch-per-unit-effort, a metric commonly used to understand the extent and effectiveness of fishing pressure. Fig. 3 Effect of temperature on fish catch. The effects of a sustained 1° increase in temperature above 28°C were (A) mildly negative and statistically insignificant, when taking into account the aggregated “ecological” and “behavioral” effects of temperature on fish catch. Yet, when we controlled for fishing behavior (B), we found a statistically significant increase in fish catch attributable to the ecological effects of rising temperature while holding fishing effort constant, a metric analogous to isolating fish catch (kilograms)-per-unit-effort. However, the potential positive ecological effect on fish availability from warming temperatures is offset by human behavioral responses that reduced fishing effort, and, ultimately, there was no effect on fish catch. Our findings suggest that, in this system, a sustained 1° to 2°C temperature increase had a positive effect on fish catch via the indirectly measured ecological pathway (Fig. 3B). Yet, the net effect of temperature on fish catch (Fig. 3A) is statistically insignificant, likely because sustained temperature increases also induced people to reduce fishing effort (Fig. 2, A and B), thereby offsetting the positive ecological effect. The observation of reduced fishing effort alongside positive ecological effects of temperature increase signals simultaneous higher returns to fishing effort and higher opportunity costs of fishers’ time as temperature increases. In short, when temperatures increased, people engaged in alternative livelihood activities to fishing, despite ecological conditions improving their potential catch. We also examined the effects of temperature on two other aquatic harvests within inland Cambodia: catch of other aquatic animals (e.g., snakes and frogs) and the harvest of aquatic plants. Households harvested an average of 4.96 kg of fish/week, while average catch of other aquatic animals and aquatic plant harvest reached 1.26 and 1.58 kg/week, respectively. These aquatic resources are key components of Cambodian livelihoods and diets and may also be affected by warming temperatures, or could provide alternative livelihood opportunities if households reduced fishing effort. Higher temperatures reduced participation, time spent harvesting, and whether active gear was used in capture of other aquatic animals (fig. S1). The net harvest, a measure of catch including the ecological effect and harvest behavior, of other aquatic animals (Fig. 4A) and plants (Fig. 4C) increased significantly with higher temperatures, except for aquatic animals at the highest temperatures. Decreased harvest effort of other aquatic animals and plants only partially offset the increased yields (Fig. 4, B and D). Fig. 4 Effect of temperature on other aquatic animal (OAA) and aquatic plant harvest. For other aquatic animals, (A) we found that the aggregate ecological and behavioral effect of temperature on other aquatic animal harvest is positive, except at the most extreme temperatures. For aquatic plants, (C) we found that the aggregate ecological and behavioral effect of temperature on aquatic plant harvest is positive and greatest at the highest temperatures. For both (B) other aquatic animals and (D) aquatic plants, when we controlled for harvest effort (we use fishing effort as a proxy for aquatic plant harvesting effort, which was not available), we found a slightly larger increase in harvest attributable to ecological effects of rising temperature while holding effort constant, a metric analogous to isolating harvest (kilograms)-per-unit-effort. This finding suggests reductions in effort as temperature rise is limiting harvest. Our findings suggest notably consistent human behavioral and ecological responses to warming temperatures across the harvest of different resources, including fish, other aquatic animals, and aquatic plants. Households responded to warmer conditions by not participating in aquatic harvest of all kinds. In addition to a consistent behavioral pathway, these results further point to a consistent ecological mechanism, where our indirect estimates of the ecological pathway suggest that slightly higher sustained temperatures increased the productivity of fish, other aquatic animals, and aquatic plants. If warming temperatures increased primary productivity, which is highly plausible given that the large majority of temperatures observed were below 30°C, that may have contributed to a rise in fish catch. Such a finding would be consistent with a range of studies that suggest warming temperatures may increase aquatic plant productivity (31), although the time horizon for increased fish and other aquatic animal productivity is likely to vary considerably by species and trophic level. At the same time, warming temperatures may alter the catchability of fish and other aquatic animals by shifting the habitats they use, driving them into deeper waters, or altering diel cycles (8). Without accounting for fisher behavioral responses to higher temperatures, it would appear that temperature had no effect on fish catch (Fig. 2A) and a positive effect on other aquatic resources harvest (Fig. 4A). Yet, what we actually observed was fewer households fishing or harvesting aquatic resources in response to warming. Climate projections tailored to the study region anticipate a temperature increase of approximately 2°C by 2060 (32) and largely overlap with the observed range of our data (fig. S2). With a 2°C sustained rise above the average temperature, we found that households were 14% less likely to fish. The effort reductions observed are substantial as, in any given survey time period, 67% of households fished for an average of 3.3 person-days/week. These meaningful responses to environmental change are easily overlooked when human behavior is not integrated in analyses. Although our data do not enable us to identify the activities to which households reallocated their time in response to higher temperatures, rising temperatures plausibly affect alternate activities. Households within our study largely consider rice farming as their primary livelihood activity (33). If higher temperatures also increase pest and weed pressure (34), households may choose to divert effort from fishing to protect their rice crops, a pattern that has been documented in other tropical cropping systems (35). Fishing participation may similarly fall as households pursue other local opportunities or members migrate, even if only temporarily, to growing urban sectors within Cambodia and in nearby Thailand (an estimated 25 and 6% of the rural population, respectively) (36–38). Ultimately, access to natural resources, agricultural land, education, and urban markets will shape decisions, constraints, and disparities in response to temperature across households. Rural households generally, and within our study communities in particular, engage in a complex portfolio of livelihoods, many of which depend on natural resources (33). Our findings that households are less likely to fish despite rising catch-per-unit-effort suggests a rebalancing of this livelihood portfolio as households respond to temperature effects on fishing activities or on nonfishing activities’ desirability or productivity. While temperatures within our study were largely below 30°C, nonlinearities and threshold effects could produce different ecological or behavioral responses at temperatures beyond those observed. Further, climate and environmental changes (e.g., dams) are projected to not only raise temperatures in Cambodia but also alter rainfall and flooding regimes with effects across a range of rural livelihoods (7). Human behavioral responses to these changes promise to be complex and multifaceted, and the consequences of these responses are uncertain. The households we study consumed over 70% of the fish they caught and 87% of other aquatic animals. Declining aquatic food catch, whether as a result of altered effort or ecological conditions, could reduce the nutritional quality of local diets by reducing households’ access to these nutrient rich foods. Alternatively, the type of household adaptations we observed may successfully buffer the impact of ecological change on income and diets. Failure to account for the human behavioral dimensions of rising temperatures has profound implications for understanding climate change. Given the complexity of resource-dependent livelihoods in the developing world, misestimating climate impacts threatens to misdirect the response needed for climate change among the most vulnerable households. The rural households most closely tied to agricultural systems and the harvest of natural resources will undoubtedly be among the first and most severely affected by rising temperatures. Understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change within these communities around the world, however, will ultimately hinge on accurate prediction and integration of both the human behavioral and the ecological dimensions of climate change.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Data We used household data collected by WorldFish and partner NGOs that we matched to georeferenced satellite imagery and weather data. Household panel data were collected from 414 households every 2 months over a 3-year period (19 time points), from November 2012 through November 2015. Data were collected in conjunction with monitoring of 40 Community Fish Refuges (CFRs), community-managed inland protected areas within the rice field fisheries. All households were located in an area where ongoing programs support CFR management and fish habitat improvements (39). The survey sample was selected in two stages; the households selected in the second stage provided that data used in this study. The first stage was a random sample from an enumerated sampling list of 16 households in one to three villages adjacent to each CFR that met the inclusion criteria of participating in fishing, cultivating a rice field, and not planning to migrate seasonally. The second stage purposively selected 10 households from the initial 16 to capture households with children under 5 years old. Further details on the procedures used can be found in the Supplementary Materials and project documentation (28, 40). After attrition due to missing data in key variables, our current estimation sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 414 households. All households were interviewed in at least one follow-up time point so no households are lost to follow up, and 308 (74%) are present in all panel periods. We test whether attrition might bias our parameter estimates and find that it has no meaningful effect (see the Supplementary Materials). Air temperature data come from a combination of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Centers for Environmental Information’s Global Historical Climatology Network and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System (26). Rainfall data come from the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2. Flooding data come from the European Commission’s Joint Research Center Global Surface Water Explorer, which maps seasonal and permanent surface water including paddy fields using United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 5, 7, and 8 (41). Statistical methods We model two distinct pathways through which temperature can affect fish catch. The first is the behavioral response of the fisher to temperature change. This could be due to physical discomfort with high or low temperatures, changing opportunity costs of time spent fishing—rather than in crop or livestock agriculture, nonfarm work, domestic chores, or leisure—under different temperature regimes, or fisher expectations of fishing conditions signaled by temperature. The second is an ecological effect via the availability of fish in the system, due to the effect of temperature on fish spawning and development, water quality and nutrient concentrations, and/or fish migratory responses (e.g., seeking deeper or cooler water). We are able to directly identify the behavioral effects and indirectly identify the ecological effects. The use of catch data to understand fish population dynamics is a widely used and long-standing approach in fishery stock management (42). While catch-per-unit-effort measures can produce biased fish stock estimates over long time horizons and without careful accounting for gear (43, 44), our relatively short time horizon, inclusion of gear types, and use of household-level data minimize this concern within our study. We analyze the behavioral pathway by investigating whether fishers’ participation (1a), effort conditional on participation (1b), and gear choice conditional on participation (1c) are affected by temperature change (Fig. 1). We then investigate the composite effect of temperature on fish catch, inclusive of both ecological and behavioral pathways together (2). Last, we control for behavior in examining how temperature relates to catch (3), allowing us to indirectly estimate the ecological effect. Together, these analyses allow us to describe the causal effect of temperature on fish catch separately for each pathway and descriptively explore the ways that households use adaptive strategies. All models are estimated with model-specific fixed effects to control for time-invariant characteristics in the cross-sectional units, as well as month fixed effects to control for seasonality common to all sample households in average years. Household fixed effects are included in (1a to 1c) models. CFR fixed effects account for the notable diversity of CFR types within this system in (2) and (3) models, for which we use the Honoré correlated random effects estimator (30), approximating a household fixed effect in a random effects Tobit model (45, 46). Using fixed effects models allows us to compare the relationship between a given household’s temperature experience and its outcomes over time by identifying the causal effect of temperature in within-household variation in fishing effort and catch over time. We cluster SEs at the CFR level, as that was the locus of the survey design. We allow for the possibility that temperature has a nonlinear, quadratic relationship with fish catch as fish species in this system are understudied, providing very limited life history information. Our findings are relevant within the range of temperatures observed, and outside this range, further nonlinearities or threshold effects are possible. We determined the optimal lag structure via Akaike and Bayes Information Criteria (AIC and BIC) for each potential model. The AIC and BIC test results consistently favor an optimal specification of one, two, or three lags, with no substantive difference, so we estimate the more parsimonious single lag. Please see the full details of statistical methods and model specifications in the Supplementary Materials.

32,32,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Self-organization of nanoparticles and molecules in periodic Liesegang-type structures - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabe3801,"Abstract Chemical organization in reaction-diffusion systems offers a strategy for the generation of materials with ordered morphologies and structural hierarchy. Periodic structures are formed by either molecules or nanoparticles. On the premise of new directing factors and materials, an emerging frontier is the design of systems in which the precipitation partners are nanoparticles and molecules. We show that solvent evaporation from a suspension of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and l-(+)-tartaric acid [l-(+)-TA] causes phase separation and precipitation, which, being coupled with a reaction/diffusion, results in rhythmic alternation of CNC-rich and l-(+)-TA–rich rings. The CNC-rich regions have a cholesteric structure, while the l-(+)-TA–rich bands are formed by radially aligned elongated bundles. The moving edge of the pattern propagates with a finite constant velocity, which enables control of periodicity by varying film preparation conditions. This work expands knowledge about self-organizing reaction-diffusion systems and offers a strategy for the design of self-organizing materials.

INTRODUCTION Self-organization and self-assembly in non-equilibrium systems are a universal process that occurs in living matter (1, 2), geochemical and mineralogical environments (3), materials science (4), and industrial settings (5). In particular, patterns formed in reaction-diffusion systems provide a fascinating example of highly ordered, spatial or spatiotemporal structures as a result of the synergy between transport of chemical species and chemical reactions. For example, periodic ring patterns have been observed in seemingly unrelated systems, e.g., in crystallizing low–molecular weight compounds (6), polymer films formed from solutions (7, 8), emulsion polymerization mixtures (9), and even in human tissues (10). In crystallizing polymer melts, the formation of ring-banded spherulites due to the helicoidal twisting of radial lamellae is a commonly observed phenomenon (11). A special class of reaction-diffusion systems is that in which a heterogeneous precipitation pattern forms. In a reaction-diffusion experiment conducted by Liesegang in the late 19th century, a reaction between two water-soluble electrolytes resulted in spatially periodic ring-type bands of a precipitating salt (12). Periodic precipitation originated from coupling of the rates of the precipitation process and reactant mass transport, resulting in a reactant-exhausted medium (13). Currently, experiments leading to periodic structures can be divided into two groups. In the classical Liesegang-type experiments, the system consists of two interacting components [ions or oppositely charged nanoparticles (NPs)], which are initially spatially separated (4, 14). Pattern formation occurs due to diffusion of these components toward each other, leading to the first precipitation band when the product of local concentrations of the reagents exceeds the solubility product. The precipitation process decreases the reagent concentrations in the precipitation zone faster than the diffusion can increase them, causing depletion, thus depleting the reagents in the region surrounding the first precipitation band. A new precipitation band forms once the solubility product is exceeded again. The repetition of the precipitation process yields periodic precipitate bands. In the second group of experiments, periodic ring-type structures form in a system that initially has a spatially uniform distribution of components but undergoes phase separation or crystallization (15, 16). Chemical organization via periodic precipitation offers a new strategy for the generation of materials with ordered morphologies and structural hierarchy (17, 18). Molecular self-organization on nano- to micrometer length scales via the reaction-diffusion process has already led to proof-of-concept applications of periodically structured materials in optics (19), microfluidics (20), and drug release systems (21). An emerging frontier in this field is the design of reaction-diffusion systems in which the precipitation partners are nanocolloidal building blocks or a combination of NPs and molecules (4) rather than reacting molecules. The capability to organize NP building blocks into well-defined, ordered patterns offers the capability to create hierarchically organized nanostructures with functionality stemming from the synergistic properties of NP assemblies (22). The first step in this direction has been undertaken by coprecipitating oppositely charged metal NPs that played the role of two “electrolytes” in a Liesegang-type system (earlier described as group 1) (23). Upon neutralization of the NP charges, colloidal stability of the system was lost, and NPs precipitated into periodic concentric zones. The next step in the organization of NPs includes periodic precipitation on the premise of new directing factors (24) and film compositions over different length scales, thereby offering a higher complexity in self-organization and following nature-made periodic patterns (25). Here, we report periodic precipitation patterns formed by the colloidal and molecular components, namely, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and l-(+)-tartaric acid [l-(+)-TA]. CNCs, rod-shaped NPs with a length of 100 to 300 nm and diameter of 10 to 20 nm (26), have recently attracted great interest of the soft matter and materials science community because of their ability to organize into cholesteric (Ch) liquid crystals (27). Upon drying, aqueous CNC suspensions mixed with low–molecular weight molecules (28, 29), polymers (30, 31) and NPs (32–34) formed films with either a Ch structure (with intrinsic defects) or random disordered morphologies; however, periodic precipitation bands have not been reported. In the present work, we show that upon solvent evaporation, an aqueous l-(+)-TA/CNC mixture undergoes phase separation and subsequent precipitation, which, being coupled with a diffusion-driven process, results in a rhythmic alternation of CNC-rich and CNC-depleted [or l-(+)-TA–rich] ring-type regions. The CNC-rich regions had a Ch structure with characteristic optical properties, while the l-(+)-TA–rich regions exhibited anisotropy stemming from radially aligned bundles. The propagation of the front edge of the ring-banded pattern with a constant velocity yielded periodic structures, with a period controlled by film composition and water evaporation rate, that is, ambient relative humidity (RH). The developed kinetic model was in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Our results expand the range of self-organizing reaction-diffusion systems and pave the way for the design of periodically structured functional materials.

DISCUSSION Generally, in multicomponent precipitation/diffusion-governed systems, the sizes of the components are in the same range, e.g., they are represented by either molecules (12, 13) or NPs (23). Our work provides the first evidence for the periodic ring-banded structures formed by two components with dimensions differing by several orders of magnitude. We stress the difference between the results observed in our work and several other phenomena that yield ring patterns, or even dual-scale patterns, in drying liquid films. Periodic “coffee ring” patterns originate from particle deposition at the contact line (the outer edge of a drying suspension) due to their periodic pinning to the substrate (46, 47), while in our work, the concentric ring pattern evolved close to the center of the film. The nucleation of the ring pattern in the film center, as well as a low temperature difference across the liquid layer (caused by water evaporation), did not favor the Rayleigh-Bénard convection (48). Notably, our results are also in marked difference with pattern formation in Belousov-Zhabotinsky autocatalytic oscillatory chemical reactions (49), since concentric ring patterns formed via phase separation, diffusion, and precipitation of CNC-rich and TA-rich phases rather than a chemical reaction. In our work, the evaporation of water from the TA/CNC suspension resulted in saturation of CNCs and TA in the mixture, accompanied by their local phase separation and subsequent precipitation of the phase enriched with a particular component. The threshold-limited steps (described by Eqs. 5 and 6) led to the saturation of CNC and phase separation close to the film center, thus creating a nucleation zone (a bright green spot in Fig. 3A and movie S1). These steps, as well as CNC diffusion from the mixed suspension toward the CNC-rich phase, depleted the neighborhood of the nucleation point from the CNCs, thereby stopping the growth of the CNC-rich ring-type band. Next, the threshold concentration of TA was reached in the region adjacent to the CNC-rich region, followed by the TA diffusion to this zone, and the TA-rich phase precipitated as a ring-type band. Then, the CNC saturation was achieved, again, in the region adjoining the TA-enriched phase and a new CNC-rich band. This repetitive phase separation/precipitation/diffusion-governed process resulted in rhythmic alternation of CNC-rich and TA-rich concentric ring-type bands. The developed kinetic model reproduced qualitatively the experimental results, that is, constant periodicity and growth of the rings in the radial direction, which is the manifestation of the finite constant velocity of the pattern formation front. The morphology of the composite films was controlled by varying the composition of the TA/CNC suspension and RH. At large R values (corresponding to the high TA content in the mixture), TA crystallization suppressed the formation of CNC-enriched ring-banded regions. At small R values (that is, at low TA concentration in the mixture), the amount of TA was insufficient for phase separation and thus the formation of alternating ring-type regions. The value of RH controlled the rate of water evaporation from the liquid film, thus affecting the time within which the system reached the saturation state, as well as the extent of CNC and TA diffusion, with wider bands formed at higher RH. We note that the addition of TA to the CNC suspension resulted in the reduction in ζ-potential of CNCs and could lead to the increase in suspension viscosity (50). Similarly, the evaporation of water from the mixed TA/CNC suspension caused an increase in viscosity. Our simulations showed that the periodic ring patterns did not qualitatively change with increasing viscosity and hence reducing diffusion coefficients of the compounds. The CNC-enriched and TA-enriched ring-banded regions had distinct structures. The CNC-enriched regions exhibited a Ch structure with characteristic optical properties. We speculate that slow evaporation of water (controlled by RH) and local (site-specific) increase in CNC concentration in the liquid film, due to phase separation, favored CNC assembly in the Ch structure. The TA-rich regions contained elongated TA-enriched bundles that are substantially thicker than the needle-like crystallite structures formed by pristine TA (Fig. 1E), which suggested the possibility of CNC embedding in these bundles, due to hydrogen bonding between TA and CNCs. The alignment of the bundles in the radial direction (confirmed in AFM, SEM, SAXS, and polarimetry experiments) was a result of shear induced by the evaporation of water from the liquid film.

MATERIALS AND METHODS An aqueous 10.3 wt % CNC suspension was supplied by the University of Maine Process Development Center. Deionized water obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system was used to dilute the CNC suspension to a concentration of 6.9 wt %, which was equilibrated for 10 days to separate into upper isotropic and lower Ch phases. The Ch phase was removed with a glass pipet and used for experiments. l-(+)-TA (purity of >99.5%), d-(−)-tartaric acid (purity of >99%), lithium chloride, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and potassium acetate salts and FITC isomer I were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Canada. Potassium carbonate (anhydrous), calcium bromide hydrate, and sodium iodide dihydrate were purchased from Fisher Chemical. All chemicals were used without further purification. Preparation of the composite films Solutions of either l- or d-tartaric acid in deionized water with concentrations in the range of 5 to 1800 mM (0.075 to 27 wt %) were mixed with the CNC suspension to the final CNC concentration of 3 wt %. The ratio of mass concentrations, R, of TA to CNCs or d-(+)-tartaric acid to CNCs in the suspension or film varied from 3.0 to 9.0. Borosilicate glass microscope coverslips (VWR International LLC) were washed subsequently with isopropanol, water, and ethanol and dried with filtered compressed air before use. Droplets of either l- or d-tartaric acid/CNC suspensions with a volume of 10 μl were deposited onto the glass slide using a 20-μl Eppendorf pipette at 21°C and RH ≈ 40% and immediately placed in a sealed chamber under controlled RH of 11, 18, 23, 33, 39, or 44% for 24 hours. The value of RH was controlled by introducing a saturated solution of a particular salt in the chamber and equilibrating it for 24 to 48 hours (51). The salts and their respective values of RH were LiCl (11%), CaBr 2 ∙xH 2 O (18%), CH 3 CO 2 K (23%), MgCl 2 (33%), NaI (39%), and K 2 CO 3 (44%). Covalent attachment of FITC to CNCs was conducted, as described elsewhere (52). An aqueous 3.11 wt % CNC suspension was mixed with 25 ml of 1.0 M NaOH solution and epichlorohydrin (7.05 ml, 0.28 mol/g of CNC) and heated at 60°C for 1 hour. The excess epichlorohydrin was removed from the epoxy-CNC mixture by 3 cycles of centrifugation (6000g, 10 min) and resuspension in deionized water (15 ml). The pH of the epoxy-CNC suspension was readjusted to 12.0 (pH meter, Mettler Toledo) with 50% (w/v) NaOH. Excess ammonia hydroxide (12 ml, 28 wt %, 5 ml/g of CNC) was added, and the mixture was heated at 60°C and stirred for 3 hours. Subsequently, ammonium hydroxide was removed by 3 cycles of centrifugation (6000g, 10 min), and NH 2 -CNCs were redispersed in 15 ml of deionized water. FITC (37 mg, 0.32 mmol/g of CNC) was dissolved in 2 ml of dimethyl formamide and added to a 15-ml NH 2 -CNC suspension mixed with 15 ml of NaHCO 3 buffer (100 mM, pH 9.0). The mixture was stirred overnight in the dark and dialyzed for 5 days against deionized water (changed twice daily) using a cellulose dialysis tubing membrane (14,000 molecular weight cutoff; Sigma-Aldrich) until FITC was no longer identified in deionized water using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The suspension was sonicated for 20 min in an ice bath and filtered with a 0.45-μm syringe filter. The pH of the FITC-CNC was adjusted to 11.0 using NaHCO 3 buffer (100 mM), and the amount of FITC attached to CNCs was determined using a calibration curve generated using standard FITC solutions in ammonium hydroxide (28 wt %, pH 11.0). The molar extinction coefficient, ε 490 , for FITC amide was calculated to be 7.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The concentration of FITC was 0.10 molecules of FITC per square nanometer of CNC. Composite films were prepared by mixing an aqueous TA solution and a mixed suspension of CNCs (5.01 wt %) and FITC-CNCs (0.20 wt %) (mixed to form a 3.00 wt % suspension). In the dry film, the concentration of FITC-CNC was 0.61%. Characterization of CNCs Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were conducted to determine the average CNC length and diameter, using a Hitachi HT7700 at 60 kV. Droplets of aqueous CNC suspension (0.001 wt %) were deposited onto a lacey carbon film 300-mesh copper grid and left until dried. The electrokinetic potential (ζ-potential) of CNCs was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument at 22°C. For each sample, nine measurements have been performed. The degree of sulfation of CNCs (sulfur half-ester content reported as millimole sulfate per kilogram of CNC) was determined by conductometric titration, as described elsewhere (53). Briefly, sulfate half-ester groups of CNCs in a 2 wt % suspension were protonated using a Dowex Marathon C hydrogen form ion exchange column (Supelco). Subsequently, the protonated CNCs were titrated against a standardized 0.1 M NaOH solution using an EcoMet 65 conductivity meter. Characterization of composite film structure POM imaging was carried out in transmission mode, using an optical microscope (Olympus BX51), with images acquired using a Nikon D7200 camera. The dimensions and structure of the composite droplets were analyzed using the software ImageJ. The fluorescence images of the composite films containing FITC-labeled CNCs were acquired using an optical microscope (Olympus BX51) with an FITC filter cube (U-N41001 HQ:F), with an excitation wavelength of 480 ± 23 nm. The preparation of samples for SEM imaging of the composite films was performed by depositing a droplet of TA/CNC (R = 4.5) suspension on a silicon wafer and drying at RH = 23%. Before deposition, the wafer was washed with water and ethanol and dried with filtered compressed air. The samples were imaged using the FEI Quanta FEG 250 environmental scanning electron microscope under high vacuum at 3 kV. To obtain fractured films, silicon wafers with deposited films were cut with a diamond-tipped glass cutter. The fractured films affixed to the silicon wafers were mounted on 90° specimen mounts using a conductive carbon tape. AFM experiments were carried out on films formed by depositing a droplet of TA/CNC (R = 4.5) on a silicon wafer and drying at RH = 23%. The samples were imaged using a Dimension atomic force microscope (Bruker Corporation). Measurements were performed under ambient environment in tapping mode using aluminum-coated silicon tips with a radius of 8 nm, resonance frequency of ~325 kHz, and force constant ≈ 40 N/m (HQ:NSC15/Al BS, MikroMasch). Image analysis was performed using Gwyddion and ImageJ software. All images were flattened, corrected, and stitched using the built-in Gwyddion functions. Spatially resolved measurements of ΔE for the films were performed on an inverted optical microscope (Olympus IX71). The samples were illuminated with a 50-μm-radius beam of collimated light from a white light source using a pinhole arrangement. The polarization state of the illumination light was controlled using a broadband polarizer and an achromatic quarter waveplate, placed immediately before the sample. The transmitted light through the sample was collected using a 20× objective (Olympus SLMPlan) and guided to a spectrometer (Ocean Optics, USB 2000-FLG) using an optical fiber. The differences between the light extinction by the films for the left (ε l ) and right (ε r ) circularly polarized components of the illumination light were measured separately, giving ΔE = ε l − ε r (54, 55). The polarimetric imaging of the TA/CNC samples was performed on an upright microscope (Olympus BX51) using a 40× (Olympus UPlan FLN) objective to image. The film was illuminated with a linearly polarized light (aligned vertically to the sample plane) at 532 nm, and the polarization state of the light transmitted through the film was analyzed using a quarter waveplate (AQWP05M-600, Thorlabs) inserted below the analyzer A (aligned parallel to the incident polarization of Fig. 4E). To map out the variations in the polarization state of the transmitted light, the images of the film were collected by rotating the fast axis of the waveplate from 0° to 180° in steps of 22.5°. The ellipticity, e, and orientation of the polarization ellipse, χ, for the transmitted light through the sample were estimated using these images by numerical methods (Supplementary materials). SAXS experiments were performed at the Soft Matter Interfaces (SMI, 12-ID) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The films were cast on a coverslip (using earlier described methods) and probed by an x-ray beam with a photon energy of E = 18.25 keV (x-ray wavelength λ = 0.67940 Å) in the transmission mode, where the beam was along the surface-normal direction of the coverslip. The beam size was 220 μm by 50 μm, and the films were scanned in a snake-like scan path with a step size of 400 μm in horizontal and vertical directions. The scattering pattern at each scanning spot was collected using a 2D detector (Pilatus 1M; 172 μm by 172 μm per pixel) placed downstream with a sample-to-detector distance of 8.3 m. The exposure time for each scan spot was 0.5 or 1.0 s since radiation damage was observed for longer exposure time. Scattering from the blank coverslip was collected as a background and subtracted from the scattering pattern before further data analysis.

33,33,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Enphase beats Q1 guidance but semiconductor shortages weigh heavy on forecasts - PV-Tech,https://www.pv-tech.org/enphase-beats-q1-guidance-but-semiconductor-shortages-weigh-heavy-on-forecasts/,"Supplier of microinverter-based solar-plus-storage systems Enphase Energy’s IQ 7 Microinverter. Image: Enphase Energy.

Enphase Energy beat its revenue guidance in Q1 2021 as the microinverter supplier got off to a strong start to 2021, however an ongoing semiconductor shortage has weighed heavy on guidance for the rest of the year.

Yesterday Enphase reported Q1 2021 revenue to have stood at US$301.8 million, up 47% year-on-year and enough to beat its previous guidance for the period of US$280 – 300 million, given during the company’s Q4 2020 results disclosure.

Microinverter shipments for the quarter stood at 830MWdc, or around 2.45 million units, while its nascent storage product Encharge continued to build momentum, shipping 42MWh in the quarter, again beating previous guidance.

But, chief executive officer Badri Kothandaraman warned yesterday, growing unpredictability around the supply of semiconductor chips used in its microinverter products is dampening the company’s guidance throughout the rest of the year, and possibly into 2022.

Guidance for Q2 2021 was given in the range of US$300 – 320 million, below the prior consensus figure of US$321 million, which Kothandaraman squared with the semiconductor supply chain which he said was “under stress”.

Semiconductor chip shortages have been noted across many sectors, driven by surging demand for consumer products including electric vehicles. Enphase’s issues relate to problems locking in supply of two chips in particular, the ASIC and AC FET drivers used in its microinverter products. Enphase has moved to lock in more supply of these particular chips, however the ramp in supply is expected to be slower and, as a result, shipment volumes are expected to be constrained moving forward.

The constraints also coincide with growing demand for Enphase’s microinverter range. Enphase stressed during a call with analysts it remained committed to expanding manufacturing capacity in both Mexico and India – equipment has already been purchased to establish a second line at its facility in Chennai, India, which ramping expected to begin in Q3 – and Kothandaraman said that demand outstripped supply considerably in the coming quarters. Bookings for Q3 2021 were said to be higher than they would ordinarily be at this time of year.

Supply constraints will prove a thorn in Enphase Energy’s side, however, due mostly to the supply chain’s unpredictability.

“We’re obviously pleased with the overall demand but we are cautious about the supply situation, which is not very predictable today.

“I do expect the supply situation to get better every quarter… I do expect Q3 to get better. I expect Q4 to get even more better. But will that match our demand? I cannot predict it now,” Kothandaraman said.

Component shortages are widely anticipated to be felt throughout this calendar year which, as one analyst noted yesterday, contradicts the previously given view from Enphase that supply chain stress would begin to ease from April 2021.

The shortage is also impacting on the launch of Enphase’s IQ 8 and IQ 8D microinverter products, which are now not expected to ramp until Q3 2021.

Material and component shortages have emerged since the end of last year as perhaps the defining feature of the global solar industry, with polysilicon shortages sending the cost of solar modules up by as much as 25% over the past six months.","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Enphase_IQ7_closeup-1.jpg,"['enphase', 'q1', 'beats', 'million', 'demand', 'heavy', 'supply', 'microinverter', 'q3', 'products', 'guidance', 'semiconductor', 'kothandaraman', 'weigh', 'forecasts', 'shortages', '2021']", 
34,34,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Ultrathin micromolded 3D scaffolds for high-density photoreceptor layer reconstruction - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf0344,"Polymeric scaffolds are revolutionizing therapeutics for blinding disorders affecting the outer retina, a region anatomically and functionally defined by light-sensitive photoreceptors. Recent engineering advances have produced planar scaffolds optimized for retinal pigment epithelium monolayer delivery, which are being tested in early-stage clinical trials. We previously described a three-dimensional scaffold supporting a polarized photoreceptor monolayer, but photoreceptor somata typically occupy multiple densely packed strata to maximize light detection. Thus, patients with severe photoreceptor degeneration are expected to extract greater benefits from higher-density photoreceptor delivery. Here, we describe the microfabrication of a biodegradable scaffold patterned for high-density photoreceptor replacement. The “ice cube tray” structure optimizes mechanical properties and cell-to-biomaterial load, enabling production of a multicellular photoreceptor layer designed for outer retinal reconstruction. Our approach may also be useful in the production of a multitude of micro- and nanoscale structures for multilayered cell delivery in other tissues.

Solid and porous polymeric thin-film scaffolds supporting hPSC-derived neural retina cell growth have been developed in recent years to overcome problems inherent to bolus cell suspension injections ( 15 – 26 ). Despite these advances, two of the core engineering challenges these scaffolds are intended to address—cell disorganization and low or unpredictable cell payloads—have remained largely unsolved. We recently developed a “wineglass” design scaffold that succeeded in orienting a single layer of individually spaced hPSC-PRs ( 26 ). However, this design did not support the close association of multiple layers of hPSC-PRs and, overall, demonstrated a high burden of synthetic biomaterial relative to the cell payload. A need therefore exists for strategies to deliver dense populations of PRs to a discrete region of the retina, particularly for macular diseases that affect high-acuity central vision such as AMD. With these primary engineering goals in mind, we developed an ultrathin biodegradable scaffold patterned with micrometer-level precision, constructed specifically to improve cell payload and reduce biomaterial burden (i.e., the volume of biomaterial used to generate a single 5-mm-diameter scaffold with a thickness of 30 μm), while maintaining optimal mechanical properties for subretinal applications. Here, we describe (i) the development and optimization of the three-dimensional (3D) microstructure shape and size (i.e., scaffold design), (ii) the scaffold fabrication processes (i.e., scale-up manufacturing), (iii) the formulation and curing of the elastomeric stamp (i.e., material optimization), and (iv) the cell seeding method, leading to the production of an hPSC-PR patch aimed at reconstructing the outer neural retina.

The first clinical trials for outer retinal cell replacement began with hPSC–retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells injected as a dissociated cell suspension bolus. These phase 1/2 trials revealed shortcomings of this approach including cell reflux at the time of delivery and disorganization of the donor RPE in the subretinal space (SRS), leading to poor long-term survival and integration ( 12 ). Notably, cell reflux from the SRS (a potential space between the PR and RPE layers of the outer retina) into the vitreous cavity via the surgical retinotomy site can also lead to adverse patient outcomes such as epiretinal membrane formation, proliferative retinopathy, and retinal detachment ( 12 , 13 ). In an effort to address these challenges and to promote more precise cell placement, multiple scaffold designs have been developed and studied to date. Three hPSC-RPE planar scaffolds—including a nonbiodegradable parylene membrane, a slowly biodegradable polyethylene terephthalate scaffold, and a biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) electrospun scaffold—are currently being tested in clinical trials for hPSC-RPE monolayer delivery in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) ( 12 ). Early reports from these studies support, in principle, the safety and feasibility of delivering scaffolds into the SRS, but these scaffolds are restricted in application to patients with salvageable native PRs. Preclinical studies aimed at hPSC-derived PR replacement have largely been limited to subretinal transplantation of dissociated mixed cell suspensions or whole or partial retinal organoids ( 14 ). A growing body of evidence from these animal studies suggests that, similar to dissociated hPSC-RPE cell transplantation, bolus injections of hPSC-PRs often suffer from reflux during transplantation, poor cell survival, structural disorganization, and/or low integration rates ( 5 , 14 ).

Advances in stem cell biology and scale-up of differentiation protocols have rapidly moved cell replacement therapies toward the clinic. Diseases of the eye and outer retina have led the way ( 8 ) due in part to ease of surgical access, relative immune privilege, availability of noninvasive monitoring techniques, potential for high-acuity vision replacement with a low cellular dose, and relative safety of ocular surgical interventions compared to other organs and tissues ( 9 ). Twelve years have passed since the first three-dimensional culture protocol for generating outer retinal cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) was described ( 10 ), but the field has already reached a substantial milestone with the initiation of more than 15 clinical trials that use hPSC-derived retinal cells ( 9 ). All major retinal cell types can be produced from hPSCs with protocols mirroring human retinal development ( 11 ); however, particular weight has been placed on the generation of PRs, owing to their position at the apex of visual function and their susceptibility to degenerative processes.

Photoreceptors (PRs) are light-sensitive cells that capture photons to initiate electrochemical impulses that traverse a complex neural network and ultimately confer visual function. Outer retinal degenerative diseases and injuries are characterized by primary or secondary PR loss with resulting severe vision loss. These conditions are common (affecting tens of millions worldwide) ( 1 , 2 ), devastating, and irreversible since the human retina is incapable of intrinsic self-repair. While gene therapies hold promise for some affected patients ( 3 ), they are limited in scope to a small number of individuals with specific inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) who are early enough in their course to retain a sufficient amount of functional native PRs. Patients with acquired PR disorders and those in the later stages of IRDs are unlikely to benefit from these approaches ( 4 , 5 ). Furthermore, IRDs can be caused by mutations in more than 200 different genes ( 6 ), underscoring the difficulty of treating patients using gene- or mutation-specific strategies alone. Hence, widely applicable approaches for restoring vision—and, in particular, cell replacement strategies—are highly attractive as they have the potential to reach a broad patient population even at later stages of degeneration ( 7 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The second-generation PR scaffold design We sought to engineer a biocompatible and biodegradable scaffold capable of capturing a high density of PRs. In the retina of humans and other vertebrates, PR cell bodies are exclusively found in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), which is approximately 8 to 10 cell nuclei in thickness and approximately 30–50 μm in height, with PR cell densities ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands per mm2 in the macular region of healthy human retinas (27–31). In designing the scaffold, we drew upon our previous experience with the first-generation scaffold having wineglass-shaped cell capture wells (26). While the wineglass PR scaffold introduced key advancements in biomaterial scaffold engineering, including the potential to promote PR polarization, its cell-carrying capacity was low (1 to 2 cells per well) in comparison to the relatively high volume of synthetic biomaterial (Table 1). Therefore, an “ice cube tray”–shaped scaffold was designed as a second-generation scaffold to maximize cell payload while also reducing the overall biomaterial burden (Table 1 and fig. S1). Specifically, our second-generation scaffold was composed of two layers: (i) a reservoir layer (i.e., cell capture well layer) in which PRs are seeded and (ii) a base layer with regularly placed through-holes to facilitate fluid and nutrient transport (Fig. 1A) (32). Reservoirs were designed to have sufficient volume and height (i.e., length/width/height of 29/29/25 μm) to enable the capture of multiple PRs in an individual reservoir. Furthermore, to promote cell seeding inside the wells as opposed to along the top of the walls, we designed the reservoir wall width as thin as possible (~3 μm) while retaining structural integrity. Similarly, to prevent cells (which average 6 μm in diameter) from escaping through the perforated base layer, we also minimized the through-hole diameter (~5 μm). The desired scaffold thickness was near that of the native macular ONL (~30 μm), which is also consistent with recent arguments that scaffolds with a thickness of less than 50 μm can enable interactions between seeded neuroretinal cells and the host RPE (30, 33, 34).

Biomaterial selection for scaffold fabrication Desirable retinal scaffold characteristics include the use of fully biodegradable materials having mechanical properties compatible with those of the human retina, both of which are important for clinical translation. The retina has a Young’s modulus of only 0.02 MPa (35), making this tissue extremely flexible and fragile. A higher modulus (>1 MPa) has been shown to enhance surgical handling of RPE scaffolds (36) without sacrificing safety or performance following implantation in the SRS. We thus sought to develop a scaffold with a Young’s modulus slightly above 1.0 MPa, balancing the need for rigidity during transplantation with flexibility to conform to the curvature of the eye upon delivery. The ideal biomaterial and its degradation products should also have proven compatibility with retinal tissue so as not to induce damage to surrounding host cells in vivo. Furthermore, the scaffold material must form thin (ideally <50 μm to facilitate interactions with RPE) (33), stable films and be amenable to the formation of precise, 3D PR capture well geometries during the micromolding process. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) was selected as the biomaterial of choice due to its retinal biocompatibility (37, 38), known degradation behavior in the SRS (<30 to 60 days) (38, 39), and suitable Young’s modulus (1.18 to 1.66 MPa) (26, 39). PGS undergoes gradual hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation to generate sebacic acid and glycerol, both of which are natural mammalian metabolites that are fully eliminated via physiologic mechanisms (39, 40). Lastly, PGS provides the ideal combination of relatively rapid degradation in vivo with slow degradation in vitro (39). We did not observe scaffold degradation after hPSC-PR seeding for up to 30 days in culture (26), which offers a wide time window to seed and maintain scaffolds while making arrangements for transplantation.

PGS ice cube tray PR scaffold fabrication With the aforementioned desirable characteristics in mind, the second-generation outer retinal scaffold with an ice cube tray structure was produced using microfabrication and micromolding techniques, which are among the most promising approaches currently used in drug and cell delivery systems (41, 42). Figure 1 (B to G) depicts the process workflow for fabricating PGS ice cube tray PR scaffolds. First, to fabricate a reusable silicon (Si) master mold with two distinctly patterned layers, we created a dense array of Si microstructures (through-holes and reservoirs) using photolithography and deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), a highly anisotropic etch process optimal for creating steep-sided holes or trenches in Si wafers (Fig. 1, B and C) (43). Here, during the DRIE process, RIE-lag effect and microloading effect were manipulated to achieve desired structure dimensions. RIE-lag effect refers to the dependency of etch rate on feature size (e.g., smaller features result in slower etch rates), while the microloading effect describes the relationship between local etch rate and pattern density (i.e., features in areas of high pattern density experience more competition for reactants, leading to a gradient in reactant flux and slower etch rate) (44). While generating the Si master mold, through-holes underwent two etching steps: a primary etching step and a secondary etching step (fig. S2). The etch rates of the through-holes in each step differed due to the microloading effect, with the primary etch rate and the secondary etch rate set at 2.148 and 1.746 μm/min, respectively. On the other hand, reservoirs only went through the secondary etching step, and the etch rate of the reservoirs was 2.448 μm/min, which was higher than the primary etch rate of the through-holes (i.e., 2.148 μm/min) due to the RIE-lag effect caused by the difference in feature size. By considering these effects and precisely calculating the etch rates, the desired target depths, approximately 5 μm for the through-hole layer and 25 μm for the reservoir layer, were successfully achieved (Fig. 2A). The final Si master mold included a base layer of through-holes with a diameter of 5.1 μm and a depth of 4.8 μm and a secondary layer of cuboidal (i.e., ice cube tray) reservoirs with a dimension of 29 μm by 29 μm by 24.5 μm. The width of the reservoir walls and the distance between adjacent through-holes were 2.8 and 5 μm, respectively, meeting the target dimensions. To facilitate smooth molding and demolding in the next fabrication step (Fig. 1D), we coated the fabricated Si master mold with a chemically inert passivation layer. Plasma polymerization was conducted with octafluorocyclobutane (C 4 F 8 ) as a precursor by DRIE, generating a Teflon-like polymer film with long linear (CF 2 ) n chains (45). Fig. 2 Fabrication of Si master mold and h-PDMS stamp. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the ice cube tray–shaped (A) Si master mold, and (B) h-PDMS stamp showing (i) a tilted view, (ii) a top view, and (iii) a cross-sectional view, respectively. The inset images show a magnified view of the microstructures of the fabricated Si master mold and h-PDMS stamp. Next, to create a reusable elastomeric stamp (i.e., a negative master mold for the fabrication of the final scaffold) that would not deform, bend, or buckle during the molding process (Fig. 1E), we selected polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the ideal material. Soft-PDMS stamps were initially tested, but these were frequently deformed during the demounting process due to the adherent nature of soft PDMS (fig. S3). Hard PDMS (h-PDMS) proved sufficiently strong to serve as the optimal stamp material. To create the stamp, we poured liquid h-PDMS over the fabricated Si master mold and left to cure for 12 hours at room temperature, followed by 2 hours at 60°C. After curing, the stamp was carefully demolded from the Si master mold without large surface defects, producing a high yield (>95%) of the desired ice cube tray microstructures (Fig. 2B). The stamp surface was coated with a monolayer of hydrophobic silane (an anti-adhesive layer) under vacuum to facilitate demounting from the final PGS scaffold. The microfabrication processes for the Si master mold and h-PDMS stamp are described in greater detail in Materials and Methods. Figure 1 (E and F) depicts the final steps in the micromolding process for fabricating the ice cube tray PR scaffold from a PGS prepolymer with the h-PDMS stamp. First, PGS prepolymer was placed on a clean Si wafer and melted on a hot plate at 120°C. The micropatterned surface of the h-PDMS stamp was then immersed into the liquid PGS. A glass slide with an overlying weight of 380 g was placed atop the stamp, pressing the liquid PGS between the h-PDMS stamp and the Si wafer (Fig. 1E) to control the scaffold thickness (fig. S4). The scaffold microfabrication apparatus was subsequently placed into a vacuum oven and cured under high vacuum (<1 mbar) at 120°C for 3 days. Figure 3A shows a cured PGS scaffold between the h-PDMS stamp and the Si wafer before demounting. After curing was complete, the h-PDMS stamp was demounted from the Si wafer, taking care to avoid fractures of the h-PDMS ice cube tray microstructures due to the rigid nature of h-PDMS. Fabricated PGS scaffolds were evaluated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to screen for surface defects attributable to the demounting process.

(A) h-PDMS stamp ready to be demounted from the scaffold on a Si wafer after complete PGS curing. (B) A PGS scaffold on the Si wafer after stamp removal.

(G) Large-area SEM image of the fabricated scaffold and a magnified view of a scaffold reservoir wall (inset). Despite careful handling, early microfabrication experiments often resulted in the retention of fractured h-PDMS microstructures in the final scaffold product, rendering the h-PDMS stamp inoperable for further use (fig. S5). To address this challenge, we used isopropyl alcohol (IPA) soaking, as it allows polymers to swell and can facilitate release from secondary mold structures (46). The h-PDMS stamp, cured PGS, and Si wafer were incubated in IPA at room temperature for 12 hours, allowing IPA to permeate the PGS scaffold. Using this approach, the PGS scaffold on a Si wafer could be reliably demounted from the h-PDMS stamp without surface defects or retained h-PDMS stamp microstructures (Fig. 3B), maintaining the h-PDMS stamp surface integrity for reuse (fig. S6). Thereafter, the PGS scaffold was carefully delaminated from the Si wafer using a single razor blade (Fig. 1F) and unrolled with sonication treatment in IPA. The microfabrication process was subsequently optimized to produce a scaffold with minimal biomaterial burden and sufficient structural integrity for successful delamination (fig. S7). The final micropatterned ice cube tray scaffold is shown via a schematic (Fig. 1G) and low-magnification photography (Fig. 3C). To assess microstructure quality and uniformity in the final product, we imaged the scaffolds with SEM; top, bottom, and cross-sectional views of the fabricated scaffold revealed precise, neat, and uniform ice cube tray reservoirs with the desired through-hole structures in the base of the scaffold (Fig. 3, D to F). In particular, the microstructure surfaces were smooth with no irregular or elevated edges and minimal structural defects. Furthermore, the final scaffold product had a high microstructure yield (>98%) over a large area (Fig. 3G). A detailed description of the fabrication process for ice cube tray PGS scaffolds can be found in Materials and Methods. Together, the optimized fabrication process for the ice cube tray design achieves a finely tuned balance between three critical and interrelated design criteria: target dimension, minimized biomaterial burden, and structural integrity.

Mechanical compliance of PGS ice cube tray PR scaffolds Since the eye is spherical in shape and outer retinal scaffolds necessarily experience internal and external stresses during delivery to the SRS, an ideal PR scaffold must be not only flexible enough to conform to curved surfaces but also durable enough to withstand local stresses without structural deformation. In addition, the scaffold should return to its original form when local stresses are removed to protect and maintain proper organization of captured cells. To model this, we assessed the mechanical properties of the PGS ice cube tray PR scaffold via finite element analysis and compared them to those of our original wineglass PR scaffold (26) to elucidate mechanical benefits and trade-offs of each design (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Finite element analysis showing equivalent von Mises stress distribution in the PGS scaffolds. (A) Wineglass and (B) ice cube tray design under 5 N of tensile force in the x and y directions: (i) isometric view, (ii) top view, (iii) bottom view, and (iv) orthogonal view. The color bar shows the von Mises stress (in newton per square meter) for an applied tensile force. To determine how the scaffolds with two different designs (wineglass versus ice cube tray) behave under external stresses, we set a fixed constraint to a square area in the center of each design that incorporated nine through-holes. Thereafter, 5 N of tensile force per unit area was applied to the four sides of each scaffold in the x and y directions. As presented in Fig. 4A, the wineglass design had high stress concentrations along the boundary of the fixed constraint, leading to a change in the shape of the scaffold. In contrast, the resulting stress was uniformly and efficiently distributed throughout the ice cube tray scaffold, without causing any appreciable deformation of the scaffold (Fig. 4B), although the ice cube tray design had a higher stress than the wineglass design due to its thinner through-hole layer (i.e., 5 μm versus 10 μm), which largely determines the mechanical properties of the scaffolds because the reservoir layer only consists of very thin reservoir walls (i.e., ≤3 μm). Tensile strength and elastic modulus were also measured to assess the ice cube tray scaffold’s mechanical properties. The modulus of the ice cube tray scaffold was 1.3 MPa, and all microstructures recovered to their original shapes after the tensile stress was removed (fig. S8), indicating favorable pliability for any surgical handling associated with transplantation. These results convincingly demonstrated that the ice cube tray design has superior mechanical properties compared to the wineglass design, both in terms of uniformity of stress distribution and extent of scaffold deformation under a defined tensile stress, two factors that are key for safe and consistent scaffold delivery in vivo.

Scaffold sterilization, stability, and degradation To facilitate cell seeding, we incorporated scaffolds into a commercially available 12-mm polyester transwell cell culture insert (Corning Costar Snapwell, Sigma-Aldrich) before sterilization (Fig. 5, A to C). To mount scaffolds into the insert, we used a 5-mm biopsy punch to create a round hole in the center of the polyester transwell membrane, which is the approximate diameter of the human macula (27). Scaffolds were then mounted in the center of the transwell membrane and secured with soft PDMS as an adhesive (Fig. 5A). Transwell inserts were snapped into holders (Fig. 5B) and placed in a six-well plate (Fig. 5C). Scaffolds were treated with O 2 plasma to enhance the surface hydrophilicity and, thus, microstructure wettability, preventing microbubbles from forming within each capture well (fig. S9) and promoting uniform cell seeding in the capture wells (26, 47, 48). Fig. 5 Generation of PGS ice cube tray PR scaffold constructs.

S10), a process widely used to sterilize delicate medical devices due to its compatibility with a variety of heat- or pressure-sensitive materials (49). In addition, gas sterilization does not melt the tissue culture plastic housing the scaffolds, as occurs during autoclaving. Sterilized scaffolds were pretreated with an extracellular matrix protein substrate (human recombinant Laminin 521, BioLamina) previously shown to optimally facilitate hPSC-PR adhesion in similar culture systems (26). To assess in vitro stability, we monitored scaffolds more than 6 weeks in culture via optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging. During this time, scaffolds did not appreciably degrade, remaining at 100 ± 5.4% of baseline thickness at the 6-week time point. Scaffold degradation within the SRS of nude rats was also examined. Comparable to previously published PGS studies (38, 39), scaffold thickness steadily decreased to 12.6 ± 3.5% of starting scaffold thickness by 2 months after implantation (fig. S11).

PR cell seeding in ice cube tray scaffolds To assess the performance of the PGS ice cube tray PR scaffold in vitro, we used an established protocol to generate retinal organoids from a previously characterized human embryonic stem cell reporter line (WA09-CRX+/tdTomato) that fluorescently labels PRs throughout differentiation and maturation (50). WA09-CRX+/tdTomato retinal organoids were differentiated to late stage 2 (approximately D120 of differentiation) (11) to achieve peak PR differentiation before seeding (11, 50). Retinal organoids were then dissociated to produce a cell suspension containing a high percentage (60 to 80%) of fluorescent CRX+/tdTomato-PRs. Laminin-coated scaffolds were seeded with cell suspensions at several concentrations (1 million, 3 million, 5 million, or 7 million cells per transwell) and cultured for 5 days to assess biocompatibility and determine the minimum number of cells necessary to achieve maximal scaffold carrying capacity (Fig. 5, D and E). Confocal imaging of fixed, immunostained scaffolds confirmed successful seeding and survival of multiple CRX+/tdTomato-expressing PRs in individual wells of laminin-coated PGS ice cube tray scaffolds (Fig. 5D). As shown in Fig. 5E, maximal scaffold carrying capacity (17.8 ± 2.4 CRX+/tdTomato-PRs per well or 1.74 ± 0.24 × 105 CRX+/tdTomato-PRs/mm2) could be achieved by seeding at a concentration of 5 million cells per transwell (total area of transwell, 467 mm2) (Table 2). An optimized seeding concentration of 5 million cells per transwell was thus used for all subsequent experiments. These experiments revealed that the ice cube tray design enabled a 3.4-fold increase in cell-carrying capacity (calculated with eqs. S1 and S2) compared to the original wineglass-shaped PR scaffold design (Table 2). The ice cube tray scaffold also facilitated the capture of a multicellular layer of PRs up to three cell layers thick (average, 2.6 ± 0.7 nuclei layers per well). The differentiated PRs expressed cone-specific (cone arrestin; ARR3) and rod-specific (NR2E3) proteins as expected for hPSC-PRs derived from stage 2 retinal organoids (Fig. 5F) (11). The substantial increase in the cell payload capacity of the ice cube tray design, combined with its decreased overall biomaterial burden, which was 50% less for the ice cube tray design than the wineglass design (calculated with eq. S3), further underscores its relative superiority (Tables 1 and 2). These results represent the highest-density capture of hPSC-PRs for any retinal scaffold described to date. Furthermore, this construct provides a means of exceeding the often-cited threshold of 150,000 PRs within a single scaffold (Table 2), which is the threshold theoretically needed to achieve an electroretinographic response (14, 51).

And natural and working lands underpin our national economy — sustaining our food supply, generating timber and providing wildlife habitat, recreation resources and environmental benefits. But we also believe these stewards of our lands and forests can — and must — find better, more productive ways to address the risks that climate change poses to our future. More innovative federal farm, forest and climate policies must help in that process.

Right now, climate change poses significant risks for farmers and our forests. These include warmer temperatures and extreme weather events that can directly increase the frequency and severity of many types of disturbances, including drought, wildfire and blowdowns, as well as exacerbate pests, diseases and other agents that further increase stress on ecosystems.

Farmers, ranchers and forest landowners can attest to the fact that changing climatic conditions — including earlier start of spring, earlier snowmelt, hotter summer temperatures and prolonged drought — are reducing moisture levels in soil and forest vegetation.

Meanwhile, the spread of pest species like bark beetle, often facilitated by the changing climate, is weakening the resilience of natural ecosystems such as overgrown forests, which themselves are the result of years of fire suppression, coupled with inadequate proactive forest management and restoration. In turn, this leads to more wildfires, more acres burned and longer, more intense fire seasons.

To address these risks, more and more elected officials, corporations and leading electric utilities across the country agree on the importance of achieving “net-zero emissions” by 2050 to safeguard our climate for future generations. We helped form and co chair the farm and forest carbon solutions task force, a coalition of 18 recognized leaders from government, agriculture, forestry, conservation and rural communities committed to fostering open policy dialogue and recommending solutions.

Our group believes that agriculture and forestry stakeholders must be at the table and part of the decision-making for how our nation’s lands can further deliver natural climate solutions, including carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reductions in agriculture and forests. Our goal is to help shape federal policy with recommendations later this year to expand farm and forest carbon solutions as part of broader economic and environmental strategies.

Some of the most feasible and cost-effective ways of reaching a “net-zero emissions” U.S. climate goal involve natural climate solutions from agriculture and forestry that pull and store carbon from the atmosphere. Already, soils, plants and trees absorb about a quarter of man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions around the world and land management activities influence the ability to absorb and sequester that carbon. Research published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that managers adopting the right soil carbon storage practices will enable these landscapes to sequester even more emissions at low costs.

Farm and forest natural carbon solutions can also boost farm incomes and improve broader environmental outcomes in agriculture and forestry. In fact, these soil carbon practices can strengthen U.S. agricultural production by building resilience to climate impacts, reducing input costs, increasing yields and improving water quality.

Natural solutions also provide many spinoff environmental benefits. Removing carbon from the atmosphere is only one of many services provided by forests, grasslands and agricultural landscapes. Other benefits include cleaner water, cleaner air, biodiversity, wood products, wildlife habitat, food and recreation opportunities.

The United States Congress should take advantage of ways to invest in farm and forest policies that use natural solutions to address climate change. Next year’s farm bill will be a key opportunity to identify smart policies that work for producers and for the climate. The recommendations from our task force are intended to provide members of Congress, agency officials and other policymakers with a roadmap for scaling public and private investments in carbon storage and emissions reductions as well as reducing barriers to voluntary stewardship practices.

Already, we have identified a common set of guiding principles for our work that include pursuing strategies that are voluntary and incentive-based, align with the economic and environmental goals of working lands, are flexible to the needs of diverse production systems and producers, foster partnerships with the private sector and are based on a commitment to delivering measurable results.

We know our nation’s lands can help deliver many new natural climate solutions. These include removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it, making greenhouse gas emissions reductions through agriculture and forestry and improving the profitability of producer operations while helping rural economies. We look forward to working with America’s farmers, ranchers, foresters, businesses, environmental advocates and all interested parties so that together we can make our lands more productive and an even bigger part of the climate solution.

38,38,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Laser-based temperature control to study the roles of entropy and enthalpy in polymer-nanopore interactions - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf5462,"Single-molecule approaches for probing the free energy of confinement for polymers in a nanopore environment are critical for the development of nanopore biosensors. We developed a laser-based nanopore heating approach to monitor the free energy profiles of such a single-molecule sensor. Using this approach, we measure the free energy profiles of two distinct polymers, polyethylene glycol and water-soluble peptides, as they interact with the nanopore sensor. Polyethylene glycol demonstrates a retention mechanism dominated by entropy with little sign of interaction with the pore, while peptides show an enthalpic mechanism, which can be attributed to physisorption to the nanopore (e.g., hydrogen bonding). To manipulate the energetics, we introduced thiolate-capped gold clusters [Au 25 (SG) 18 ] into the pore, which increases the charge and leads to additional electrostatic interactions that help dissect the contribution that enthalpy and entropy make in this modified environment. These observations provide a benchmark for optimization of single-molecule nanopore sensors.

To overcome the challenges of static, external temperature-control methods, we used a laser-based heating approach ( 31 ) that allows dynamic control of the local temperature. Optical heating can be achieved through direct excitation of the vibrational modes in water with infrared light ( 31 , 32 ) or indirectly through nanoplasmonic-assisted heating ( 33 , 34 ) and excitation of electronic modes in semiconductor materials ( 35 ). This work will focus on direct infrared heating that has been used to demonstrate thermal control of DNA unzipping for nanopore analysis ( 31 , 35 ). Using dynamic control, data for nearly continuous Arrhenius plots can be collected in short times (≈10 s). We demonstrate this technique by directly measuring the enthalpy and entropy components of the free energy for polymer escape for small peptides and polyethylene glycol (PEG) from the α-hemolysin (αHL) pore and the Au 25 (SG) 18 -modified αHL complex. The analysis here uses a self-consistent picture of the energetic landscape by connecting the free energy difference between the polymer in the pore and the polymer in the bulk (i.e., partition coefficient) to the free energies of polymer capture and escape. This connection yields a relationship between the polymer residence time kinetics and the free energy of escape from the pore, which provides a more complete picture of the interactions that are critical for the optimization of a nanopore sensor.

While most work discusses entropy as the dominant contributor to the free energy barrier ( 9 , 21 , 22 ), there is evidence that enthalpy can play a critical role, particularly in modified systems that enhance the electrostatic interactions available within the pore ( 23 , 24 ). One successful approach to separating the thermodynamic components used the replacement of weakly interacting cations, such as K + , with a noninteracting cation (i.e., Li + ) ( 25 ). However, a more direct method would be to measure polymer-nanopore kinetics as a function of temperature to construct Arrhenius plots from which the enthalpy and entropy can be unambiguously extracted. Although temperature control of a nanopore apparatus is available through infrared lamps, or sealed Peltier devices, the cumbersome and slow nature of these experiments (i.e., temperature changes over minute time scales) has limited the number of detailed thermal studies to just a few examples ( 26 – 31 ).

Using the Fokker-Plank equations ( 12 – 14 ) and detailed analysis of polymer theory ( 15 , 16 ), connections can be made between polymer-pore dynamics and the free energy barrier for a polymer to escape the nanopore ( 6 ). Subsequently, a large number of reports have studied polymer nanopore interactions providing both detailed coarse-grained models for the potential well ( 15 , 17 – 19 ) and chemically specific analytical models ( 20 ). The most comprehensive models for the free energy of a polymer confined in a nanopore included potential energies from excluded volume effect, vibrational modes of the intermolecular bonds, external electric fields and electrostatic interactions ( 19 ). Further extensions have included the interactions of the polymer with solvent and electrolyte components as well ( 20 ), which provides the ability to model voltage-dependent effects for neutral polymers in nanopores.

Nanopore-based resistive pulse sensing is an effective tool for single-molecule analysis ( 7 , 8 ). This sensing provides label-free and high-throughput (~10 events/s to 100 events/s) detection, as well as the ability to modify the local environment (such as the force via voltage and temperature in some cases). Effective resistive-pulse sensing requires that molecules spend a measurable amount of time within the pore so that the corresponding current blockades are easily measurable. Given the typical pore dimensions (≈5 nm), a molecule that experiences no interactions with the pore should escape in less than 1 μs. Thus, for molecules to be observed in the pore with a low-pass cutoff frequency of 10 kHz, there must be a free energy barrier against escape that can be parameterized by enthalpic and entropic components ( 9 ). Characterizing this free energy barrier offers insight into the mechanism for retention of polymer analytes in nanopore sensors and molecular mechanisms of membrane transport proteins ( 10 ), which can improve precision, understanding, and optimization of nanopore sensing systems. Moreover, this characterization can more broadly elucidate about the mechanisms dictating solute transport through transmembrane channels ( 11 ).

The study of polymer energetics in nanoporous systems began in earnest in the 1970s with investigations of partition coefficients of macromolecules into zeolites and gels among other nanoporous materials ( 1 ). This spawned theoretical investigations into the static and dynamic properties of confined polymer chains ( 2 , 3 ). This work focused on applying scaling laws toward understanding intrapore diffusion coefficients and polymer partitioning coefficients, both of which could be studied with techniques that used bulk porous materials to measure the ensemble properties of the molecules. While these ensemble methods provided critical insight into polymer-pore interactions, the advent of single-molecule nanopore sensing ( 4 – 6 ) provides a platform for the study of polymer-pore dynamics on a more fundamental level.

RESULTS

Theoretical background Here, we model the polymer-pore interaction with a free energy profile along an unspecified reaction coordinate. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of this free energy profile in and around the nanopore. This energy profile contains three distinct levels: a bulk solution level, a pore occupied level, and a transition level between these two states that serves to limit entry and exit of polymer analyte into and away from the pore. Our goal is to extract the enthalpy and entropy components of the transition barrier using a laser-based heating methodology. To better understand the relative magnitude of these three levels, we begin with room temperature estimates of the free energy difference between the bulk and pore occupied states (ΔG0 total ). This can be found from the polymer partition coefficient Π = 1 N A V pore C bulk τ in τ total = exp ( Δ G total 0 k B T ) (1)where N A is Avogadro’s number, V pore is the pore volume, C bulk is the polymer concentration in the bulk solution, τ in is the total occupation time of analyte in the pore, τ total is the total measurement time, k B is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute temperature. This definition of the partition coefficient normalizes out the pore volume, which means that Π is a measure of the lifetime of a polymer in the pore compared to a polymer in a pore-sized volume in bulk solution. This convention leads to a partition coefficient greater than 1 and thus a free energy of polymer occupation in the pore greater than the bulk, as used previously by others (36, 37). In addition, we note that all analysis throughout is performed at a single applied potential (70 mV) and each free energy value is to be interpreted as corresponding to that applied potential (i.e., ΔG0 total = ΔG0 total at 70 mV). Fig. 1 Proposed free energy scheme for polymer capture and release from a nanopore. Analyte from outside the pore overcomes a barrier ΔG‡ on to enter the pore. Analyte resides inside the pore in a lower energy state relative to the bulk. Escape from the pore back into the bulk solution requires overcoming the free energy barrier to escape ΔG‡ off . This study focuses on laser-based extraction of the entropy and enthalpy components of ΔG‡ off . See the main text for a discussion on estimates of ΔG‡ on and ΔG0 total . The free energy barrier to be captured by the pore (ΔG‡ on ) can be estimated from the on-rate capture of polymer into the pore k on using the seminal Berg-Purcell relation (38) k on = 4 DaC bulk exp ( − Δ G on ‡ k B T ) (2) Here, D is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte and a is the pore radius. For the purposes of this analysis, we neglect any modification of the diffusion coefficient for polymers near the pore entrance where the applied field will cause drift-dominated flow. A more complete description of the on-rate kinetic process and connection to the free energy of capture can be found elsewhere (39). To estimate the relative magnitude of the different energy barriers used herein, we performed nanopore measurements on polydisperse PEG, monodisperse PEG with 28 repeat units (PEG 28 ), and the three peptides angiotensin 1 (AT1), angiotensin 2 (AT2), and neurotensin (NT) under various solution conditions at room temperature. A complete description of experimental conditions along with a summary of results for the free energy barriers can be found in the Supplemental Materials. These values are in reasonable agreement with previous measurements (25) and, as we outline below, provide a means to extract the entropic and enthalpic components of the free energy barrier to escape from the pore. Residence time blockade distributions are well described by single exponential functions that allow us to treat the polymer-nanopore system as a chemical interaction with a simplified transition-state reaction scheme (20, 40). Thus, the mean blockade residence time and the free energy barrier to analyte escape ΔG‡ off are related by the following expression τ = τ 0 ( T ) exp ( Δ G off ‡ k B T ) (3) Here, τ 0 is the attempt time to escape from the pore, which will depend on the solution temperature (20). The enthalpic, ΔH‡ off , and entropic, ΔS‡ off , components of the free energy barrier to escape can be found from the slope and intercept of the natural log of the mean residence time versus the inverse temperature as follows ln ( τ τ 0 ) = Δ G off ‡ k B ( 1 T ) = Δ H off ‡ k B ( 1 T ) − Δ S off ‡ k B (4) Thus, the mean residence time, normalized by the attempt time measured at various temperatures, can be used to estimate the entropy and enthalpy of the free energy barrier for polymer escape from the pore. Calculating the attempt time can be difficult and model dependent (41), which limits the effectiveness of Eq. 3 to extract ΔH‡ off and ΔS‡ off . To address this, we note that the predetermined values for ΔG0 total and ΔG‡ on from Eqs. 1 and 2 and the fact that ΔG‡ off = ΔG0 total + ΔG‡ on (see Fig. 1) can be used to fix values for the estimated attempt time at room temperature. In brief, the attempt time becomes an adjustable parameter so that the entropy and enthalpy components extracted from Eq. 4 are in agreement with the ΔG‡ off value found from Eqs. 1 and 2 (i.e., ΔG‡ off = ΔH‡ off − TΔS‡ off ). A more complete description of the attempt time estimates and the temperature dependence of the attempt time used throughout this manuscript are provided in the Supplemental Materials.

Experimental background Constructing Arrhenius plots described in Eq. 4 requires the ability to heat the solution temperature in and around the nanopore. Here, we use a laser-based heating mechanism, which offers several improvements over bulk heating methods. Rapid control of local temperatures with infrared light can avoid some of the instabilities in protein and membrane systems often encountered in single-molecule nanopore devices. Figure 2A illustrates the principle of operation. A 1444-nm laser was intensity-modulated with a sinusoidal waveform at 0.25 Hz by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) and directed to the back aperture of a microscope objective (4×, numerical aperture 0.2) that focused the light onto a lipid bilayer membrane containing a single αHL pore. At this wavelength, water absorbs infrared light (α ≈ 30 cm−1), which provides heating within the laser focal spot (V focal ≈ 10 pl). To investigate intra-pore thermodynamics, two well-characterized polymer systems—PEG and peptides (AT1, AT2, and NT)—and negatively charged glutathione-capped gold nanoclusters [Au 25 (SG) 18 ] were investigated. Both molecules and clusters interact with the nanopore, reversibly allowing for the ionic current to be monitored for extended periods of time. Au 25 (SG) 18 reduces the conductance by approximately 25% with mean residence times on the order of tens of seconds (Fig. 2B). The presence of these clusters in the pore leads to a 20-fold increase of the polymer residence time in the pore and thus improves the prospects of nanopore sensing near-neutral polymers (8). However, the mechanism for this cluster-induced enhancement remains unclear and partially motivates the free energy studies here. Fig. 2 Illustration of the experimental setup and corresponding heating traces. (A) Schematic representation of the experimental setup. (B) Typical current trace for PEG 28 interacting with the nanopore as Au-cluster partition, into and out of the vestibule of αHL. (C) and (D) show the temperature-calibrated current for PEG 28 and AT1, respectively, as the polymers interact with the open pore. The current (and temperature) is modulated by the infrared laser through one period of oscillation. (E) PEG-αHL residence time distributions are shown at 24°C with a Au-cluster (filled square) and open pore (open square) configuration. (F) AT1-αHL residence time distributions are shown at 24°C with a Au-cluster (filled square) and open pore (open square) configuration. Data shown were collected in 3 M KCl under 70 mV applied transmembrane potential. Ground voltage is referenced to the trans-side of the pore throughout all experiments. Error bars in (E) and (F) are estimated from 1 SD calculated as the square root of the counts. To extract the enthalpic and entropic free energy components, ionic current is recorded at room temperature to produce a baseline data point in the Arrhenius plot; we then modulate the laser intensity resulting in open pore current between approximately 200 and 350 pA. The open pore current can then be used to estimate the temperature using a second-order polynomial that converts the open pore current to temperature (27, 31, 33) (more details can be found in the Supplemental Materials). This corresponds to a temperature range of approximately 25° to 50°C (27, 31, 33). We can assign a residence time, blockade depth, and solution temperature to each blockade event. This conversion is highlighted in Fig. 2 (C and D) for both PEG 28 and AT1 under open channel conditions. A similar calibration scheme is used when Au 25 (SG) 18 clusters are confined in the pore (Supplementary Materials). The defining characteristics of the polymer-induced blockades are the magnitude of the current interruption (i.e., blockade depth) and the residence time. The peptides and PEG samples analyzed here produce well-resolved featureless blockades from which the blockade depth can be used to estimate the polymer size (42). Here, the residence time was used to examine the role of thermodynamic properties of the molecules in detecting and characterizing the polymers. To justify using simplified models for the characterization of a polymer, we first measured the residence time distribution of PEG 28 and AT1 at two temperatures (Fig. 2, E and F, respectively). In every case, the blockade distribution is well described by a single exponential decay that allows us to treat the polymer-nanopore interaction as a chemical interaction with a simplified transition-state reaction scheme (i.e., Eq. 3) (20, 40). To create Arrhenius plots, resistive pulses were recorded for approximately 5 min during a temperature sinusoidal modulation (period = 0.25 Hz). The residence time τ was then calculated for temperatures binned with approximately 0.4 K precision (see Supplementary Materials for details). The resulting data were then plotted and analyzed to extract the enthalpy and entropy of the free energy barrier to polymer escape. Figure 3 illustrates the advantages of the laser-driven temperature control (dynamic control); AT1 was observed with laser-based heating and compared to a similar experiment using static-Peltier control temperature control. The purpose of this comparison was to ensure that the dynamic laser-based temperature modulation does not produce any unexpected systematic biases. The agreement between the laser-based heating and the bulk solution heating suggests that the laser heater does not introduce spurious artifacts (i.e., through convective flow or radiative transfer) into the system. We note that because the data collection (including temperature equilibration between points) required more than 30 min to generate a dataset that contained three discrete data points, replicate measurements for bulk temperature manipulation are typically prohibitive. Fig. 3 Comparison of Arrhenius plots for bulk heating and laser-based heating. Arrhenius plots produced by the laser-based dynamic (open symbols, three different pores) and Peltier-based bulk (filled black circles, one pore) heating protocols show consistency between the methods. The solid lines are least squares linear fits to each dataset. The static heating conditions correspond to temperature control via a PID-controlled Peltier device embedded in the analysis chamber. The dynamic heating conditions correspond to temperature control via a 1444-nm laser modulated with an AOM. The static experiments produced three discrete temperatures. The error bars for the static datasets were estimated from the standard deviation of observed residence times. Representative data are from AT1 at 70 mV in 3 M KCl (pH 7.2).

Ionic strength dependence for homopolymer PEG: Open pore Clearly, the dynamic heating methodology presented herein provides another, more sensitive, tool to probe polymer-pore interactions. As a first demonstration of dynamic analysis, we focus on the free energy components of PEG confinement in an αHL pore as a function of the solvent ionic strength. The αHL pore is the workhorse of the biological nanopore sensing community. It has been well characterized and consists of a trans-side lumen and cis-side vestibule separated by a constriction ring with diameter ≈1.5 nm (43). Previous estimates of the trans-side lumen volume, where polymers will reside throughout our measurements, range from 10 to 50 nm3 (44). Here, we model the pore lumen as a right circular cylinder with an average pore diameter of 2.2 nm and a length of 5.5 nm, yielding an overall pore volume (trans-side lumen) of 21 nm3. Previous work has shown that PEG residence times in the αHL pore depend strongly on the ionic strength and nature of the electrolyte (25, 45–47). Given the connection between increasing the residence time and the efficacy of a nanopore sensor, understanding the mechanism connecting ionic strength and residence time represents an ideal example of the use of dynamic heating to better understand the nanopore as a sensor. Potassium chloride has been thoroughly studied and shown to weakly interact with PEG (20). In nanopore spectroscopy, this association leads to an increase of PEG residence time in the nanopore with the effect increasing with cation concentration (20, 40). The molecular mechanism for the increased retention time is unclear. Speculation on the mechanism has suggested increased interaction strength between the polymer and the pore (47, 48), decreased solubility of the polymer as the solvent stops behaving as a good solvent (25), or changes in the entropic barrier to transport (49–52). The temperature-dependent studies here shed light on the mechanism. We note that the limited range of ionic strengths reported here (3.0 < [KCl] < 3.8 M) results from the fact that KCl crashes out of solution at higher ionic strength (KCl maximum solubility ≈ 4 M in the presence of PEG) and PEG residence times at elevated temperatures fall well below the inverse detection bandwidth of our system (B−1 = 100 μs) for [KCl] < 3.0. Nevertheless, compelling results can be seen over our reported concentration range. It is well established that the residence time for PEG increases with ionic strength (20, 25, 45, 46, 53). This phenomenon is primarily due to the interaction of cations with the polymer molecule and confirmed here in Fig. 4A, which shows that the PEG 28 residence time of both the open pore (blue) and cluster-occupied pore (orange) grows with increasing ionic strength. This behavior can be understood from the overall free energy of escape as a function of ionic strength in Fig. 4B, which has been attributed to a microscopic description in which PEG forms a complex with K+ to PEG-K+ n that imparts polyelectrolyte-type properties on the polymer (20, 40). Under this scenario, we can model the escape barrier into entropic contributions related to tension along the molecule as it exits the pore through the region where the local electric field is largest (54). This alters the enthalpic barrier by reducing the mean coordination number of the ions bound to the polymer. When the escape barrier is separated into enthalpic (Fig. 4C) and entropic (Fig. 4D) contributions, it is apparent that ionic strength alters the contribution of both enthalpy and entropy for both the open pore (blue) and the gold cluster occupied pore (orange) as well. While the residence time increases for the PEG with cation concentration, the enthalpic component of the PEG-pore interaction decreases (Fig. 4C). This is counterintuitive if the dominant interaction is a van der Waals interaction between the pore and the polymer. However, we note that the entropic component of the escape barrier increases with ionic strength (Fig. 4D) (here, the entropy component is scaled as −TΔS‡ off to facilitate comparison with the enthalpic component). We can attribute reduced significance of ΔH‡ off to charge screening by the electrolyte and −TΔS‡ off to increased stiffness of the polymer as it binds more cations in the transition region between the bulk and pore. This combination leads to an increasing residence time with increasing ionic strength provided that the rate of change for the entropy exceeds that of the enthalpy, which it does in this case. Given the positive correlation between PEG residence time and ionic strength (25, 40, 45, 53), it appears that the entropic component of the free energy barrier is the critical factor in determining PEG-pore interactions as ionic strength is increased in a pore that has little to no excess charge. Fig. 4 Mean residence time and free energy contributions (enthalpy and entropy) of the escape barrier for the open pore (blue) and cluster-occupied pore (orange) for PEG 28 as a function of KCl salt concentration. (A) The mean residence time increases with increasing ionic strength and the mean residence time increases by about an order of magnitude with a cluster present in the pore. (B) ΔG‡ off shows similar trends to the residence time behavior, validating the thermodynamic description of the PEG-pore kinetics. (C) ΔH‡ off increases with the gold in the pore and partially explains the gold cluster behavior. (D) ΔS‡ off (scaled as −TΔS‡ off , T = 297 K) increases with ionic strength, which explains the residence time dependence and shows that the entropic component dominates the open pore behavior. In addition, the gold cluster in the pore reduces the entropic component, and this can be understood by the fact that the cluster modifies the confined volume within the pore. See the main text for details. All data were taken in KCl electrolyte buffered to pH 7.2 with tris under a 70-mV applied transmembrane potential. Each data point corresponds to weighted averages over three different pores, and the error bars correspond to ±1 standard error (SE). The solid and dashed lines are guides to the eye only. To check the validity of these reported values for ΔH‡ off and −TΔS‡ off , we use simplified models for the energetic components confining the polymer to the pore. Beginning with the enthalpy component, we note that the PEG is confined to the trans lumen region of the pore under an applied transmembrane field. Previous numerical studies have shown that in the ionic strength conditions reported here, PEG 28 weakly binds about 2e of charge (40). Under an applied 70-mV transmembrane field, the charge will be confined only partway across this potential drop [i.e., the PEG only experiences ca. 30% of the field drop in the trans lumen region of the pore (54)]. From this, we can estimate ΔH‡ off = 0.3qV app = 4.2 kJ/mol, which is in reasonable agreement with the values reported in Fig. 4C. In addition, the entropic component of the polymer transition barrier can be estimated from the free energy required to completely stretch a polymer chain TΔS‡ off = r2k B T/(nb2), where r is the average end-to-end distance of the polymer, n is the polymer repeat number, and b is the size of each monomer subunit (55). For PEG 28 , we have the following parameters: r = 2.1 nm, n = 28, and b = 0.1464 nm (56, 57), which yield −TΔS‡ off = 6.8 k B T = 16.8 kJ/mol at room temperature. As with the enthalpic change, this too is in reasonable agreement with the reported values in Fig. 4D. These results verify our kinetic approach to estimating the enthalpy and entropy components of the free energy barrier to polymer escape.

Ionic strength dependence for homopolymer PEG: Cluster-occupied pore In addition to the open pore analysis, we performed thermodynamic analysis for the gold cluster–occupied pore and found that enthalpy is increased nearly fourfold with respect to the open pore case and the entropy is reduced in the presence of the gold. We believe that these two observations can be understood by the fact that clusters add two additional barriers to transport: an increased entropic barrier at the constriction point of the αHL β barrel (43) and an enthalpic change due to Coulombic interaction between the cation-bound PEG and the negatively charged gold clusters. It appears that the Coulombic attraction dominates even under extremely high ionic strength conditions. This may be explained by the fact that increasing ionic strength increases the number of cations bound to the PEG and thus the attraction between the PEG and gold cluster. Regardless of the exact mechanism, Fig. 4 highlights two important conclusions. The first is that for the open pore, the entropic component of the free energy barrier to escape for PEG appears to dominate the kinetics and suggests that to increase the PEG residence time, one should focus on the polymer degrees of freedom both inside the pore and in the transition region between the pore and bulk solution. The second conclusion is that although entropy drives the PEG-pore interaction, it is possible to modify the enthalpy (via charge) to increase the PEG-pore interaction time, which is a route to superior size selectivity by the pore (30, 58).

Polydisperse PEG The results in Fig. 4 focus on one particular PEG size (n = 28). However, a benefit from the single-molecule analysis is the ability to isolate data from precise polymer sizes. With individual n-mers of PEG resolved, the relative energetic contributions can be expressly estimated for each monomer-length increase in the polymer (Fig. 5). To achieve sufficient resolution, ionic current was recorded with static laser power until a sufficient number of molecules were observed to characterize the residence time for n-mers ranging from n = 18 to n = 40. The data were processed and binned in a two-dimensional histogram (Fig. 5A). A more thorough discussion on the construction of the histogram in Fig. 5A can be found in the Supplementary Materials. Fig. 5 The free energy profile of polydisperse PEG in the open pore configuration reveals size-dependent shifts in the free energy components. (A) Two-dimensional histogram of a PEG mixture provides a range of discrete polymer data. (B) Residence time of the extracted data as a function of temperature. (C) Relative contributions of ΔH‡ off (red) and −TΔS‡ off (cyan) to the Gibbs free energy at 297 K. All data were collected in 3.5 M KCl with an applied potential of 70 mV. The solid gray line shows the overall free energy of escape calculated from the entropy and enthalpy components. This shows that the entropic component of the free energy dominates the enthalpic component as PEG size increases. The polydisperse PEG mixture consists of PEG2000:PEG1000:PEG 28 at 10 μM:10 μM:2 μM concentrations. The error bars in (C) correspond to ±1 SD calculated from n = 3 different pores. To extract the thermodynamic information, the residence time was measured at seven static temperatures with laser heating (Fig. 5B) and the thermodynamic information was calculated from these values. Previous work suggests that PEG is excluded from the pore by the entropic-spring effect that becomes dominant at ≈3000 g/mol or n ≈ 68 (46), which corresponds to an estimate of the largest PEG molecule that completely fits in the β barrel ≈3400 g/mol (n ≈ 77) (30). We stress that the data presented here are well below this pore-filling regime, yet it shows a appreciable shift in the energetics of the polymer-pore system. As shown previously (20), ΔG‡ off for the polymer capture smoothly increases with increasing polymer size. However, a closer inspection shows that ΔH‡ off decreases with polymer size in a nonlinear fashion while the entropic term, −TΔS‡ off (at 297 K), increases at an approximately 50% higher rate (Fig. 5C). These data show a subtle transition in the behavior of the polymer from an enthalpic-dominated process for small molecules to an entropic-dominated process as the polymer exceeds n = 25. In this regime, the diameter of the polymer is approximately equal to the diameter of the β barrel at its widest point and 1.3 times the diameter at the narrowest constriction in the pore (43) as estimated by the hydrodynamic radius of PEG in bulk solution under good solvent conditions [2R h = 2.0 nm for n = 27 (57, 59)]. The increase in –TΔS‡ off with polymer size is attributed to the difference between entropy in the pore and entropy as the polymer leaves the pore. Thus, the polymer degrees of freedom increase more rapidly with increasing polymer size inside the pore than through the transition state, which is consistent with a model where the polymer is stretched in the electric field through the escape transition. Conversely, ΔH‡ off decreases with increasing polymer size, which seems counterintuitive. One would expect larger polymers to chelate more cations and thus increase the enthalpic barrier to escape. However, this is not the case and could be attributed to a combination of charge repulsion between bound cations on the PEG chain and other effects related to the transition out of the pore that may impede the ability for larger polymers to chelate additional cations in the transition state. Overall, the ability to separate the entropic and enthalpic components of the free energy barrier to PEG escape highlights the fact that the mechanism that causes the increasing residence time with increasing PEG mass is dominated by the entropic component of the free energy barrier, which was also observed for the case of homopolymer PEG in different ionic strength solutions. The laser-based heating approach provides a sensitive tool to explore these free energy components and better understand the mechanisms that drive polymer-pore interactions.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf5462/F1.large.jpg,"['free', 'polymernanopore', 'barrier', 'roles', 'enthalpy', 'interactions', 'energy', 'entropy', 'residence', 'laserbased', 'polymer', 'temperature', 'peg', 'study', 'pore', 'fig', 'control', 'nanopore']",

Less well known is their influence on material chemistry. The severe lattice distortion at these defects drives solute segregation to them, resulting in strong, localized spatial variations in chemistry that determine microstructure and material behavior. Recent advances in atomic-scale characterization methods have made it possible to quantitatively resolve defect types and segregation chemistry. As shown here for a Pt-Au model alloy, we observe a wide range of defect-specific solute (Au) decoration patterns of much greater variety and complexity than expected from the Cottrell cloud picture. The solute decoration of the dislocations can be up to half an order of magnitude higher than expected from classical theory, and the differences are determined by their structure, mutual alignment, and distortion field. This opens up pathways to use dislocations for the compositional and structural nanoscale design of advanced materials.

Dislocations play a fundamental role in the mechanical behavior of many materials ( 1 , 2 ). They often form three-dimensional (3D) networks, with a total length that can reach 1 light-year per cubic meter in metals and semiconductors. Having been studied for nearly a century ( 3 , 4 ), much is known about their mechanical character and behavior. Much less well characterized, however, is their interaction with, and influence on, the material chemistry. Probing and understanding the interplay between structure and chemistry is essential as it influences many material properties, often by orders of magnitude ( 5 , 6 ), ranging from catastrophic embrittlement in steels ( 7 – 9 ) to enhanced phonon scattering in thermoelectrics ( 10 , 11 ). To fully understand these interactions, one needs atomic-scale resolution, both in experiments ( 2 , 6 , 12 – 16 ) and modeling/simulation ( 1 , 17 – 23 ). When studying these phenomena in a Pt-Au model system, we made an unexpected discovery: Unlike the expected cloud-like, quasi-random distribution of solute atoms around dislocations suggested by Cottrell and Bilby ( 2 ) over 70 years ago, there is no simple solute decoration of dislocation cores. Instead, we find a wide range of decoration states deviating from the bulk composition. More specifically, a wide range of segregation amounts (enrichment factors from 2.9 up to 8.5) has been observed, all higher than the value of 2.2 predicted by classical theory ( 24 ) for the case of Cottrell segregation to an edge dislocation in Pt-Au. Such a strong dependence of solute segregation behavior on defect type, lying behind their hidden chemical nature, has not previously been elucidated. This is carried out in the current work with the help of atomistic simulations, enabling a systematic study of the effect of defect type on segregation behavior and local solubility. We found that in an otherwise homogeneous solid solution, each defect configuration exhibits its own specific segregation state that deviates, in some cases, by up to one order of magnitude from the bulk composition (see defect segregation levels marked on top of the bulk phase diagram in Fig. 1 ). These findings show a much stronger influence of defects on the local chemical composition than expected based on theory ( 24 ). Thus, they have a profound influence on all material properties determined by the interplay of chemistry and defects. In the following, a short summary of methods is presented, followed by a detailed discussion on each of the observed defects and their local chemistry.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We magnetron-sputtered a 1-μm thin-film Pt–7 atomic % (at %) Au sample to form a homogeneous solid-solution alloy. The free-standing samples were heat-treated at 1300 K for 15 min to trigger Au segregation to the defects. Correlative transmission electron microscopy (TEM)–precession electron diffraction (PED) and atom probe tomography (APT) (25–27) are used for quantitative structural and chemical analyses. Complementary diffusive molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations (18–20) based on the embedded atom method (EAM) potential for Pt-Au from (28) provides further insight into these observations, in particular, into the relations between segregation morphology, defect type, and the defect stress field. See the Supplementary Materials for the details of sample preparation and simulation setup.

In Fig. 1A, linear and disc-like regions (pointed by arrows) indicate lattice imperfections. The gray arrow in Fig. 1A points to a low-angle grain boundary (LAGB) and the other colored arrows to distinct dislocations. Together, the local orientation spread (LOS) map (Fig. 1B) and the atom probe reconstruction (Fig. 1, C and D) determine the identity of these features. The APT data were taken from the region enclosed by the green dashed line in Fig. 1C. APT reconstruction (Fig. 1D) determines the morphology of the regions of segregated Au associated with different defects. APT crystallographic analysis identifies four defect types: (i) dislocation array in a LAGB, (ii) free-standing glissile dislocation, (iii) stacking fault tetrahedron (SFT), and (iv) Frank loop. Figure 1E shows Au at % profiles across these defects in the corresponding colored boxes in Fig. 1D. Figure 1F (top row) displays a symbol (left), an APT reconstruction (middle), and a DMD simulation result (right) for each defect type. The upper and lower limits of solute segregation to these defects are reported in the Supplementary Materials (fig. S3).

In the binary Pt-Au phase diagram in Fig. 1F (below), the red star marks the bulk alloy composition (vertical line) and temperature (horizontal line) that was used to allow Au segregation and equilibration at the defects. The vertical lines below each defect type indicate the corresponding local Au at %. Au segregation to the defects shown varies from approximately 29 at % for a dislocation array in a LAGB to 63 at % for a Frank loop. This reveals two points: First, the magnitude of the segregation depends strongly on the hosting defect type. Second, it is not only the generic individual structure of the defect that determines the decoration but also its exact topological arrangement, through the associated distortion fields. The diffusion length of Au in Pt is about 1.0 μm (1300 K, 15 min), using D τ and a diffusivity of Au in Pt of D = 1.1 × 10−15 m2/s (29). Because this is far above the defect extension and spacing considered here, the Au at % can be regarded as being equilibrated, with steady-state values.

Low-angle grain boundary As shown in Fig. 1F, Au segregates to parallel linear defects in the LAGB. The low-angle character of the boundary was determined by electron diffraction and confirmed by the pole patterns obtained from the atom probe crystallographic analysis (fig. S4). On the basis of the PED results, the LAGB has a misorientation of 2.5° with a tilt component of 2.4° and a twist component of 0.1°. On the basis of the morphology of the experimental Au segregation region (Fig. 2, B to D) and DMD simulation results (Fig. 2, E and F), the parallel linear defect microstructure in the LAGB is interpreted to represent an array of edge and mixed dislocations, in agreement with classical theory (24). More specifically, as shown in Fig. 2A, on the basis of the APT crystallographic analysis, parallel lenticular (cross-sectional view) Au segregation regions (Fig. 2B) lie in the ( 11 1 ¯ ) plane, a common slip plane family in the face-centered cubic (fcc) system. The dislocation array aligns at 30° to the glide plane normal as shown in Fig. 2C. The quantitative Au at % profiles (Fig. 2D) indicate that the region of segregated Au is about 3 nm wide in the direction normal, and about 8 nm wide in the direction parallel, to the array plane. From the Au at % profile along ξ ⃑ [ 2 1 ¯ 1 ] (black) in Fig. 2D, we found that the dislocation in this LAGB has a segregation range of 18 to 29 at % Au. Such variation in segregation level may be due to atomic-scale features such as kinks or jogs along the dislocation lines. We also observed some solute depletion regions, e.g., in profiles normal to the plane of the dislocation array (red) and normal to the dislocation array in the array plane (blue) in Fig. 2D. For instance, the minimum Au content in the red Au % profile is about 5 at % lower than the bulk composition.

For comparison, an Au at % profile in defect-free bulk crystal (yellow) is also displayed. (E) Atomic virial hydrostatic stress field and (F) segregated Au at % for the model dislocation array in (A) predicted by DMD simulation. The gray bars in (B), (C), (E), and (F) indicate a length of 5 nm. Minimum and maximum Au at % values (averaged in voxel units of 0.63 nm3) are 3.1 and 13.6, respectively. Color contouring is cropped for better visualization. Simulation results are also presented for an array of dissociated dislocations in the Supplementary Materials. To gain further insight, corresponding DMD simulations have been carried out for dislocation arrays consisting of both single-sign and dipole configurations. Because the latter configuration results in segregated Au distributions in better qualitative agreement with the experimental observations, the dislocation dipole array is a more likely configuration for this LAGB. More specifically, the experimental dipole configuration is interpreted as a combination of pure-edge and mixed dislocations (Fig. 2, A, E, and F), resulting in a tilt angle between adjacent grains of φ = b/d = 1.9° (30). This value is comparable to the experimental value of 2.4°. As shown in Fig. 2E, the stress field of such a dipole results in maximum Au segregation to the regions between each monopole (Fig. 2F) where the hydrostatic stress is positive (note that the lattice constant a 0 of Au is 4% larger than that of Pt). Au depletion (Fig. 2E) occurs in regions with negative hydrostatic stress (Fig. 2F). For better visualization, the range in Fig. 2F is limited to values between 4 and 9 at % Au. The minimum and maximum Au at % values (averaged in voxel units of 0.63 nm3) are 3.1 and 13.6, respectively. Note that the maximum of 13.6 at % Au predicted by DMD is substantially lower than the experimentally observed value of 24 at % Au obtained from a cross section normal to the dislocation line vector ξ ⃑ [ 2 1 ¯ 1 ] (Fig. 2C). One reason for the deviation between experiment and prediction may be the inaccuracy of the EAM potential from (28) used in the DMD simulations. In particular, the values of the elastic constants of pure Pt and Au predicted by this potential are smaller than the experimental values, resulting in a lower stress field and less segregation. Besides this, the close spacing of the defects may result in an experimental value for local average Au at %, which is larger (e.g., 9 at % for the same box as DMD around the LAGB) than the 7 at % (i.e., bulk value) assumed in the DMD simulations. In addition, the DMD simulations are carried out at lower and fixed average composition (i.e., rather than fixed chemical potential), which also results in less segregation compared to experiments. Increasing the average Au at % in the simulation indeed results in more segregated Au (e.g., 12.3 at % bulk composition would result in a segregation value of about 24 at % to LAGB). Moreover, we investigated a few possible dislocation configurations in the LAGB and identified one that results in a good qualitative match to the experimentally observed segregation distribution. In real materials, local dislocation configurations can be more complicated. For instance, multiple types of dislocation pairs may be present in a given LAGB, in addition to the geometrically necessary ones. As mentioned above, dislocation lines may also contain jogs and kinks. These details can influence the solute distribution and morphology at defects. Experimental resolution of these, however, is only possible with full 3D atomic-level characterization, in both structure and chemical space. This is not possible for relevant sample volumes with currently available characterization technology. Although APT is the state-of-the-art technique for composition quantification, its current resolving power is near atomic at best (31). Besides this, APT characterization depends on a reconstruction technique involving uncertainties such as ion flight path and positioning aberration, related to the exact shape of the electrical field at the atomic surface from which an atom evaporates (32). Because of this, fine structures can be therefore slightly blurred (33). Further details concerning the APT crystallographic analysis and DMD simulation are summarized in the Supplementary Materials (figs. S4 and S6). Note that, for better comparison with experimental results, the DMD results are presented in voxel-averaged form, using the same voxel size as the one in APT analysis. Raw (nonaveraged) segregation ranges are reported in the Supplementary Materials.

Free-standing, glissile dislocations These dislocations form and glide in the bulk during the bending and peeling of the film from the substrate (Fig. 3A). As in the LAGB, the morphology of segregated Au regions is lenticular (Fig. 3, B and C), and these regions are interpreted as decorated dislocations (12–16, 34–37). These dislocations are, for the most part, associated with the ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ) plane (identified in fig. S2). On the basis of the crystallographic analysis and loading configuration, we infer that these (Fig. 3B) are edge dislocations with a a 0 [ 01 1 ¯ ] / 2 Burgers vector, consistent with the crystallographic orientation of the specimen tip and bending-based loading in Fig. 3A. Fig. 3 Analysis of bulk glissile dislocations. (A) Sketch of deformation and resulting stress state in the thin film due to peeling from the substrate. (B) Front view (normal to [ 01 1 ¯ ] , left) and side view (normal to [ 2 ¯ 11 ] , right) of a group of decorated dislocations by the 6 at % Au isosurfaces in APT measurement.

(D) Au at % profiles along (i) the dislocation line vector ξ ⃑ = [ 2 ¯ 11 ] / 6 , (ii) the slip plane normal n → = [ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ] / 3 , and (iii) b → , for the dislocation in (C). (E) DMD simulation of Au segregation to a dissociated edge dislocation. (F) Simulated Au at % profiles along (i) n → (red curve) and (ii) b → (blue curve). For comparison, the segregated Au at % profile along b → of a perfect edge dislocation is also shown. As shown in Fig. 3C, the lenticular distribution of segregated Au around a given decorated dislocation is wider (about 10 nm) in the Burgers vector direction than in the ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ) plane normal direction (about 5 nm). Figure 3D displays Au at % profiles for the dislocation in Fig. 3C along (i) the dislocation line direction ξ ⃑ (black curve), (ii) the glide plane normal n ⃑ (red curve), and (iii) the direction of the Burgers vector b ⃑ (blue curve). The compositional fluctuations along the dislocation line could be due to, for example, the presence of kinks and jogs. Because the length of these is of the order of a single Burgers vector (about 0.27 nm), these features are most likely super jogs/kinks that can be formed by sequential dislocation cutting events (17, 38). Figure 3E displays DMD simulation results for Au segregation to a dissociated edge dislocation. Corresponding Au at % profiles along the Burgers vector (blue curve) and normal to the glide plane (red curve) are shown in Fig. 3F. For comparison, the Au at % profile along the Burgers vector of a perfect edge dislocation (violet curve) is also shown. Note that the width of the simulated Au distribution around a dissociated edge dislocation (blue curve, Fig. 3F) is closer to the experimental case (blue curve, Fig. 3D) than that around a perfect edge dislocation (violet curve, Fig. 3F). In contrast to the DMD result of little or no Au segregation to the stacking fault (i.e., Suzuki segregation), however, the experimental results suggest the opposite, i.e., even more Au segregation to the region where the stacking fault would be assuming that the dislocation is dissociated. Interpretation of this dislocation as dissociated is also complicated by the fact that the stacking fault is too narrow to experimentally distinguish between the amount of Au segregating to the partial cores and to the intervening stacking fault.

Selected additional atom probe observations Interpretation of characterization results for Au segregation to defects in terms of specific defect types is complicated, in general, by the fact that errors in the determination of atom trajectory from the specimen tip to the detector result in “blurred” or “fuzzy” APT reconstructions of solute distribution around defects, representing the so-called local magnification effect (32, 33). This is even more severe for defects with more complex structure and small volumetric extent such as SFTs (Fig. 4A, I). With this in mind, one can nevertheless interpret further features in the APT dataset. For example, the features observed in Fig. 5 are interpreted in terms of cross-slip, super kinks/jogs, extended node, and dislocation-LAGB interaction, following the treatment of these features in (24). On this basis, Fig. 5A is interpreted as a cross-slipped screw dislocation. Note that the ISF energy of Pt is about 130 mJ/m2, resulting in narrower stacking faults and increased cross-slip probability. On the basis of APT crystallographic analysis (e.g., fig. S4), the two screw dislocations lie in ( 11 1 ¯ ) and ( 1 ¯ 1 ¯ 1 ¯ ) . Dissociation of a perfect screw into two mixed partials results in a hydrostatic core stress field driving solute segregation. Recombination of the partials into a perfect screw for cross-slip results in less Au segregation at the intersection between the glide and cross-slip planes (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5 Dislocation reaction and interactions observed in the atom probe specimen. Examples of (A) cross-slip, (B) super kinks, (C) super jogs, (D) extended node, and (E) dislocation LAGB interaction indicated by the APT data. A length scale of 5 nm is indicated by a gray bar. In each figure, the right-hand image is rotated 90° to the left relative to the left image. Changes in dislocation line direction are observed in Fig. 5 (B and C). Depending on whether the slip plane is changed, they are classified into super kinks (no change of glide plane) or super jogs (change of glide plane). Only multiple kinks or jogs can be observed experimentally. Figure 5D displays three dislocations meeting at a junction/extended node. The last example (Fig. 5E) exhibits bulk dislocation interaction with a LAGB having a misorientation angle of 5.2°, a tilt rotation angle of 4.6°, and a twist angle of 2.3°. The dislocation glides in different slip planes before intersecting the LAGB. A segregation level as high as 46 at % Au has been observed in the interaction region. These more complicated cases are the subject of an ongoing investigation to be reported on in the future. Table 1 provides the minimum and maximum solute composition values for multiple defect types obtained from Au at % profiles. The values in Table 1 show the most representative values measured at each particular defect type. For example, solute segregation to a LAGB is apparently enhanced (1.6 times) when this boundary is intersected by a glissile dislocation. Glissile dislocations with a lenticular shape have a slightly higher solute level than those with a circular shape. The solute level at the cross-slip junction is 26% lower than those observed for the adjacent glissile dislocations. A SFT intersected by a glissile dislocation contains 1.3 times more segregated solute. These observations imply that interaction among defects also influences solute segregation. Therefore, the structural character for each dislocation investigated has to be specified, supporting our general conclusion that the chemical nature of dislocations is strongly linked to their underlying structure and associated distortion fields. This is also the subject of current and ongoing investigations. Table 1 Minimum and maximum solute at % for different defect types obtained from profiles across defects in the APT dataset.

42,42,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Hydraulic resistance induces cell phenotypic transition in confinement - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabg4934,"Cells penetrating into confinement undergo mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition. The topographical features of the microenvironment expose cells to different hydraulic resistance levels. How cells respond to hydraulic resistance is unknown. We show that the cell phenotype shifts from amoeboid to mesenchymal upon increasing resistance. By combining automated morphological tracking and wavelet analysis along with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we found an oscillatory phenotypic transition that cycles from blebbing to short, medium, and long actin network formation, and back to blebbing. Elevated hydraulic resistance promotes focal adhesion maturation and long actin filaments, thereby reducing the period required for amoeboid-to-mesenchymal transition. The period becomes independent of resistance upon blocking the mechanosensor TRPM7. Mathematical modeling links intracellular calcium oscillations with actomyosin turnover and force generation and recapitulates experimental data. We identify hydraulic resistance as a critical physical cue controlling cell phenotype and present an approach for connecting fluorescent signal fluctuations to morphological oscillations.

By applying fast Fourier transform (FFT), the oscillation frequency of distinct F-actin structures at the cell leading edge (blebbing and short, medium, and long actin filament) is identified on the basis of their characteristic turnover times, which are obtained from fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Using short-time Fourier transform (STFT), we obtained the spectrogram from the oscillation curves to identify the time dependence of frequency modulation and relative importance of distinct F-actin structures in the frequency domain. Our analysis reveals a periodic phenotypic change involving a cycle from blebbing to short, medium, and long actin filament formation that loops with bleb recurrence. The period of the unit cycle becomes shorter for blebbing cells at elevated resistances, which is consistent with their AMT. The period becomes independent of hydraulic resistance upon knocking out its key mechanosensor TRPM7 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 7) or inhibiting its downstream targets Arp2/3 or formins. Hydraulic resistance increases actomyosin contractility through TRPM7 mechanosensing ( 9 ) that generates higher regional intracellular pressure to facilitate cell movement. The propagated pressure ( 16 ) then imposes compressive forces on the cell-lateral channel wall interfaces that foster FA maturation, actin-based filament formation, and bundling/extension, which favor the elongation of protrusion and AMT.Myosin motors are recruited to actin filaments from blebbing sites. The competition of myosin between actin-based filaments and blebs determines the cell phenotype. Examination of intracellular calcium signals reveals a similar periodicity pattern to that of actin, which is captured by a mathematical model of cytoplasmic Ca 2+ dynamics and the cytoskeletal polymerization/depolymerization cycle.

During motility, the intracellular fluorescence signal at the cell leading edge exhibits oscillatory patterns associated with changes in cell morphodynamics. These oscillations may encompass distinct intracellular processes, such as blebbing expansion/retraction, actin filament bundling, and cleavage. The objective is to decouple these oscillatory waves into individual components and determine their relative importance in frequency and time domains, thereby providing detailed, temporal information for the migration mode. Wavelet analysis provides a powerful platform for signal processing as it can detect, decompose, and classify various discrete oscillatory patterns. Wavelet analysis has been used in diverse fields of research such as radiometry, communication systems, cosmology, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc. In biomedical research where the statistical characteristics are usually nonstationary, the wavelet transform algorithms are widely used for real-time detection of neural signals ( 15 ). We are herein using wavelet analysis to process fluorescence signals and correlate them to distinct morphological earmarks and ultimately to the mode of migration.

Given the rapid interconversion between MAT and amoeboid-to-mesenchymal transition (AMT), we examined the migration mode of hundreds of LifeAct-GFP–tagged cells in confined channels of increasing length, and thus increasing hydraulic resistance, by quantifying the normalized cell protrusion length and the coefficient of variation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal, two parameters that define the cell morphological footprint. Mesenchymal cells relative to blebbing cells exhibit a larger protrusion length along with a uniform actin distribution ( 10 ) depicted by a low coefficient of variation, as opposed to blebbing cells that display actin polarization at the poles ( 10 ) and thus high coefficient of variation. Although confinement induces MAT, we found that the cell footprint shifts from amoeboid to mesenchymal upon increasing hydraulic resistance.

Plasticity enables tumor cells to adapt to diverse tissue microenvironments presenting different chemical and physical cues and to optimize their directed locomotion by tuning the underlying migration mechanisms. Cancer cells entering confining channels undergo a phenotypic mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (MAT) ( 10 – 14 ). Cells with a mesenchymal phenotype display an elongated spindle-like shape with actin-rich finger-like protrusions at the leading edge, which are stabilized by the interactions of focal adhesions (FAs) with ECM. On the other hand, amoeboid cells in confinement assume a pill-like morphology and exhibit membrane blebs promoted by elevated contractility, which are identified as discrete, sphere-like bulges localized primarily at the cell poles ( 14 ). It is unknown how confined cells respond to increasing hydraulic resistance.

Cells in vivo travel either by remodeling their surrounding three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) to open up tunnel-like tracks or by migrating through 3D longitudinal tracks naturally occurring in various anatomical structures ( 1 ). During this journey, cells squeeze through confining pores ranging from 1 to 20 μm in diameter or channel-like tracks varying from 3 to 30 μm in width and hundreds of microns in length ( 2 ). Tumor cells move inside confining channels not only by uptaking and discharging water ( 3 ) but also by pushing the column of water ahead of them ( 4 ), which generates hydraulic resistance ( 5 – 7 ). Hydraulic resistance is a physiologically relevant cue, which regulates cell directional choices in confinement ( 4 , 8 , 9 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Hydraulic resistance regulates the phenotype of migrating cells A microfluidic device, consisting of an array of confining channels of constant cross-sectional area (width, W = 4 μm and height, H = 10 μm) (3), was used to investigate the influence of hydraulic resistance on migration mode (Fig. 1A). Hydraulic resistance (5, 9) was tuned by varying the channel length from 150 to 1500 μm, thereby increasing the resistance by 10-fold (fig. S1A). Intriguingly, the migration speed of MDA-MB-231 cells increases with increasing hydraulic resistance (fig. S1B), which is counterintuitive, as resistance is expected to suppress motility. Moreover, hydraulic resistance induces a cell phenotypic switch from blebbing to mesenchymal (Fig. 1, B and C). Blebbing motile cells display a pill-like morphology and bear membrane blebs, which are identified as sphere-like bulges localized at the cell poles (Fig. 1C) (9, 13, 14), and represent 80% of confined MDA-MB-231 cells at 1× but only ~30% at 10× (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, mesenchymal cells exhibit finger-like protrusions (Fig. 1C). Using LifeAct-GFP–tagged MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed that blebbing cells display polarized actin distribution that is markedly enriched at the leading and trailing edges (10), whereas actin is more uniformly distributed in mesenchymal (protrusive) cells (fig. S1C). Because of their pill-like morphology, blebbing cells occupy the entire cross-sectional area of the channel along their longitudinal axis (fig. S1D). However, this is not the case for mesenchymal cells due to the presence of finger-like protrusion at the cell poles (Fig. 1C and fig. S1D). Fig. 1 Hydraulic resistance regulates the phenotype of migrating cells.

(D) Representative image sequence depicting a LifeAct-GFP–tagged cell undergoing phenotypic transition. Arrowheads indicate the protrusion (red) and bleb (yellow) of a hybrid cell (iii). Scale bar, 5 μm. (E) 3D phase diagram showing normalized protrusion length over the cell length (x axis, from 0 to 1), coefficient of variation of LifeAct-GFP signal throughout the cell (y axis, from 0 to 1), and number of cell footprints (z axis, 10 frames or footprints collected per cell for n > 100 cells from three independent experiments) in each bin (24 × 24 bins, 0.05 step size) in channels of prescribed hydraulic resistances. Cells transitioning from blebbing to protrusive translocate from the top left (short protrusion, polarized actin at the poles) to the bottom right (long protrusion, uniform actin distribution) on the diagram. To establish that hydraulic resistance regulates the cell phenotype, we analyzed the cell morphology footprint (Fig. 1D) inside channels of prescribed resistances and generated a phase diagram (Fig. 1E) with two parameters: the coefficient of variation of LifeAct-GFP signal versus the normalized protrusion length, which represents the cumulative length of cell parts whose widths were ≤70% of the channel’s width, divided by the overall cell length (fig. S1E). Blebbing cells, which exhibit a polarized actin distribution at the cell poles that corresponds to high values of coefficient of variation and a pill-like morphology that results in negligible protrusion lengths, are located at the top left of the phase diagram, whereas mesenchymal cells with relatively uniform actin signal and finger-like protrusions populate the bottom right (Fig. 1E). Cell treatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766, which promotes an amoeboid phenotype (12), shifted the cell population footprint inside channels of 10× hydraulic resistance from the bottom right to the top left corner (fig. S1F). In contrast, the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632, which supports a protrusive morphology (9, 14), concentrated cells migrating in channels of basal hydraulic resistance (1×) at the bottom right corner of the phase diagrams (fig. S1F). Using the phase diagram, we examined the phenotypic transition of cells migrating in channels of different hydraulic resistances. A smooth transition of the cell population footprint from the top left toward the bottom right corner was observed upon gradually increasing the hydraulic resistance from 1× to 10× (Fig. 1E). This progressive transition is exemplified by the presence of a hybrid phenotype displaying both sphere-like blebs and finger-like protrusions (Fig. 1D, iii), which is located in the middle of the phase diagram. Thus, elevated hydraulic resistance promotes the growth of actin-based filaments, which mediate the phenotypic switch from blebbing to mesenchymal. We hypothesized that hydraulic resistance exacerbates branched actin formation at the cell leading edge consistent with the intrinsic load adaptation of actin network (17, 18). Consistent with this hypothesis, Arp2/3 inhibition caused a pronounced yet partial effect on suppressing phenotypic transition from blebbing to mesenchymal in channels of elevated (≥8×) resistance (fig. S1F). Similar effects were noted by knocking down the RhoA effector mDia1 (fig. S1F), which promotes the formation of bundled fibers. Both these interventions also reduce migration speeds at high hydraulic resistances (≥8×) (fig. S1, G and H). By introducing the migration speed as the z-axis variable in the phase diagram, we show that control cells with a protrusive phenotype display faster motility (fig. S1I). TRPM7 was identified as the key mechanosensor of hydraulic resistance in confinement (9). Consistent with this finding, functional TRPM7 knockout (KO) (9) abolishes the regulation of cell phenotype by hydraulic resistance, resulting in a hybrid phenotype, as depicted on the phase diagram (fig. S1F), and fast migration irrespective of the hydraulic resistance (fig. S1J).

Hydraulic resistance promotes a thicker actomyosin cortex and larger FAs at the cell leading edge Cells balance the external hydraulic pressure with cortical actomyosin at an intersection before a directional migration decision is made (9). We thus hypothesized that elevated hydraulic resistance promotes a thicker actomyosin cortex. To test this, we quantified the LifeAct-GFP and MIIA-GFP signals of cells displaying a blebbing or hybrid morphology in channels of different resistances (Fig. 2, A to C, and fig. S2, A to C). Both the actin and myosin signals at the cell leading edge increased with increasing hydraulic resistance (Fig. 2C and fig. S2C). TRPM7 KO abrogated the actin and myosin signal regulation by hydraulic resistance, consistent with its role as a mechanosensor of this cue (fig. S2, D and E). In addition, Arp2/3 inhibition or formin knockdown (KD) produced flat intensity values at all resistances (fig. S2, D and E) due to the suppression of branched and bundled actin network.

Data represent means ± SD. **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001, assessed by two-tailed unpaired t test. Hydraulic resistance is counteracted by actomyosin contractility at the cell leading edge, which generates high regional intracellular pressure that eventually dissipates throughout the cell body (9, 16). As the pressure wave propagates, the highest compressive forces are exerted at the cell-side channel wall interfaces at the leading edge (fig. S2F). Hence, during the phenotypic switch from blebbing to mesenchymal at elevated resistances, FAs and actin filaments are predicted to emerge and grow from these interfaces (fig. S2F). Live-cell imaging using paxillin-GFP reveals the presence of FAs primarily at the basal surface and at the lateral channel walls either intersecting or close to the basal plane at the cell front (Fig. 2D and fig. S2G). The FA number and area at the side channel walls increased with increasing hydraulic resistance, whereas the corresponding ones at the basal plane remained unchanged (Fig. 2, E and F). The growth and dynamics of FAs and the recruitment of actin fibers at these sites are regulated by the Arp2/3 complex (19–21). In line with prior work, live-cell imaging using ARP3-mCherry shows that Arp2/3 displays a spatial distribution similar to that of FAs and localizes primarily at the side channel walls either intersecting or near the basal surface at the cell anterior (fig. S2, H and I). Moreover, Arp2/3 inhibition abolishes the hydraulic resistance–mediated increases in the number and area of FAs at the lateral (Fig. 2, E and F, and fig. S2I), but not basal, walls (fig. S2, J and K).

Arp2/3 is critical to the induction of larger FAs and lamella by hydrostatic pressure The pressure load that cells experience at their leading edge inside confining channels is of the order of 1 Pa (4, 9). Hydrostatic pressure differentials were generated by pipetting prescribed amounts of media atop paxillin-GFP– or ARP3-mCherry–expressing cells seeded on collagen I–coated slides (9). The fluorescence signal intensities were quantified on the basis of the feature extraction from a thin layer of cell lamella at the basal 2D plane (Fig. 2G and fig. S2, L and M). Hydrostatic pressure induced a rapid albeit transient increase of both paxillin and ARP3 signals at the lamella (Fig. 2, H and I, and fig. S2, N and O), which faded away within 10 to 20 min. It also promoted the growth of lamella and cell spreading area in a magnitude-dependent manner (Fig. 2J and fig. S2P). Moreover, hydrostatic pressure loading fostered the colocalization of paxillin and Arp3, as evidenced by immunofluorescence staining (fig. S2, Q and R). Arp2/3 inhibition abolished the hydrostatic pressure–mediated increase of FA signal and cell spreading area (Fig. 2, I and J). Using LifeAct-GFP–tagged cells, the lamella growth induced by hydrostatic pressure (30 Pa) was evident from the intense membrane extension and ruffling at the cell periphery (fig. S2S, ii and iii), which is indicative of strong actin polymerization and bundling (22), coupled with increased FA sites anchoring stress fibers at the periphery (fig. S2, iv). The hydrostatic pressure–induced elevation of LifeAct-GFP and MIIA-GFP signals was suppressed by Arp2/3 inhibition (fig. S2, T and U). Together, these data reveal the interplay of Arp2/3 and FAs in response to the elevated hydraulic/hydrostatic pressure to facilitate cell protrusions.

Actin filament dynamics is regulated by hydraulic resistance During a typical phenotypic switch in confinement, the blebbing cell first experiences the shrinkage of blebs, then the polarization of actin at the lateral wall-cell interface, followed by the emergence of finger-like actin filaments, and last, the anchoring and elongation of these filaments along the side channel walls at the cell anterior (Fig. 3A). We split these distinct morphologies into four categories (Fig. 3A): (i) blebbing and (ii) short, (iii) medium, and (iv) long actin filaments. FRAP was performed at the leading edge of actin-GFP–tagged cells, and the recovery curve was fitted with an exponential function (fig. S3, A to C) to obtain the characteristic turnover time, t 0 (23), which describes the period of molecular turnover of processes that occur within the affected region of interest (ROI). Using FRAP analysis, the characteristic turnover time of blebs in confinement (Fig. 3A, i) was determined to be ~60 s (Fig. 3B), which matches the life span of a bleb that was manually tracked in our experiments (fig. S3, D and E). This value obtained for confined cells is within the range reported from measurements on 2D, where expansion typically lasts 5 to 30 s and retraction 60 to 120 s (24). Fig. 3 Actin filament dynamics is regulated by hydraulic resistance. (A) Representative example of actin-GFP–tagged MDA-MB-231 cells in four distinct morphologies during phenotypic transition in confinement: (i) blebbing and (ii) short, (iii) medium, and (iv) long actin filaments. Yellow lines depict the separation of the cell edge near the side wall interface from the center area. Scale bar, 2 μm. (B) Characteristic turnover times obtained from the exponential fitting of FRAP recovery curves for the aforementioned four distinct morphologies of actin-GFP–tagged vehicle control and Arp2/3-inhibited (CK666; 100 μM) cells. Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001, assessed by two-tailed unpaired t test.

Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc. (E) Percentage of cells displaying short, medium, or long actin filaments at different hydraulic resistances categorized during FRAP assays. Cells of >30 from three independent experiments were examined under each condition. (F) Characteristic turnover times of short, medium, and long actin filaments, determined by FRAP, at different hydraulic resistances. Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. (G) Edge-to-center ratio of characteristic turnover times for cells displaying blebbing versus filamentous/hybrid morphologies. Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. ***P < 0.001, assessed by two-tailed unpaired t test. The turnover time of short actin filaments in confinement (Fig. 3A, ii) was calculated to be ~40 s (Fig. 3B), which is in line with published data (25, 26). Assembly and branching of short filaments are mediated by the Arp2/3 complex, and as such, inhibition of its activity via CK666 reduced their turnover time to 20 s (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with prior work showing that the turnover time of actin filaments scales with their length (23, 27). Along these lines, we determined the turnover time of the medium-sized filaments (Fig. 3A, iii) to be ~80 s (Fig. 3B). These filaments appear as wave-like extensions (Fig. 3A, iii) in close proximity but not anchored to the lateral channel walls because they lack FAs at their tip (fig. S3F). Their morphology resembles the peripheral ruffles found in membrane protrusions on 2D (22). The involvement of integrin-mediated FA complexes enables further elongation of actin fibers and the combination of multiple filaments into bundles (Fig. 3A, iv), thereby supporting an actin polymerization–based mode of migration (28) and cell transition to a mesenchymal phenotype. In line with published data (27), the characteristic turnover time of long filaments was on the order of hundreds of seconds. Arp2/3 inhibition moderately prolonged the turnover of medium-sized filaments, presumably due to the suppression of branching during filament elongation and/or bundling (Fig. 3B). It also had a modest, yet nonsignificant (P = 0.07), effect on the turnover of long filaments, and as expected, it did not alter blebbing turnover (Fig. 3B). Hydraulic resistance did not regulate blebbing turnover as assessed by FRAP (Fig. 3C) or by manually tracking bleb lifetimes (fig. S3D). However, the turnover of actin filaments increased with hydraulic resistance (Fig. 3D), which is attributed to the higher frequency of longer actin filaments at elevated resistances (Fig. 3E) that exhibit larger turnover times (Fig. 3B). This is further substantiated by data showing that the turnover times of various actin filaments were not affected by hydraulic resistance (Fig. 3F). It is noteworthy that the turnover times of actin filaments near the lateral walls were substantially longer than those in the central protrusive region, whereas no spatial differences were detected for blebs (Fig. 3G), suggesting a polarized spatial distribution of actin-GFP at the cell leading edge during phenotypic transition.

Wavelet analysis of LifeAct-GFP signals reveals a periodic regulation during phenotypic transition In light of the distinct characteristic turnover times of actin signals involved in different dominant processes, we monitored migrating LifeAct-GFP–expressing cells inside channels at a frame rate of 5 s, which is faster than the turnover time of any leading edge actin structure in confinement (>20 s). The average fluorescence intensity within the outlined cortical region (Fig. 4A) was normalized by the moving average to generate the oscillation curve of actin signal (fig. S4A). By performing FFT and plotting the amplitude of oscillations as a function of frequency, three distinct peaks were detected between 0 and 10, 10 and 20, and 20 and 40 mHz (fig. S4A), which correspond to the turnover times obtained by FRAP. A peak at 20 to 40 mHz represents an F-actin turnover period of 25 to 50 s, which correspond to the short actin filaments. A peak at 10 to 20 mHz is indicative of a medium-sized filament with an average turnover time of ~80 s. A further decrease in frequency (0 to 10 mHz) corresponds to a longer oscillation period (>100 s) found for long actin filaments. The representative peaks for blebbing fall in the frequency range of medium-sized filaments (10 to 20 mHz). Fig. 4 Wavelet analysis of LifeAct-GFP signals reveals a periodic regulation during phenotypic transition. (A) Representative image sequences showing LifeAct-GFP–tagged MDA-MB-231 cells undergoing periodic phenotypic alterations: from (i) protrusive to (ii) blebbing, transition to (iii) hybrid phenotype with actin filaments growing along cell-side channel wall interface, and back to (iv) blebbing and (v) protrusive.

Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. (E) Oscillation period determined from the spectrograms of LifeAct-GFP–tagged wild-type, TRPM7 KO, CK666 (100 μM)–treated, and mDia1 KD cells. Data are means ± SD for n > 20 cells from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01, assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc. (F) Oscillation period, determined as in (E), at different hydraulic resistances for wild-type cells (distinguished in blebbing/hybrid versus protrusive phenotypes) and Y-27632–treated cells. Data represent means ± SD for n > 10 cells from three independent experiments. P < 0.001, assessed by two-tailed unpaired t test. We next applied STFT on the oscillation curve to generate a spectrogram, which gives a visual representation of the power of the signal within a predefined range of frequency as a function of time (fig. S4B). A sinusoidal-like frequency modulation curve emerged from the optimized spectrogram (Fig. 4B and fig. S4B), where different frequency ranges were matched and verified with the distinct phenotypes observed in confocal images. An example cell initially displayed medium-sized filaments, as evidenced by frequency oscillations at ≥10 mHz (Fig. 4B, i) and verified by the presence of wave-like protrusions at the lateral wall-cell interfaces in confocal images (Fig. 4A, i). It then quickly assumed a blebbing phenotype, as suggested by the increased frequency at ~15 mHz (Fig. 4B, ii), which was visually verified by the presence of large spherical bulges at the leading edge (Fig. 4A, ii). Next, the cell switches to a protrusive phenotype exhibiting medium filaments at the side channel wall-cell interfaces coupled to a concave membrane curvature in the central protrusive region (Fig. 4A, iii, and fig. S4C). This phenotypic switch was captured in the spectrogram by the intense oscillations at ~15 mHz (Fig. 4B, iii), which was preceded by a peak at ~30 mHz, which corresponds to the assembly of small actin filaments during transition from a blebbing to protrusive phenotype with medium-sized filaments. In the next phenotype switch cycle, the cell assumed again a blebbing phenotype (Fig. 4A, iv) at 15 mHz (Fig. 4B, iv) before transitioning to protrusive (Fig. 4, A, v and B, v) with a convex membrane curvature at the central protrusive area (Fig. 4A, v, and fig. S4C). The overall cell length along the longitudinal axis varied with the cell phenotype and contracted during blebbing while it extended during transition to a protrusive phenotype (fig. S4D). In a typical phenotype cycle (Fig. 4C), a blebbing cell at ~15 mHz will transition to a protrusive phenotype by retracting its blebs and initiating the assembly of small actin filaments (20 to 40 mHz), which will grow into medium (10 to 20 mHz) and then long (0 to 10 mHz) filaments. Representative spectrograms are shown for more cells before (fig. S4E) and after (fig. S4F) complete transition to a protrusive phenotype. Cumulatively, the spectrogram analysis reveals a periodic cycle of actin signals at the cell leading edge that controls migration phenotype (Fig. 4C). We extracted the sinusoidal curves from the spectrogram of cells migrating in channels of different hydraulic resistances (Fig. 4D). The bell-shaped curve at 1× became narrower with increasing hydraulic resistance for control cells (Fig. 4D), reflecting a faster turnover (Fig. 4E). TRPM7 KO, which abrogates cell mechanosensitivity (9), abolishes the dependence of the phenotype cycle period on hydraulic resistance by promoting a faster turnover at lower (1× to 2×) resistances (Fig. 4E and fig. S4, G and H). Arp2/3 inhibition or mDia1 KD also results in actin cycles that are independent of hydraulic resistance (Fig. 4E and fig. S4I). The shorter period reflects a faster takeover of actin filaments by blebs at all resistances. In addition, posttransition cells exhibiting a protrusive phenotype and ROCK-inhibited cells display a robust long oscillation period at low frequencies (10 mHz) (Fig. 4F and fig. S4F). Inside low-resistance channels, the distribution of actin oscillation period of blebbing cells overlapped quite extensively with those displaying a protrusive phenotype (Fig. 4F). However, these two distinct phenotypic subpopulations were split apart into discrete groups at elevated resistances (Fig. 4F). The disappearance of blebbing phenotypes with long oscillation period suggests that their successful transition to protrusive ones requires a shorter time window for sustained actin polymerization due to a reinforced basis for filamentous growth (i.e., elevated Arp2/3 activity and FA density) at higher resistances. The detected population of blebbing cells with short actin oscillation period at high resistances is indicative of survival bias.

The spatiotemporal distribution of myosin II at the cell anterior is regulated by hydraulic resistance and is a key determinant of cell phenotypic transition The competition of the two migration modes, blebbing versus protrusive, is essentially a scramble for migration-related molecular resources, which include the cytoskeletal components actin and myosin. Cortical actomyosin is the key player in bleb-based migration (14, 24, 29, 30). The protrusive migration mode, which relies on actin bundles, requires myosin localization toward the bundled actin filaments to generate contractions and stabilize FAs (31, 32). We thus investigated the spatiotemporal localization of MIIA-GFP during actin oscillations by focusing on how blebbing cells lose the tug of war to a protrusive phenotype. When blebs were generated at the leading edge, the myosin signal was rather uniformly distributed at the cortex (Fig. 5A, i and iii). When the blebs collapsed, the growth of actin filaments at the cell-lateral channel wall interfaces was accompanied by MIIA translocation from the central protrusive region toward the actin filaments (Fig. 5A, ii and iv, and fig. S5, A and B). The presence of myosin at the center of the cell cortex facilitates the contraction of filaments at the cell-side channel wall interfaces, thereby promoting transition to a blebbing morphology (fig. S5, C to E). Fig. 5 The spatiotemporal distribution of myosin II at the cell anterior regulated by hydraulic resistance is a key determinant of cell phenotypic transition.

(B) Top: Yellow dashed lines depict the separation of the cell edge near the side channel wall interface from the center area. Bottom: Average fluorescence intensity profile of the cell cortex.

(D) Maximum edge-to-center ratio and (E) maximum period of cortical MIIA-GFP oscillation of MDA-MB-231 cells displaying a blebbing and/or hybrid phenotype during phenotypic transition at different hydraulic resistances. Data represent means ± SD for n ≥ 12 control, TRPM7 KO, CK666-inhibited, and formin-inhibited cells from three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 and ***P < 0.001, assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc. (F) Using the average values obtained for control cells in (D) and (E), the edge-to-center ratio versus oscillation period of MIIA-GFP was plotted. Asterisks indicate the maximum edge-to-center ratio necessary to retain a blebbing phenotype at different hydraulic resistances. Beyond that threshold, cells transition to a protrusive phenotype. To quantify the MIIA-GFP signal, we split the cell cortex into three regions, edge-center-edge, and measured its intensity in each of them separately (Fig. 5B). The dynamics of edge/center MIIA intensity ratio exhibited a wave-like periodicity (Fig. 5C). It climbed up when filaments were growing at the cell-lateral channel wall interfaces, and at its apex (Fig. 5C, ii), the cell either started restoring the blebbing phenotype (Fig. 5C, iii) or transitioned to a protrusive phenotype (Fig. 5C, iv). The maximum edge/center ratio before phenotypic transition and the maximum time period of the oscillatory cycle decreased with increasing hydraulic resistance (Fig. 5, D and E). Similarly to actin, TRPM7 KO, Arp2/3, or formin inhibition abolished the dependence of edge/center ratio or MIIA period on hydraulic resistance (Fig. 5, D and E). Notably, the numerical values of the myosin II oscillation period match very well those obtained with actin. The contractility-induced actin filament growth near the side channel walls facilitates myosin II localization at cell-channel interfaces, thereby increasing the MIIA edge/center ratio. Higher hydraulic resistances promote a faster molecular translocation, as depicted by the elevated slope (Fig. 5F). A stable blebbing phenotype would be maintained as long as the edge/center ratio remains below a threshold value, which is indicative of the cell’s ability to use the myosin II remaining at the central area to generate adequate contractility. This requirement is stricter at elevated hydraulic resistances because a higher local pressure from actomyosin is required for force balance. This implies that cells would tolerate a bigger loss of myosin at the central region in channels of lower hydraulic resistance to maintain the blebbing phenotype, whereas the same edge/center ratio would lead to a protrusive morphology in channels of higher resistance (Fig. 5F).","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabg4934/F1.large.jpg,"['resistance', 'blebbing', 'hydraulic', 'induces', 'cells', 'confinement', 'filaments', 'phenotype', 'actin', 'cell', 'phenotypic', 'fig', 'transition']", 
43,43,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Nuclear receptors FXR and SHP regulate protein N-glycan modifications in the liver - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf4865,"Nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP) are key regulators of metabolism. Here, we report a previously unknown function for the hepatic FXR-SHP axis in controlling protein N-linked glycosylation. Transcriptome analysis in liver-specific Fxr-Shp double knockout (LDKO) livers revealed induction of genes encoding enzymes in the N-glycosylation pathway, including Mgat5, Fut8, St3gal6, and St6gal1. FXR activation suppressed Mgat5, while Shp deletion induced St3gal6 and St6gal1. Increased percentages of core-fucosylated and triantennary glycan moieties were seen in LDKO livers, and proteins with the “hyperglycoforms” preferentially localized to exosomes and lysosomes. This up-regulation of N-glycosylation machinery was specific to the Golgi apparatus and not the endoplasmic reticulum. The increased glycan complexity in the LDKO correlated well with dilated unstacked Golgi ribbons and alterations in the secretion of albumin, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Our findings demonstrate a role for the FXR-SHP axis in maintaining glycoprotein diversity in the liver.

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR; NR1H4) and small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2) belong to a superfamily of nuclear receptors that regulate transcription of several genes involved in intermediary metabolism. Global deletion of FXR and SHP induces liver injury ( 12 ) and ultimately results in spontaneous hepatic carcinogenesis in mice ( 13 ). Here, we set out to identify molecular networks coordinated by hepatic FXR and SHP, in addition to their conventional metabolic targets. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), glycomics, glycoproteomics analyses, and electron microscopy, we found a key role for this axis in regulating the liver N-glycome.

N-Glycosylation is a key posttranslational modification that decides the fate of several liver proteins, including their targeting to the plasma membrane or for secretion. Briefly, various combinations of sugar molecules (glycan moieties) attach covalently to the nitrogen of asparagine residues of a protein ( 1 , 2 ), including mannose and glucose in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen ( 3 – 6 ). Further glycan processing occurs in cis- and medial-Golgi, including the addition of GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine) by the MGAT (Mannosyl-glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase) family of proteins resulting in “antennae” (or branch) glycan moieties. These branched glycans are finally modified in trans-Golgi via the addition of fucose by fucosyltransferase (Futs), N-acetylgalactosamine by GalNAc transferases, and sialic acid by sialyltransferases (Stgals and Stsias) ( 5 , 7 , 8 ). These complex glycan structures not only allow for structural and functional heterogeneity in the tissue glycoproteome but also are important for maintaining appropriate liver function ( 9 – 11 ). However, the regulation of this essential protein modification in the liver remains understudied.

( A ) Circulating levels of albumin are reduced in LDKO mice, with no significant change in hepatic albumin levels (n = 4 to 9 mice per group, Student t test, **P < 0.01). Whereas serum levels of ( B ) cholesterol and ( C ) triglycerides are higher in LDKO mice (n = 5 to 9 mice per group; Student t test, **P < 0.01 and ****P < 0.0001). ( D ) Schematic figure displaying unstacked Golgi and hyperbranched N-glycans in an LDKO hepatocyte.

To validate that the loss of FXR-SHP–induced hepatic Golgi expansion and accumulation of N-glycoproteins, we isolated primary hepatocytes from control and LDKO mice and stained them for the resident Golgi-protein, Golgin. LDKO hepatocytes displayed higher Golgin expression than controls ( Fig. 5B ). In addition, Phaseolus Vulgaris Leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) were used to stain-branched (complex) glycans and sialic acid moieties, respectively. Both PHA-L and SNA stained the plasma membrane and some of the Golgi as expected ( 7 ). The amount of PHA-L and SNA staining and its colocalization with Golgin were enhanced in LDKO hepatocytes compared to controls ( Fig. 5, C and D ). Last, we measured plasma profiles of the secreted products trafficked through the Golgi ( 43 , 44 ) from LDKO livers. We found that, in the LDKO mice, while hepatic albumin levels were unaffected, serum albumin levels were significantly reduced ( Fig. 6A ). In addition, the circulating levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly altered in LDKO plasma, compared to controls ( Fig. 6, B and C ). Together, these findings reveal that loss of hepatic FXR-SHP axis results in up-regulation of N-glycosylation transcripts, increases in complex glycoforms, defective Golgi structure, and altered secretion in hepatocytes ( Fig. 6D ), which likely also affects lipoprotein clearance indirectly.

As N-glycan processing occurs in both the ER and the Golgi apparatus ( 3 , 5 , 8 ), we examined and found that the N-linked glucosyl transferases up-regulated in the LDKOs were specifically associated with the Golgi and not the ER ( 34 ) except for Alg10b, which catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of N-glycan moiety (fig. S7A). As unfolded protein response can regulate N-glycome ( 35 – 38 ), we quantified ER stress in LDKO livers by XBP-1 (X-box binding protein 1) splicing assays ( 39 – 41 ) and gene expression profiling ( 42 ). We found no changes in them compared to control (fig. S7, B and C). These data confirm that the N-glycosylation and the stress pathways in ER are not affected, but several N-glycosylation genes in the Golgi apparatus are induced in LDKO livers ( Fig. 2, A and B ). So, using electron microscopy, we examined the Golgi structure and observed unstacked and dilated Golgi in LDKO livers, unlike well-stacked Golgi ribbons in controls ( Fig. 5A ).

( A ) Schematic figure displaying the fate of glucose in a hepatocyte. ( B ) LDKO mice have reduced fasting blood glucose levels (n = 12 to 15 mice per group; Student t test, ***P < 0.005). Bar graphs comparing FPKM values of genes regulating ( C ) glycolysis, ( D ) gluconeogenesis, and ( E ) pentose phosphate pathway show no significant difference between control and LDKO livers (n = 3 mice per group; Student t test, *P < 0.05). ( F ) PAS staining indicates lower glycogen content in LDKO livers (n = 5 mice per group). Scale bars, 50 μm). ( G ) UDP-glycan sugars are not altered in LDKO livers (n = 5 mice per group, Student t test).

To determine the consequence of elevated glycosylation in LDKO livers, we examined the different cellular fates of glucose, such as glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, glycosylation, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis ( Fig. 4A ) ( 29 , 30 ). In agreement with increased glycosylation, LDKO mice exhibited lower circulating glucose levels ( Fig. 4B ). Furthermore, the genes regulating glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis remained unaltered in LDKO livers ( Fig. 4, C to E ). However, the low glucose correlated with the severe loss of glycogen stores in LDKO livers as evident by periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining ( Fig. 4F ). Next, we analyzed the intermediates of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway such as uridine 5′-diphosphate (UDP)–GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc ( 31 – 33 ) in LDKO livers, and their levels were comparable despite the increase in demand for N-glycosylation ( Fig. 4G ). While the hexose intermediates are not limiting, the liver glycogen levels are diminished, circulating glucose is reduced, and N-glycosylation is increased, when the FXR-SHP axis is ablated in the liver.

LDKO liver glycoproteins were isolated and analyzed for their glycan profiles. LDKO livers display increased percentage of ( A ) core fucosylated and ( B ) triantennary glycans in LDKO liver compared to controls (n = 5 mice averaged per group). ( C ) Gene Ontology analysis of proteins with increased glycosylation reveals their cellular localization and function (n = 5 livers pooled per group). ( D ) Relative ratio of complex, sialylated and fucosylated glycoforms for CATZ, EMPL, and lysosomal membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) indicate enrichment of hyperglycoforms in LDKO livers compared to controls (n = 5 mice averaged per group).

To assess the functionality of the induction of N-glycosylation genes, we performed glycan profiling on control and LDKO liver lysates (fig. S6A). We found about twofold increase in core fucosylation ( Fig. 3A ) and hyperbranching (tertiary glycans) in LDKO livers compared to the controls ( Fig. 3B ), whereas both sialylation and mannosylation were unaltered (fig. S6B). To identify the proteins that were being targeted for altered N-glycan processing, we performed glycoproteomics on control and LDKO liver lysates. Figure S6C illustrates an example of the mass spectrum of a glycoform of a liver protein. Gene Ontology analysis of the transcripts encoding for these altered glycoproteins revealed a metabolic or secretory function and localization to the extracellular exosome, ER, and lysosome ( Fig. 3C ). These proteins including, but not limited to, cathepsin Z, lysosomal membrane protein, endoplasmin, haptogloblin, and epoxide hydrolase exhibited increases in more complex glycoforms in LDKO livers ( Fig. 3D and fig. S6D). For example, we found that HexNAc(5)Hex(5)Fuc(1)NeuAc(1) glycoform of lysosomal membrane protein is completely absent and replaced by a more complex HexNAc(5)Hex(7)Fuc(1)NeuAc(2) glycoform in LDKO livers. These data are in line with gene expression changes, and consistently, we find complex N-glycan decorations in LDKO.

Next, we assessed whether Shp alone can regulate expression of these genes and found St3gal6 and St6gal1 up-regulation in the liver-specific Shp knockout mice compared to their respective controls ( Fig. 2E ). We also tested the role for FXR in controlling the expression of glycosyltransferases by activating it with its agonist GW4064 in WT mice. FXR activation led to a modest but significant down-regulation of Mgat5 but did not alter the expression of Fut8, St3gal6, and St6gal1 levels ( Fig. 2F ). This result indicates that FXR can suppress Mgat5 expression, whereas SHP can suppress Stgal expression and together coordinate the expression of several glycosyl transferases. We next analyzed the publicly available hepatic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets for FXR ( 27 ) and SHP ( 28 ) to determine whether these nuclear receptors bind to their respective target genes, Mgat5, and St3gal6 and St6gal1. Although no SHP binding was observed in St3gal6 and St6gal1 DNA sequences (fig. S5A), we did find a robust FXR-binding peak along with its core motif (ER2, “TGACCTCAAACTCA”) within the intron 4 of Mgat5 gene (fig. S5B). These data support the hypothesis that FXR may directly regulate Mgat5 transcription, whereas SHP may indirectly regulate transcription of St3gal6 and St6gal1.

As global Fxr-Shp double-knockout mice show elevated CYP17A1 expression and its enzymatic product 17 hydroxy progesterone (17OHP) ( 12 ), we investigated and found similar up-regulation of Cyp17a1 mRNA expression in LDKO livers (fig. S4A). However, serum 17OHP levels in LDKO were below the detectable limit (fig. S4A). Exogenous 17OHP administration to the wild-type (WT) mice (fig. S4, B and C) led to a decrease in mRNA levels of N-glycosylation genes (fig. S4D) with an increase in certain glycan decorations but not fucosylation (fig. S4E). These results indicate that 17OHP is not sufficient to explain the N-glycosylation phenotype of LDKO mice.

To test whether BA overload seen in the LDKO livers was sufficient to induce expression of N-linked glycosyltransferases, we analyzed the RNA-seq data of CA-treated control livers. We found no significant differences in transcript levels of glycosyltransferases ( Fig. 2C ). Then, we tested whether a toxic hydrophobic BA, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), can alter the expression of glycosyltransferases. When we treated primary hepatocytes with DCA, we found a modest suppression in Mgat5, Fut8, and St6gal1 expression ( Fig. 2D ) rather than the induction observed in LDKO livers. These findings demonstrate that elevated BAs are not responsible for the induction of glycosyltransferases.

( A ) Heatmap indicates up-regulation of key glycosyltransferase genes that are involved in “decorating” glycoproteins in LDKO livers. (n = 3 mice per group, Student t test, fold change > 1.5, P < 0.05). ( B ) Schematic highlighting the steps of cellular protein processing in ER and Golgi apparatus. ( C ) Bar graphs comparing the FPKM values indicate up-regulation of glycosylation genes in LDKO livers is not a consequence of BA overload (n = 3 mice per group; one-way ANOVA, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001). ( D ) Incubation of primary hepatocytes with a toxic BA, such as DCA, suppresses the N-glycosylation genes instead (n = hepatocytes cultured in triplicates from two mice per group; Student t test, *P < 0.05 and ****P < 0.0001). Qualitative RT-PCR analysis of ( E ) liver-specific SHP knockout (LSKO) livers and ( F ) FXR-activated (treated with GW4064, FXR agonist) livers reveal that FXR and SHP individually regulate some of these glycosylation genes (n = 5 to 8 mice per group; Student t test, **P < 0.01 and ****P < 0.0001).

Instead, the RNA-seq data showed up-regulation of essential N-linked glycosyltransferases ( 7 , 8 , 23 ) ( Fig. 2A ), such as Mgat5 (N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase V) that promotes glycan branching, Fut8 (α-1,6-fucosyltransferase) that adds fucose to the glycan core, and St3gal6 and St6gal1 (sialyltransferases) that add sialyl groups ( Fig. 2B ). These glycosyltransferases “decorate” proteins associated with the cell-matrix and cell-cell contact and promote tumorigenesis ( 9 , 24 – 26 ). Higher expression of Mgat5, St3gal6, and St6gal1 are associated with poor survival of patients with liver cancer (fig. S3E), suggesting that stringent control of their expression is critical to maintain normal liver function.

To decipher the molecular networks coordinately regulated by hepatic FXR-SHP, we performed RNA-seq analysis and found more than 2600 significantly altered transcripts in LDKO livers compared to the controls. Of these, 1253 were up-regulated, while 865 were down-regulated in LDKO livers (fig. S3, A and C). Gene network analysis pinpointed several known signaling and metabolic pathways including response to nutrients, cell adhesion, and drug clearance. Unexpectedly, we found an enrichment of genes involved in the glycosylation pathway ( Fig. 1C and fig. S3B). Upon further analysis, we found that these alterations were unique for N-linked, but not O-linked, glycosylation (fig. S3D). Consistent with this observation, intracellular O-GlcNAcylation ( Fig. 1D ) and the expression of genes regulating O-GlcNAcylation, Ogt, and Mgea5 ( 21 , 22 ) were unchanged ( Fig. 1E ).

We next investigated whether the genes involved in maintaining BA homeostasis were altered in LDKO mice (fig. S2D). SHP is known to turn off genes responsible for BA synthesis ( 14 , 18 – 20 ), including Cyp7a1 (cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase) and Cyp8b1 (sterol 12-alpha-hydroxylase). Both these genes were poorly repressed in LDKO livers upon CA challenge, unlike the controls. We found that LDKO livers showed reduced basal expression of canalicular transporter Bsep (Abcb11) and lost the CA-mediated up-regulation of Bsep and Mdr1a (Abcb1a) expression compared to control livers. Genes responsible for BA uptake into hepatocytes Ntcp was up-regulated in LDKO + CA but not in control + CA, whereas Oatp1 was suppressed in both groups. Although, CA-fed LDKO livers revealed pronounced induction of BA efflux transporters Mrp3 (Abcc3) and Mrp4 (Abcc4) (fig. S2E), it was insufficient to compensate for the loss in canalicular transport, and the increase in hepatic uptake led to excess hepatic BAs.

Biochemical characterization revealed ( A ) severe liver injury (marked by serum ALT and AST levels) and ( B ) bile acid accumulation in LDKO + CA mice compared to the controls (n = 6 to 11 mice per group, one-way ANOVA, *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001). ( C ) RNA-seq was performed on the livers of chow-fed control and LDKO mice. Functional clusters display enrichment of glycosylation upon Fxr-Shp deletion. Blue circles: down-regulated; red circles: up-regulated in LDKO mice (n = 3 mice per group). ( D ) Neither intracellular O-GlcNAcylation levels nor ( E ) the genes regulated O-GlcNAcylation, Ogt and Mgea5 were enhanced in LDKO mice (n = 3 to 4 mice per group; Student t test, P < 0.05 was considered significant). GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. FPKM, fragments per kilobase million; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor.

Bile acids (BAs), the cholesterol metabolites synthesized in the liver, are responsible for fat digestion. By activating FXR and SHP in the liver, BAs autoregulate their concentrations ( 14 – 17 ). LDKO mice exhibited poor response to cholic acid (CA; a primary bile acid in humans) supplemented diet. Focal inflammation and ballooned hepatocytes were observed in chow-fed LDKO livers, which were more evident in CA-fed LDKO livers (fig. S2A). Markers of liver injury, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were significantly elevated in LDKO + CA ( Fig. 1A ). Compared to controls, LDKO mice accumulated pathological levels of BAs in the plasma, liver ( Fig. 1B ), and gall bladder (fig. S2B) in response to the CA diet. However, ileal BA levels were unchanged (fig. S2C), indicating that the intact intestinal FXR-SHP axis in LDKO mice was sufficient to maintain the ileal BA concentrations.

Last, we observed an altered secretome of LDKO livers, which is consistent with a recent study that predicted that FXR may control hepatocyte secretome ( 50 ). Our findings provide a mechanism and additional evidence of how the secretory ability of the liver may be altered when the hepatic FXR and SHP axis is deleted. Overall, this study defines a previously unidentified role for FXR and SHP in regulating glycosylation, a less understood posttranslational modification, which is distinct from their conventional role in nutrient homeostasis. Understanding how hepatic FXR-SHP axis specifically regulates Golgi dynamics and N-glycosylation will open new avenues to target various cellular pathways.

Since the altered glycosyltransferases in the LDKO mice—Mgat5, Fut8, and St3gals—are localized only in medial- and trans-Golgi apparatus ( 23 , 49 ), this indicates a spatial specificity of the hepatic FXR-SHP regulation. To this effect, we did not observe any ER stress in the LDKO livers. The structural defect was localized to the Golgi apparatus in LDKO livers. Furthermore, many of the N-linked glycoproteins present in the exosomes, lysosomes, and ER were up-regulated in the LDKO livers. Not only more complex glycoforms are expressed in LDKO livers but also glycoforms that were not detected in controls. These “hyperglycoforms” in LDKO may alter the function of the protein, resulting in defective signaling pathways.

To further probe how LDKO mice fuel the increased N-glycosylation in the liver, we examined various glucose metabolic pathways and found no alterations in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and gluconeogenesis. However, we observed reduced serum glucose levels and hepatic glycogen pools in LDKO mice that could be used through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathways to increase N-glycosylation. Despite increase N-glycans in the LDKO mice, we found no differences in the levels of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNac in the livers, indicating similar flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway between the LDKO and WT livers and that the hexosamine pathway is not rate limiting in this process.

Next, we tested whether FXR and SHP can individually alter the expression profiles of these glycosyltransferases. Loss of hepatic SHP induced expression of sialyltransferases, whereas FXR activation suppressed Mgat5 gene, which is responsible for glycan branching, indicating that FXR and SHP coordinate the N-linked glycan landscape at the transcript level in the liver.

Challenging hepatocytes with high bile acid concentrations in vitro and 17OHP in vivo both resulted in suppression of genes involved in N-glycosylation. This BA-mediated decrease in glcosylation was also observed in previously published studies ( 46 – 48 ). Thus, it is unlikely that the increase in BA or 17OHP directly caused the observed up-regulation of glycosyltransferases in LDKO livers.

We serendipitously found a role for FXR and SHP in regulating the N-glycosylation status of liver proteins through RNA-seq data of control and LDKO livers. Only the N-glycosylation specific to Golgi was induced, with no difference in the levels of intracellular O-GlcNAcylation or ER N-glycosylation. Particularly, the “branching” glycosyltransferase Mgat5, core fucosyltransferase Fut8, and sialyltransferases St3gal6 and St6gal1 ( 7 , 23 , 45 ) were induced in the absence of hepatic FXR-SHP axis. We validated the gene expression data and found increases in core fucosylation and triantennary complex branching of glycan moieties on LDKO N-glycoproteins by glycomics.

Unlike global Fxr-Shp double-knockout mice ( 12 ), the LDKOs did not accumulate excessive bile acids under basal conditions. However, they were defective in their response to a bile acid overload (CA-enriched diet), indicating that the hepatic FXR-SHP axis is necessary for this function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and experimental design Fxr-floxed and Shp-floxed mice, obtained from K. Schoonjans laboratory, were intercrossed to obtain double-floxed homozygous Fxr-Shp mice (Fxrfl/fl Shpfl/fl). Furthermore, these Fxrfl/fl Shpfl/fl (control) mice were bred with mice expressing the Cre-recombinase under the control of albumin promoter (AlbCre mice, Envigo/Harlan laboratories) to obtain liver-specific double knockouts (Fxrfl/fl Shpfl/fl AlbCre+, LDKO). The mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background and housed on a standard 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. Both the control and LDKO mice were born in regular Mendelian ratios. To study how LDKO mice respond to BA-induced stress, we fed LDKO and control mice with normal chow or 1% CA diet for 5 days. Plasma, liver, gall bladder, and ileum were collected between Zeitgeber times ZT4 to ZT6 (n = 6 to 12 mice per group). Fasted C57BL/6J mice (Envigo/Harlan laboratories) were gavaged with either vehicle [1% methylcellulose and 1% TritonX-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)] or FXR agonist GW4064 (50 mg/kg). Mice were gavaged twice, first in the evening and second in the morning, and euthanized 3 hours after second gavage (n = 5 mice per group). To examine the role for 17OHP, we injected WT mice with 17OHP (125 mg/kg, i.p) or corn oil twice on the first day, followed by once daily injections for four additional days. All the experiments were carried out on 10- to 12-week-old male mice, fasted for 8 to 10 hours unless specified as outlined in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the National Academy of Sciences (NIH publication 86-23, revised 1985), and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Genotyping Mouse tails were clipped during weaning to obtain genomic DNA. Tails were lysed using DirectPCR tail lysis buffer (Viagen Biotech) and proteinase K by an overnight incubation at 55°C. Proteinase K was heat-inactivated for 1 to 2 hours, and PCR was performed on the DNA isolated using primers listed in table S1.

Chemicals Methylcellulose was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no. 0262), GW4064 was obtained from Cayman Chemicals and 17OHP (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary hepatocytes isolated from C57BL/6J mice were incubated with 100 μM DCA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 hours (n = 2 mice per group, three technical replicates).

Serum biochemistry Blood was collected and centrifuged at 7000 to 8000g for 10 min. The plasma samples collected were tested for ALT and AST enzymes using Infinity ALT/GPT (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase) and AST/GOT (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase) kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasma BA levels were measured using a colorimetric BA assay kit (Genway) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The circulating albumin levels were quantitated using the Albumin [BCG (Bromocresol Green)] Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision). Control and LDKO mice (n = 5 to 6 mice per group) were fasted for four hours before collecting blood. Fresh plasma was analyzed for lipid metabolites by fast-protein liquid chromatography at Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania. For fasting blood glucose measurements, control and LDKO mice were fasted for 12 hours, and blood glucose was measured by tail bleeds using one-touch glucometer. Serum 17OHP levels were measured by mass spectroscopy at Roy J Carver Biotechnology Center Metabolomics Facility at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

Tissue BA assay For hepatic and intestinal BA analysis, about 100 mg of liver tissue or whole ileum was homogenized in 75% ethanol, followed by a 2-hour incubation at 50°C and centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was diluted with 1× PBS and used to measure BA content in the liver or intestine, respectively, using the colorimetric BA Assay Kit (GenWay) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The BA levels were normalized to the weight of the tissue used. For biliary BA measurements, intact gall bladders from mice were punctured to obtain the content, which was further diluted with 1× PBS and analyzed for BA pools.

Histology Liver tissues from all the mouse cohorts were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight, subsequently dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol (70 to 100%) and xylene, and lastly embedded in paraffin. Liver sections (5 μm thick) were cut, deparaffinized, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard histological protocols. These sections were also stained with periodic acid and Schiff’s reagent for PAS staining. Briefly, the deparaffinized sections were stained with 0.5% periodic acid for 10 min, followed by wash in water and incubation in Schiff’s solution for 30 min. Next, slides are rinsed in 0.55% potassium metabisulfite for 30 s and washed in running warm tap water for 10 min to develop the pink color. Last, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted, and imaged.

RNA-seq analysis RNA was isolated from control and LDKO livers (n = 3 per group) using the RNeasy Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was tested using an Agilent bioanalyzer by the Functional Genomics Core at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, UIUC (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign). HiSeq libraries were prepared, and 100–base pair (bp) paired-end Illumina sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 4000 at the high-throughput sequencing and genotyping unit, UIUC. Reads were processed for quality using Trimmomatic (51) and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using STAR (52). Gene expression was determined as fragments per kilobase million using count and differential expression values obtained from DESeq2 (53) and HTseq (54). Fold change of >1.5 and <0.67 was considered significant. Gene Ontology pathway and cellular component analysis were performed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) and mapped using Enrichment maps plugin in Cytoscape. Mouse reference gene set served as background. The RNA-seq data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (55) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE164447 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164447).

Identifying DNA binding motifs The gene sequences were retrieved from the Ensembl genome browser, release 102 (56). These sequences were then run using FIMO (Find Individual Motif Occurrences) software (57). FIMO uses a position-dependent scoring matrix that describes the score of each possible nucleotide at each position in the given sequence. Motifs containing or resembling the canonical “IR1 (AGGTCAnTGACCT) and ER2 (TGACCTnnAGGTCA) motifs” were identified and compared with the binding peaks identified using the ChIP-seq dataset (27, 28).

Quantitative real-time PCR and splicing assay analysis RNA was isolated from snap-frozen livers (n = 4 to 5 per group) using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed for gene expression analysis by SYBR Green–based Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using mouse-specific primer sets listed in table S2. Relative gene expression was calculated by delta-delta Ct method and was normalized to 36B4 as loading control. For Xbp-1 splicing assay, the complementary DNA samples from both control and LDKO livers were run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel to examine its spliced isoforms. Percentage (%) exclusion for the variably spliced region was calculated with ImageLab software (Bio-Rad) as [(exon inclusion band intensity)/(exon inclusion band intensity + exon exclusion band intensity) × 100].

Detection of O-GlcNAc by Western blot Liver tissues were homogenized in Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Protein (30 μm) was run out on a PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated overnight with antibodies to O-GlcNAc (RL2, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam). Visualization was done using the Li-Cor Odyssey and analysis using the Li-Cor Image Studio Software.

Extraction of proteins from mouse liver for glycomics, glycoproteomics, and proteomics Control and LDKO liver tissues (n = 5 mice per group) were tested for glycan structural diversity in glycoproteins using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time-of-flight (45) and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) at Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia. Briefly, about 100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in a 1:1 ratio of ice-cold methanol/water. Chloroform:methanol:water at the ratio of 4:8:3 was added, mixed vigorously, and left to incubate at room temperature for approximately 2 hours on a bench rocker. The sample was then centrifuged at 4°C, 3000 rpm for 15 min to separate the precipitated tissue proteins from the supernatant glycolipids layer. The chloroform:methanol:water extraction was repeated two more times. The protein pellet was blown for a few minutes under a stream of nitrogen, and 1 ml of ice-cold water, along with 4 ml of ice-cold acetone, was added for acetone precipitation at −20°C. After about 4 hours, the sample was centrifuged at 4°C, 3000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was discarded. Acetone precipitation was repeated one more time, and lastly, the pellets were processed using only 4 ml of ice-cold acetone, following the same procedure. The pellets were then dried under the nitrogen stream and stored at −80°C for further analysis.

Glycomics analysis About 5 mg of protein pellet was resuspended in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer and digested with trypsin for 24 hours at 37°C, followed by purification by passing through a C18 solid-phase cartridge after inactivating trypsin by heating at 95°C for 5 min. The eluted peptides were treated twice with peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGaseF) for a total incubation time of 18 hours. The released N-glycans were separated from the peptides by passing through a C18 solid-phase cartridge and were dried by lyophilization. These N-glycans were permethylated with methyl iodide for 10 min at room temperature with shaking. The reaction was quenched by adding water, and the permethylated glycans were extracted in dichloromethane, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS by using DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) as the matrix (58). For 17OHP experiments, about 50 mg of liver tissue was washed with PBS two times and homogenized in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer using a 20-gauge needle and syringe. The sample was probe-sonicated for 2 min, followed by ultrafiltration thrice using 10-kDa centrifuge filters (MilliporeSigma Amicon, UFC501024). The protein solution from the filter was collected in the ammonium bicarbonate buffer with PNGaseF and incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. The N-glycans were then purified, permethylated, and analyzed by MALDI-MS as mentioned above.

Glycoproteomics analysis About 1 mg of proteins extracted was dissolved in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Dithiothreitol solution (17 mg/ml) was added to the samples and incubated at 37°C for 90 min, followed by incubation with iodoacetamide solution (65 mg/ml) at room temperature for 90 min in the dark for carbamidomethylation. The sample was dialyzed against double-distilled water and digested by trypsin (0.4 μg/μl; Promega) at a trypsin to protein ratio of 1:40 and incubated at 37°C for 12 hours. The digestion was terminated by heating at 95°C for 5 min, desalted by C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges, and then samples were dried under speed vacuum. The peptides and glycopeptides were subsequently redissolved in 0.1% formic acid in water. The digests were enriched for the glycopeptides by using the ProteoExtract Glycopeptide Enrichment Kit (Millipore, MA) and stored at −80°C until analysis by nano–liquid chromatography–tandem MS (LC-MS/MS). Desalted liver protein digests were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) equipped with a nanospray ion source and connected to a Dionex binary solvent system. Prepacked nano-LC columns of 15 cm length with 75 μm internal diameter, filled with 3-μm C18 material, were used for chromatographic separation of digests. Precursor ion scan was performed at 120,000 resolution in an Orbitrap analyzer, and precursors at a time frame of 3 s were selected for subsequent fragmentation using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy of 28 and collision-induced dissociation (CID) at a normalized collision energy of 40. The threshold for triggering an MS/MS event was set to 500 counts. The fragment ions were analyzed on Orbitrap after HCD and CID fragmentation at a resolution of 30,000. Charge-state screening was enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state or a charge state of +1 were excluded (positive ion mode). Dynamic exclusion was enabled with an exclusion duration of 30 s. The LC-MS/MS spectra of the tryptic digest of proteins were searched against mouse protein database in.fasta format (downloaded from uniport) using Byonic 2.3 software with trypsin as the digestion enzyme. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were selected as variable modifications. Common mammalian N-glycans were used as variable modifications on asparagines. The LC-MS/MS spectra were analyzed manually for the glycopeptide fragmentation on HCD and CID with the support of Xcalibur 3.0.63 software. The spectra of glycopeptides were evaluated for the glycan neutral loss pattern, oxonium ions, and the glycopeptide fragmentations and identified the glycans. For the relative ratio calculation, the peak area of the glycoforms was extracted manually using the Xcalibur 3.0.63 software. Unannotated glycopeptides were identified on the basis of the presence of oxonium ions and neutral losses on the spectra of glycopeptides.

Nucleotide sugar extraction and detection Sugars from liver tissues were extracted as described previously (59). Approximately 50 mg of mouse liver tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of cold 80% ethanol in a gentleMACS (Miltenyi Biotec) dissociator. Tissue lysates were centrifuged at 8000g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge overnight. The evaporated samples were dissolved in 9% butanol, and lipids were removed by three extractions with 90% butanol. The lower aqueous fraction was evaporated overnight by vacuum centrifuge. Samples were resuspended in 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and sugar nucleotides were extracted using EnviCarb graphitized carbon columns (Supelco). Columns were prepared by washing with 3 ml of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, followed by 2 ml of water. Samples were loaded, and the column was washed with 2 ml of water and 2 ml of 25% acetonitrile, followed by 2 ml of 50 mM TEAA (Triethylammonium acetate) buffer. Samples were eluted with 2 ml of 25% acetonitrile and 50 mM TEAA. Eluate was evaporated overnight in a vacuum centrifuge and dissolved in 240 μl of 40 mM sodium phosphate buffer. A Dionex (Thermo Fisher Scientific) HPIC (High Pressure Ion Chromatography) system consisting of a Dionex ICS-6000, CarboPac PA1 column 2x250, and PA1 guard column 2x50 under the control of Chromeleon 7 software was used for analysis. The program involved a gradient made of the following solutions: A = dionized water; B = 1 mM NaOH; C = 1 mM NaOH/1 M NaOAC. The gradient was isocratic B followed by a 20-min gradient up to 60% C. A step up to 100 B was used to clean the column before an equilibration back to 100 A. Ultraviolet absorbances were collected at 260 nm. Concentrations of nucleotide sugars detected were normalized to wet weight of tissues.

Lectin staining Liver sections (5 μm thick) from control and LDKO mice were cut, deparaffinized, and stained for lectins such as UEA (Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin) (binds fucose), PHA-L (binds complex glycans), and SNA (binds sialic acid) from Vector Laboratories. Briefly, sections were blocked with Carbo-free Blocking solution (SP-5040, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by fluorescently labeled lectin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were then washed twice in PBST (Phosphate Buffered Saline with Triton X-100) and stained, mounted with Vectashield Hardset mounting media (H-1400, Vector Laboratories), and imaged using confocal microscope LSM 710 at Institute for Genomic Biology Core facility, UIUC using 488-nm laser, and a red psuedocolor was assigned to it.

Immunostaining of primary hepatocytes Primary hepatocytes from control and LDKO mice were isolated using a two-step collagenase perfusion technique using 3000 U collagenase type I from Worthington. Cells were layered onto a 30% Percoll gradient and centrifuged at 600 rpm for 10 min. The pellet, rich in live hepatocytes, was then washed, cultured in growing medium (Williams E media supplemented with 1× insulin-transferrin-selenium solution from Gibco, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 1× l-glutamine), and plated in collagen-coated fluorodishes. Media was changed 2 hours after plating to remove dead, nonadherent cells, and the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 to 15 min after two more hours, followed by lectin staining as mentioned above. These cells are further permeabilized with 1× PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated in the blocking buffer (1× PBS + 1% normal goat serum) for 30 min. The primary antibody for Golgin 97 (catalog no. 13192, Cell Signaling Technology) was applied to the sections at 1:100 concentration and incubated overnight at 4°C. Next, the sections were washed in the blocking buffer, and secondary fluorescent antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594) were applied for 1 hour at room temperature. Last, the cells were incubated with NucBlue nuclear staining probes (R37606, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at room temperature and then imaged on a Zeiss LSM 710 microscope at Institute for Genomic Biology core facility, UIUC.

Transmission electron microscopy Liver sections (1 mm thick) were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (pH 7) for 2 to 3 hours, followed by postfixation with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 60 min. These sections are then dehydrated through ethanol series and embedded using epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections are cut and left to dry, followed by imaging using transmission electron microscopy.

Western blot Total proteins were isolated from ~50 mg of snap-frozen liver tissue by homogenizing in 600 μl of cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 10 mM tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and phosphatase and protease inhibitors (one tablet per 10 ml of buffer; catalog nos. 4906837001 and 4693159001). Samples were sonicated in a water bath to shear DNA and clarified by centrifugation. Protein concentration was measured using the DC (detergent compatible) Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, 5000112). Proteins (~20 μg) were resolved on a 4 to 20% TGX (Tris-Glycine eXtended) gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred semidry using “Mixed MW” program on the Bio-Rad Trans Blot Turbo System onto a nitrocellulose membrane with 0.45-μm pore size (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature using tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were then incubated with primary antibody against albumin (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, no. 4929) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed thrice with TBST, followed by incubation with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000; Bio-Rad, no. 1706515) for 1 hour. Membranes were then visualized on the ChemiDoc MP using the Clarity Western ECL Kit (Bio-Rad).","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf4865/F1.large.jpg,"['modifications', 'ldko', 'fig', 'n', 'regulate', 'using', 'nuclear', 'protein', 'levels', 'receptors', 'livers', 'fxr', 'nglycan', 'expression', 'liver', 'shp', 'control', 'mice']", 
44,44,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,How are Back-to-Back Meetings Affecting Your Brain? - UC Today,https://www.uctoday.com/collaboration/how-are-back-to-back-meetings-affecting-your-brain/,"How many back-to-back meetings do you have in a week?

For many, back-to-back meetings have become a standard part of the pandemic world. As soon as one meeting ends, you barely have time for a sip of water before another begins. Microsoft Teams, the solution behind many of those meetings, recently revealed some findings on how our everyday interactions are really affecting us.

According to the research, breaks are absolutely essential if we want to improve our ability to engage and focus in meetings. According to Jared Spataro, CVP of Microsoft 365, back-to-back meetings simply aren’t sustainable.

What the Research Found

Microsoft’s research revealed that breaks between meetings are essential in allowing the brain to reset and reduce the ongoing build-up of stress from one meeting to the next. Two straight hours of back-to-back meetings in a previous study showed beta waves (stress waves) increasing over time. However, when participants took a break, the waves reset.

Microsoft went on to note that when participants had meditation breaks between meetings, their brainwaves had better frontal alpha asymmetry. This basically means they were more engaged during the meeting.

Additionally, if being in a constant meeting wasn’t problematic enough, jumping between meetings can be a high source of stress too. Participants not taking breaks in Microsoft’s studies saw peaks in stress when they were moving between calls.

The takeaway, according to Microsoft, is that we all need to embed more breaks into our daily practices, particularly when it comes to meetings.

How Microsoft is Helping

To address the demand for breaks in the regular meeting environment, Microsoft has implemented settings in Outlook that allow companies and individuals alike to take five, ten, and fifteen minutes off Microsoft Teams meetings. The idea is that this will give people a chance to relax and decompress between meetings, rather than jumping between conversations.

For instance, you might decide to implement a five-minute break between each meeting, so set Outlook to only set meetings on five-past the hour. There’s an Outlook support page available that shows you how to set up the various settings from an individual perspective.

Outlook and Microsoft Teams are relied on by millions of people worldwide today. However, Microsoft believes it’s important for good meetings to be accompanied by good wellbeing. Aside from access to new Outlook scheduling features, Microsoft also introduced a personal wellbeing insights solution in Teams, which helps you to become aware of how you’re spending your time.

This environment, within the Microsoft Viva experience platform, intends to support employees in making better decisions about how to schedule their time, not just from a productivity perspective. Viva Insights will even be bringing Headspace meditation and mindfulness experiences into Teams, so you can disconnect from work better in the evenings, or just take a break between meetings.","Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.uctoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Reveals-the-Impact-of-Constant-Meetings.jpg,"['outlook', 'stress', 'breaks', 'meeting', 'set', 'brain', 'teams', 'backtoback', 'microsoft', 'affecting', 'waves', 'meetings']", 
45,45,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Why insurgent groups in northern Nigeria continue to kidnap school children - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/why-insurgent-groups-in-northern-nigeria-continue-to-kidnap-school-children-159965,"This is a transcript of episode 12 of The Conversation Weekly podcast: “Why children keep getting kidnapped in Nigeria + the Kenyan women who join Al-Shabaab”. In this episode, insurgent groups in northern Nigeria continue to kidnap schoolchildren as the government struggles to protect communities against militants such as Boko Haram. And we speak to a researcher who has interviewed Kenyan women about why they joined the militant Islamist group Al-Shabaab.

NOTE: Transcripts may contain errors. Please check the corresponding audio before quoting in print.

Gemma Ware: Hello and welcome to The Conversation Weekly. I’m Gemma Ware in London, and for this episode I’m joined by my colleague Wale Fatade in Lagos, Nigeria. Hello Wale.

Wale: Hi Gemma. Good to be with you.

Gemma: This week, why insurgent groups in northern Nigeria continue to kidnap school children.

Wale: And why the government has been unable to improve the security situation in the region.

Hakeem Onapajo: They use children to negotiate during conflict.

Gemma: And we speak to a researcher who has interviewed Kenyan women about why they joined the militant group Al-Shabaab.

Fathima Azmiya Badurdeen: So because you’re not strong as an individual then you feel like joining the Al-Shabaab.

Gemma: You’re listening to The Conversation Weekly, the world explained by experts.

Wale: Gemma, today I’m going to take you to Nigeria.

Gemma: Wale, where are we talking to you from?

Wale: I’m talking to you from Lagos, but today we are going to talk about the north, specifically the north-eastern part of Nigeria.

Gemma: And what’s it like in the north?

Wale: The north used to be very beautiful. We have partly desert, partly savannah. You can stand in a particular location and see farther, farther, far without any structure obstructing your view, like the forest that you have in the south. But now it’s been pretty scary these days, because now it’s a scene of banditry, kidnapping and terrorist attacks.

Gemma: And we’re talking today about children in particular. So what’s it like being a child growing up in this part of Nigeria in the north?

Wale: Children used to roam around and move freely, but now to be a child in north-eastern part of Nigeria, it’s more likely to be kidnapped, abducted or taken away in the classroom or on the way to school.

Gemma: Are children still being kidnapped?

Wale: Oh yes, we had an incident in December last year where 333 students were kidnapped. Some days later, another batch of students were kidnapped from an Islamic school, in Mahuta too, in Katsina state. Early this year in February 27, students were abducted in Kagara, Niger state. Some days later, 317 school girls were abducted in Jangebe. And some days later, at the Federal College of Forestry and Agriculture, some students were kidnapped. As of now, 29 of them are still being captured by these kidnappers.

Gemma: And even this week there’s been another attack, hasn’t there?

Wale: Yeah, there’s been another attack in a town called Damasak in Borno state, which has witnessed several attacks. People have been chased away from their homes and some people were killed, I think about eight people.

Gemma: And so who is behind these attacks?

Wale: It used to be Boko Haram. It’s a terror group, that is known for abduction. Known for trying to prevent children from going to school and it loosely translate “book is forbidden”, that is anything western education is not something that they’re in support of. But now that has metamorphosed into Islamic State in West Africa, ISWAP as they are called. And then there are also other groups kidnapping for money. And these are the people that the Nigerian media loosely refer to as bandits.

Gemma: And so for this episode, you’ve been speaking to some experts about what’s been happening, right?

Wale: I’ve been speaking to two experts to find out more about why children are being targeted by insurgent groups, including Boko Haram and all these other groups. And then also the challenges the Nigerian government faces now in improving security in the northern part of the country.

Hakeem Onapajo: I’m Hakeem Onapajo, I’m a senior lecturer in the department of political science and international relations at Nile University of Nigeria. That’s in Abuja.

Wale: Hakeem’s research focuses on the northeast of Nigeria, and the neighbouring region surrounding Lake Chad.

Hakeem: I’ve researched extensively on the problem of Boko Haram and the north-eastern part of the country. So we were talking about, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger Republic. These are the areas that are more affected by the activities of the terrorists.

Wale: He says that civilians have borne much of the brunt of the conflict involving Boko Haram. The militant organisation wants to overthrow the government of President Muhammadu Buhari and create an Islamist state.

Hakeem: Civilians have been a major casualty in the whole violence in that particular region. About 16,000 people have been killed and we’ve had over 2 million people that have been displaced.

Wale: Recently, Hakeem’s research has turned to look at the impact the conflict in northern Nigeria has had on the most vulnerable: children. He’s recently published new research in the journal African Security on the issue, and has just written an article about it for The Conversation.

Hakeem: I was able to discover that the conflict has a huge impact on the welfare and security of children in that area. A UN report show that almost 4,000 children were killed between 2015 and 2016, that’s just in one year and while we have about 7,000 of them injured in various attacks.

Read more: Why children are prime targets of armed groups in northern Nigeria

Wale: Children have been caught right in the middle of the conflict and have as a result often suffered the most.

Hakeem: As a result of suicide attacks, as a result of air and ground strikes. As a result of extra judicial killings by state security forces, especially on suspicions of being suicide bombers.

Wale: Many of those who survive attacks are then displaced from their homes by the conflict.

Hakeem: UNICEF reported that about 57% of the total 2 million people, those who are affected as internally displaced people, in the IDP camps are children and half of this number. You have about 244,000 of them suffering from severe malnutrition. And worse still, it’s estimated that about 49,000 of them would die if there was no emergency treatment. So it’s a serious situation that we have in that part of the region. And the more worrisome aspect of it is a massive recruitment of children as child soldiers in that area.

Wale: While the conflict has only received international attention in the past five to six years, Boko Haram’s activities go back at least until 2009.

Hakeem: The activities of the group have been there for some time in terms of missionary activities.

Wale: The general consensus among researchers is that the group’s mostly missionary activities were generally peaceful.

Hakeem: The menace of Boko Haram actually started in 2009 when the group had a clash with state security agencies.

Wale: In the clashes, the Nigerian government killed an estimated 800 Boko Haram members including the leader, Mohammed Yusuf. Following the attack, the group retaliated under its new leader Abubakar Shekau, by launching an insurgency campaign against the Nigerian state.

Hakeem: They started by targeting security officials or anything that has a semblance or has a figure of the state.

Wale: But soon the group shifted its focus to target civilians.

Hakeem: Later they were seeking means to gain international attention. So they moved towards attacking civilians because they are actually the vulnerable groups in the society. Now civilians constitute one of their major targets.

Wale: And gradually, Boko Haram militants began targeting children.

Hakeem: They started by going to dormitories, boarding houses, schools to attack the children. They were used by suicide bombers then. And if you look at the gender dimensions their penchant to go after girls. They also use them as domestic slaves to work for them in their camps. They use them as sex slaves. They rape them.

Wale: Eventually, Boko Haram garnered international attention in 2014 when it kidnapped 276 girls in Borno State in a place called Chibok.

Hakeem: The group was relatively unknown before their kidnap of the Chibok girls. And immediately after the kidnap, there was this global campaign for the release of the children, the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.

Wale: High-profile politicians and celebrities, including then-first lady, Michelle Obama, came forward posting pictures of themselves on social media, holding up banners that said “Bring Back Our Girls”.

International efforts to rescue the girls involved the intervention of the human security division of the Swiss government’s foreign ministry and the Red Cross. Between 2016 and 2021 some 100 of the Chibok girls were freed in exchange for about US$3.7 million in ransoms. Of the remaining 176, some have escaped or died, and at least 100 girls are still believed to be living in Boko Haram’s captivity.

Hakeem says, it was this reaction from the international community that led Boko Haram to kidnap the girls in the first place.

Hakeem: So that itself popularised the group. And besides that, they can also use that to negotiate for some ransom in order to fund their operations. So these are some of the reasons why children are very strategic to their activities.

Wale: There are other reasons why Boko Haram continues to kidnap children.

Hakeem: They use the children to negotiate during conflict, for the release of their members that have been in prisons. Because of the emotional aspect of children, they feel the government would easily listen to them.

Wale: But Boko Haram is just one of many insurgent groups in Nigeria. Across the country, conflict and armed groups are threatening the lives of Nigerians, such as the conflict in the west, between Fulani herdsmen and Yoruba farmers.

And security issues are not confined to the north-east of the country. Bandits and other armed groups, like the Islamic State in West Africa, have begun doing copycat kidnappings in the north-west of the country, most recently in Zamfara state when 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped and released a few days later in early March.

Earlier this month, in April, a prison in Nigeria’s southeast in the town of Owerri, was attacked by members of a new armed insurrection. The gunmen share no affiliation or ideological interest with Boko Haram. Whether it’s Boko Haram or other insurgent groups, this all points to a much larger question around security in Nigeria.

To understand more about what the government has been doing – or hasn’t been doing – I reached out to Samuel Okunade.

Samuel Okunade: The state of insecurity in Nigeria is rife. Currently there’s still killings, banditry and of course kidnapping.

Wale: Samuel is a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, where he researches the goevrnment’s response to the attacks by Boko Haram and how communities in the north-east of Nigeria have dealt with the conflict.

Samuel: The constant attacks being carried out by the insurgent group, built my curiosity to finding out the coping strategies which they’ve been able to evolve over the years to ensure their continued survival within those communities.

Wale: Samuel’s research focuses on communities living near Nigeria’s borders.

Samuel: We can also call this places borderlands. So these are, these are communities that you find on the borders between two independent states. And when you look at the way Boko Haram carry out their attacks at times, they live in, in some communities on the other side of the border. So they come into these communities at will to carry out their attacks, burn down houses, kill people, kidnap people.

Wale: As part of his work, Samuel focused on six border communities in 2017 and 2018, in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, where he looked at the Nigerian military’s response to the attacks by Boko Haram.

Samuel: I discovered that the Nigerian government, which is supposed to be the major player, the key stakeholder, has failed in its responsibility of combating the menace of the Boko Haram within that region and within the country at large. And that’s why the Boko Haram still continue to grow in leaps and bounds til date and they still continue to carry out attacks within the region. And gradually the attention is shifting to the bandits in the north-western part of Nigeria.

Wale: Samuel says this all points to the fact that there is a high rate of insecurity in Nigeria.

Samuel: And it’s not just the Boko Haram element now. It has peeled to the southern part of Nigeria. When we look away from the north-eastern region of Nigeria and we look into the north-western part, a lot of people have lost their lives to banditry, kidnappings, clashes between the farmers and the herders within that region.

Wale: But by far the biggest security threat continues to be Boko Haram. Until 2010 the Nigerian government had largely ignored the security conditions in north-east Nigeria.

Samuel: The Nigerian government was forced, was pushed, to respond. And this only happened when the United States blacklisted the Nigerian state for terrorism in January 2010.

Wale: Samuel is referring here to the use of a directive issued by the US Department of Homeland Security in 2010, which placed Nigeria on the US terror watch list alongside other so-called “countries of interest”. The measure effectively meant that citizens from countries including Nigeria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia, who travelled to the US were subjected to enhanced background checks and interrogation techniques at US airports.

As a result of the blacklisting, a diplomatic row ensued: Nigeria’s (then) minister of information, Professor Dora Akunyili, described the move as “unfair” and discriminatory, while foreign affairs minister then, Chief Ojo Maduekwe, said: “The new security measures by the US targeted at Nigerians is an unacceptable new year gift.”

But Samuel says, it was this designation of Nigeria as a country of interest that eventually spurred the government in Abuja into action the year after.

Samuel: They decided to work on an anti-terrorism legislation and that was what led to the Terrorism Prevention Act, which was signed into law in June 2011. Shortly after, the president then decided to form a special joint task force called JTF to respond. At the initial stages was composed of 30,000 troops and they were mobilised into the north-eastern state, especially the troubled areas to combat the attacks of the Boko Haram.

Wale: The Joint Task Force, made up of both members of the military and the Nigerian Police Force, coordinates intelligence and supports the Nigerian security forces in the fight against insurgents. While initially focusing mainly on localised counterinsurgency campaigns, its remit has expanded progressively over the years. In addition to armed protection of communities under attack by Boko Haram, members of the Joint Task Force have more recently been tasked with providing security to displaced populations living in camps for internally displaced people. But Samuel says much of the current strategy depends on regional and international support.

Samuel: At a point they got support from within Africa and from beyond. They got support for training, they got intelligence support. And they were also supported in terms of arms and ammunition, which are donated to them by various countries of the world. And some of them, even sent down troops to support in the fight against the Boko Haram.

Wale: But the government’s strategy wasn’t working.

Samuel: The Boko Haram still continued to grow and they still continue to carry out attacks within that region. The lackadaisical attitude being shown towards the fight against insurgency as impeded, or has prevented, the Nigerian government from successfully fighting the menace of insurgency within the region.

Wale: He says this is because the Joint Task Force is often overpowered by the insurgents, who carry superior arms and use guerrilla tactics in their attacks.

Samuel: The government has failed to adequately coordinate these huge resources is available to them to be able to fight and combat the Boko Haram menace. When you look at the reality, the kind of weapon, the military or the JTF carry is far, far, far less than what the force they are fighting is carrying.

Wale: Part of the reason the government has been unable to coordinate an effective response, Samuel says, is widespread corruption.

Samuel: Corruption has eaten deep into the fabrics of the Nigerian state. And that is the reason why they were earmarked so much money to purchase arms and ammunition and then at the end of the day, you discover that nothing as been purchased in the fight against this insurgency.

Wale: As a result of the corruption, many Nigerian soldiers have had to survive on meagre or often unpaid salaries.

Samuel: They’re being treated like slaves in their own country. And that’s the situation of the soldiers. We don’t have basic things to keep us going. And what are those basic things: water, food. It’s so alarming that things like that people who are risking their lives for their country would lack this kind of things. So if they lack food, if they lack of water, then we won’t be surprised that they would lack the needed firearm to combat the Boko Haram within that region.

Wale: Another part of the problem is that the Joint Task Force has allegedly engaged in unlawful killings, arrests, extortion and intimidation.

Samuel: They’ve been killing the local people indiscriminately, especially the youth and the men. And as a result of that, the people have lost trust in them. And we can see how the fight against insurgency within that region as dragged up til date to a point in which we now have another group in the north-west coming up now and carrying out kidnappings and all that.

Wale: In the interviews Samuel conducted for his research with people living in the border communities, he found that many had felt neglected by the government, leaving them to fend for themselves.

Samuel: There is this lady she’s called Aisha Bakari Gombi. She’s leading a force in Borno State, to counter the attacks of the Boko Haram in some of the border communities to see to the release of kidnapped children, women, by the Boko Haram. Today, we can see that some of them can happily to return to their farms, to live in those communities again, although they still have to be very conscious of their environment when they move around, because it’s still pretty dangerous for them.

Wale: Hakeem Onapajo told me that the issue goes beyond the government’s failure to protect its population, but that in some cases the state is complicit in using children.

Hakeem: The state supported militia group, that’s the CJT, the Civilian Joint Task Force, both of them are using children to fight in that particular region. So according to UN estimates, for example, about 8,000 children, are presently child soldiers in that region.

Wale: I asked Hakeem what he thought the government’s strategy should be to protect communities from attacks against insurgents and to stop more children from being kidnapped.

Hakeem: Number one, government has to have a new approach towards addressing the insecurity in the country. You know, it’s abhorrent that the approach has not been working. Security in the country, especially in that region, there should be much more commitment to international collaborations in addressing the problem of that area. There should be much more provision of the needed equipment for the soldiers to fight this particular group. And also they should be much more focused on the non-military approaches towards addressing the problem. You know, there are root causes behind the reign of terror in that region. I think much more focus should be on how to try to introduce programme that will prevent the easy recruitment and attacks of children in that region.

Wale: And he says the government needs to start prioritising children.

Hakeem: When I wrote my article someone commented that why should we be talking about child security? Why not talk about general security? But the answer to that is that, children have some of their peculiar interest and children are much more vulnerable. So the government must find a way to provide special security at places where children are actually located in schools, in IDP camps, in their homes.

Wale: Samuel warned that, unless the government rebuilds the trust with communities living in the shadow of Boko Haram, these communities will find other solutions to keep themselves safe.

Samuel: So one of the coping strategies, which I found out in some of the communities, many of them are going into alliance with the Boko Haram in terms of negotiation for security. And every month they give out groceries to them, they give out whatever the agreement is in exchange for security. When the lives of your citizens are not being protected, then people will lose trust in your government. And that’s exactly what we are witnessing presently in Nigeria. So the Nigerian state has to stand up to its responsibility of protecting lives and properties of the people.

Gemma: Thank you, Wale, for digging into the history of all that and how complex it is and how big a task it is for the government to really protect these communities. It sounds like it’s a real challenge.

Wale: Seriously, the government, must up its game in responding to all these attacks.

Gemma: Our listeners can read more from Hakeem Onapajo and Samuel Okunade about their research in some articles that they’ve written for The Conversation, which we’re going to be putting links to in our show notes.

Wale: And now we are crossing the continent from west to east for our second story today to hear about some new research in Kenya about another Islamist group - Al-Shabaab.

Gemma: Al-Shabaab is a militant group based in Somalia where it’s in a kind of violent stalemate with the Somali government and a coalition of foreign peacekeeping troops. From its bases in Somalia, Al-Shabaab continues to recruit people from the coastal region of neighbouring Kenya, including women. To find out more about these women, and the complex dynamics surrounding their involvement in Al-Shabaab, I called up Fathima Azmiya Badurdeen in Mombasa to talk about the interviews that she’s been doing with some of these women.

Fathima: I’m Fathima Azmiya. I work at the Department of Social Sciences, Technical University of Mombasa in Kenya. My study focuses on, recruitment of women and girls into extremist networks, such as the Al-Shabaab.

Gemma: And where am I speaking to you from today?

Fathima: From Kenya, I’m based in Mombasa.

Gemma: Can you explain to our listeners who are Al-Shabaab and what is their kind of goal and what do they want as an organisation?

Fathima: Al-Shabaab are a transnational terrorist network. The origin is in Somalia, it’s mainly a Somali-based militant, I could say insurgency group. And it spreads its influence in most of the east African regions and even beyond. So ideology is mainly to have a caliphate in the east African region. The primary areas of operation are Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Tanzania, Uganda, even today to a level like Mozambique.

Gemma: We’re talking in March 2021 and Al-Shabaab has been in existence since the early 2000s. How much territory does it have? And what’s the kind of balance of power between it and the Somali government?

Fathima: They have their bases. Today, too, we have particular, we call it a sort of a transition government, but still Al-Shabaab becomes very strong in the southern areas, mainly because of its tax bases, their control.

Gemma: OK, so they’re more powerful along the southern part of Somalia, which is actually bordering Kenya. Your research has focused on coastal Kenya and kind of the northern bit of Kenya will work going down towards Mombasa, which is in the south of the country. Can you explain to me what kind of the dynamics are this area that you research?

Fathima: So, my study is based on the coastal region of Kenya. This includes areas like Lamu, Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi. Kenya becomes a conducive ground for recruitment from this transnational extremist movement due to the prevailing pockets of marginalised communities and also deprived situations. The broken state-citizen relationships, youth unemployment and also some underdeveloped areas. But today the trends are changing from what it was before. So it’s not only the coast, but we also have other areas which are vulnerable for radicalisation and recruitment.

Gemma: And your focus has been predominantly on women being recruited into the Al-Shabaab. Can you explain why is Al-Shabaab trying to recruit women?

Fathima: So like many other terrorist organisations or insurgency networks, Al-Shabaab also uses women, and girls. This is not something very new, but the main reason why Al-Shabaab had this trend emanating is because of women’s important roles and the need for their role in tactical operations. Like for example, when the surveillance increased on men, actually, the trend was to have women now to carry out these activities so that they can bypass these surveillance. Women are more often looked from a passive view of not being violent. So when they carry out activities, it’s a shocking thing.

And also women and girls can perform many activities in their traditional roles, and at the same time, as in the combatant roles, like in the camps, they can be cleaning, cooking, they can be combatants also. They can also be sent to Kenya to gather information or to find certain things. They play a very important role in logistics support, like hiding members in their houses or weapons. They also become important in fundraising efforts, to recruit other women and men mainly because of their social interaction skills and their are pivotal positioning in families and the community. So women play a very important role in those countries.

Gemma: Could you explain a bit about how you go about this research?

Fathima: It was really important for me to understand the person from their own cultural context. So I started with the observing terror suspect trials. And I used to go and talk to the parents, then ask for permission. Some would give, some won’t give you. Once you get a start-up interview, you don’t directly ask questions, you just build a trust until the person itself feels like they are ready to talk to you. And I had to stay long periods of time in these communities, so that I understand their perspective better.

Gemma: So you’ve built up this group of around 36 women that you’ve interviewed and you’ve written a number of academic papers about them. But your most recent paper has focused on women who joined Al-Shabaab voluntarily. Can you explain what is the difference between a voluntary and involuntary reason for joining?

Fathima: When you look into voluntary recruitment, I look into it as women who join out of their sheer will. So this can be based because they like the Al-Shabaab ideology. Or sometimes we have even women who go because of group belongingness that you feel, like it is a Muslim group. You have to be part of it, or you have joined with a friend. So those are mainly the voluntary aspect. Then you have the involuntary recruitment. That is when women and girls are forced to join these networks. Or those who join the groups are joining because of particular receptive, or elimination strategies used by the Al-Shabaab network.

Gemma: You had these 36 women, and then you picked up 16 of them who you can categorise as women who’d voluntarily joined the group. Can you explain what the main factors were for those women?

Fathima: When I made the selection of these 16, those are the women who I’m mainly inclined on building a caliphate. They were the ones who were completely, resonating with the ideology of the Al-Shabaab. They are very minority, but they play a very important role because they have prominent positions in the network because of their ideological resonance.

Then you have another group that might join because of particular anger involved, like maybe they want to get revenge from the state. So because you are not strong as an individual, now you feel like joining the Al-Shabaab as a revenge motive. Then you have the third one, which I consider as the majority.

So the third one is mainly in line with the circumstances based on their daily interactions with the family or the peers. Now, these relationships are very important because as woman growing up in a patriarchal setting, maybe in particular dependency relationships, like you’re dependent on your husband or a male relative, or it can be the aspect of she’s really in love with him so she doesn’t want to lose him or maybe because she’s scared. She may not have a man. And you know, it also comes back to the economics, with children. So sometimes, you make your decision based on these dependency relationships. It seems like you’re volunteering, but it has been shaped because of your family, your circumstances or you want to be your obedient wife. So that is mainly the majority.

And then you have the fourth one, which is mainly focused on the camp. That is your voluntariness was based on the time you spent in the camp, the ideological trainings you underwent in the camp. Maybe you join involuntarily, but because of the ideological training that has been constantly given to you in the camp, now you have the voluntariness based on trainings you undergo.

Gemma: And I wonder what significance your findings have for Kenya in particular, the counter-terrorism strategies and policies that the government is trying to put in place.

Fathima: I would say the study would be more significant in preventing and countering violent extremism. Because the study tries to understand and place the role of women in radicalisation and recruitment. First, we should acknowledge there is problem. Second, and you look into the topic of women in deradicalisation, or disengaging or re-integration, it’s important to have this gendered angle, because what fits men may not fit women. Then what measures can we take when you’re trying to prevent women from getting into these networks, whether it is voluntary or involuntary.

Then also when it comes to voluntary, mainly with ideology, how can we respond to this ideological tenants that facilitate a voluntary recruitment? Like for example, misinterpreted Quranic verses. So those are some of the discussions we need with these young women, girls so that they understand before they make a decision. So it comes back into this life skills, critical thinking, decision-making type of interventions that are needed.

Gemma: Just finally, what are you working on next? Are you still interviewing these women or are you moving to, to look at other issues with Al-Shabaab?

Fathima: I’m still working with these women, mainly in line with the reintegration processes. But I’m also working on, the topic of boys. That is the topic of masculinities, radicalisation and recruitment with boys and men to whether recruitment pathways are changing and whether trends are different for men and women.

Gemma: OK. Well, we’ll look forward to reading about that in the future. Thank you very much, Fatima. It’s been fascinating talking to you.

Fathima: Thank you too for having me.

Gemma: You can read an article by Fatima with more details about her research by clicking the link in the show notes.

Wale: And now to end the show, we’ve got a message from Bryan Keogh, business editor at The Conversation in the US.

Bryan: Hi, I’m Brian Keogh, a senior economy and business editor for The Conversation based in New York. My first recommendation is on the controversial topic of vaccine mandates. A lot of companies have considered requiring their workers to get vaccinated as they try to get everyone back to the office.

This has prompted some US states try to prevent this. Liz Tippett, an employment law expert at the University of Oregon has an interesting take on this debate. Employers don’t need to worry about mandating vaccines because they already have plenty of other tools to compel compliance from their employees. As Liz explains, companies have gotten so good at manipulating our behaviours through various types of nudges, that your boss probably won’t even need a mandate to get you to take a shot.

My second recommendation comes from Clare Mehta, a psychologist at Emmanuel College. A recent survey asked if you could be one age for the rest of your life, what would it be? The surprising answer was 36 and disappointing for me since it suggests I’m already past my prime. It wasn’t to Clare, however, who has been studying the experiences of people in the thirties and early forties. It’s an interesting time in a person’s life. So much tends to be happening from buying a home for the first time to getting married, having children to beginning to really own one’s career. Her research found that though these big changes and challenges brought a lot of stress, they also brought a lot of joy, too. People also said they were feeling more self-confident and generally happier. Unfortunately, Clare didn’t learn when everything goes downhill. That’s all for me. Thanks and happy reading.

Gemma: Brian Keogh in New York there. That’s it for this week. Thanks to all the academics who’ve spoken to us for this episode.

46,46,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,A non-immunological role for γ-interferon–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) in osteoclastic bone resorption - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabd3684,"The extracellular bone resorbing lacuna of the osteoclast shares many characteristics with the degradative lysosome of antigen-presenting cells. γ-Interferon–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) enhances antigen processing within lysosomes through direct reduction of antigen disulfides and maintenance of cysteine protease activity. In this study, we found the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL drove expression of GILT in osteoclast precursors in a STAT1-dependent manner, resulting in high levels of GILT in mature osteoclasts, which could be further augmented by γ-interferon. GILT colocalized with the collagen-degrading cysteine protease, cathepsin K, suggesting a role for GILT inside the osteoclastic resorption lacuna. GILT-deficient osteoclasts had reduced bone-resorbing capacity, resulting in impaired bone turnover and an osteopetrotic phenotype in GILT-deficient mice. We demonstrated that GILT could directly reduce the noncollagenous bone matrix protein SPARC, and additionally, enhance collagen degradation by cathepsin K. Together, this work describes a previously unidentified, non-immunological role for GILT in osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.

In contrast to cytosolic thioreductases such as thioredoxin, GILT has an acidic pH optimum for activity ( 19 ). The acidified, lysosomal content–rich resorption lacuna of the osteoclast thus offers an ideal microenvironment for GILT activity; however, expression and corresponding function of GILT within osteoclasts were previously uncharacterized. Herein, a key role for GILT in the maintenance of the bone resorptive capacity of osteoclasts is described. We found that the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL is a strong inducer of GILT expression, and genetic deletion of GILT significantly impaired bone resorption efficiency in vivo and in vitro. Additional evidence suggests that GILT contributes to bone resorption within the resorption lacuna via direct reduction of noncollagenous bone protein and the maintenance of proteolysis by the cysteine protease cathepsin K. Collectively, this report identifies a previously unknown non-immunological role for GILT in osteoclastic bone resorption.

γ-Interferon–inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) remains the sole reductase described within vesicles of the endolysosomal system of mammalian cells ( 19 , 20 ). Predominantly studied in the context of antigen presentation, GILT directly catalyzes the reduction of disulfide bonds, which has been shown to be a requirement for the processing of a variety of self-, infectious, and neoplastic protein antigens containing inter- or intramolecular disulfides ( 21 – 25 ). More recently, it has been found that GILT is also required for optimal activity of the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin S, in alternatively activated macrophages—presumably, through maintaining the active-site cysteine in its thiol state within the acidic environment of the lysosome ( 18 , 26 ). Despite evidence that the evolution of GILT preceded that of the adaptive immune system, functions for GILT beyond its well-defined role in antigen processing remain mostly unexplored ( 27 – 30 ).

Unique among tissue-resident macrophage populations, osteoclasts are giant multinucleated cells formed via the fusion of embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell precursors of erythromyeloid and myeloid lineages ( 3 – 6 ). The survival/proliferation and differentiation of osteoclasts are driven by the cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; also known as CSF-1) and receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11), respectively ( 7 , 8 ). Once mature, osteoclast α V β 3 integrins adhere to organic bone matrix to form a tight sealing zone against the surface of the bone, resulting in an isolated extracellular compartment termed the resorption lacuna. Vacuolar (V-)ATPase proton pumps at the ruffled border of the lacuna serve to acidify the compartment, and polarized lysosomal secretion deposits numerous lysosomal proteins within the resorption lacuna including acid phosphatases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and lysosomal cysteine cathepsins ( 9 – 13 ). The end result is an acidic, highly degradative compartment optimized for the resorption of the inorganic and organic components of bone. Cathepsin K is the major protease within the resorption lacunae of osteoclasts and is principally charged with the degradation of collagen ( 12 , 14 ). In humans, an autosomal recessive deficiency in cathepsin K results in pycnodysostosis, a severe osteopetrotic phenotype further modeled in mice following genetic deletion of cathepsin K ( 15 – 17 ). Similar to other lysosomal cysteine protease members, cathepsin K has an acidic optimum, and the active site cysteine must remain in a reduced thiol state for protease activity ( 18 ).

The dynamic nature of bone is necessary for normal growth, repair, and calcium homeostasis and requires a fine balance of bone synthesis and bone resorption. While the mesenchymal stem cell–derived osteoblasts synthesize new bone, the myeloid-derived osteoclasts are ultimately responsible for the resorption of bone ( 1 ). Dysregulation of bone turnover can lead to a net loss or net gain of bone density, resulting in osteoporosis or osteopetrosis, respectively. While the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is multifactorial, osteoclast dysfunction is principally blamed for the development of osteopetrosis ( 2 ).

( A and C ) Representative real-time kinetic measurement of the hydrolysis of a cathepsin K (CatK)–specific substrate (Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp, A) or the collagenase substrate DQ collagen (C) by recombinant human CatK with or without bioactive GILT in a reconstituted system. RFU, relative fluorescent units. ( B and D ) Averaged rates of Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp hydrolysis (B, n = 5 independent experiments) or DQ collagen hydrolysis (D, n = 4 independent experiments) relative to heat-inactivated (HI) GILT controls. Relative rates were calculated between 60 and 120 min (B) or between 0 and 30 min (D). (A to D) Reactions were performed in assay buffer (pH 5) with 50 mM sodium acetate and 500 μM cysteine. A GILT:CatK ratio of 5:1 (175:35 ng, A and B) or 2:1 (400:200 ng, C and D) was used for each experiment. Where indicated, heat inactivation of GILT was performed at 95°C for 10 min before addition. Error bars are presented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s post hoc test.

Similar to SPARC, we found the number of free thiols in recombinant cathepsin K was increased following incubation with active GILT (fig. S6). As with other cysteine cathepsins, the active-site cysteine of cathepsin K must be in a reduced thiol state for proteolytic function, leaving the enzyme susceptible to oxidative inactivation, particularly in acidic environments. We thus measured hydrolysis of a cathepsin K–specific peptide substrate (Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp) by human cathepsin K in a reconstituted system with or without active human GILT, hypothesizing that the reductase function of GILT would help maintain the proteolytic capacity of cathepsin K. In agreement with our previous work with cathepsin S ( 26 ), rates of hydrolysis of the Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp substrate by cathepsin K were increased in systems with active GILT compared with heat-inactivated GILT ( Fig. 5, A and B ). Similarly, cathepsin K–mediated hydrolysis of type I collagen labeled with a self-quenched fluorophore (DQ collagen) was significantly more efficient in the presence of active GILT ( Fig. 5, C and D ). In the absence of cathepsin K, GILT displayed no direct effects on either fluorogenic substrate. Together, these data show that GILT can maintain the proteolytic function of the collagenase cathepsin K, and provide an additional mechanism by which GILT promotes bone resorption in osteoclasts.

Conceivably, disulfide-containing proteins within the organic bone matrix would be susceptible to direct reduction by GILT in the resorption lacuna. Because type I collagen, the main organic constituent of bone tissue, contains no disulfides in its mature fiber structure, we explored the potential for GILT to reduce secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC; also known as osteonectin). SPARC is one of the most abundant noncollagenous proteins in bone and contains seven intramolecular disulfide bonds within its 43-kDa structure that are essential for its role as a structural bone matrix protein ( 37 ). Principally, SPARC is thought to aid and nucleate bone mineralization with both collagen and hydroxyapatite (HA) crystal binding domains, and its deficiency leads to overt osteopenia in mice ( 38 , 39 ). To determine whether GILT could directly reduce disulfides in SPARC, active recombinant human GILT was incubated with native human SPARC in a reconstituted system at 37°C, pH 5, with 100 μM cysteine. Following labeling of liberated thiols with biotinylated iodoacetamide and detection by Western blot under nonreducing conditions ( Fig. 4A ), it was found that incubation with GILT increased the amount of free thiols in SPARC as evidenced by enhanced SPARC biotinylation ( Fig. 4B ). Reduction by GILT also affected the native structure of SPARC, as reduced SPARC displayed a gel shift as previously described ( Fig. 4B ) ( 40 ). Thus, SPARC, a major structural protein within the organic bone matrix, is susceptible to GILT-mediated reduction and subsequent denaturation.

( A ) Representative images of TRAP-stained WT and GILT −/− osteoclasts. ( B ) Enumeration of osteoclastogenesis following RANKL treatment of WT and GILT −/− cells (n = 5 to 6 biological replicates). Osteoclasts were defined as TRAP + (purple) multinucleated cells (MNCs; ≥3 nuclei). (A and B) Cells were differentiated using M-CSF (15 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 6 days on plastic dishes before TRAP staining. ( C and D ) Representative images (C) and quantification (D) of resorption pits on bovine bone slices (n = 15 biological replicates). WT and GILT −/− osteoclasts from age- and sex-matched mice were differentiated on top of individual bone slices for 12 days, and resulting resorption pits were stained with toluidine blue for quantification. ( E ) Representative scanning electron microscopy images of resorption pits on bovine bone slices generated by WT (left) or GILT −/− (right) osteoclasts over 12 days. ( F ) Concentrations of the collagen breakdown product CTX-I released from bone slices following 12 days of resorption as measured by ELISA (n = 15). (A to F) Scale bars, 500 μm (E, white), 200 μm (A and C, black), or 50 μm (A, blue). Each n represents osteoclasts isolated from a single animal. Error bars are presented as means ± SEM. *P < 0.05 by unpaired Student’s t test (B and F) or Mann-Whitney U test (D).

To assess a potential influence of GILT in the derivation of osteoclasts, the efficiencies of WT and GILT −/− murine monocytic precursors to differentiate into mature osteoclasts in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL were evaluated. After 6 days in culture, WT and GILT −/− samples produced comparable numbers of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)–positive multinucleated osteoclasts, demonstrating that the absence of GILT did not affect the differentiation of osteoclasts in vitro ( Fig. 3, A and B ), corroborating our findings in vivo ( Fig. 2H ). To determine the efficiency of bone resorption by WT and GILT −/− osteoclasts, monocytic precursors were differentiated into mature osteoclasts on bovine bone slices for 12 days, and resulting areas of resorption were stained with toluidine blue and quantified. GILT-deficient osteoclasts were significantly less efficient in their ability to resorb bone compared with WT osteoclasts ( Fig. 3, C and D ). Impaired bone resorption by GILT −/− osteoclasts was further demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy ( Fig. 3E ) and reduced concentrations of the cathepsin K–dependent bone resorption by-product CTX-I (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) in the supernatants of bone slices resorbed by GILT −/− osteoclasts ( Fig. 3F ). In contrast to CTX-I, release of the MMP-dependent collagenolytic by-product ICTP (cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen) was equal between WT and GILT −/− osteoclasts (fig. S3) ( 36 ). The presence of GILT had no discernable influence on the expression and processing patterns of cathepsin K in mature osteoclasts (fig. S4, A to D), nor on the production of reactive oxygen species (fig. S5). Together, these results suggest that GILT deficiency does not affect osteoclastogenesis but confers a defect in osteoclastic bone resorption.

On the basis of the reported function of GILT in lysosomes of APCs, we hypothesized that GILT may function to maintain the proteolytic capacity of osteoclasts and, accordingly, play a role in bone resorption. To assess the influence of GILT activity on bone turnover in vivo, we quantified bone parameters of tibiae of 20-week-old female wild-type (WT) and GILT-deficient mice by microcomputed tomography (μCT). Tibiae from GILT −/− animals exhibited significant increases in both cortical and trabecular bone mineral density (10 and 29%, respectively), as well as trabecular bone volume ratio (35%) compared with WT controls ( Fig. 2, A to D ). A discernable, albeit insignificant increase in trabecular connective density (34%) was also observed (P = 0.091) ( Fig. 2E ). Histological analysis likewise revealed increased trabecular bone within the tibiae of 20-week-old female GILT −/− mice compared with WT, despite equal numbers of mature osteoclasts ( Fig. 2, F to H ). In addition, serum concentrations of the collagen breakdown product CTX-I, but not the bone formation biomarker PINP (N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen), were significantly decreased in GILT −/− mice, suggesting impaired bone resorption, but not bone formation, in these animals ( Fig. 2, I and J ). To determine whether these changes modified the biomechanical properties of the bone, tibiae from WT and GILT −/− mice were compared by three-point flexural testing ( Fig. 2K ). Both the ultimate stress to fracture and elastic modulus of GILT −/− tibiae were significantly higher than those of WT samples, suggesting increased bone strength and stiffness ( Fig. 2, L and M ). Notably, related models of osteopetrosis in adult mice with cathepsin K or V-ATPase deficiencies demonstrate similar increases in bone strength ( 34 , 35 ). Overall, these data are consistent with an appreciable osteopetrotic phenotype in GILT-deficient mice and point to a nonredundant role for GILT in bone resorption.

IFN-γ–driven expression of GILT is dependent on signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling ( 32 ). Because RANKL results in phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine-727 (S727) during osteoclast differentiation ( 33 ), we evaluated whether STAT1 is required to induce GILT expression in response to RANKL. RANKL treatment of M-CSF–derived monocytic precursors led to phosphorylation of STAT1 at S727, but not tyrosine-701 (Y701), whereas IFN-γ led to robust phosphorylation of STAT1 at both S727 and Y701, as previously reported ( Fig. 1D ). Consistent with the involvement of STAT1, the ability of RANKL to drive GILT expression in monocytic precursors from STAT1-deficient mice was significantly compromised ( Fig. 1E ). Collectively, these findings identify the osteoclastogenic cytokine RANKL as a potent activator of GILT expression mediated through a STAT1-dependent pathway. The high levels of GILT in mature osteoclasts, and its colocalization with cathepsin K, led us to investigate a potential functional role for the reductase in bone resorption.

(A to C) Cells were differentiated for 6 days with M-CSF (15 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml), or M-CSF (15 ng/ml) only, throughout the entirety of each experiment. (D and E) Precursor cells were expanded in M-CSF (15 ng/ml) for 48 hours before described treatments.

To evaluate expression of GILT in osteoclasts, M-CSF and RANKL, or M-CSF alone, were used to drive differentiation of murine bone marrow–derived monocytic precursors to osteoclasts and bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMMØs), respectively. At both the transcript and protein levels, GILT expression was significantly increased in RANKL-treated osteoclasts compared with BMMØs ( Fig. 1, A and B ). By immunofluorescence, GILT was found to be highly expressed in multinucleated as well as individual mononuclear cells stimulated with M-CSF and RANKL ( Fig. 1C and fig. S1). In large multinucleated osteoclasts, GILT was found to colocalize with the lysosomal cysteine protease, cathepsin K (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.703 ± 0.07) ( Fig. 1C and fig. S1). Similar to its expression in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) ( 19 , 31 , 32 ), RANKL-driven expression of GILT could be further augmented in mature osteoclast populations with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (fig. S2, A and B).

Seminal discoveries by others have identified key, nonredundant roles for GILT in adaptive immunity, and as such, GILT has been primarily considered an enzyme of the immune system ( 18 , 21 – 24 , 60 , 61 ). The existence of GILT homologs in a variety of primitive species that lack adaptive immune systems, however, suggests that GILT-like thiol oxidoreductases evolved to perform critical roles outside of antigen processing ( 27 , 28 , 30 ). This study identifies such a role for GILT in the homeostasis of bone. Given the widespread physiological necessity to reduce disulfides and maintain cysteine protease activities in acidic environments, we anticipate that GILT will continue to emerge as a critical enzyme for many biological processes spanning many species.

In this study, we found that IFN-γ could further enhance GILT expression in mature murine osteoclasts (fig. S2). Long-term therapy with recombinant IFN-γ greatly improves bone resorption in human patients with severe malignant osteopetrosis ( 53 , 54 ). Similarly, IFN-γ therapy is effective in increasing bone resorption in several mouse models of osteopetrosis ( 55 , 56 ). The impact of IFN-γ on osteoclast biology is complicated—in vitro, IFN-γ is widely considered a strong suppresser of osteoclastogenesis ( 57 , 58 ); however, contradictory findings have been reported depending on the IFN-γ concentration, degree of osteoclast differentiation, and presence of costimulating cytokines ( 59 ). Stimulated superoxide production by osteoclast precursors ( 54 ) and activation of T cells to release osteoclastogenic RANKL and TNF-α ( 57 ) are proposed mechanisms for enhanced bone resorption in response to IFN-γ in humans and mice, respectively; however, augmentation of GILT expression in osteoclasts presents a plausible parallel mechanism. Further investigation into the role of GILT during IFN-γ therapy, and bone remodeling in general, is warranted and may support the use of GILT-related therapeutic strategies for bone disease.

In addition to reductive maintenance of cathepsin K, we demonstrate that disulfides within the structural bone matrix protein SPARC are susceptible to GILT-mediated reduction ( Fig. 4 ). The presence of numerous disulfide bonds within SPARC is unique among bone matrix glycoproteins ( 49 ). While the GILT-mediated reduction and degradation of SPARC in vivo were not directly demonstrated and are a limitation of this study, the denaturation of the SPARC tertiary structure by GILT would theoretically destabilize the overall organization of the bone matrix, leaving SPARC increasingly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Similar to collagen, SPARC is directly degraded by cathepsin K ( 12 , 50 ); thus, GILT-mediated reduction of SPARC and activation of cathepsin K may work synergistically to enhance SPARC turnover during bone resorption. Although we focused on SPARC, akin to its demonstrated promiscuity in antigen processing ( 51 ), GILT is likely to reduce other disulfide-containing, noncollagenous proteins within the resorption lacuna such as the proteoglycan biglycan ( 52 ), which may influence the physiological and biomechanical properties of bone in GILT-deficient animals. The potentially vast GILT interactome within the osteoclast lacuna could explain the distinct phenotype of adult GILT −/− bones, whereby the increase in bone mineral density is associated with increased bone strength and stiffness, contrasting the brittle bone osteopetrosis seen in human pycnodysostosis ( 15 ). Nonetheless, related models of osteopetrosis in adult mice with deficiencies in cathepsin K or V-ATPase have demonstrated similar increases in bone strength ( 34 , 35 ).

Degradation of type I collagen by cathepsin K is a fundamental determinant of bone resorption efficiency ( 12 , 14 – 17 , 46 ) and suggests the maintenance of cathepsin K activity by GILT ( Fig. 5 ) is at least partially responsible for the impaired bone resorption associated with GILT deficiency in this study. Generation of cathepsin K–dependent, but not MMP-dependent, type I collagen degradation products from bone was found to be impaired in the absence of GILT ( Fig. 3F and fig. S3), further emphasizing the role GILT plays in specifically supporting the activities of redox-sensitive cysteine proteases in acidified environments ( 36 ). While we focused our attention on cathepsin K, the impact of GILT on other cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin S, and other redox-sensitive enzymes within the resorption lacunae of osteoclasts should also be considered. In addition, for GILT to function as a thioreductase, it requires the availability of reductive energy, usually in the form of free cysteine ( 18 , 26 , 47 ). Whereas the source and forms of reductive equivalents in the osteoclast lacuna have yet to be explored, early studies in the macrophage phagolysosome suggest both exogenous (e.g., extracellular cysteine) and endogenous (e.g., NADPH, selenocysteine-containing reductases) pathways contribute to the reductive capacity of this acidified compartment ( 48 ). We could predict that reduced cysteine liberated through the degradation of organic bone would provide a source of reducing equivalents within osteoclast lacunae, although similar to the phagolysosome of the macrophage, cytosolic pathways may also contribute.

The initial rational for this study was based on the prediction that GILT would be expressed in osteoclasts because GILT is constitutively expressed in other monocyte-derived cells such as macrophages ( 19 , 31 ). Osteoclasts were found not only to express GILT but also to express significantly higher levels of GILT than resting bone marrow macrophages, in line with publicly available microarray datasets ( 41 ). At both transcriptional and translational levels, cytokine stimulation of monocytic precursors with M-CSF and RANKL significantly increased GILT expression compared with M-CSF alone ( Fig. 1 ). RANKL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, initiates a tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 6 (TRAF6)–mediated signaling cascade via stimulation of the RANK receptor on the developing osteoclast’s surface. Among others, TRAF6 activates the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p38, resulting in p38-dependent phosphorylation of S727 within the transactivating domain of the transcription factor STAT1 ( 33 , 42 ). Of note, IFN-γ–mediated induction of GILT expression is dependent on STAT1 activation, and multiple STAT1-recognition sites are found within the human GILT promoter ( 32 ). Because S727 phosphorylation by secondary signals [e.g., lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α)] greatly enhances STAT1-dependent signaling during an IFN-γ response ( 43 – 45 ), RANKL-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 S727 likely underpins, at least in part, the strong induction of GILT during osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, genetic deletion of STAT1 significantly reduced the capacity of RANKL to drive GILT expression within osteoclast precursors ( Fig. 1E ). Further supporting this conclusion is the induction of another IFN-γ–inducible protein, MIG (monokine induced by IFN-γ), in osteoclasts by a RANKL/p38/STAT1-S727–dependent, IFN-γ–independent mechanism ( 33 ).

Increased expression of the lysosomal enzyme GILT in response to RANKL and IFN-γ facilitates accumulation of GILT within the resorption lacuna of the osteoclast. Bone matrix proteins (e.g., SPARC) containing disulfide bonds are consequently susceptible to GILT-mediated reduction and, conceivably, increased proteolytic digestion (mechanism 1, left). In addition, maintenance of cathepsin K (CatK) collagenase activity by GILT promotes increased breakdown of organic bone, improving the overall efficiency of osteoclastic bone resorption (mechanism 2, right).

The collective findings of this study demonstrate a nonredundant role for the lysosomal thioreductase GILT in the maintenance of optimal bone resorption by osteoclasts. We propose that GILT is highly expressed in osteoclasts in response to RANKL and acts in the resorption lacuna to enhance bone degradation via two synergistic mechanisms: direct reduction of noncollagenous structural proteins such as SPARC, and through maintenance of the collagenase cathepsin K in its reduced, active state ( Fig. 6 ).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mice C57BL/6 (WT) and B6.129S(Cg)-Stat1tm1Dlv/J (STAT1−/−) mice were purchased from the Jackson laboratory (62). Congenic C57BL/6 GILT−/− (GILT−/−) mice were provided by P. Cresswell (Yale University School of Medicine) (23). All animals received identical husbandry within the Clara Christie Centre for Mouse Genomics (University of Calgary). Mouse experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the University of Calgary Animal Use and Care Committee and designed in accordance with the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Age- and sex-matched participants were used within each experiment. For in vivo μCT, 20-week-old female mice were euthanized and frozen at −20°C before analysis.

Osteoclast culture Bone marrow cells were flushed from the tibia, femur, and ilium of 6- to 8-week-old WT or GILT−/− mice. Following red blood cell lysis (4 min, 155 mM NH 4 Cl, 12 mM NaHCO 3 , and 0.1 mM EDTA) and filtration (70 μm), cells were cultured in T-25 flasks overnight in basal media [10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin (100 U/ml), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate in DMEM] with recombinant M-CSF (15 ng/ml). Resulting nonadherent precursor cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells per well (96-well plate with or without bone slices; Fig. 3 and fig. S3), 2 × 105 cells per well (24-well plate; Fig. 1C), or 1 × 106 cells per well (6-well plate; Fig. 1, A and B, and figs. S2 and S4) with M-CSF (15 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Subsequently, fresh osteoclast media [M-CSF (15 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml)] or control media [M-CSF (15 ng/ml) only] was added. Both macrophages and osteoclasts received stimulation with M-CSF (15 ng/ml) through the entirety of each experiment. Cells were differentiated for 6 [quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot, immunofluorescence, and TRAP staining] or 12 (bone slice experiments) additional days, with half-media changes performed every 2 days. For 12-day bone slice experiments, only quarter-media changes were performed on days 8 and 10 to help maintain supernatant CTX-I and ICTP concentrations. To assess the effect of IFN-γ on osteoclastic GILT expression, fully differentiated osteoclasts at day 6 were treated with IFN-γ (500 U/ml) for 24 hours before total RNA or protein isolation. Osteoclastogenesis was confirmed by TRAP staining using the Acid Phosphatase, Leukocyte kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were imaged with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope using an Olympus DP72 digital color camera. For the purpose of enumeration, osteoclasts were defined as TRAP+, multinucleated cells (≥3 nuclei), and two randomized 4× fields of view were counted and averaged for cells from each biological replicate.

STAT1 signaling WT or STAT1−/− nonadherent precursor cells (isolated as described above) were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well (12-well plate; Fig. 1, D and E) with M-CSF (15 ng/ml) for 48 hours to produce homogeneous monocytic populations. To evaluate STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D), WT cells were first cultured in low-serum media (0.1% fetal bovine serum) overnight, and then either left untreated, treated with RANKL (200 ng/ml) (15 min), or treated with IFN-γ (100 U/ml) (15 min) immediately before lysis and Western blot analysis. Alternatively, WT or STAT1−/− cells were stimulated with M-CSF (15 ng/ml) or M-CSF and RANKL (15 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml, respectively) for an additional 48 hours followed by Western blot analysis to evaluate the involvement of STAT1 during early induction of GILT expression (Fig. 1E).

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantified by NanoDrop analysis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). qScript cDNA Supermix (Quanta BioSciences) was used for cDNA synthesis, and iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used for qPCR amplification. Reactions were run on an iQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 95°C for 3 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 30 s and 58°C for 30 s. All primers were designed using Primer3 as follows: GILT (gene name: IFI30, forward: 5′-CTGTTCCCACTCGAGGTTCC-3′, reverse: 5′-CCATCACCATCAGCCAGGTT-3′); cathepsin K (gene name: CTSK, forward: 5′-CTTTGGAAGGGAGTGGGCAT-3′, reverse: 5′-ACCAGCACAGAGTCCACAAC-3′); TRAP (gene name: ACP5, forward: 5′-AAAATGCCTCGAGACCTGGG-3′, reverse: 5′-GTAGGCAGTGACCCCGTATG-3′); 18S (forward: 5′-CGCGGTTCTATTTTGTTGGT-3′, reverse: 5′-AGTCGGCATCGTTTATGGTC-3′). All products displayed a single melt curve, and each gene was normalized to 18S ribosomal RNA as an internal control. Biological replicates were tested under each experimental condition and made relative, and the results were paired for statistical analysis.

Western blot Cells were lysed on ice for 10 min with ice-cold lysis buffer [1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM tris (pH 8)]. For STAT1 phosphorylation blots (Fig. 1D), cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and 25 mM tris (pH 7.5)] containing 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitor (Cell Signaling Technologies). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Samples were prepared in SDS sample buffer, with (reducing; Fig. 1 and figs. S2 and S4) or without (nonreducing; Fig. 4 and fig. S6) β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min before loading. Total GILT expression was measured using a mouse α-mouse GILT primary antibody (clone MaP.mGILT6, Hycult Biotech) (63) followed by a horse α-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)–horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody (#7076, Cell Signaling Technology). Cell lysates were run on Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free protein gels (Bio-Rad), and expression of mature GILT was normalized to total protein levels using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). Rabbit α-mouse P-S727 STAT1 (#9177), P-Y701 STAT1 (#9167), and total STAT1 (#9172) antibodies (all Cell Signaling Technologies) were used to evaluate STAT1 signaling and were probed using a goat α-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody (#7074, Cell Signaling Technology). Following P-S727 and P-Y701 detection, blots were stripped and probed for total STAT1, and P-S727 and P-Y701 levels were normalized to total STAT1 protein levels. Cathepsin K expression was measured using a rabbit α-cathepsin K primary antibody (ab19027, Abcam) followed by a goat α-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody. Cathepsin K expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (using rabbit α-GAPDH primary antibody #2118, Cell Signaling Technologies). Biotinylated SPARC and biotinylated cathepsin K were probed using Precision Protein Strep-Tactin HRP Conjugate (Bio-Rad). Equal SPARC loading was confirmed using goat α-human SPARC (AF941, R&D Systems) followed by a donkey α-goat IgG-HRP secondary antibody (sc-2020, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Equal cathepsin K loading was confirmed using rabbit α-cathepsin K (ab19027, Abcam) followed by a goat α-rabbit IgG-HRP secondary antibody.

Immunofluorescence Cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and coverslips were blocked with 5% goat serum/1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, including mouse α-mouse GILT (clone MaP.mGILT6, Hycult Biotech) (63) and rabbit α-mouse cathepsin K (ab19027, Abcam). Following PBS washes, secondary antibodies [Alexa Fluor 488 goat α-mouse IgG (A11029) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat α-rabbit IgG (A11037), Thermo Fisher Scientific] and Phalloidin-iFluor 647 (ab176759, Abcam) were added to each coverslip for 1 hour at room temperature. Last, nuclei were stained with Bisbenzimide H 33258 (VWR) (1 μg/ml) for 10 min in the dark, and coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using Dako Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Agilent). Cells were imaged on an Olympus IX71 inverted epifluorescence microscope using a Retiga 2000R CCD digital camera (QImaging). Specificity of the α-GILT antibody was confirmed using cells from GILT−/− mice, and no-primary controls were performed to assess nonspecific binding of secondary antibodies. Colocalization of GILT and cathepsin K signals was assessed using the JACoP colocalization plugin for ImageJ (64) to calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient, a measure of linear association, across entire BMMØ or osteoclast images. Costes’ automatic threshold method was used to minimize background fluorescence.

Microcomputed tomography Frozen euthanized mice were thawed overnight at 4°C and then brought to room temperature. The proximal 6.36 mm of the right limb of each mouse was scanned using a vivaCT 40 scanner (Scanco Medical) under the following conditions as previously described (65): isotropic resolution, 15 μm; tube voltage, 45 kVp; tube current, 133 μA; and integration time, 200 ms. Scans consisted of 1000 projections over 180° and were reconstructed on a 2048 × 2048 matrix. Calibration of the scanner was performed using HA phantoms. Subsequent to the scans, Image Processing Language (IPL V5.08b, Scanco Medical) was used to extract the trabecular and cortical regions of the tibiae via segmentation. The mean gray scale values of voxels in both the trabecular and cortical regions were converted to mg of HA/cm3 and reported individually as trabecular and cortical bone mineral density. Trabecular bone volume ratio (BV/TV) and trabecular connectivity density (Conn.D) were calculated after segmentation.

Three-point flexural test After μCT scanning, the mice were dissected, and their tibiae harvested. The samples were wrapped in gauze dipped in PBS and frozen at −20°C until further use. The day of the biomechanical tests, samples were thawed to room temperature, and both left and right tibiae underwent three-point bending analysis using an ElectroForce 3200 test instrument (Bose Corporation) as previously described (66). Briefly, the lateral surface of the tibia was placed on the bending jig with lower supports located 8.69 mm apart at the tibial crest and the tibia-fibula junction. Tibiae were stabilized by applying a 1-newton preload to the midpoint between the two lower supports. Subsequently, load was applied and measured using a 450-newton load cell at a displacement rate of 0.033 mm/s. Force was applied to the bone until fracture, and force values in newtons were normalized to the geometry of the bone to calculate flexural stress (σ = 3PL/2bd2, where P is the applied load in newtons, L is the span length of 8.69 mm, b is the tibia width, and d is the tibia depth). Strength of each bone was quantified as the ultimate stress reached before fracture. Elastic modulus, a measure of resistance to elastic deformation under stress, was calculated by plotting stress (σ) versus strain (ε = 6Dd/L2, where D is the displacement in millimeters, d is the tibia depth, and L is the span length) and calculating the maximal slope of the linear region with an R2 ≥ 0.995.

Bone histomorphometry Tibiae were isolated from 20-week-old WT and GILT−/− mice and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature. Bones were washed in PBS, and then decalcified for 1 week in ddH 2 O with 10% EDTA at room temperature. Bones were sectioned in series longitudinally at 3 μm in paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Prairie Diagnostic Services). Sections were imaged with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (4× fields of view) using an Olympus DP72 digital color camera and subsequently analyzed for trabecular bone area and osteoclast numbers using cellSens image analysis software (Olympus). Histopathological assessment was performed by an American College of Veterinary Pathology–certified pathologist (A.L.W.) in a blinded fashion. Regions of interest for measuring trabecular bone area and osteoclast counts were defined using the cortical bone and growth plate as boundaries.

Bone resorption assay Bovine bone slices (Immunodiagnostic Systems) were stained for areas of resorption as previously described (67). Briefly, supernatants from wells containing bone slices were collected for CTX-I and ICTP analyses, and the bone slices were washed twice with PBS followed by 1 N NaOH for 30 s to remove cellular content. After three additional washes with distilled water, bone slices were removed from each well and left to air dry. Bone slices were stained with 1% toluidine blue in 1% sodium borate for 5 min, followed by three successive rinses with distilled water. Once air dried, bone slices were imaged with an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope using an Olympus DP72 digital color camera. Areas of resorption were defined as pits/trenches positively stained with toluidine blue, and percentages of resorption within each total area were quantified using ImageJ. Two unrelated 4× fields of view representing maximal levels of bone resorption were quantified and averaged for each bone slice, with each bone slice representing osteoclasts from an individual biological replicate. For scanning electron microscopy, representative bone slices previously resorbed by WT or GILT−/− osteoclasts were loaded onto copper tape and sputter coated with gold-palladium before visualization using an XL30 scanning electron microscope (Philips).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay CTX-1 and PINP concentrations in 20-week-old female WT or GILT−/− mice were determined using a RatLaps (CTX-I) EIA Immunoassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems) and a Rat/Mouse PINP EIA Immunoassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fasting blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture, centrifuged at 300g for 15 min to remove cellular content, transferred to fresh tubes, and stored at −80°C before analysis. Cell culture concentrations of CTX-I and ICTP were determined using a CrossLaps for Culture (CTX-I) ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) Immunoassay (Immunodiagnostic Systems) and a Bovine ICTP Competitive ELISA kit (MyBioSource), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Collected supernatants from resorbed bone slices were centrifuged at 300g for 15 min and stored at −80°C until CTX-I/ICTP analysis. For all ELISA assays, samples were run in duplicate and averaged, and concentrations were interpolated from a sigmoidal four parameter logistic (4-PL) curve-fit standard curve.

H 2 O 2 quantification The generation of extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) by WT and GILT−/− osteoclasts was assessed using the redox-sensitive reagent Amplex UltraRed (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nonadherent osteoclast precursor cells were plated at high density (2.5 × 105 cells per well; 96-well plate) and differentiated into osteoclasts using M-CSF (15 ng/ml) and RANKL (100 ng/ml) for 6 days, as described above. The following day, 150 μl of osteoclast supernatant (or media-only control) was transferred to a fresh 96-well plate and incubated with 10 μM Amplex UltraRed reagent and HRP (2 U/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. The absolute fluorescence intensity of the resulting oxidized product (resorufin) was measured using an EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer).

Recombinant GILT reductase activity Recombinant human GILT expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (LS-G50826) was purchased from LifeSpan BioSciences. To confirm reductase bioactivity of the GILT enzyme (see fig. S7, A and B), the disulfide-containing fluorogenic cystine-based reagent BODIPY FL l-cystine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted to a final concentration of 5 μM in assay buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 200 μM cysteine, pH 5). Subsequently, 200 ng of GILT, 200 ng of heat inactivated GILT (enzyme heat inactivated at 95°C for 10 min before addition), or no GILT was added to the reaction mixture at a final total volume of 50 μl, and fluorescence liberation was kinetically measured in real time at 37°C for 180 min using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Following the subtraction of background fluorescence (samples with 5 μM substrate in assay buffer, no cysteine), rates of disulfide reduction were determined by calculating the slope of the real-time trace between 45 and 90 min (y = mx + c, where y is the relative fluorescence, m is the slope, and x is the time) and made relative to the no GILT control.

Free thiol labeling and quantification We diluted 500 ng of recombinant human SPARC (PeproTech) or 200 ng of recombinant human cathepsin K (EMD Millipore) in assay buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 100 μM cysteine, pH 5) with or without the addition of 500 ng of recombinant human GILT (LifeSpan BioSciences) at a final reaction volume of 30 μl, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. GILT (or vehicle) was preactivated with 50 μM dithiothreitol (DTT) (15 min, 37°C) before addition. Identical samples containing excess DTT (25 mM) were also prepared as a positive control for disulfide reduction. To both quench the reaction and label newly liberated thiols, biotin ethylenediamine iodoacetamide (Biotium) in 10× borate-buffered saline (pH 8.8) was added to each reaction mix to a final concentration of 250 μM. The labeling reaction was performed in the dark for 90 min at room temperature, and final products were quenched with nonreducing SDS sample buffer before separation by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein bands corresponding to biotinylated SPARC were analyzed using Image Lab software (Bio-Rad), and band intensity was made relative to 25 mM DTT-positive controls.

Recombinant cathepsin K activity assays Maintenance of cathepsin K proteolytic activity by GILT was measured using a protocol adapted from our previous study with cathepsin S (26). Briefly, 35 ng (Fig. 5, A and B) or 200 ng (Fig. 5, C and D) of recombinant human cathepsin K (ab157067, Abcam) was diluted in assay buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 500 μM cysteine, pH 5). Subsequently, recombinant human GILT (LS-Bio) or heat inactivated (HI) GILT (enzyme heat inactivated at 95°C for 10 min before addition) was added to the reaction at a 5:1 ratio (175 ng GILT; Fig. 5, A and B) or a 2:1 ratio (400 ng GILT; Fig. 5, C and D). Recombinant GILT activity was previously demonstrated to be completely heat labile (26), with heat-inactivated GILT having no effect on cathepsin activity in an acidic reconstituted system (see fig. S7, C and D). GILT and heat-inactivated GILT were pretreated with 50 μM DTT (15 min, 37°C) before addition. Immediately before commencing measurements, 50 μM of the fluorescent cathepsin K–specific substrate Abz-HPGGPQ-EDDnp (Anaspec) or 60 μg/ml of the fluorescent collagenase substrate DQ collagen (type I, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to each reaction mixture to a final total volume of 50 μl. Proteolytic cleavage of each substrate was kinetically measured in real time at 37°C using a FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Following the subtraction of background fluorescence (samples containing substrate in assay buffer), rates of proteolysis were determined by calculating the slope of the real-time trace between 60 and 120 min (Fig. 5, A and B) or between 0 and 30 min (Fig. 5, C and D) (y = mx + c, where y is the relative fluorescence, m is the slope, and x is the time) and made relative to heat-inactivated GILT samples.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabd3684/F1.large.jpg,"['osteoclastic', 'k', 'thiol', 'bone', 'cells', 'cathepsin', 'resorption', 'nonimmunological', 'using', 'γinterferoninducible', 'osteoclasts', 'reductase', 'lysosomal', 'fig', 'gilt', 'wt', 'role']",

Leaders can develop a reboarding strategy using five culture drivers

Focusing on culture drivers can set managers and teams up for success

Many organizational leaders today are eagerly talking about returning their work back to ""normal."" It's as though this will be a panacea for all the problems incurred trying to get work done over the past year. Some leaders even seem to be under the assumption that work will function as it did before 2020, picking up right where they left off before the pandemic hit.

It would be nice if life were that simple.

The reality is the global workforce has a fresh perspective on the importance of effective work-life integration. Those who were able to work remotely may have had sustained or improved productivity in a virtual environment. On the flip side, remote workers have experienced higher amounts of stress and worry during the pandemic than on-site workers.

Historically, when companies have the benefit of their employees working together on-site, the workplace culture -- defined by Gallup as ""how we do things around here"" -- often encourages interactions among associates and creates work expectations for behaviors, norms and practices. Now, with many companies planning to maintain a hybrid work environment that blends on-site and off-site work, ensuring an aligned culture that applies to the entire workforce while supporting the values of the organization is crucial.

No matter their role or whether employees have been with the organization for one day or 30 years, learning new practices on how to best work together in this evolving workplace is a requirement. An employee reboarding strategy can help.

Develop a Reboarding Strategy Using the Five Culture Drivers

Your organization may already have a reboarding strategy -- and, chances are, that strategy centers largely on compliance and providing wellness and wellbeing services like employee assistance and stress reduction programs. Those things are foundationally important but do not necessarily deal with the often-unaddressed requirements of getting a job done.

Workplace cultures are consciously created through hard work and intention. A reboarding strategy keeps company culture front and center and provides managers with a road map for how to create a positive work environment in a hybrid working world. Reboarding should be more than a reminder of how things were done in the past -- it needs to be intentional, strategic in nature and applicable to all employees, regardless of tenure or location. High-functioning cultures do not necessarily need an overhaul after the pandemic, but they may need to recalibrate the drivers of their culture to align with the new way of getting work done.

No matter their role or whether employees have been with the organization for one day or 30 years, learning new practices on how to best work together in this evolving workplace is a requirement.

There are five main drivers of organizational culture that collectively shape how employees conduct themselves, make decisions and accomplish their work. Organizations that ensure they are delivering on these five drivers set managers and employees up for success as they continue to adjust to evolving work dynamics with hybrid teams, flexible work environments and new norms.

Culture Driver 1: Leadership and Communication

The way your organization's leaders define, display and communicate your purpose and brand influences whether employees will exemplify those values.

Somewhat paradoxically during the pandemic, Gallup saw a rise in overall employee engagement. This was due in large part to the increased transparency and communication delivered to the workforce by senior leaders. This increased engagement dropped and then plateaued -- it was predictably unsustainable because history has shown us that leaders will go back to decreased communication once the crisis is perceived to be over. And, worse, they may not back up their assurances with supportive actions.

To maintain trust in leadership, review your communications, ensure decisions are based on organizational values, and map commitments and assertions made to visible leadership behaviors, organizational policies and the needs of employees.

During the pandemic, leaders also communicated directly with managers about changes in work, customer priorities and addressing resource needs to get the job done. This increased communication needs to continue -- it allows a company's managers to know where to focus their teams and drive productivity. Further, it builds trust in leaders among all employees.

Culture Driver 2: Values and Rituals

Values and rituals set and reinforce the tone for how employees interact with others and get work done.

Core values are beliefs that an organization desires its people to universally espouse -- many times, this is aspirational. They represent a guiding star, a promise to their employees and customers, and are pressure-tested in a crisis.

Rituals are habitual and, by nature, hard to break without integrating new habits. This is why organizations need to be intentional about creating new rituals that can withstand the new dynamics of work.

If management formerly exhibited company values through the ritual of walking around to check in informally with their team on a daily basis, what should that look like if some or all members are off-site? Perhaps it takes the form of informal quick connects through Zoom or check-ins via phone calls to provide the opportunity to touch base with their team members. However, if you are touting flexibility in the remote work dynamic, realize that these quick connects also need to be flexible and centered on the individual employee, not the manager.

Organizations need to be intentional about creating new rituals that can withstand the new dynamics of work.

Hosting town halls with organizational leadership is another example of a ritual that has necessarily changed with more people working remotely. Shifting these to a virtual format might feel more formal than sitting in a great hall and being able to raise a hand in the moment -- but with intentional structuring, these virtual town halls can still make employees feel like their leaders are as accessible as ever. Intentional restructuring might look something like giving employees opportunities to submit questions beforehand via email, having a moderator monitor the chat and pose incoming questions from employees to leaders, and cascading manager communications about the event so that employees feel encouraged to attend and participate.

Culture Driver 3: Human Capital

To succeed in this new era of work, organizations must create a people-centered employee experience that reinforces their purpose, brand and culture. Every decision about the workforce -- including selection, engagement and development -- should recognize how blended work and life have become while respecting people's personal space as technology blurs the line even more.

Doing this successfully will necessitate that managers have a holistic understanding of who their employees are as people. This isn't a one-size-fits-all world anymore. Managers have to be in tune with their associates on an individual level to ensure their team members are performing and coping well with whatever work looks like for them now.

The right work-life balance for a new parent will be different than it is for an associate who takes care of an ailing family member, or that of a single Gen Zer, and so on. To strike this delicate balance for an entire team, managers need to strengthen their abilities to individualize, listen and find creative solutions to problems.

To succeed in this new era of work, organizations must create a people-centered employee experience that reinforces their purpose, brand and culture.

Leaders can help facilitate a positive employee experience by expanding discretionary authority for managers, empowering them to take action when they need to. This can seem like an impossible ask for many organizations, unless your organization selects managers based on who has the right talent for the role and then invests in their leadership development (for example, helping managers shift from boss to coach). But when talented managers are empowered to act independently, they can affect the day-to-day experiences that reinforce how valued employees feel.

Culture Driver 4: Work Teams and Structures

As traditional, on-site teams become less and less common, organizations should embrace new ways of working, whether that means hybrid teams, hybrid schedules or blending both.

One of the evident benefits of these new structures includes accessing the best talent available, regardless of their physical location. There are also many drawbacks. The shift out of the office has relegated ""water-cooler talk"" to being something of a relic. Back-to-back Zoom meetings may seem to inflate productivity, but many organizations Gallup works with cite a lack of collaboration and innovation in the absence of the serendipitous, informal interactions that used to happen organically in hallways and common areas.

Scheduled remote social events can provide some of this missing connection -- but often, remote employees will deprioritize such structured events in the pursuit of their day-to-day job demands. Managers are best positioned to stimulate opportunities for informal collaboration by recognizing what work employees are doing and how it connects with the bigger picture and others' goals. They can model and encourage small shifts in behavior and the use of available technology platforms like Microsoft Teams to truly create community and achieve success in new ways.

Rather than being nostalgic for the past, organizations have an opportunity to blow up old structures and create new processes that remove barriers to achieving profound, purpose-driven work.

Culture Driver 5: Performance

From goal setting to accountability to pay and other rewards, performance management practices must support an organization's purpose, deliver on its brand promise and reinforce its desired culture.

Performance management requires organizational infrastructure -- and, assuming it is successfully embedded, its efficacy ultimately comes down to the manager. And some organizations' management practices are not in line with their organizational leadership's values and desired culture.

Only about one in 10 people possess the natural talent to manage, though another two in 10 can function at a high level if their company invests in coaching and development plans for them. It will come as no surprise to hear that working remotely only exacerbates the negative effects of weak managers, as they tend to rely on micromanaging and fill calendars with unnecessary meetings to feel effective.

In spite of this, the manager has become a key channel between leadership and employees amid the pandemic, responsible for sharing the organization's response to the crisis with each employee. But in March 2020, less than half of employees (48%) strongly agreed that their immediate supervisor kept them informed about what was going on in the organization as a result of COVID-19, indicating a major opportunity to close the gap in communication for half the workforce. This lack of communication related to the pandemic reflects what is often the same lack of communication regarding performance expectations.

Employees also need high wellbeing for high performance. At the outset of the pandemic, only 45% of employees felt like their organization cared about their wellbeing. In Gallup's database, this percentage varies widely -- from 30% to 90% across organizations. A large component of fostering wellbeing is within managers' span of control. It doesn't have to be a conversation solely about mental health, nor should it be. It can be about addressing purpose and career wellbeing in performance conversations, earning trust through supportive actions, and connecting with employees about aspects of their wellbeing during coaching conversations.

Investing in managers by teaching them to coach and develop their team members can be the difference between employees feeling cared for and able to perform at their best or feeling like they're left in the dark.

Rather than being nostalgic for the past, organizations have an opportunity to blow up old structures and create new processes that remove barriers to achieving profound, purpose-driven work.

The pandemic's universal disruption of the way work used to get done accelerated the shift to remote work for many. Most organizations didn't have a chance to plan or prepare. It just happened. But now, leaders have the time (and resources) to be intentional about their decisions for the future. As employees adjust to what work and life look like in this new era, help them find their bearings by using intentional, strategic reboarding efforts delivered effectively and authentically through the five drivers of your organizational culture.

48,48,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Direct observation of hyperpolarization breaking through the spin diffusion barrier - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabf5735,"Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a widely used tool for overcoming the low intrinsic sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging. Its practical applicability is typically bounded, however, by the so-called “spin diffusion barrier,” which relates to the poor efficiency of polarization transfer from highly polarized nuclei close to paramagnetic centers to bulk nuclei. A quantitative assessment of this barrier has been hindered so far by the lack of general methods for studying nuclear polarization flow in the vicinity of paramagnetic centers. Here, we fill this gap and introduce a general set of experiments based on microwave gating that are readily implemented. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach in experiments conducted between 1.2 and 4.2 K in static mode and at 100 K under magic angle spinning (MAS)—conditions typical for dissolution DNP and MAS-DNP—and directly observe the marked dependence of polarization flow on temperature.

It is common to call the spins that lie inside and outside of the spin diffusion barrier core and bulk spins, respectively. Assuming Wolfe’s definition of the barrier, diffusion from core to bulk spins is impossible by the definition itself. Claims that diffusion is observed through the diffusion barrier only make sense with respect to theoretical definitions. The HypRes experiment monitors polarization flowing from spins that are inaccessible to NMR detection to those that are accessible. We will refer to them as hidden and visible spins, respectively, to avoid ambiguity. We note that the core spins—if any—are a subset of the hidden spins.

In addition to theoretical definitions of the diffusion barrier, Wolfe ( 28 ) introduced an operational definition according to which spins are within the diffusion barrier if they are “in stronger contact with the lattice phonons that with the bulk spins,” that is, if they relax faster than they can exchange polarization with the bulk spins. Wolfe determined experimentally that proton spins at 0.3 nm to the paramagnetic center were still in strong contact with the bulk spins and, hence, outside of the barrier, according to his definition (for proton spins separated by 0.16 nm in a paramagnetic crystal at 1.4 K and 1.6 T). This approach was used in other recent studies ( 35 , 37 ).

( A ) Dipolar coupling of a proton and an electron spin taking the angular dependence into account d(r,θ) or as the root mean square d RMS (r), where r and θ are the distance between the electron and the nucleus and the angle between the vector connecting the electron and the nucleus and the main magnetic field, respectively. The black solid line represents the radius of the mean volume per electron in the case of sample I. The blue and red domains correspond to areas where proton spins are expected to contribute to the NMR line or not, respectively. ( B ) Representation of the spin diffusion barrier r b for the solvent protons of sample I according to Blumberg ( 17 ), Khutsishvili ( 19 , 54 ), and Hovav et al. ( 32 , 33 ). (red spheres) compared with the mean volume per electron spin r MV (e − ) (blue sphere). The black sphere represents the electron.

Figure 2A shows the dipolar coupling of a proton spin with an electron centered in a vertical plane, for both the exact form and taking its root mean square over all orientations. Figure 2B shows a visual representation of the diffusion barriers for sample I in red. The calculation of the barrier radius requires the determination of the distance between neighbor nuclei. Here, we have estimated the distance between neighbors assuming a statistical distribution of proton spins with the concentration of the solvent. Therefore, the resulting radii of the diffusion barriers are representative of diffusion among solvent protons and not among the protons of the radical itself, where the local density of proton spins is higher. The mathematical expressions and the details of how we calculated the different radii using these definitions are given in the Supplementary Materials. The radii of the diffusion barrier in Fig. 2B are compared with the mean volume per electron, represented in blue, which can be seen as the limits of the system. For all three definitions, the spin diffusion barrier is larger than the mean volume per electron. In other words, there should be no spin diffusion among the solvent protons of sample I. We ought to point out that these predictions are only rough estimates, which assumes that spins are statistically distributed in space.

The definition of the spin diffusion barrier changes according to authors’ choices and throughout the years of theoretical and experimental development. The size of the diffusion barrier may either be predicted by theory or determined experimentally. In essence, theoretical definitions are all based on the comparison of the interaction between nuclei and between an electron and nuclei. Blumberg’s original definition sets the limit where the dipolar interaction between nuclei is equal to the interaction between the nucleus and the electron ( 17 ). Khutsishvili’s definition sets the barrier where the difference in Larmor frequency of the nuclei caused by the electron is equal to the interaction between the nucleus and the electron, resulting in a shorter radius ( 18 ). These two definitions only take into account the secular term of the dipolar interaction between the electron and the nucleus. More recently, more sophisticated definitions of the diffusion barrier were proposed ( 32 , 33 ). Hovav et al.’s criterion includes the pseudo-secular contribution. Furthermore, it includes an arbitrary parameter ζ that determines to which extent diffusion is quenched within the barrier.

These new methods provide important insights into a very fundamental mechanism in DNP, namely, the flow of nuclear polarization away from paramagnetic agents to the bulk spins. While it was possible to study such processes indirectly using conventional saturation recovery experiments or DNP build-up curves, the HypRes approach offers the possibility of a more direct measurement in which the respective contributions of DNP and diffusion are disentangled. The model that we use here to extract quantitative information from the HypRes results is a first simplistic approach. However, these results could be used to test more profound models including mechanistic description of the polarization transfers among nuclei.

We dub our method HypRes (for hyperpolarization resurgence). In the following, we show the applicability of HypRes on sample I at 1.2 to 4.2 K and 7.05 T in static mode. We develop a simple model that treats the spin system as two reservoirs, visible and hidden, connected by a flow rate. We find that between 1.2 and 4.2 K, the flow rate spans over two orders of magnitude and is faster than relaxation toward thermal equilibrium. A second variant of the HypRes experiment, including the manipulation of the spins nearest to the electron with broadband adiabatic pulses, probes indirectly spin diffusion occurring among the hidden spins. We show that spins closer than 0.3 nm to the electron can still exchange polarization with the bulk spins, in line with the recent literature ( 35 , 37 ). These measurements also provide experimental evidence for the theoretical prediction that with decreasing distance between nuclear and electron spins, the polarization exchange by spin diffusion slows down. Last, we show that the method is also compatible with MAS-DNP by applying it to a sample of 2:3 H 2 O:glycerol (v/v) doped with 10 mM AsymPolPOK radical ( 44 ) (sample II) at 100 K and 14.1 T.

Saturation recovery recorded with small-angle pulses at 7.05 T and 3.8 K in static mode for sample I, after performing DNP in either positive or negative mode (i.e., yielding positive or negative nuclear polarization). Polarization surges far above and below from thermal equilibrium, respectively, before it finally relaxes toward it. The saturation recovery experiment recorded without prior microwave irradiation is shown for comparison.

To the best of our knowledge, no experimental procedure has been reported as of yet that enables a quantitative assessment of the polarization flow in the vicinity of the electron. Here, we introduce a general and simple method giving access to such information in a wide range of experimental conditions. The key idea is to generate a large polarization gradient between the core and bulk spins using microwave gating ( 43 ) and to subsequently monitor the return of the bulk spins to thermal equilibrium. Typical results are presented in Fig. 1 , which shows three experimental proton saturation recovery curves for a sample of 1:3:6 H 2 O:D 2 O:glycerol-d 8 (v/v/v) (commonly known as “DNP juice”) doped with 50 mM 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPOL) radical (sample I) at 3.8 K and 7.05 T. We recorded saturation recovery after performing DNP in either positive or negative mode (that is, setting the microwave frequency so as to yield positive or negative nuclear polarization, respectively) and without prior microwave irradiation. Saturation recovery experiments start with a train of saturation radio-frequency (rf) pulses, which should “erase” the memory of the system. Yet, because the pulses have a limited bandwidth, they do not affect the core spins whose resonance is strongly shifted by the nearby electron. During the saturation recovery recorded with prior microwave irradiation, polarization spreads from core to bulk spins, causing strong overshoots, which substantially exceed the intensity of thermal equilibrium toward, which all three curves tend. The sign of the overshoot reflects the sign of the DNP that was built before recording the saturation recovery. This experiment gives direct access to the dynamics of the polarization flow from core to bulk spins as their equilibration is time-resolved.

Early on, several authors found that spin diffusion was still possible among core spins, despite Blumberg and Khutsishlvili’s predictions, either by theory ( 24 – 27 ) or experimentally ( 28 ). More recently, the introduction of dDNP and MAS-DNP has revived the interest in the question of the spin diffusion barrier ( 29 – 42 ). Most of these studies address the question of the diffusion barrier by comparing DNP build-up curves with models including DNP effects, diffusion, and relaxation. The existence of the diffusion barrier (or the slowdown of diffusion) is assessed indirectly based on the ability of the models to reproduce experimental DNP build-up curves. Two recent studies have approached the question experimentally using synthetic chemistry to precisely control the distance between the electron and the closest nuclear spin ( 35 , 37 ). They were able to determine the minimal distance from the electron at which nuclei could contribute to the DNP enhancement of the bulk spins, for their respective samples and experimental conditions.

dDNP and MAS-DNP rely on four DNP mechanisms ( 13 – 15 ): the solid effect (SE), the cross effect (CE), the thermal mixing, and the Overhauser effect. In all cases, hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins is required for polarization transfer. As the intensity of this interaction decays with the inverse cube of the distance between the spins (for the dipolar part), polarization transfer occurs with the highest probability at the shortest distance from the electron. Nuclei that are too distant from the electron for efficient direct interaction may polarize more rapidly indirectly by nuclear spin diffusion relayed DNP ( 16 ). However, the nuclear spins closest to the electron spin, called “core” nuclei, are effectively decoupled from the “bulk” spins. When the electron-nucleus interaction surpasses the internuclear interaction, nuclear flip-flops are not energy-conservative anymore, and therefore, spin diffusion in the vicinity of the electron spin is reduced, thus limiting the DNP performance. This concept, known as the spin diffusion barrier, was first proposed in the 1960s by Blumberg ( 17 ) to refine Bloembergen’s model of relaxation by nuclear spin diffusion in paramagnetic crystals ( 16 ). Khutsishvili ( 18 ) proposed an alternative definition of the same concept and later applied it in the context of DNP ( 19 ). In the following years, the models of Khutsishvili and Blumberg were extended by others to more experimental cases ( 20 – 23 ). Typical radii of the diffusion barrier were found to be on the order of 1 to 2 nm, depending on sample formulation and experimental conditions.

Hyperpolarization techniques are a broad set of methods for increasing the nuclear spin polarization substantially beyond the thermal equilibrium value, thereby providing a route to overcoming the low intrinsic sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance methods. Among the methods established over the past few decades, dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) techniques have become a method of choice for a broad range of applications, from materials sciences ( 1 ) and biology ( 2 ) to preclinical research ( 3 ), to give a few outstanding examples. In a DNP experiment, the high polarization of unpaired electron spins is transferred to the surrounding nuclear spins by microwave irradiation. Typically, stable organic radicals serve as the source of electron spins, and DNP is performed in the solid state and at low temperatures, where the electron polarization is highest. The two most currently widespread variants of DNP are magic angle spinning DNP (MAS-DNP) ( 4 ) and dissolution DNP (dDNP) ( 5 – 9 ). The former is usually performed at temperatures around T = 100 K and magnetic fields of B 0 = 9.4 to 21.1 T ( 10 ), providing enhancements on the order of hundreds over thermal equilibrium. By contrast, dDNP is typically performed at around T = 1.0 to 1.6 K and B 0 = 3.35 to 10 T ( 11 , 12 ) and is followed by sample dissolution and transfer in the liquid state to a magnetic resonance imaging scanner ( 3 ) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. Typical signal enhancements in dDNP experiments are on the order of tens of thousands over thermal equilibrium ( 5 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

HypRes experiment The experimental procedure of the HypRes experiment is shown in Fig. 3. It consists of the following steps: Fig. 3 HypRes experiment. Schematic representation of the HypRes experiment and its steps. During the preparation phase, polarization is built by microwave irradiation of the electron resonance (represented by the “μw” block). The polarization of the visible spins is then annihilated by a train of hard pulses (represented by the “Sat” block) during the detection phase. The polarization of the visible spins is monitored by small-angle pulses (represented by black rectangles) separated by variable delays (VD). The curves show the evolution of the visible and hidden spins during the course of the experiment. The circles below represent the polarization of the visible and hidden reservoirs (outer and inner circle, respectively), with darker shading indicating higher polarization. I) Full saturation. The polarization of the nuclear spins is wiped out so that the experiment starts in known conditions by a series of hard rf pulses (more details are available in the “Erasing the memory of the system between experiments” section in the Supplementary Materials). II) Prepolarization. Microwaves are turned on during a delay set to be at least five times the proton DNP build-up time constant so that, when the microwaves are gated, the sample is assumed to have reached DNP equilibrium with a spatially homogeneous polarization P DNP max . III) Visible spins saturation. The NMR signal is saturated using a train of hard rf pulses. Because the saturation pulses have a limited bandwidth, the spins that experience a strong dipolar shift due to a nearby paramagnetic center are not affected. The saturation scheme is optimized to be efficient for the visible nuclear spin with the polarization of the visible spins P v ~ 0, while remaining as short as possible to leave the hidden nuclear spins unaffected with P h = (1 – η sat ) P DNP max , where η sat is an attenuation factor ideally close to 0. The saturation block is terminated by a delay to accommodate acoustic ringing and allow the remaining transverse magnetization to dephase before detection. At this point, the proton spin system has polarization values P v ~ 0 and P h = (1 – η sat ) P DNP max . IV) Resurgence monitoring. The hyperpolarization resurgence is monitored for the visible spin reservoir by NMR acquisition blocks separated by time delays. V) Decay monitoring. The return to thermal equilibrium is monitored. Figure 4 shows a typical HypRes curve and its processing for sample I at 7.05 T and 3.8 K. More details regarding the experimental procedure and the processing of HypRes data are available in Materials and Methods and in the Supplementary Materials. Fig. 4 Processing of HypRes results. The HypRes experiment is recorded with and without microwave irradiation, resulting in the microwave-on and -off curves, respectively. The microwave-off curve is subtracted to the microwave-on curve to yield a curve of polarization excess with respect to thermal equilibrium. Note that the microwave-off curve corresponds to a conventional saturation recovery experiment.

Two-reservoir model A model is used to interpret the data assuming that the visible and hidden spins behave as reservoirs exchanging polarization at flow rate R f and that each reservoir returns to thermal equilibrium with respective intrinsic relaxation rates, R 1,v and R 1,h , which is reminiscent of typical spin temperature models (14). Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of the model. The underlying assumption is that diffusion within the reservoirs is fast with respect to the flow between them, which allows the polarization to be considered as “instantly” uniform inside each reservoir. This would be true if diffusion was not hindered by the presence of the electron. We estimate that diffusion connects the spins within a characteristic time of 100 ms or at a frequency of 10 s−1 in our conditions [this estimation is based on values from the literature (45); more details are available in the Supplementary Materials]. As will be revealed in Results, the measured flow rate is small compared to this characteristic diffusion rate. However, of course, diffusion is expected to be hindered by the presence of the electron. This simplification is a trade-off to describe the system with a simple model in first approximation. It is also assumed that no other reservoirs substantially influence the proton spin system. In particular, it is assumed, and later verified, that the deuterium nuclei present within the sample are not responsible for the observed effect. Fig. 5 Two-reservoir model. Schematic representation of the model used to analyze HypRes results. The relaxation rate constant of the visible spins R 1,v is assumed to be negligible. Polarization flows between the visible and hidden reservoirs at flow rate R f , while the hidden spins relax to thermal equilibrium at rate R 1,h . Under the assumptions above, the evolution of the polarizations in the visible and hidden reservoir, P v (t) and P h (t), is given by the following differential equation d dt ( P v P h ) = ( − χ h R f − R 1 , v χ h R f ( 1 − χ h ) R ex − ( 1 − χ h ) R f − R 1 , h ) ( P v P h ) + P eq ( R 1 , v R 1 , h ) (1)where χ h is the fraction of the nuclear spins in the hidden reservoir and P eq is the nuclear polarization at Boltzmann equilibrium. The derivation of the model is given in the Supplementary Materials. The solution to this differential equation is ( P v P h ) = P eq − α V − e λ − t − β V + e λ + t (2)with the eigenvalues λ + and λ − and eigenvectors V + and V − given by λ ± = − R f − R 1 , v − R 1 , h ± ( R f + R 1 , h − R 1 , v ) 2 + 4 χ h R f ( R 1 , v − R 1 , h ) 2 V ± = ( 1 + R 1 , h + λ ± R f ( 1 − χ h ) 1 ) (3)and the coefficients α and β, which depend on the initial conditions α = ( λ + + R 1 , h ) ( P eq − P h 0 ) + ( 1 − χ h ) R f ( P v 0 − P h 0 ) λ + − λ − β = ( λ − + R 1 , h ) ( P eq − P h 0 ) + ( 1 − χ h ) R f ( P v 0 − P h 0 ) λ − − λ + (4)where P v 0 and P h 0 are the polarizations of the visible and hidden reservoirs at t = 0, respectively, which corresponds to the beginning of NMR signal detection. Because the visible reservoir is saturated, we have P v 0 = 0 . Because the polarization is assumed to be homogeneous throughout each reservoir at t = 0, the polarization of the hidden reservoir is equal to the polarization at the DNP equilibrium, that is, P h 0 = P DNP max . The eigenvalues λ + and λ − determine the two relevant time scales predicted by the model. −λ − corresponds to the rate at which the two reservoirs equilibrate with each other, while −λ + corresponds to the rate at which their polarizations return toward Boltzmann equilibrium, after equilibration. This rate thus corresponds to the longitudinal relaxation rate constant R 1 , and so we write R 1 = − λ + (5) In our conditions, we approximate that the intrinsic relaxation rate constant of the bulk spins R 1,v is 0; that is, the visible spins only reach Boltzmann equilibrium through spin diffusion toward the hidden spins, which are efficiently relaxed by the nearby electrons (17, 19). Because the curves obtained in the HypRes experiment are expressed in terms of polarization excess, the thermal buildup must be subtracted, yielding ( PE v PE h ) = ( P v P h ) − P eq ( 1 − e λ + t ) = − α V − e λ − t − ( β V + − P eq ) e λ + t (6)where PE v and PE h are the polarization excess in the visible and hidden reservoirs, respectively.

Experimental quantification of the polarization flow as a function of temperature The HypRes experiment was performed on sample I at 7.05 T in static mode between 1.2 and 4.2 K. The polarization excess along time is shown in Fig. 6A (gray crosses). During the preparation step, the sample was polarized in positive mode, causing a positive polarization overshoot. Because of the prohibitively slow relaxation at the lowest temperatures, the curves were not recorded until they had reached thermal equilibrium. In particular, at 1.2 K, the polarization had reached its maximum but was only starting to decay when the monitoring was stopped. The two-reservoir model described above was applied to these HypRes curves (black curves in Fig. 6A). As explained in the dedicated section, it was assumed that the polarization of the visible and hidden reservoirs at the beginning of detection was 0 and P DNP max , respectively, and that the intrinsic relaxation rate of the visible reservoir was negligible, R 1,v ≈ 0. The three remaining free parameters are R 1,h , R f , and χ h . Their fitted values are shown in Fig. 6B. The flow rate R f spreads over two orders of magnitude from 4.4 × 10−3 s−1 to 0.29 s−1. The relaxation rate of the hidden reservoir R h is not shown for 1.2 K because its fitted value is unrealistically small and out of the trend (the fitted value is between 10−14 and 10−11 s−1 depending on the starting point of the fit algorithm). However, neither the quality of the fit nor the fitted values of R f and χ h are significantly affected by the value of R 1,h (the fit was repeated fixing R 1,h between 0 and 10−5 s−1, which did not affect R f and χ h significantly). For the available range, R h spreads from 9.4 × 10−4 s−1 to 6.9 × 10−2 s−1. The fitted size of the hidden reservoir χ h is between 5 and 7%. We show in fig. S2 that the HypRes effect occurs also in a fully protonated sample, that is, in the absence of a deuterium spin reservoir. Fig. 6 Diffusion versus temperature. (A) Results of the HypRes experiment at 7.05 T in static mode between 1.2 and 4.2 K for sample I, monitored with small-angle pulses expressed in terms of polarization excess with respect to thermal equilibrium. The gray crosses and the black lines represent the experimental data and the fit of the two-reservoir model, respectively. (B) Fitted parameters of the two-reservoir model plotted against temperature. The size of the hidden reservoir is given according to the two-reservoir model (χ h ) and according to Eq. 7 ( χ ∼ h ). The error bars correspond to the error of the fit with 95% confidence. The model fits the data appropriately during the decay of the curves, that is, once the strong polarization gradient between hidden and visible spins has already disappeared. As expected, the quality of fit is poorer at the beginning of the curve, during the equilibration. The simplicity of the model that assumes two homogeneous reservoirs does not account for the complex dynamics of the spin system, when gradients are equilibrating among the hidden spins. Nonetheless, it allows for at least an order of magnitude estimate of the flow between the reservoirs and shows its tremendous temperature dependence. The relaxation rate of the hidden reservoir R 1,h is found to be slow compared with the flow between the reservoirs R f (the ratio R 1,h /R f goes from ~1/4 to ~1/27 at 4.2 and 1.8 K, respectively). This implies that the two domains of the HypRes curve (the equilibration and the decay) can be interpreted separately; the rise of the polarization excess informs on the flow between the reservoirs R f , while the decay informs on the relaxation rate R 1,h . It also implies that polarization is able to equilibrate throughout the spin system before relaxation becomes substantial. In this limit, the size of the hidden reservoir is directly proportional to the intensity of the overshoot P HypRes χ ∼ h ≈ P HypRes P h 0 = P HypRes ( 1 − η sat ) P DNP max (7)where η sat and P DNP max are the attenuation of the polarization in the hidden reservoir caused by the saturation block at the end of preparation and the polarization measured at DNP equilibrium, respectively. The size of the hidden reservoir can be obtained with this method ( χ ∼ h ) or with the two-reservoir model (χ h ). While the latter is biased by the poor match of the two-reservoir model, the former gives a more direct estimate of the size of the hidden reservoir by the HypRes experiment. Figure 6B shows that the size of the hidden reservoir, evaluated with Eq. 7, seems to decrease when temperature increases. Two effects can explain this apparent dependence. First, because of the increase of flow rate R f with temperature, more polarization is able to leak out of the hidden reservoir during saturation at higher temperature. As the saturation scheme was identical for all six HypRes curves, an increased saturation of the hidden reservoir η sat with temperature can be expected and thus a smaller “apparent” size. Second, the condition that the polarization flow is much faster than relaxation is better satisfied at the lowest experimental temperature.

The size of the hidden reservoir The size of the hidden reservoir was quantified in a separate experiment for comparison with the values obtained above. The thermal equilibrium signal buildup of DNP juice was recorded as a function of TEMPOL concentration at 3.8 K and 7.05 T and fitted with a monoexponential model (see fig S3). Figure 7A shows how the thermal equilibrium signal decreases with increasing TEMPOL concentration. The signal was not recorded without TEMPOL because of the very slow relaxation of proton spins in the absence of paramagnetic relaxation. Assuming that the signal loss is linear with the TEMPOL concentration in the low range, we extrapolate the intensity at a concentration of 0 (here, we simply used the slope between the first two points) to normalize the curve with a y intercept of 100%. From this curve, we find that the presence of 50 mM TEMPOL in sample I removes ~30% of the proton signal. Fig. 7 Quantification of the hidden spins. (A) Relative proton signal as a function of TEMPOL radical concentration in DNP juice recorded at 7.05 T and 3.8 K in static mode (open circles) showing that the presence of the radical quenches ~30% of the NMR signal for sample I. The dashed line represents linear interpolation of the first two points. (B) Simulated fraction of the spins that are hidden because they are unaffected by rf pulses as a function of the pulse bandwidth. Δω and ω 1 are the paramagnetic shift and nutation frequency of the pulses, respectively, used to discriminate between visible and hidden spins. (C) Simulated fraction of the spins that are hidden because their transverse relaxation time constant is below the dead time of the spectrometer as a function of the correlation time of the electron spin state. T 2,para and τ d are the transverse paramagnetic relaxation time constant and the spectrometer dead time, respectively, used to discriminate between visible and hidden spins. The light blue and pink areas represent the visible and hidden fraction of the proton spins, respectively. See the Supplementary Materials for details of the simulations. Two effects may account for the signal loss in the presence of a paramagnetic species. First, the dipolar interaction with electrons shifts the Larmor frequency of the close nuclei outside the detection limits. Second, the interaction with electrons shortens the transverse relaxation time of the nuclei, an effect known as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), which increases the signal loss during the dead time between the pulse and the acquisition (46, 47). Figure 7 (B and C) shows simulations of the two contributions, which were performed assuming a random distribution of 1926 electrons in a cube of 40 nm (corresponding to the concentration of 50 mM). The proton paramagnetic shift was calculated taking into account the angular dependence of the dipolar interaction. Protons are considered undetectable when their paramagnetic shift is larger than the excitation bandwidth of the pulse, which we estimate to be equal to the nutation frequency (42 kHz). We find that ~5% of the spins are hidden according to this criterion [see Fig. 7B]. The transverse paramagnetic relaxation rate of the protons is calculated using the equation of PRE (46, 47), which does not account for any angular dependence. Protons are considered to relax too rapidly to be detected when their transverse relaxation time constant is on the order of the dead time between the pulse and the signal acquisition (τ d ). Paramagnetic relaxation depends on the correlation time of the electron spin state τ c (e−), which we can only estimate to be on the order of 0.5 μs (see the Supplementary Materials). Figure 7C shows the fraction of spins that are hidden by PRE as a function of τ c (e−). We find that, for τ c (e−) = 0.5 μs, the hidden fraction is 6%. Details on the simulations are available in the Supplementary Materials. The contributions of the two effects simulated here may have different angular dependencies, but they do not add up together in such a way that could explain the experimentally determined signal loss of ~30% shown in Fig. 7A. This experimental result remains difficult to rationalize. It should be noted that even if the PRE may contribute to the signal losses shown in Fig. 7A, it is not the effect that enables HypRes. In contrast, the frequency shift causes the protons near the electron spins to be immune to saturation pulses, which is the essential ingredient allowing the creation of a polarization gradient near the electron and, thus, for the HypRes effect. Our simulation shows that ~5% of the protons in sample I are beyond the bandwidth of the pulses, in reasonable agreement with the result of the HypRes experiment shown in Fig. 6 (hidden reservoir size between 5 and 7%). The HypRes experiment was repeated at 3.8 K and 7.05 T for sample I with various saturation pulse nutation frequencies (see fig. S5A). We found that the dependence of the hidden fraction on the nutation frequency of the saturation pulses follows the same trend for experiment and simulation (see fig. S5B).

HypRes using broadband inversion pulses To gain further insight into the spin diffusion processes near the electron, we repeated the HypRes experiment at 3.8 K and 7.05 for sample I in static mode adding a broadband inversion pulse centered at the middle of the NMR line before saturating the visible spins (see pulse sequence in Fig. 8A). We used chirp pulses with widths of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 MHz, intended to invert proton spins over ±0.25, ±0.5, ±1, ±1.5, and ±2 MHz, respectively. These pulses thus invert proton spins far off resonance (from the detectable NMR range). After inversion, the spins are saturated by a train of pulses that act only on a narrow bandwidth (see above), as in the pulse sequence presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 8 HypRes experiment with inversion pulses. (A) Pulse sequence of the HypRes experiment including a broadband adiabatic pulse at the end of the preparation step (represented by the shape labeled “Inv”). (B) Results of the HypRes experiment with inversion pulses at 7.05 T and 3.8 K in static mode recorded with small-angle pulses for sample I with inversion widths from 0.5 to 4 MHz, in logarithmic and linear scale. (C) Estimated relative polarization profiles of the proton spins at the end of the preparation as a function of Larmor frequency shift taking into account the imperfection of the pulses (see the Supplementary Materials for more information on the pulse imperfections). The dip near zero is due to the narrow band saturation at the end of the preparation phase. (D) Estimated relative polarization profiles of the proton spins at the end of the preparation as a function of the distance to the electron spin, converted from (C) using Eq. 8. The numbers by the curves in (B) to (D) indicate the theoretical widths of inversion chirp pulses in megahertz. At the end of the preparation, the proton spins can be separated into three parts: 1) Those far from the electron have a polarization of 0 due to the narrow saturation pulses. 2) Those closer to the electron that have been inverted by the broadband pulse have polarization with opposite sign compared to what they acquired under DNP (but reduced by the inversion pulse imperfection). 3) Last, those that are close enough to the electron with Larmor frequencies outside of the range of inversion of the pulse have kept the sign of polarization that they acquired under DNP. Following preparation, the signal resurgence is recorded by small-angle pulses, varying the delay between the detection blocks to capture processes occurring on all time scales. Figure 8B shows the resulting HypRes curves. On a fast time scale of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds (depending on the inversion width), the inverted hidden spins equilibrate their polarization with the visible spins, causing a negative overshoot. Then, on a longer time scale of hundreds of seconds, the polarization of the spins that had not been inverted and had, therefore, kept their positive polarization reaches the visible spins causing a positive polarization overshoot. The width of the inversion pulses influences the curves in several regards. First, the wider the inversion, the stronger the negative overshoot and the weaker the positive overshoot, which is consistent with the assumption that more spins are inverted with a larger pulse bandwidth and that they do exchange polarization with the visible spins. Second, the wider the range of inversion, the later the negative extremum is reached (after 0.4 and 1.4 s for the 0.5- and 4-MHz inversion pulses, respectively), and the same is true for the positive extremum (after 150 and 300 s for the 0.5- and 4-MHz inversion pulses, respectively). A larger pulse inversion bandwidth implies that the noninverted spins are more coupled to the electron. Therefore, the fact that the overshoot occurs later demonstrates that the stronger the protons are coupled with the electron, the more spin diffusion is hindered. Last, the slopes of the curves going from the negative to the positive extrema are also affected by the inversion width that supports this argument. These measurements thus provide experimental evidence that the Larmor frequency gradient caused by the electron spin is responsible for a gradient of the nuclear spin diffusion coefficient. We note that the shift of the nuclear Larmor frequency caused by the hyperfine interaction goes with the inverse cube of the distance to the electron and is expected to affect nuclear spin diffusion (as detailed in Introduction). Yet, the dependence of the spin diffusion coefficient with respect to the distance to the electron is not known. The results presented here pave the way toward a detailed study of this dependence. The quality of the inversion pulses was assessed in a separate experiment presented in the Supplementary Materials (see fig. S6), showing that the inversion has a maximum efficiency over ~3/5 of the theoretical width. Those measurements are used to estimate the polarization of the proton spins at the beginning of detection as a function of their dipolar coupling constant to the electron [see Fig. 8C]. The polarization dip at the center corresponds to the saturated visible spins. Assuming that the offset frequency of the nuclei is governed by the paramagnetic shift, we can translate the offset into a distance (see the Supplementary Materials for the expression of the paramagnetic shift). For a given shift Δω, the distance between the electron and the nucleus can take any value between 0 and r e − n max , depending on the angle between main magnetic field and the vector connecting the electron and the nucleus θ. The maximal possible distance r e − n max corresponds to θ = 0, π and is given by r e − n max = ( 1 2 μ 0 4 π ℏ γ e γ n ∣ Δ ω ∣ ) 1 / 3 (8)in rad s−1, where μ 0 , ħ, γ e , γ n , and r are the vacuum permeability, reduced Planck’s constant, the gyromagnetic ratios of the electron, and the nucleus and the distance between them, respectively. The profiles in Fig. 8C are expressed as a function of the maximum electron-nucleus distance r e − n max using the above equation and are shown in Fig. 8D.

The nuclei closest to the electron The HypRes experiment with inversion shows that spins as close as 0.3 nm to the electron can exchange polarization with the visible spins, faster than they relax toward thermal equilibrium. The HypRes experiment with a 4-MHz inversion width causes a stronger negative overshoot than with a 3-MHz inversion width. Therefore, there are spins that are not inverted by the 3-MHz inversion pulse but are inverted by the 4-MHz inversion pulse and yet can still share their polarization with the visible spins. According to Fig. 8D, such spins are at a maximum distance of 0.3 nm to the electron. Ooi Tan et al. have shown in 2019 that proton spins within a radius of <0.6 nm to a trityl radical were in contact with the bulk at 100 K and 0.3 T (37). Our results confirm this observation at 3.8 K and 7.05 T. This interpretation relies on the assumption that the inversion pulses are efficient even far away from the center of the NMR line. However, the efficiency of the inversion pulses is diminished at its edges due to the finite width of the resonance of the NMR probe. Furthermore, paramagnetic relaxation in the transverse plane is expected to be intense for far off-resonance nuclei as they are nearer to the electron spin, causing them to relax during the inversion pulse. Yet, because we observe a stronger effect of the inversion as we increase the chirp width, we conclude that the broadest pulse must still be reasonably efficient at its edges. If the 3-MHz inversion pulse was inefficient at its edges, the 4-MHz inversion pulse would not be more efficient over the same range, and the same results would be observed for the two experiments. It is interesting to remark that a sphere with a radius of 0.3 nm in a solution with 11 M protons contains less than a single proton spin on average. Yet, the TEMPOL molecule itself contains 12 protons on the four methyl groups that surround the radical and a further four protons on the next positions of the ring. As a consequence, the proton spin concentration is stronger in the vicinity of the electron than in the bulk of the sample. This local heterogeneity could be part of the reason why the nuclear polarization appears to escape so easily, a feature that could be used for the rational design of new polarizing agents.

HypRes experiment in MAS-DNP conditions at 100 K We further apply the HypRes method in the context of MAS-DNP at 100 K on sample II. We chose to use a fully protonated medium to avoid cross-relaxation from deuterium to proton spins and, thus, ensure that any overshoot is strictly due to the contribution of the hidden proton spins (48). The high proton concentration results in a strong dipolar broadening of the NMR line, ~70 kHz [see Fig. 9A]. The sample was polarized during 4 s before saturation. Figure 9B shows the microwave-on and -off curves together with the excess. Contrary to the experiments shown in Figs. 6 and 8, each point of the curve was acquired separately using a π/2 rf pulse and repeating the acquisition with another delay. Although not as strong as at lower temperature, a HypRes overshoot is observed. Fig. 9 HypRes under MAS. (A) Proton spectrum of sample II at 14.0 T and 100 K under MAS at 8 kHz obtained by DNP. (B) Corresponding HypRes curves. Contrary to experiments in static mode at low temperatures, these measurements were obtained with π/2 pulses, each point being an individual measurement. Because of the low number of data points at short delays (between 0 and 50 ms), the two-reservoir model cannot be fitted to the data. However, visual inspection of the HypRes curve shows that the maximum of the excess is reached ~30 ms after saturation. The flow rate can thus be estimated to be on the order of R f ≈ 30 s−1. As a comparison, for sample I at 4.2 K in static mode, the maximum of the excess is reached ~3 s after saturation, with a flow rate of R f = 0.29 s−1, indicating that the flow is two orders of magnitude slower. This may be due to the combined effects of increased spin concentration, MAS, and higher temperature. The low-temperature measurements were performed on sample I, with 11 M protons, while the MAS measurements were performed on sample II, with 110 M. Increasing the proton concentration decreases the average distance between neighbors and, therefore, increases the dipolar couplings and the diffusion coefficient. MAS is known to influence the spin diffusion coefficient and, in some cases, it may enhance spin diffusion (45). We note that studying the dependence of the flow rate on the MAS rate would be of great interest but is beyond the scope of the current study. The CE-DNP mechanism under MAS leads to a depolarized nuclear state with lower polarization compared to Boltzmann equilibrium (36, 49). During the HypRes experiment, after microwaves are turned off, the electrons rapidly return to Boltzmann equilibrium (within 5T 1,e ~ 1.5 ms) (36, 49) and start depolarizing the nuclei. The observation of the overshoot indicates that hidden spins exchange polarization with the visible spins faster than they are depolarized. The reason why the overshoot is so weak as compared to thermal equilibrium is likely to be explained by the saturation scheme. The visible spins were saturated with a train of 100 pulses separated with 5 ms, which yields a total of 500 ms. As the exchange between the reservoir is on the order of 30 ms, a substantial portion of polarization is able to escape from the hidden reservoir in between pulses resulting in a non-ideal saturation factor of the hidden reservoir η sat . Furthermore, the radical concentration in sample II is five times lower than in sample I, which hides a smaller fraction of the spins and, hence, causes a smaller overshoot.

The favored polarization pathway Our results show that the flow rate of polarization from hidden to visible spins is highly sensitive to temperature (see Fig. 6). It is as fast as 0.28 s−1 at 4.2 K but markedly decreases with temperature reaching a value as low as 4.3 × 10−3 s−1 at 1.2 K. This could contribute to the explanation of why DNP becomes slower as temperature decreases. Figure 10A shows DNP build-up curves for sample I between 1.2 and 4.2 K. The proton polarization at DNP equilibrium P DNP max and the build-up rates, R DNP,a and R DNP,b , were extracted from the experimental data by fitting a biexponential function P ( t ) = P DNP , max ( 1 − a exp { − R DNP , a t } − ( 1 − a ) exp { − R DNP , b t } ) (9)where a is the weight of the fast rate component R DNP,a and is between 0 and 1. The fit parameters are shown in Fig. 10B. See the Supplementary Materials for more details on the fit and on the choice of the fit function. As the temperature is decreased from 4.2 to 1.2 K, the build-up rate constants drop by more than a factor of 2, from R DNP,a = 0.037 s−1 and R DNP,b = 0.018 s−1 to R DNP,a = 0.018 s−1 and R DNP,b = 0.004 s−1. Fig. 10 DNP performance vs. temperature. (A) DNP build-up curves for sample I at 7.05 T in static mode between 1.2 and 4.2 K, monitored with small-angle pulses. The colored circles and the black lines represent the experimental data and the biexponential model, respectively. (B) Fit parameters of the biexponential model (see Eq. 9), DNP build-up rates R DNP,a and R DNP,b , and polarization at the DNP steady state P DNP max plotted against temperature. The error bars correspond to the error of the fit with 95% confidence. The fact that diffusion is slower at lower temperature gives a hint as to how the favored polarization pathway is affected by temperature. At 4.2 K, the polarization that builds up in the hidden reservoir can flow out to the visible spins on a time scale, which is fast compared with the DNP build-up time constants. Therefore, the polarization of the hidden reservoir is expected to contribute to the observed signal under DNP. In contrast, at 1.2 K, the flow of polarization from the hidden to visible reservoir that we measured with the HypRes experiment becomes slower than the DNP build-up rates. Therefore, the polarization of the hidden reservoir is not expected to contribute efficiently to the observed signal under DNP.

Possible mechanisms enabling polarization flow As we pointed out in Introduction, diffusion is expected to be effectively suppressed among the solvent protons of sample I. Yet, our results show that diffusion can occur but strongly depends on temperature. A possible explanation for this breakdown in flow rate at lower temperatures is that nuclear spin diffusion among core nuclei is assisted by electron spin flip-flops. This idea was suggested back in 1971 by Horvitz (24–27), who showed that the field fluctuations induced by the electronic flip-flops compensate for the energy mismatch between the neighboring core nuclear spins, thus enabling nuclear spin polarization flow. At low temperature, where the polarization of the electron approaches unity, the electron spin flip-flop rate diminishes (43), which, in turn, would slow down the polarization flow from hidden to visible nuclear spins. At 1.2 K and 7.05 T, the electron spin polarization exceeds 99.9%, and the electron spin flip-flop probability vanishes, an effect that has been successfully exploited in the past in microwave-gated DNP experiments (43). Microwave irradiation diminishes the electron polarization. Experiments in (43) were performed in very similar conditions to that of sample I (between 1.2 and 4.2 K) and found that microwave irradiation reduces the electron polarization from ~100 to <40%. The HypRes experiment gives access to the measurement of polarization flow rates in the absence of microwave irradiation. It is hence possible that the flow rate under microwave irradiation, that is, when DNP occurs, is actually higher. Assessing this contribution will be the subject of future work. One study investigates how phonons can contribute to nuclear spectral spin diffusion, that is, spin diffusion between nuclei whose energy is not perfectly matched (43). It shows how phonons may introduce temperature dependence into spin diffusion. The authors conclude that “the temperature-dependent spin diffusion […] seems to be a rather general phenomenon, occurring more as a rule than as an exception at temperatures not close to the absolute zero.” Such mechanisms could contribute to the temperature dependence of the polarization flow rate measured in our study. In the context of MAS-DNP, Mentink-Vigier et al. (40) and Perras et al. (36, 38) have both shown that the modulation of the hyperfine interaction by MAS allows polarization transfer from core to bulk proton spins (34, 36). Wittmann et al. have reported similar findings on 13C hyperpolarization by endohedral fullerene N@C 60 as the polarizing agent (39). This mechanism could, hence, contribute to the flow of polarization under MAS observed in this study. The question of the spin diffusion barrier is also raised outside of dDNP and MAS-DNP. We note the recent work of Pagliero et al. (50) in the field of color centers in diamonds used for 13C hyperpolarization. Although they are concerned with a different physical system, they draw conclusions that are similar to ours. They show that nuclear spin diffusion is possible for 13C spins with coupling constants to paramagnetic centers of no less than 100 MHz. Furthermore, they propose a mechanism to account for this peculiar diffusion process.

New perspectives for the study of the diffusion barrier Over the past two decades, a number of studies have brought insights into diffusion processes in the vicinity of the electron. Modern computational tools enabled quantum mechanical descriptions of multiple-spin systems, replacing continuous models based on diffusion laws. Full quantum mechanical approaches were used to simulate DNP buildups in static conditions (31–33, 41, 42). In these studies, the slowdown of nuclear polarization transfer in the vicinity of the electron is a direct consequence of how the interactions of the system are modeled—the spin barrier does not enter the model as a hypothesis, as in Blumberg or Khustishvili’s early works (17, 19). Full quantum mechanical descriptions were also used in a number of studies of MAS-DNP (30, 36, 38, 40). In an alternative approach, two studies used rate equations to describe transfer and relaxation within a large number of individual spins, in both static and MAS-DNP (39, 51). One of them used this approach to understand the polarization pathways in static SE-DNP of proton spins at 80 K and 5 T and concluded that polarization transport from the electron directly to bulk nuclei is more efficient than through the intermediate core nuclei (51). The other used the same approach to simulate 13C MAS-DNP build-up curves and gave a mechanistic account of how in this context polarization could efficiently be transferred from core to bulk spins (39). Last, a recent study used a model based on diffusion laws reminiscent of earlier works but in the context of MAS-DNP (29). This approach gave a phenomenological picture of the dependence of polarization transfer in the vicinity of the electron on the concentration of nuclear spins. The simulations used in these studies—whether based on full quantum mechanical descriptions, rate equations, or temperature-like models—were meant to reproduce DNP build-up curves, which are influenced by the efficiency of both the electron-nucleus polarization transfer (DNP mechanism) and the nucleus-nucleus polarization transfer (spin diffusion). The HypRes experiment allows a study of the second of these contributions separated from the first. Repeating such simulations to model the dynamics of HypRes curves is warranted to bring greater insights into nuclear spin dynamics in the vicinity of the electron.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabf5735/F1.large.jpg,"['observation', 'barrier', 'polarization', 'hypres', 'spins', 'hyperpolarization', 'r', 'diffusion', 'spin', 'breaking', 'electron', 'dnp', 'p', 'direct', 'hidden']", 
49,49,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Weaker bonding can give larger thermal conductance at highly mismatched interfaces - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf8197,"Thermal boundary conductance is typically positively correlated with interfacial adhesion at the interface. Here, we demonstrate a counterintuitive experimental result in which a weak van der Waals interface can give a higher thermal boundary conductance than a strong covalently bonded interface. This occurs in a system with highly mismatched vibrational frequencies (copper/diamond) modified by a self-assembled monolayer. Using finely controlled fabrication and detailed characterization, complemented by molecular simulation, the effects of bridging the vibrational spectrum mismatch and bonding at the interface are systematically varied and understood from a molecular dynamics viewpoint. The results reveal that the bridging and binding effects have a trade-off relationship and, consequently, that the bridging can overwhelm the binding effect at a highly mismatched interface. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of phonon transport at interfaces, unifying physical and chemical understandings, and allowing interfacial tailoring of the thermal transport in various material systems.

In this work, with fine control over the structure of the SAM, we realize a systematic study of the binding and bridging effects on the TBC by varying both the end groups of the SAM (CH 3 and SH) and phonon frequencies of the dielectric (silicon, sapphire, and diamond). In the Cu/diamond system, we experimentally demonstrate that the CH 3 -SAM–functionalized vdWs interface gives a counterintuitively higher TBC than the SH-SAM–functionalized covalently bonded interface, whose interfacial adhesion strength is typically two orders of magnitude higher ( 17 ). By comparing the TBCs of all the systems, we find that this abnormal phenomenon only occurs at the interface with highly mismatched frequencies, where the bridging effect dominates over the binding effect in determining the TBC. We find a trade-off between the binding and bridging effects, and the strong bridging effect overwhelms the negative effect of the weak interfacial adhesion at the CH 3 -SAM–modified vdWs interface.

The use of an SAM as an intermediate layer facilitates interfacial heat conduction through two distinct mechanisms: binding and bridging effects ( 12 ). Many studies have shown TBC enhancement by increasing the interfacial adhesion via the binding effect, which enhances the transmission coefficient of individual phonons while remaining the range of phonon transmission constant (the number of phonon channels keeps unchanged). At interfaces such as gold/quartz ( 13 ) and Cu/silica ( 14 ), by varying the end groups from CH 3 [van der Waals (vdWs) interface] to SH (covalently bonded interface), which increases the interfacial adhesion strength by approximately two orders of magnitude, the TBC increases from 36 to 65 MW/m 2 ·K, and from 260 to 430 MW/m 2 ·K, respectively. In addition, fewer, but still several, works have demonstrated enhancement of the TBC through the bridging effect at interfaces such as gold/polymer (25 to 165 MW/m 2 ·K) ( 15 ) and Cu/diamond (40 to 80 MW/m 2 ·K) ( 16 ). Bridging the vibrational frequency mismatch between the materials on the sides of the interface with the SAM can extend the phonon transmission spectrum to a broader range, the same as that of the expanded vibrational density of states (vDOSs) overlap, which creates extra phonon channels for an enhanced interfacial thermal transport. Although previous studies have elucidated the effectiveness of SAM modification for TBC enhancement and corresponding mechanisms, the binding and bridging effects have always been discussed separately. A unified understanding of the relative contributions of the binding and bridging effects would expand the methods to further promote the TBC by SAM modification, but the challenge is to systematically vary both the bonding strength and frequency matching.

The rapid advances in electronics have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation at the material level ( 1 ), for which interfaces between constituent materials and inside composites are critical because they are scatterers for phonons, resulting in thermal resistance ( Fig. 1A ) ( 2 ). To enhance the thermal boundary conductance (TBC), the insertion of an intermediate layer at an interface has attracted considerable interest. Controlling the mass ( 3 ), thickness ( 4 – 6 ), and chemical components ( 7 ) of the intermediate layer has been suggested to be effective in enhancing the TBC. Recently, the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) ( 8 ) comprising alkyl chain molecules with a thickness below 2 nm has emerged as a promising candidate for the intermediate layer ( 9 – 11 ) because of the precise and flexible controllability of the physical and chemical structures by varying the chain length and end groups ( Fig. 1B ).

RESULTS

Anomalous heat conduction at the mismatched interface To obtain an interface with variable adhesion, we used alkylsilanes [n-butyltrimethoxysilane and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propanethiol] with two different kinds of end groups (SH and CH 3 , respectively) for SAM functionalization (Fig. 1C). The SH-SAM can form a robust covalent bond (S─Cu) with Cu via the dehydrogenation reaction of SH, making the interfacial adhesion strength typically two orders of magnitude higher than that with the weak vdWs interaction between the CH 3 -SAM and Cu. Using these two kinds of SAM in systems such as Cu/diamond, Cu/sapphire, and Cu/silicon with different degrees of vibrational mismatch, we can elucidate the roles of both the binding and bridging effects in determining the TBC. We fabricated the samples by forming the SAM on the substrates and then depositing the Cu and aluminum layers, which served as a transducer (see Materials and Methods). Because the morphology of the SAM influences the heat conduction through the interface (10), SAM formation on the substrates (diamond, sapphire, and silicon) was performed concurrently in the same reaction container to ensure that the morphologies of the SAMs in all the systems are comparable. The morphologies of the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM should be similar to ensure that the resultant differences in the TBC originate mainly from the differences in the properties of the SAM end groups. To this end, before depositing the metals, we applied the commonly used water contact angle and ellipsometry measurements to characterize the SAM morphologies (Fig. 2A). The thicknesses of both the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM are approximately 5 to 6 Å, with contact angles of 53° and 93°, respectively, owing to the difference in the hydrophilicity of the end groups. This result agrees well with a previous study (18), indicating that the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM are similar in morphology, uniform monolayers with high order.

The inset is a schematic of the sputtered sample. Using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR; Fig. 1D), we first measured the TBC at the Cu/diamond interface. The temperature decay profile illustrates a clear difference between the interfaces functionalized by the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM (Fig. 3A), where the decay is considerably faster in the CH 3 -SAM case. This result indicates an unexpected phenomenon in which the CH 3 -SAM–modified interface with the CH 3 -Cu vdWs interaction, whose adhesion is two orders of magnitude lower than the S-Cu covalent bonding, achieves a higher TBC than the SH-SAM–modified interface. This contradicts the fundamental understanding of the binding effect reported in previous studies (13, 14). Fig. 3 TDTR measurement.

(D) TBC of SH-SAM– and CH 3 -SAM–functionalized systems with different degrees of vibrational mismatch. To verify the reproducibility of the experimental results, we carried out additional measurements using independently prepared samples of the same kind. The resulting TBCs are summarized in Fig. 3B. For each case, the measured TBC was observed to be within a reasonable range (±7 MW/m2·K; where the error bars represent the uncertainty in TDTR data fitting and sample preparation, including SAM formation and metal deposition), with an average TBC for the CH 3 -SAM interface of approximately 61.5 MW/m2·K, twofold higher than that of the SH-SAM interface (33.6 MW/m2·K). This high reproducibility of the experimental results proves the reliability of this unusual dependence of the TBC on the bonding strength. Moreover, we characterized the SH-SAM samples (with metal layers deposited) using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) to exclude unintentional factors such as degradation of the SAM and poor contact between the SAM and deposited Cu layer that may degrade the TBC. The TEM cross-sectional view and the corresponding energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) line scan at the interface (Fig. 2, B and C) display a highly uniform SAM layer (~6 Å) firmly in contact with both Cu and diamond, whose thickness is in perfect agreement with that measured by the ellipsometer. Figure 2D shows the XPS spectrum of the sulfur (S) 2p peak measured at the surface close to the Cu/SAM interface with the help of a precisely controlled argon sputtering process (inset in Fig. 2D). This enables direct probing of the chemical bonding at the interface. We observed that the S 2p 3/2 peak at a binding energy of approximately 161.7 eV corresponds to the S─Cu covalent bond (19), while the peak representing the pristine SH end groups (~168 eV) is absent. This result reveals that almost all the SAM molecules formed Cu─S covalent bonds at the Cu/SAM interface. The measurement reproducibility tests and the SAM morphology characterizations before and after the metal deposition strongly suggest the validity of the experimental results, which clarify that the properties of the SAM end groups are responsible for the unusual trend of the TBC at the Cu/diamond interface. To explain the gap between the current findings and the usual understanding that stronger interfacial adhesion enhances the TBC, we compared the TBCs with those of other systems with the same SAM modification. Figure 3C shows the TBCs in Cu/sapphire and Cu/silicon systems measured by TDTR (for each case, multiple samples were prepared separately). In these systems, we found that the TBC shows the usual dependence on the interfacial adhesion strength (9, 13, 14) in that the interfaces modified by the SH-SAM (covalently bonded interfaces) have higher TBC than those modified by the CH 3 -SAM (vdWs interfaces). This result once again supports the reliability of the anomalous trend of the TBC observed for the Cu/diamond system because the sample preparations for all the systems were performed together. The systems with different materials on the dielectric side of the interface result in different extents of vibrational frequency mismatch between Cu and the dielectric. This influences the bridging effect of the SAM (20–23) due to the difference in the overlapping of vibrational frequencies between the SAM and the materials on both sides, which can change the TBC. In this sense, the results may imply that the bridging effect of the CH 3 -SAM has such a strong impact that it overwhelms the disadvantage of the weak vdWs interaction in terms of the binding effect.

Phonon transport at interfaces with varying phonon frequencies For the discussion in view of the vibrational mismatch between different materials, we use the Debye temperature, which is the temperature at which all vibrational modes are excited in a given material, as an indicator for the frequency range of the lattice vibrational spectrum (or vDOSs). Here, as a simplification, the degrees of vibrational mismatch of the systems are determined by the Debye temperature (19) of the materials on the dielectric side, which is 550, 1000, and 2200 K for silicon, sapphire, and diamond, respectively, as the other side was fixed to Cu (Debye temperature is 343 K). Because the measured TBC for the Cu/silicon systems is underestimated, as it includes the thermal resistance of the unavoidable natural oxide layer (~3-nm-thick silica, measured by the ellipsometer), the value was corrected by removing the thermal resistance of the oxide layer. We then plotted all the TBCs as a function of the Debye temperature of the dielectric side (Fig. 3D). In the SH-SAM–functionalized cases, an increase in the vibrational mismatch of the system results in a reduction in the TBC. This result agrees well with the previous research that studied the TBC between metal leads with different vibrational frequencies (24). In contrast, for the CH 3 -SAM–modified cases, the trend becomes nonmonotonic, where the highly mismatched Cu/diamond interface shows a higher TBC than the interfaces with lower degrees of vibrational mismatch. According to previous studies (25, 26) on highly mismatched metal/diamond systems, the heat conduction through the interface is dominated by the inelastic phonon interaction, resulting in low TBC, which means that phonon transmission through the elastic channel is strongly impeded by the vibrational mismatch. Therefore, if the CH 3 -SAM modification can substantially enhance the bridging effect, then phonon transmission can be promoted through elastic phonon channels to largely affect the TBC, even to the extent that the loss in the binding effect is overwhelmed. This makes a highly mismatched system a necessary condition for the bridging effect to overwhelm the binding effect, which is consistent with the superiority of CH 3 -SAM modification over SH-SAM modification observed only for the Cu/diamond interface. To further examine the mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Cu/diamond system (see Materials and Methods). The MD simulations capture the experimentally observed trend of the TBC in the two different SAM cases, where the TBC is higher for the CH 3 -SAM (131.2 MW/m2·K)–modified case than for the SH-SAM case (110.4 MW/m2·K). Using this system, we calculated the vDOSs of Cu, diamond, and the SAM (Fig. 4A). The vDOS of diamond exhibits high peaks at frequencies around 40 THz, totally deviating from that of Cu, whose cutoff frequency is approximately 8 THz. The vDOSs of the CH 3 -SAM and SH-SAM show a broad distribution (0 to 90 THz), where the vDOS overlap with that of diamond is notable for both kinds of SAM. This makes the temperature jumps at the SAM/diamond interface negligible. In contrast, a relatively large temperature jump occurs at the Cu/SAM interface (fig. S1), dominating the TBC of the entire interface. Therefore, the vDOS overlap of Cu and the SAM, which determines the number of elastic phonon channels at the interface, becomes the key factor of the TBC. Consequently, we mainly focus on the low-frequency range (~20 THz) covering the vibrational modes of both the SAM and Cu, where an evident difference in the vDOSs exists between the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM. For the CH 3 -SAM, the vDOS is higher in the range of frequency overlap with that of Cu (<8 THz), with a minor drop below 2 THz, which benefits the bridging effect. The vDOS of the SH-SAM decreases more rapidly with decreasing frequency, resulting in a smaller vDOS than that of the CH 3 -SAM below 8 THz, thus unfavorable vibrational matching with Cu and a weaker bridging effect. Here, the calculated magnitude of the difference in vDOS between CH 3 -SAM and SH-SAM is somewhat smaller than the actual experiment judging from the difference in TBC (~20%), as shown in Fig. 4B, being smaller than that of the experiments (twofold). This is understandable considering that the vDOSs of SH-SAM and TBC of CH 3 -SAM are highly sensitive to the force fields of the MD simulations as shown in Fig. 4B and fig. S2, respectively, which will be discussed further later. Therefore, here, we intend to use the MD simulations only to qualitatively reproduce the experiment and explain the roles of the bridging and binding effects. Fig. 4 MD simulation. (A) vDOSs of copper, SAM, and diamond. (B) TBC and (C) corresponding spectral interfacial thermal conductance (in the representative one- and threefold relative interfacial adhesion strength cases) of CH 3 -SAM– and SH-SAM–modified copper/diamond systems obtained by artificially controlling the relative interfacial adhesion strength to 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 times. This difference in vDOS between the SH-SAM and CH 3 -SAM can be explained by the low-frequency vibrational modes of the SAM, whose frequencies are roughly proportional to k m (15). Here, m is the effective atomic mass of SAM molecules, and k is the effective force constant of the entire SAM layer considering it as a spring system connecting Cu and diamond (the model is concretely discussed in the Supplementary Materials). Because both ends of the SH-SAM chain molecules are anchored through strong covalent bonds, the effective force constant k is large. In contrast, the CH 3 -SAM molecules are covalently bonded only on a single side (the other side experiences the weak vdWs force interaction), making the effective force constant k smaller. Therefore, as the masses of these two kinds of SAM are similar (13% difference), the smaller effective force constant in the case of the CH 3 -SAM can induce lower vibrational frequencies, hence resulting in a higher bridging effect. This idea was further verified by the change of vDOS through artificially changing the bonding strength of Cu─S indicated by the coefficient of the harmonic bond between Cu and S in the MD simulation. By substantially increasing or decreasing this bonding strength (by 0.1 and 10 times), we observed a clear downshift of the low-frequency vibrational modes with increasing bonding strength between the SAM and Cu (fig. S2A). This result indicates the thought-provoking fact that strong interfacial adhesion inhibits heat conduction by weakening the bridging effect at the interface, giving rise to an unexpected trade-off between the binding and bridging effects. Note here that the vDOS variation when artificially changing the interaction of CH 3 -SAM and Cu is negligibly small (fig. S2B). The spring model introduced above can also explain the difference of vDOS variation between the CH 3 -SAM and SH-SAM (discussed in the Supplementary Materials). This result can further verify the effectiveness of the spring model in describing the vibrational frequency of SAM.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf8197/F1.large.jpg,"['weaker', 'fig', 'bonding', 'thermal', 'larger', 'highly', 'mismatched', 'bridging', 'ch', 'conductance', 'interfaces', 'vibrational', 'shsam', 'effect', 'tbc', 'cu', 'interface', 'sam']", 
50,50,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Three-dimensional microscale hanging drop arrays with geometric control for drug screening and live tissue imaging - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabc1323,"Existing three-dimensional (3D) culture techniques are limited by trade-offs between throughput, capacity for high-resolution imaging in living state, and geometric control. Here, we introduce a modular microscale hanging drop culture where simple design elements allow high replicates for drug screening, direct on-chip real-time or high-resolution confocal microscopy, and geometric control in 3D. Thousands of spheroids can be formed on our microchip in a single step and without any selective pressure from specific matrices. Microchip cultures from human LN229 glioblastoma and patient-derived mouse xenograft cells retained genomic alterations of originating tumors based on mate pair sequencing. We measured response to drugs over time with real-time microscopy on-chip. Last, by engineering droplets to form predetermined geometric shapes, we were able to manipulate the geometry of cultured cell masses. These outcomes can enable broad applications in advancing personalized medicine for cancer and drug discovery, tissue engineering, and stem cell research.

Furthermore, geometric control in a 3D culture platform can be advantageous because tissue structures including size and shape facilitate the physiological function of the tissue by allowing cells and their microenvironment to exchange chemical, electrical, and mechanical cues ( 3 , 4 , 24 – 33 ). Engineering of tissues with tuneable morphologies has been studied in 3D culture techniques such as bioprinting and micropatterning, but these techniques are known to cause high shear stress on cells during seeding ( 3 , 34 ). Guided assembly using magnetic levitation and nanoparticles has also been used to demonstrate the formation of annular ring structures using human GBM cells ( 17 ). However, the formed structures in this platform are unable to retain shape during cellular compaction, and pretreatment with magnetic beads at high concentrations adds complexity and potential toxicity ( 7 ). In this paper using human GBM cells, we demonstrate the use of hanging drop culture for geometric control of 3D cultured structures. Because our platform uses a microchip with etched channels, we fabricated a chip with circular, square, and triangular annular wells, which allowed the media droplet shape to conform to the shape of channel cavity because of capillary forces. Using this approach, we were able to generate dense and continuous annular circle, square, and triangle 3D shapes ranging in sizes from a few hundred micrometers to several millimeters. We believe that our platform will open up applications of hanging drop platform where different cell types can be cocultured in 3D on-chip to generate self-assembled and self-organized tissues with the salient in vivo–like features naturally formed via cell-cell interactions.

To address these challenges, we introduce a modular microchip hanging drop platform that can be used for drug screening, live imaging, and geometric control applications. In our platform, the individual droplets with cells are held by capillary forces in nanoliter-sized wells. For drug screening applications, the miniaturized and optimized culture conditions allow one cell seeding step to produce an array of hundreds to thousands of uniform tumor spheroids with diameter in the hundreds of micrometers (and, hence, we use the term “microcancers” or “microcancer spheroids”).We have shown that microcancer size and volume can be controlled and easily varied through both chip design and cell seeding densities. Formed spheroids were characterized in real time through upright fluorescence microscopy for tumor spheroid formation, cell death, and other processes. We validate this technique with LN229 human glioblastoma (GBM) cells and PDX glioblastoma cells, also demonstrating compatibility with automated live cell imaging showing formation of the microcancers. We also show capability to perform high-resolution confocal analysis to study the expression of protein markers directly on-chip without the need for extraction of the tumor spheroids. To demonstrate that our platform does not bias tumor evolution by putting selective pressure, we show, through the use of mate pair sequencing, a complete overlap in chromosomal rearrangement (CR) events between the PDX and the corresponding microcancers grown in our platform. As one of the main applications of the technology, we show direct drug testing on LN229 and PDX GBM tumor spheroids formed in our platform as characterized by real-time optical microscopy. Our nanodroplet culture model allows simultaneous testing of hundreds to thousands of 3D microcancer cultures in real time where each microcancer captures the salient characteristics of the tumor. Because of the small size of the platform, smaller biopsies can be tested with many drugs. Drug testing can be done in days, and the system also allows for sequential (staggered time point) drug testing. Therefore, this system makes it possible to rapidly test many drugs in real time even from clinical scenarios where only small biopsies are available.

A special consideration is that all proliferative models of drug testing, including 2D, 3D organoids, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, are subject to selective pressure and tumor evolution ( 20 , 21 ). Because the tumor microenvironment has been increasingly recognized as a key contributor to cancer progression and resistance to therapy, removing selective pressure by optimizing culture conditions to maintain the tumor microenvironment are essential for accurate prediction of response to treatment. Because of its rapid reaggregation of dispersed tumor cells, ideally suited for this is the hanging drop technique where inverted 20- to 40-μl droplets containing cells held by capillary forces form tumor spheroids, and commercial hanging drop plates in 96- and 384-well formats are now available ( 18 , 22 , 23 ). However, the current technology for performing hanging drop cultures is very laborious and low throughput and requires the disruption of culture conditions and transfer of formed spheroids into a secondary plate for end point analysis. The current techniques are not compatible with direct live microscopy-based characterizations and also suffer from elevated osmolarity caused by evaporation of media from the droplets ( 7 ), which also limits the time for growth and analysis.

Cell culture has been extensively applied in drug discovery, tissue engineering, and stem cell research ( 1 – 6 ). However, conventional two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cultures do not replicate the important features of 3D conditions, and much work has been done to elucidate the differences in cellular morphology, behavior, and molecular signaling between the classic cell monolayer approaches and analogous 3D cultures ( 1 , 2 ). 3D culture systems offer the unique opportunity to grow cells such that the resulting tissues acquire morphological and cellular characteristics relevant to in vivo conditions ( 7 – 15 ). Although several 3D culture techniques exist that deploy protein-based or synthetic polymer–based gel environments ( 7 ), rotation-based bioreactors ( 16 ), magnetic levitation ( 17 ), and hanging drop techniques ( 18 , 19 ), their broad practical application has been limited because of several reasons ( 1 ). Matrix and hydrogel-based techniques are often used to generate organotypic cultures from isolated stem cells or tumor-initiating cells. These organotypic cultures have increasingly become an invaluable tool in cancer biology as these matrices allow more control over the cell environment and signaling during culture. However, it should be noted that they also require cell proliferation and matrix engineering, as the scaffolds can introduce unpredictable cell-polymer interactions that influence and bias downstream applications of the organoids ( 1 ). Aggregation techniques such as magnetic levitation using nanoparticles to cause spheroid formation have demonstrated a limited number of spheroids and require cells to be pretreated with magnetic beads at high concentrations adding complexity and potential toxicity ( 7 ).

RESULTS

Experimental design We fabricated several microchip designs containing an array of silicon microwells of varying dimensions etched to a depth of 120 μm. The silicon surface was oxidized after the formation of the wells. Figure 1A shows the platform design and schematic of on-chip cell seeding protocol. The entire chip is less than the size of a quarter, and Fig. 1B shows two chip designs, one with an array of 900 microwells with a constant well size of 300 μm (side length of well) and the other with a well size gradient in which the well side lengths were varied from 100 to 500 μm. This design can easily be scaled to a larger size and a higher number of individual wells. The spacing between each well was kept at 20 μm. Each well in this array will downstream act as an isolated incubation chamber for 3D hanging drop cell culture. A detachable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well (or well array) was assembled on top of the silicon chip to select a subset of the silicon wells to customize the number of microcancers required. The temporary adhesion between the PDMS well and the chip surface forms a removable reservoir over the chip where the cell solution can be loaded and centrifuged. The cell seeding protocol began by first making the surface of the chips hydrophilic by exposing to oxygen plasma for 3 min at 300 W (Fig. 1A, 1). This step serves two goals. First, the hydrophilicity helps in homogeneous cell seeding by allowing easy access of media and cell solution inside the wells, and, second, it makes the chip surface and environment sterile for downstream culture. After making the chip hydrophilic, the cell solution is loaded in the PDMS reservoir, and the cells centrifuged at 200g for 2 min. The centrifugation step brings down the cells into the underlying wells and loads the entire array in a single step (Fig. 1A, 2 and 3). Once the cell loading is complete, the PDMS reservoir is removed and the individual microwells are partitioned using mineral oil and shear force from air or oil, as described in our previous work (35) (Fig. 1A, 4). This step removes well-well connections and forms individual droplets in wells. Last, the chip was inverted in mineral oil in the cell culture chamber to create inverted hanging drops, thus increasing cell-cell interactions and resulting in the tumor spheroid formation (Fig. 1A, 5 and 6). The volume of each well is kept constant by the mineral oil layer that serves as an evaporation barrier allowing culture for an extended period. No additional surface coatings or gel formulations are needed, which might put selective pressure on tumor evolution.

Cell culture on chip and microcancer size control To evaluate our platform’s ability to form and culture microcancer spheroids on chip of different sizes, we first seeded LN229 cells on the well size gradient chip and examined the survival profiles of the formed microcancers over time. A real-time imaging compatible cell death indicator green dye (CellTox, Promega) and a cell membrane staining red dye (PKH, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the media to quantify cell death in the microcancer tumor volume with time. Tile and z-stack imaging was performed for each day of culture to volumetrically map the green and red volumes within a microwell. Volumetric mapping of the green and red dyes was performed on Imaris software, and final individual well tracking was performed using MATLAB. The details of analyses are in Materials and Methods and fig. S1. The cell death in each well was normalized to the microcancer volume in that same well to account for well-to-well variations in cell numbers. Figure 1C shows a fluorescence microscope image of a high-throughput culture of LN229 human glioblastoma microcancers after 1 day of culture after cell seeding on the well size gradient chip. Loading a solution of cell density at 1.87 million cells/ml resulted in a range of microcancer sizes from 7.6 nl for 500-μm wells to 0.36 nl for 100-μm wells. Details on cell seeding can be found in Materials and Methods. Figure 1D shows the volumetric mapping of spheroids seen in the white box in Fig. 1C. One of each microcancer size has been highlighted in yellow. Three microcancers of each size were analyzed for microcancer volume and cell death. In Fig. 1E, we see a linear relationship of well size to microcancer volume with an r2 value of 0.97. In addition, in current 3D culture approaches, variations in spheroid sizes and morphology leads to challenges in creating standard culture and assay protocols, as well as in analyzing data (36). Our data show that the size of spheroids can be well controlled. Over the 3 days of culture, the 100-μm spheroids (smallest size) remain relatively constant in size with an average volume increase of about 1.5%. In contrast, the 500-μm spheroids show an average volume increase of 12.5% over 3 days of culture. As seen in Fig. 1F, cell death remains below 13% over the 3 days of culture independent of the spheroid size. Being able to control and test a range of spheroid sizes in a high-throughput manner will be useful in cancer drug screening and other biological applications (36–38). Microcancer size can also be controlled in our platform for a constant well size by varying the seeding cell density. The box-and-whiskers plot (n = 12) of the microcancer volume and cell death for varying cell numbers per well over 3 days of culture for LN229 human glioblastoma cells cultured in 300-μm well array is shown in fig. S2. We found that 300 cells per well did not seem to aggregate as well as the other higher cell numbers per well, evidenced by a higher range of volumes on day 1. Note that for 1000 cells per well, the microcancer spheroid volume is ~4 nl on day 1, which is still less than 50% of the microwell volume (10.8 nl), leaving additional volume for further cell growth. Next, to demonstrate the ability to culture primary tumor cells on our platform, we loaded 300-μm well array with cells harvested from GBM8 PDXs implanted in mouse brain (Fig. 2, A to D). The harvest cells from the xenograft represented the cellular diversity of the PDX brain tumor (39). Figure 2 (E and F) shows the box-and-whiskers plot (n = 12) of GBM8 microcancer volume and cell death for varying PDX cell numbers cultured on chip for 3 days. For PDX cells, 300 cells per well formed dense spheroids as opposed to their LN229 cell line counterpart. Also, the PDX spheroids had lower day 1 volumes for 700 (~1.5 nl) and 1000 cells (~2 nl) per well compared to their LN229 cell line counterparts (3.5 and 3.75 nl, respectively). These differences likely reflect differential expression of adhesion receptors and increased compaction of cells in the PDX tumor. It is important to note that our technique can optically track individual wells for changes in cell death or microcancer volume over time and can automatically normalize for any variations in cell loading process. Figures S3 and S4 show individual traces of volume and cell death versus time for LN229 and PDX microcancer spheroids, respectively. Fig. 2 On-chip PDX culture.

Assessment of cellular identity and diversity of microcancers (n = 7653) was evaluated through single-cell RNA sequencing. (I) Distributions of UMI counts in GEM cells. Summed UMI counts from mouse genes (top) and human genes (bottom). (J) Distributions of numbers of genes with >1 UMI in each GEM cell.

Each dot represents the transcriptome of a single cell from dissociated microcancers. (K) and (L) show the single-cell gene expression of key markers for gliomas and glioma stem cells. Scale bars represent z-test–normalized gene counts.

Harvesting 3D cultures from chip for genomic analysis Because our system is in an open format, we can also readily harvest the formed 3D cultures from the chip. To do this, we first submerged the chip in 1 ml of media to remove the residual oil layer from the top of the array in a 12-well culture. Then, the 3D cultures are removed directly by pipetting and aspirating the volume from the chip.

Mate pair sequencing demonstrates high degree of relatedness between the PDX and 3D cultures To further explore the biological attributes afforded by our platform and to show that our culture platform does not bias tumor evolution by putting selective pressure, we harvested PDX microcancers after 3 days of culture on chip and performed genomic analysis on microcancers and the PDX source for comparison. Figure 2 (G and H) shows the genome plots of data merged from three independent 3D experiments from our platform. Each line on the plot represents a CR event supported by at least six sequencing fragments chosen as threshold. These plots show high degree of similarity. Significantly, over 60% (38 of 63) of all CRs were shared between the two samples. However, it should be noted that for the CR events that appeared to be unique to one sample, we could find sequencing fragments corresponding to the same event in the 3D cultures but at lower than threshold levels. Hence, we can conclude that there was a complete overlap in CR events between the two samples, suggesting high degree of relatedness between the PDX and the 3D cultures.

Single-cell RNA sequencing shows cell diversity in PDX microcancers cultured on our platform To thoroughly analyze the phenotypical composition of the microcancers grown on chip, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on microcancers extracted from three separate chips after 3 days of culture. Details on library preparation and sequencing can be found in Materials and Methods. To determine the ratio of mouse to human cells within our cell clusters, we looked at both total UMI counts and total numbers of genes detected. Across our three libraries, only 86 of 10,300 gel bead emulsion (GEM) cells had mouse UMI counts > human UMI (Unique Molecular Identifier) counts, suggesting a very low percentage of mouse cells in our samples. In addition, the distributions of mouse UMIs in all GEM cells were much lower than most human UMIs (median UMIs: mouse = 62 and human = 28,250; Fig. 2I). We also looked at the number of mouse and human genes with at least 1 UMI per GEM cell (Fig. 2J). There is a much bigger separation between mouse and human, with only 1.1% of GEM cells having >64 mouse genes detected (log 2 scale = 6) but 99.9% of GEM cells having >64 human genes detected. Therefore, the true number of mouse cells in our samples is on the order of 1 to 2%. We then discarded the mouse genes and used R v4.0.3 package Seurat v3.2.1 to do further quality-based cell filtering, normalization, principal components analysis, and, last, a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plot of the three combined chips (final cell n = 7653; details in Materials and Methods). Projections of select genes confirmed high expression of critical markers related to glioblastoma (Fig. 2K). GBM8 cells exhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification and express ATRX. Consistent with this, we confirmed abundant expression of both EGFR and ATRX. Furthermore, localization in the expression profile of a known neurogenesis and glioma stem cell regulator, ASPM; a marker of astrocytic lineage, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); a neural progenitor marker often associated with glioma stem cells, NES (nerolidol synthase); along with the absence of expression of the mature neuron marker RBFOX3 (RNA Binding Fox-1 Homolog), indicates the presence of heterogeneous cell populations within the GBM8 microcancers, including both progenitor and more differentiated cell populations. (Fig. 2L).

On-chip live cell imaging of microcancer formation To observe the microcancer formation in real time, we performed automated live-cell fluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope. Figure 3A and movie S1 show the time-lapsed images over 72 hours from a live cell imaging setup shown in fig. S5A. We tracked four cell clusters initially located at the well periphery for three wells and plotted the change in the 2D projected distance between these regions over time (Fig. 3, B to D, and fig. S5, B and C). The rate of aggregation of cells was slower for the first 9 hours after seeding as seen in Fig. 3D possibly because of the time it takes to reexpress adhesion molecules following trypsinization or for the secretion of soluble factors that enhance cell-cell adhesion. Separate small local cell aggregates form initially at different locations within a well, followed by joining of these aggregates over time, and, last, movement of these aggregates toward the center of the well to form the final microcancer spheroid. Once the formation was complete in 24 hours, the microcancers maintained their shape and integrity for the next 48 hours of the experiment. This imaging capability can extend the applications of our platform to a range of studies of spheroid, organoid, and acini formation in microenvironments and various tissue-on-a-chip applications. Fig. 3 Capturing real-time microcancer spheroid formation with live cell imaging on an inverted microscope and molecular characterizations of spheroids in microwell array.

Distance between each z-stack slice is 10 μm (scale bar, 20 μm) (G).

Morphological and molecular characterization We also performed morphological analysis of these 3D spheroids using scanning electron microscopy to reveal the architectural integrity of these structures (fig. S6). It is important to note that the samples could be directly fixed and imaged on chip without the need for any extraction. We characterized the spheroids formed in our platform, both structurally and molecularly, to show their similarity with in vivo tumor characteristics and hence propose their utility as in vitro cancer models for drug screening in glioblastoma. We cultured human glioblastoma cell (LN229) and PDX microcancers on chip for 3 days and then imaged them using a high-resolution confocal microscope directly on chip after fixing and staining the microcancers. We evaluated the expression of N-cadherin, a transmembrane protein that mediates cell-cell contact through homotypic cell adhesion. Consistent with reported cellular localization in GBM, other 3D cultures, and xenograft models (17, 40), we observed N-cadherin expression both in the membrane at areas of cell-cell contact and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, E to G). This is in contrast with 2D cultures in which N-cadherin expression was found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus but absent from the membrane (17, 40). Figure S7 (A and B) shows confocal images of LN229 tumor spheroids with high N-cadherin expression at the cell junctions and cytoplasm within 1 day of culture on-chip. Figure S7 (C and G) shows a large confocal tile of an array of tumor spheroids on chip and high-resolution confocal analysis of individual tumor spheroids, and fig. S8 shows a split view of confocal z-stack of a PDX microcancer. These results demonstrate the versatility of our platform to perform high-throughput and high-resolution protein expression analysis to elucidate and study heterogeneity in the 3D cultures directly on chip. The high-resolution confocal analysis presented above was performed directly on chip without the need to extract the 3D cultures. This feature allows users to select and analyze specific microcancers on the basis of specific criteria and to track individual microcancers over the course of analysis. This is important when heterogeneity within the microcancers that originated from the same patient-derived tumor cell suspension could be expected because of tumor heterogeneity or because of subsampling of different cell populations. The tracking is not possible in prior techniques, which require users to extract the 3D cultures in bulk and analyze them downstream. This direct on-chip characterization can be even more important for primary cell cultures, studies on acini, lumen formation, etc., where 3D structures can be very fragile and break upon shear stress from pipetting and handling. In summary, we show direct compatibility of our platform with several forms of high-resolution optical characterization techniques.

Application: Drug testing directly on chip We next evaluated the possibility of drug testing directly on our platform by taking real-time measurements of response to drugs, as opposed to the current hanging drop methods used to extract the formed tumor spheroids and then performing an end point–only analysis in a separate well plate (41). We chose dasatinib for drug testing and introduced it after 3 days of culture in the chip. Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has previously been shown to reduce cell viability in several conventional and PDX GBM cell lines, including LN229 (42, 43). The process for introducing the drugs on chip is as follows. The chip was kept upright inside mineral oil and centrifuged briefly to bring down the spheroids. Next, an appropriate volume of media with drugs is loaded on chip through oil and incubated for 30 min to reach a homogeneous concentration. It is important to note that in the entire process of media exchange or drug loading, the microcancers are always immersed in culture media held inside the wells with capillary forces and never physically come in contact with oil. The volume of drugs loaded depends on the number of spheroids being cultured or wells filled with media on chip, which, in turn, are defined by the size and numbers of PDMS reservoirs initially used for cell seeding. The volume of media with drugs added is usually five times the volume of wells containing spheroids. The concentration of the drug is increased by an appropriate factor to account for the media without drugs already present in wells, resulting in the desired final drug concentration in the wells after diffusion. The chip was partitioned as before by using oil, inverted, and daily measurements of green and red fluorescence were taken. It is of note that this process can be used to periodically change media on chip for long-term 3D culture. Figure S9A shows a timeline of drug testing experiments on chip. Figure 4A and figure S9 (B to E) show the results of drug testing for LN229 microcancer spheroids. Figure 4A shows alternate day maximum projection images for concentrations of 10 μM (top), 100 nM (middle), and no drug control (bottom). Figure S9 (B to E) shows the same for concentrations of 1 μM, 10, 1 nM, and 100pM of dasatinib drug, respectively. Figure 4 (B and C) show the box-and-whiskers plots (n = 12) of tumor spheroid volume and normalized cell death. It can be observed that for higher concentrations of drugs (10, 1 μM, and 100 nM), the cell death starts to increase as soon as 4 days after culture with drugs (day 7 overall) compared to lower drug concentrations and the no drug control. The median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value for dasatinib on LN229 microcancers was found to be 95.9 nM as measured on day 9, which is within the reported range found by others (Fig. 4D) (44, 45). Because of excessive cell death and destruction of spheroids for these high drug concentrations, the entire well starts to appear green in days 7 to 9, and hence, the overall green volume captured exceeds the spheroid volume (red), and the normalization results in values greater than 1. We also performed drug testing on PDX microcancers. Figure 4E shows alternate day maximum projection images of drug administered PDX spheroids for concentrations 10 μM (top), 100 nM (middle), and no drug control (bottom), and fig. S10 (A to D) shows the same for concentrations of 1 μM, 10, 1 nM, and 100pM of dasatinib drug, respectively. Figure 4 (F and G) show the box-and-whiskers plot (n = 12) of PDX microcancer volume and normalized cell death. The IC 50 value for dasatinib on PDX microcancers was found to be 13.8 nM as measured on day 9, which is very similar to what has been previously observed (43) (Fig. 4H). However, the overall response to dasatinib in terms of normalized cell death was significantly lower for PDX, as the PDX microcancers overall remained intact and viable even for higher drug concentrations. This result is in agreement with the inability of dasatinib to affect tumor growth in GBM8 PDX in vivo, although it is highly effective in 2D culture (43). Figures S11 and S12 show individual traces of volume and cell death as response to drug over time for 12 LN229 and PDX microcancer spheroids, respectively. Fig. 4 On-chip LN229 and PDX drug testing. (A and E) Maximum projections of 12-well cultures of LN229 spheroids (A) and PDX spheroids (E) for days 1 to 9 after cell seeding (initial cell concentration: 500 cells per well).

For negative control, only media and CellTox green dye were added. Each well has a side length of 300 μm (for scale).

(D and H) The IC 50 value for LN229 spheroids (D) and PDX spheroids (H) was calculated to be 95.9 and 13.8 nM, respectively, as measured on day 9.

51,51,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Direct detection of 5-MeV protons by flexible organic thin-film devices - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabf4462,"The direct detection of 5-MeV protons by flexible organic detectors based on thin films is here demonstrated. The organic devices act as a solid-state detector, in which the energy released by the protons within the active layer of the sensor is converted into an electrical current. These sensors can quantitatively and reliably measure the dose of protons impinging on the sensor both in real time and in integration mode. This study shows how to detect and exploit the energy absorbed both by the organic semiconducting layer and by the plastic substrate, allowing to extrapolate information on the present and past irradiation of the detector. The measured sensitivity, S = (5.15 ± 0.13) pC Gy −1 , and limit of detection, LOD = (30 ± 6) cGy s −1 , of the here proposed detectors assess their efficacy and their potential as proton dosimeters in several fields of application, such as in medical proton therapy.

In this work, the first study on responsivity of organic semiconductor detectors to proton beams is presented. Both the real-time mode and the integration-mode response of the sensors are described, and the process of interaction between the charged particles and the active layer of the detector is discussed.

Organic semiconductors have already been demonstrated to be reliable detectors for ionizing radiation, but they could offer also appealing properties for proton beam monitoring. They can be processed and deposited at low temperature (<150°C) by solution, leading the possibility to realize millimeter pixels of the order of mm 2 onto flexible and large-area substrates. Moreover, the facts that they do not require expensive fabrication setups and that they are reusable make them a potential low-cost, industrially scalable sensing system. Last, a crucial point for the dosimetry application is the fact that they are water tissue equivalent in terms of absorption and, consequently, the calibration of the sensor is not needed.

To date, there is no example of organic semiconductor detectors used as proton beam dose monitoring systems. Organic semiconductors have been successfully used for the realization of efficient flexible x-ray dosimeters ( 15 – 20 ), and only few papers report a preliminary test with polymeric semiconducting sheets for the detection of α particles ( 20 – 23 ) and more recently for the detection of thermal neutrons ( 24 ).

Plastic scintillators are also used for beam diagnostics. In particular, scintillating fibers are used for real-time dose delivery and beam imaging with very good results ( 12 , 13 ). Drawbacks for this approach are mainly related to the light detection, which has to be very sensitive to obtain reliable results. Therefore, photomultiplier tubes or silicon photomultipliers with a suitable readout chain have to be coupled to the fibers. Moreover, a dose calibration procedure requires accurate knowledge of the scintillation properties, namely, of the ionization quenching factor, and sometimes, the simultaneous detection with different scintillators is needed for achieving accurate measurements ( 14 ). Last, imaging with 1-mm resolution is a difficult task to obtain near the target, because arrays of fibers have to be assembled with a cumbersome setup. Moreover, the transmissivity of scintillating plastic fibers can be lowered by bending or mechanical stress due to the insertion in the setup or to the adjustment on the target, resulting in calibration errors.

Silicon microstrip detectors have been used for ion beam imaging with very good temporal and spatial resolution. However, high doses are required for a good image quality and noise can affect the analysis of the proton energy. More complex structures, like CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) pixelated detectors, present low radiation hardness for daily use, together with the complexity of the readout procedure. Last, it has to be taken into account that all silicon-based detectors cannot be used for flexible systems adhering to the skin or to curved surfaces. An accurate review on the different detection methods has been realized by Seco et al. ( 3 ).

Suitable modern detectors are silicon-based MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor), silicon strips, and plastic scintillators. MOSFET detectors have been studied for the detection of the dose delivered both on skin and on rectal walls with good results ( 9 , 11 ). The main drawback is the need for accurate calibration procedures, because the detectors are intrinsically nonwater equivalent with an energy-dependent response. Moreover, MOSFET fabrication requires a clean room and high-level technology, and to date, no large-area detectors for imaging applications are in production. Last, the limited radiation hardness of MOSFETs leads to continuous tests for their reliability and to expensive substitution procedures.

A few types of detectors can reliably provide this information, but many are not suitable for the listed applications. For instance, dosimeters based on thermoluminescence, optical stimulated luminescence, and track measurements cannot be used for real-time monitoring. On the other side, calorimeters, ionization chambers, and gas detectors are very accurate but interfere with the beam parameters because they block the beam or are too bulky.

In proton therapy, a detector has to satisfy two major requirements. The first one is the capability to detect dose rate and position of the beam in real time. This is mandatory to have the control of the delivered dose if the beam position changes with respect to the patient. Because the needed accuracy for the beam position is about 1 mm, small involuntary movements, even due to respiration, can affect the treatment effectiveness ( 6 ). The second issue is the monitoring of the dose on healthy tissues. It is well known that the skin receives high doses during the irradiation treatment of various types of cancers (i.e., breast cancer), giving rise to long-term side effects ( 7 ). For instance, alopecia is a high risk in patients where brain tumors are treated with scanning proton beams ( 8 ). Another severe collateral effect involves the dose delivered to the rectal wall during prostate treatments, for which dose monitoring methods with detectors inserted into rectal balloons have been studied ( 9 , 10 ). In all these cases, detectors have to be in contact with the patient to record the dose in real time.

The development of detectors for protons and heavy particles is a long-lasting research topic not only for fundamental applications but also, more recently, for monitoring energy and flow of particles in ion beam applications. For instance, novel beam extraction technologies, like laser-driven accelerators, require fast and reliable systems for monitoring the beam quality ( 1 ). However, the most demanding application of ion beams, for which accurate measurements are increasingly needed, is hadron therapy of cancer. In this application field, ion beams, mostly proton beams, are used for the controlled treatment of cancer by focusing them onto small volumes to avoid the spreading of the radiation to healthy tissues ( 2 ). The effectiveness of the treatment is enhanced by tuning the beam both in intensity and in position to irradiate the tumor in a controlled way. For this reason, there is an increasing demand of systems optimized for the accurate recording and mapping of the dose delivered during a treatment plan ( 3 ). Besides this aspect, the next frontier for medical applications of proton beams is proton tomography, where high-energy (230 to 250 MeV) proton beams are used through the patient ( 4 , 5 ).

RESULTS

The organic detectors we fabricated and tested are depicted in Fig. 1A. The devices have a photoconductor structure where the active semiconducting layer is an organic thin film (150 nm thick) of microcrystalline bis(triisopropylgermylethynyl)-pentacene (hereafter TIPGe-Pn), deposited by drop casting onto two interdigitated gold electrodes in coplanar architecture (Fig. 1A) (25). We deposited gold electrodes by thermal evaporation on a 125-μm-thick plastic substrate [i.e., polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)], ensuring the mechanical flexibility of the system. In particular, we fabricated and tested samples with the same channel length (i.e., the distance between the fingers of the electrodes) of L = 30 μm and two different width, i.e., W = 205.5 mm (W/L = 6850) and W = 45 mm (W/L = 1500).

TIPGe-Pn is an organic small molecule similar to bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene molecule (TIPS-Pn) by substituting the two silicon atoms with two germanium atoms (26, 27). The strong packing of the organic units and the oriented alignment of the microcrystalline structures (Fig. 1B) ensure efficient charge transport within the semiconducting layer. TIPGe-Pn–based detectors have been demonstrated to enhance the charge carrier mobility and the x-ray sensitivity with respect to TIPS-Pn–based counterparts (15, 28). All fabrication steps to implement these detectors are scalable to large-area, low-temperature (<180°C) compatible processes, thus allowing to obtain large-area, thin, and flexible detectors (Fig. 1C).

The detector response under proton irradiation was tested using a 5-MeV beam provided by the 3 MV Tandetron accelerator of the LABEC ion beam center (Laboratory of Nuclear Techniques for the Environment and Cultural Heritage, INFN Firenze, Italy). Proton beam currents used in this work are typically in the 1- to 100-pA range. The weak intensity of the beam is monitored and quantitatively measured using a rotating chopper (29), placed between the silicon nitride window and the sample, that intercepts the beam. Although the energy of ion therapy beams is commonly above 70 MeV, the proton energy tested in this work is of the order of the end-of-range values, in particular of the energies of scattered protons reaching internal healthy tissues surrounding the target.

Figure 2A depicts the entire experimental setup used to access the proton detection of the here reported sensing system. We enclosed the devices in a box, keeping the detector in the dark during the measurements, with a small aperture to let the proton beam in. We centered the sensor in front of the extracted proton beam (Fig. 2B). To determine the actual energy of the protons impinging onto the 150-nm-thick organic layer, the energy lost by the protons passing through the several layers interposed between the beam and the sensor (see Materials and Methods) has to be calculated. After passing through these layers, protons lose about 390 keV, as calculated with the stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM) Monte Carlo code (30). Figure 2C reports the SRIM simulation of the linear energy transfer (LET) of each proton in the TIPGe film and in the PEN substrate. As can be observed, the total released energy, given by the integral of the curves, in the plastic substrate is much higher than the one deposited in the organic semiconductor due to the substantially different layer thicknesses. In particular, the energy lost by each proton within the TIPGe-Pn layer is, on average, 1.55 keV, while the energy absorbed by the plastic substrate is about 1590 keV. This difference can be effectively exploited to implement a proton detector able to simultaneously operate both in real-time mode (exploiting the absorption of the organic thin film) and in integration mode (based on the absorption within the plastic substrate), as detailed in the following.

Fig. 2 The 5-MeV proton irradiation setup. (A) The detectors have been irradiated by 5-MeV protons at the LABEC center using an extracted beam line and tuning the fluences of protons in the range [3.5 × 109 to 8.7 × 1011] H+ cm−2.

(B) During the measurements, the devices were closed in a box, which keeps the organic detector in the dark. The protons passed through a 14-μm-thick Al window and 18 mm of air before impinging onto the active layer of the detector. (C) Simulated curve of the energy released by the proton beam in each layer.

During the irradiation, the sensors were polarized at low voltages (<1 V) to collect the charges generated by anelastic interactions of protons with the electrons of the semiconducting layer. The detector performance has been tested under consecutive ON/OFF cycles of exposure to 5-MeV proton beam, tuning the fluence of particles impinging onto the devices in the range between 3.5 × 109 H+ cm−2 and 8.7 × 1011 H+ cm−2. The dynamic current response of the sensors is reported in Fig. 3 (A and B) , where the colored areas of the graphs represent the time windows of proton irradiation. We carried out the measurements by either keeping the exposure time constant (t = 10 s; Fig. 3A) or varying it between 10 and 30 s (Fig. 3B).

Fig. 3 Real-time radiation detection response by organ semiconducting thin films. (A and B) Current versus time response of the detectors irradiated by multiple ON/OFF cycles of protons tuning the incident fluences (3.5 × 109 to 9 × 1011 H+ cm−2). The detectors have been tested, keeping the exposure time constant t = 10 s (A) or varying it between 10 and 30 s (B). During the measurements, an electric field (applied bias <1 V) was imposed to the organic semiconducting layer. The time window of the irradiation is colored in the graphs, and the color intensity of the boxes indicates the intensity of the proton beam. (C) Highlight of dynamic response of the detector. The slow increase of the current indicates photoconductive gain effect. The current (ΔI) is calculated as the difference between maximum peak current and the baseline current before the irradiation. The integral of the plot (colored in pink) represents the total charge induced by the protons. (D) Plots of the collected charges in function of the total dose of protons for two different W/L. The black squares correspond to W/L = 1500, while the red circles represent W/L = 6850. In both cases, the graphs indicate a linear response of the detector in a wide range of fluences (40 Gy to 11 × 103 Gy).

Figure 3C zooms into one of the peaks reported in Fig. 3 (A and B), highlighting the typical curve of response to proton irradiation by the detector. The shadowed area indicates the total collected charges during the interval of exposure to the flux of protons. The small spikes during proton irradiation are due to the small metal plate of the chopper necessary for the accurate evaluation of the beam flux. As a result of the energy absorption from the impinging radiation, electron-hole pairs are generated within the organic semiconductor and the electrical current measured between the two electrodes increases by ΔI. When the beam is switched off, the current has an initial fast drop due to the recombination of the charges, followed by a slower decay. The dynamic of the induced current peak is a fingerprint for the detection of ionizing radiation by thin-film organic semiconductor-based sensors. As recently discussed (31, 32), the current induced in organic thin film following exposure to ionizing radiation is increased by an inner mechanism of amplification [i.e., the photoconductive gain effect (31)] mediated by trap states. In particular, for p-type semiconductor such as TIPGe-Pn, due to the presence of electron traps, the negative charges are suddenly trapped within the organic thin film, and to maintain the charge neutrality, additional holes are continuously injected inside the channel of the device, so each radiation-induced charge contributes more than one time to the total current. Thus, the current increase ΔI corresponds to the induced hole current amplified by a gain factor G, defined as the ratio between the recombination time (τ r ) of the trapped electrons and the transit time (τ t ) of the holes through the channel. These two characteristic times are described by Eqs. 1 and 2 τ t = L 2 μ V (1) τ r = α γ [ α · ln ( ρ 0 ρ X ) ] 1 ‐ γ γ (2)where L is the length of the channel, μ is the charge carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, α is the time scale of the trap states, γ is related to the distribution of the trap states, and ρ 0 and ρ X are the intrinsic and radiation-induced charge densities of the organic layer, respectively. These two characteristic times univocally describe the “rise” and “fall” shapes of the dynamic response of the sensor because they are intrinsically related to transport properties and to the density and energy distribution of the active traps, which determine the “real-time” detection process. According to this model, the proton-induced current can reach a saturation regime if the sensor is irradiated for a time, which exceeds a certain threshold voltage. In this case, a dynamic equilibrium between the generation and trapping of minority carriers and their recombination is reached, resulting in a plateau in proton-induced current during the exposure (see fig. S1).

Figure 3C shows how, after each exposure, the current does not return to the initial value, but it maintains an offset that depends on the absorbed total irradiation dose.

For each exposure cycle, the radiation dose absorbed by the sensor has been calculated by D = E abs × N prot ρ TIPG-Pn × Volume (3)where E abs is the simulated value of the energy released by each proton into the organic thin film obtained by multiplying the organic layer thickness and the LET value extracted from the SRIM simulation reported in Fig. 2C, N prot is the number of protons impinging onto the sensor and monitored by the rotating beam chopper described in Materials and Methods, ρ TIPG-Pn is the density of the organic layer formed by TIPGe-Pn molecules (1.233 g cm−3), and Volume is the active volume of the sensor, which has been calculated as the product of the organic layer thickness and the proton beam spot area that was centered and totally included onto the area of the sensor. We calculated the proton-induced charges collected during each exposure cycle as the integral of the induced current peaks (i.e., the colored shadow in Fig. 3C). Figure 3D reports the collected charges as a function of the total proton dose for four samples: two samples with W/L = 1500 (black dots) and two samples with W/L = 6850 (red dots). The response of all tested detectors is linear with increasing radiation dose in a wide range of doses between 40 Gy and 11 kGy. Different samples with equal geometry lay on the same fit line, assessing the reproducibility and the repeatability of the detection response. From the plots in Fig. 3D, we extracted the sensitivity of the detector (i.e., the induced charges collected per unit of absorbed dose) as the slope of the linear fitting curve, reaching the values of S W/L=1500 = (5.15 ± 0.13) pC Gy−1 and S W/L=6850 = (3.40 ± 0.18) pC Gy−1. The different responses achieved with the two geometries can be ascribed to the different electrical efficiency for the extraction/injection of the induced charges by the electrodes.

An important figure of merit for a detector is the minimum detectable dose, often indicated as limit of detection (LOD), that allows to envisage the potential exploitation of the detector for different applications. We calculated the LOD of the here presented sensors using the following equation LOD = 3 × RMS signal Sensitivity (4)where RMS signal is the root mean square of the current flowing in the device in dark condition and Sensitivity is the higher sensitivity obtained. By applying this definition, a LOD down to (30 ± 6) cGy s−1 has been estimated.

The linearity of the real-time response holds even after 28.5 kGy of proton irradiation, assessing the reliability and the radiation hardness of TIPGe-Pn–based detectors.

It is also noteworthy that, exploiting the inner amplification provided by the photoconductive gain mechanism, we can operate the detector at very low bias if compared with the typical voltages used for semiconductor nuclear detectors (i.e., tens/hundreds of volts). We choose low-bias operations as the best trade-off for this class of sensors for three different reasons. First, organic materials suffer from bias stress even at a few bias volts (33) (see fig. S2), and working at low voltages can improve the reliability and the stability of the sensor. Second, the low bias and the interdigitated architecture increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the detectors. Last, under the application point of view, this is a key aspect to achieve portable, light-weight, low-cost, even wearable technologies.

Up to now, we discussed the sensor’s detection mechanism in real-time mode, based on the interaction between the proton beam and the organic thin film. However, the persistent current turns to be reproducible and scales with the total absorbed dose. Hereafter, we discuss how to exploit the gradual baseline shift induced by multiple successive exposures, to implement an integration-mode operation, following the irradiation history of the sensor.

Figure 4A reports the current-voltage characteristics (I-V) of a TIPGe-Pn detector before and after proton irradiation, and after up to 3 months of storage in the dark. The increase of conductivity of the organic layer due to the interaction with the proton beam is evident. The conductivity raises from (1.93 ± 0.08) × 10−6 S m−1 to (36.4 ± 0.1) × 10−6 S m−1 after 66 nC of incident protons. The effect is reversible, and despite the long relaxation time, full recovery occurs after 3 months [conductivity of (1.88 ± 0.07) × 10−6 S m−1]. Looking closely at the typical dynamic response curve of the detector to proton irradiation (see Fig. 4B), the total proton irradiation–induced current can be considered composed of two different contributions. The first one is the real-time response as a result of energy released in the organic semiconductor layer and photoconductive gain effect. This has already been discussed before and called ΔI. The second contribution, here denoted as I 0 , represents the current baseline shift due to the fixed charges trapped in the plastic substrate after each proton beam exposure and depends on the irradiation history of the detector. In analogy to the procedure described above, we calculated the total induced charges (i.e., the integral of the green area highlighted in the dynamic curve of Fig. 4B) and the dose corresponding to each exposure (Fig. 4C). The integrated amount of charges generated in the substrate, responsible for the current baseline shift (and of its long relaxation time), is linearly dependent on the integrated dose of proton irradiation received by the detectors. From the linear fit of the curve reported in Fig. 4C, the sensitivity of the detector, here thus operating in an integration mode, results S = (6.97 ± 0.18) × 10−1 pC Gy−1. The generation of charges in polymeric foils following proton irradiation is an effect known in the literature (34–38) and is well justified in the here presented devices, fabricated onto a 125-μm-thick plastic substrate absorbing a consistent fraction of the proton energy (about 1590 keV per H+; Fig. 2C).

Fig. 4 Organic proton sensor operated in integration mode. (A) Current-voltage curves acquired before (black) the irradiation, after 2.5 × 1011 incident protons (42 nC, red line), after 4 × 1011 incident protons (66 nC, green line), and after 4 hours (blue line), 64 hours (light blue line), and 95 days (pink line and dots) of storage in the dark. The graph shows the increase of conductivity of the organic semiconducting layer due to the irradiation. (B) Dynamic curve (black line) of the current response of the detector to different fluences of incident protons [(4.5 × 10−11 to 6.6 × 10−11) H+ cm−2]. Two different contributions can be distinguished: ΔI (pink shadow) is the real-time response proportional to the dose (already described in Fig. 3), while I 0 (green shadow) represents the baseline shift due to the fixed charges trapped in the plastic substrate. (C) Linear increase of the total charge generated in the plastic substrate as a function of the integrated dose, which irradiates the sample. (D and E) Schematics of the detector integration-mode operation: the protons irradiating the sample generate charges in the polymeric foil with a very long relaxation time. These trapped negative charges induce an increase of the semiconductor conductivity, leading to higher source-drain current in the organic thin film. This effect is similar to what happens in an organic field effect transistor (OFET) structure, where the gate electrode is typically used to tune the current flowing between the source and drain electrodes. In this case, the irradiated polymeric substrate of the sensor acts as the bottom-gate electrode of an OFET structure, creating a gating effect proportional to the integrated dose of irradiating protons.

We suggest that these proton-induced charges, accumulated in the plastic substrate (Fig. 4D), act as a bottom-gate effect for the organic semiconductor layer, increasing its electrical conductivity. This effect can be assimilated to what occurs in a field effect transistor (Fig. 4E), where the gate electrode is used to tune the density of charges flowing in the thin channel at the semiconductor/dielectric interface, between the source and drain electrodes. Here, as the charges induced in the plastic substrate have a long lifetime (as assessed by the I-V curves; Fig. 4A), this gating effect adds up after each proton exposure, with a contribution proportional to the actual dose received, thus allowing to quantitatively monitor the irradiation history of the detector.

It is noteworthy that to collect and to exploit the information accumulated within the plastic substrate, the organic semiconducting layer and its interface with the substrate play an essential role, as they permit to transduce into a source-drain current the information stored in the static charges induced in the substrate by proton irradiation. While the organic devices on PEN foils show the integrative response that we described above, similar devices with organic layer deposited onto Corning glass slides do not follow the same behavior. Only the sensors on PEN present the “memory” effect, while for devices onto glass, the proton irradiation induces a nonlinear decrease of the current and does not allow to extract any information (fig. S3). This measurement confirms the crucial role of both the organic material and the substrate in the integrative response of the detector. In fact, proton irradiation effects and charge generation are less pronounced in glass (35).

We demonstrated the complete decoupling of the real-time detection response attributed to the organic semiconducting layer (and ruled by the photoconductive gain mechanism) from the integrative contribution due to the absorption of energy in the PEN substrate. The independence of these two distinct mechanisms of detection is demonstrated by the linearity of the generated charges and the total dose represented in Fig. 3D. Moreover, when considering any two real-time peaks obtained under the same proton fluence, they exactly overlap, demonstrating that, despite the different amount of charges induced in the substrate due to the different “history” of the detector, the organic semiconductor equally responds to the same fluence of protons. The two signals can thus be both reliably and effectively exploited to monitor the proton doses in an independent way (more details are shown in fig. S4).","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabf4462/F1.large.jpg,"['thinfilm', 'devices', 'dose', 'fig', 'current', 'organic', 'flexible', 'detector', 'irradiation', 'protons', 'detectors', 'direct', '5mev', 'detection', 'proton', 'beam']",

The bright spot at the right edge is a spurious feature due to a tracer particle stuck at the wall. Except for (F), the scale bars correspond to 5 μm.

As long as no H 2 O 2 is added to the solution (i.e., there is no chemical activity), the tracers display regular Brownian motion, with negligible out-of-plane fluctuations and no interaction (other than hard-core steric repulsion) is observed between the particles (see Fig. 1A , left). Upon addition of H 2 O 2 , i.e., once the chemical activity is turned on, it is observed that some of the stuck Janus particles detach and start moving along the glass slide, with the Pt cap at the back. However, many of the Janus particles remain stuck in configurations with the symmetry axis parallel or perpendicular to the glass slide. Consequently, each such experimental realization allows, in general, simultaneous observations of three situations involving a chemically active particle: immobile Janus particle (stuck to the wall) in an axis parallel or axis perpendicular to the wall configuration, and mobile Janus particle in a sliding state.

For an experiment, a drop of an aqueous suspension of tracers (of one size) is deposited onto a glass slide, on which Janus particles are adhered with their symmetry axis in various configurations (for details, see Methods), including the desired axis-perpendicular and axis-parallel ones. By varying the volume fraction of the silica tracers in the suspension, dilute or dense (closed packed) in-plane monolayers of tracers, as needed for a particular setup (see below), can be formed upon sedimentation.

The chemically active Janus particles used in our experiments are spherical silica beads of radius R = 2.5 μm half-covered with a thin layer of Pt (see Methods). We define the orientation of the Janus particle via the unit vector d , which lies along the symmetry axis and is oriented from the chemically active hemisphere to the inactive one. As tracers, we use chemically inactive silica particles of radii R tr = 1 μm or R tr = 0.5 μm.

Last, we note that both the number of rings of tracers formed on the silica side and the area of the depletion zone behind the active Pt side increase upon increasing the concentration of H 2 O 2 fuel. It must also be emphasized that although the size of the depletion zone changes with fuel concentration, its shape does not.

It can be seen that—as for the case of the cap-perpendicular configuration—for the cap-parallel configuration, the behaviors exhibited by the tracers of different sizes are qualitatively the same (see movie S4). The only differences seem to be that a larger number of layers form in the compact semicircular region around the inert side for the smaller tracer size; however, the spatial extent of these layers is similar (approximately two to three R) for both tracer sizes.

At the Pt side of the particle, an opposite effect (i.e., a repulsive interaction) is observed, and an exclusion zone, completely depleted of tracer particles, emerges (see Fig. 2, A and C , and movie S3). Tracer particles, which are initially located in the vicinity of the Pt cap, are pushed away up to a distance of two to three R from the Pt cap. The repulsion in this region is sufficiently strong to overcome the diffusion of the tracer particles, which are subject to Brownian fluctuations, toward the Pt cap. The steady-state distributions shown in Fig. 2 (B and D) confirm these observations and reveal the formation of an exclusion zone, with a shape similar to that of a bean, behind the Pt cap (the deep blue region at the Pt side in Fig. 2, B and D ).

Immediately upon addition of H 2 O 2 , tracers that are initially located in a cone-like region opening from the inert side of the Janus particle are rapidly drawn toward the inert cap. This leads to the formation of circular segments of rings of passive particles on the silica side of the active particle (see Fig. 2, A and C ), bearing resemblance with the compact-to-loose multiring structures observed for the case of the active particle stuck in an axis-perpendicular configuration. A plot of the steady-state distribution of tracer particles around the silica half reveals that the closest ring of particles is more tightly bound as compared to the outer rings ( Fig. 2, B and D ). These circular segments end near the equator region (the circle separating the active and passive caps) of the Janus particle, somewhat into the chemically active region.

( B and D ) In-plane steady-state distribution of silica tracers around an active Janus particle in an axis-parallel configuration for tracers of radius R tr = 1 (B) and 0.5 μm (D). The origin of the in-plane system of coordinates is set at the center of the active particle. The strongly attractive circular ring segment at the inert side of the Janus particle (the bright yellow at the left) is accompanied by the formation of a spatially extended zone completely depleted of tracers at the active, Pt-coated, side (deep blue region at the right).

Axis-parallel configuration. We turn next to the behavior exhibited by passive silica tracers in the vicinity of an active Janus particle stuck at the wall in an axis-parallel configuration ( Fig. 2 ). The areal density of tracers was suitably adjusted to reach a compromise between keeping the system in the dilute monolayer limit while still having sufficiently many tracers around a stuck active particle to allow a mapping of the attraction and repulsion regions.

Concerning the experiments with the smaller tracer particles (radius R tr = 0.5 μm), they reveal a similar behavior where four to six rings form around the Janus particle at H 2 O 2 ≃ 6% (see Fig. 1, G and H , and movie 2). Similar to the case of larger tracer particles, these structures remain stable for as long as there is sufficient H 2 O 2 in the solution.

Once the first ring is completely filled, the compact ring structure turns stable (no tracer leaves the ring); however, tracers are still drawn in and additional ring structures build, ring after ring, around the active particle (see Fig. 1C ). The number of rings formed depends on the concentration of H 2 O 2 , i.e., on the activity; at low concentrations of H 2 O 2 (≲2%), a single ring forms, while at high concentrations of H 2 O 2 (≃6%, i.e., the value above which the velocity of a motile Janus particle becomes roughly independent of the H 2 O 2 concentration), three to four rings form around the Janus particle ( Fig. 1D ). The tracers closer to the Janus particle are more tightly confined compared to those further away, as can be inferred from the corresponding trajectories and mean square displacements (see Fig. 1, E and F ). Last, one notes that there are occasional exchanges of tracers between the outermost ring and the “bulk” solution, but there is no exchange of particles involving the inner concentric rings once they are completely filled. The structure remains stable for hours (more precisely, for as long as sufficient H 2 O 2 is in the solution) but melts away once the system runs out of H 2 O 2 . This further argues for the dynamic, activity-induced nature of the ring structure.

Axis-perpendicular configuration. We start the discussion with the observations in the case of the tracer particles of radius R tr = 1 μm. For a Janus particle stuck with the symmetry axis perpendicular to the wall, it is observed that, upon addition of H 2 O 2 , silica tracers located in the vicinity of the particle are drawn toward it (see Fig. 1, B and C ). (Note that the optical microscopy observations cannot discriminate whether this is a cap-up or a cap-down configuration.) This implies that the chemical activity of the Janus particle is experienced by the tracers as an effective attraction (see Fig. 1C ). The magnitude of this interaction is substantial (in the sense that it dominates thermal fluctuations) over a spatial range of few radii of the Janus particle; the interaction is sufficiently strong to lead to quasi-crystalline ring structures around the active Janus particle (see Fig. 1, B and C , and movie S1). As shown in Fig. 1B , during the formation of the ring structure, the motion of a drawn-in tracer is basically along the radial direction until it reaches the active particle, after which it translates within the (yet to be completely filled) ring along the circumference. The observation of strongly biased motion is consistent with an estimate Pe t ≫ 1 for the tracer Péclet number Pe t ≔ ∣ v t ∣R tr /D tr , where D tr is the diffusion constant of the tracer and v t is the tracer velocity. From analysis of the data in Fig. 1 , we estimate that ∣ v t ∣ ∼ 5 μm/s is a typical magnitude of the tracer velocity. Accordingly, for an R tr = 1 μm tracer immersed in water, we estimate Pe t ≈ 20. (Note that this estimate does not account for hindrance of tracer diffusion by the wall, which would lower D tr , i.e., increase Pe t by a prefactor ∼2 to 3 that depends on the height of the tracer above the wall.)

Once the Janus particle is active, one observes a reorganization of the monolayer, with the emergence of a depletion zone at the Pt side of the particle and a ring-structured compression region at the silica side of the particle (see Fig. 3, D and E , and movie S6). By analyzing the time-averaged distribution of tracers around the jammed Janus particle, two- to three-ordered ring segments are apparent at the inert (silica) side (the bright yellow spots in Fig. 3F ). In contrast, the depletion zone at the Pt side of the active particles (the deep blue zone in Fig. 3F ) is fluid, with substantial changes in shape over time as the surrounding tracers try to diffuse into this area ( Fig. 3, G and H ). Despite the changes in shape, the area of the depletion zone fluctuates around a well-defined average value (see Fig. 3J ); this value depends on the H 2 O 2 concentration, and it increases upon increasing the H 2 O 2 concentration ( Fig. 3, I and J ), which clearly argues that the emergence of the depletion zone is a result of the chemical activity of the jammed Janus particle.

Dense monolayer of tracers: Motile Janus particle in a jammed state. Last, we have also studied the case in which a motile Janus particle is trapped in a jammed state inside a dense (quasi–close-packed) monolayer of tracers of radii R tr = 1 μm (see Fig. 3 ); i.e., although the active particle is, in principle, motile (not stuck to the wall), it reaches a stall state, the stall force being provided by the pressure in the monolayer of tracers. (The inert particles are thus no longer just tracers for the fields sourced by the active Janus particle; they directly interact with the active particle and influence its dynamics.) To ensure this setup, we have restricted the study only to the Janus particles (within the dense silica particle monolayer) that, upon addition of H 2 O 2 , visibly change their orientation to being axis parallel. This is indicative of them being potentially motile, albeit unable to move because of being jammed within the densely packed monolayer. Although this setup is conceptually much more difficult to approach and analyze theoretically (a task which we leave for future work), we briefly discuss it below.

The most notable feature is the absence of any ring structure at the silica side of the Janus particle, in contrast to the behavior observed when the Janus particle is stuck to the wall in the axis-parallel configuration. The trajectories evidence a tendency of the tracers located in the proximity of the active particle to be drawn in toward the equator region, as well as a clear repulsion at the Pt side ( Fig. 3B and movie S5). The tracers colliding head-on with the active particle slide along the silica cap until reaching a point just past (≲1 μm) the equator, after which they are repelled (see the kinks in the trajectories in Fig. 3B at the point of leaving the surface of the Janus particle). From this image sequence, it is also possible to extract the probability of finding a tracer at a certain location along the surface of the Janus particle, which is shown in Fig. 3C . This “heatmap” confirms an increased probability of contact in a region near the equator that extends from the silica side by ≈1 μm into the Pt side, i.e., in the region where the passive particles are actively drawn in (see Fig. 3A ). Furthermore, the heatmap clearly documents the lack of any contact with tracers on the central part of the Pt side, i.e., this is a region of substantial effective repulsion experienced by the tracers.

As for the cases discussed in the previous subsections, the density of tracers (R tr = 1 μm) was suitably adjusted to reach a compromise between keeping the system in the dilute monolayer limit while still having sufficiently many tracers around to allow a mapping of the characteristics of the active particle–tracer interactions during the time that the active particle is within the field of view of the microscope. The motile active particle can be seen to be in a wall-bound sliding steady state; although an accurate measurement of the orientation of the director d with respect to the wall is not possible, one can assess that d is quasi-parallel to the wall by noting that the visible dark area (Pt covered) represents approximately half of the disk area image of the Janus particle ( Fig. 3A ). [A detailed analysis of the mechanism leading to this stable cap–(quasi-)parallel configuration in motile active particles can be found in ( 20 , 16 ).]

Dilute monolayer of tracers. The behavior of the tracers in the case in which the active Janus particle is motile, in a steady state of sliding along the wall, is more conveniently analyzed in a system of reference comoving with the particle (for details, see Methods). The origin of the comoving system is set to the center of the Janus colloid, the axes are chosen such that the x-y plane is parallel to the wall, and the direction x is parallel to the projection of the director d onto the wall.

Theoretical interpretation of the behavior of tracers near an immobilized active Janus particle

It is evident that a system of catalytically active Janus particles in a bath of inert tracers exhibits a very rich behavior that depends on the orientation and state of motion of the Janus particles. Intrinsically, this behavior emerges from a complex interplay of chemical and hydrodynamic effects. First of all, active Janus particles achieve self-propulsion through an interfacial coupling between self-generated chemical and hydrodynamic fields. Specifically, the chemical gradients that arise from the reaction on the catalytic “face” of the particle, in combination with (material-dependent) molecular forces between the particle surface and the various molecules in the solution, lead to so-called self-phoretic motion (32, 33). The chemical and flow fields implicated in the self-phoretic motion of a Janus particle are affected by geometric confinement, i.e., by the presence of the hard planar wall beneath the Janus particle (16) (as well as, in general, by the presence of other particles). Second, the inert tracers respond both to local chemical gradients (via phoresis) and to flow; their motion is the net result of these contributions. Third, the same interfacial mechanism that couples chemical gradients and flow in the vicinity of the surface of a Janus particle can also take place on the planar wall, i.e., chemiosmosis can occur (30). In addition, we note that if the catalytic reaction involves charged intermediates, then there may be electric fields in the solution leading to electrophoretic contributions to the motion of the Janus and/or tracer particles (34). Unraveling the interplay of these effects is a challenging task.

Here, our aim is to develop a minimalistic, coarse-grained model that has few adjustable parameters, and which yet still captures the main qualitative features observed in the experiments. To simplify this task, we focus on the case of immobilized Janus particles in a dilute bath of tracers. To interpret and rationalize the experimental observations, we consider a previously used simple continuum model of chemical gradients and hydrodynamic flow created by an immobile, catalytically active Janus particle near a planar wall (see Methods) (16, 20, 30, 31). In brief, at the catalytic cap of the particle, solute molecules (i.e., oxygen) are released in the solution. The connection between the gradients of the solute number density c(x) (chemical field), where x is a position in the solution, and the hydrodynamic flow u(x) of the solution is assumed to be that of a slip velocity as in the classical theory of neutral diffusiophoresis (32, 33). Accordingly, each surface is characterized by a certain so-called phoretic mobility (or surface mobility) coefficient: b w at the wall, b c at the catalytic cap, and b i at the inert part of the Janus particle. These coefficients encode the material-dependent interactions between the solid surfaces and molecules in the solution. We note that our coarse-grained model does not resolve charged intermediates or electric fields.

We consider the motion of a single tracer; this is analyzed in the point-particle limit, i.e., the tracer responds to the chemical gradients and hydrodynamic flow created by the particle and the wall, but only weakly and locally disturbs these fields. Accordingly, the tracer particle is advected by the hydrodynamic flow with velocity u(x t ) [where x t = (x t , y t , z t ) denotes the location of the center of the tracer] and responds to chemical gradients via phoresis (32), i.e., it drifts with a phoretic velocity b t ∇c(x t ), where b t is the phoretic mobility of the tracer. Furthermore, we can distinguish advection by the chemiphoretically driven flow u p (x t ), originating at the surface of the Janus particle, and advection by the chemiosmotically driven flow u w (x t ), originating at the wall. We thus write v t ( x t ) = u p ( x t ) + u w ( x t ) + b t ∇ c ( x t ) (1)where v t (x t ) is the velocity of the tracer particle as a function of its position x t . We note that if v t has a component directed toward the center of the Janus particle, then the tracer has an effective attractive interaction with the Janus particle when the tracer is at x t ; likewise, if v t has a component directed away from the center of the Janus particle, then the tracer has an effective repulsive interaction with the Janus particle at x t .

In the following calculations, we assume that the tracer particle has sedimented to the vicinity of the wall and (because of its appreciable weight) maintains only in-plane mobility; this is consistent with the experimental observation that the tracers always remain in focus when viewed with optical microscopy. The distance from the surface of the tracer to the wall (separation) is expected to be in the range of tens of nanometers. This parameter is expected to have only a weak influence on the phenomenology, as long as the height of the center of the tracer to the wall is taken to be slightly larger than the radius of the tracers. In units of the radius R of the Janus particle, the tracer particles have radii R tr = 0.4R or R tr = 0.2R, respectively; in this work, we take the height h tr ≔ z t /R of the center of the tracer particle to be h tr = 0.41 or h tr = 0.21 for the larger and for the smaller tracers, respectively. In what concerns the stuck Janus particle, we will model it as being stalled, by suitable external force and torque, in the particular configuration of interest (axis perpendicular or axis parallel) and slightly above the surface, rather than being in direct contact with the wall; i.e., the center of the Janus particle is taken to be located at h/R = 1.1, rather than being in direct contact with the wall. This vertical shift and its value (as long as not too large) are expected to not influence the qualitative features of the emergent dynamics (see also Methods); however, it notably reduces the technical, numerical difficulties in determining the chemical field and the hydrodynamic flow.

Noting that the magnitude of one of the phoretic mobilities, e.g., ∣b c ∣, can be absorbed in the definition of a velocity scale (33) U 0 (see Methods), the model depends on four parameters: the sign of b c and the mobilities b i , b t , and b w . The special choice of materials used in the current experiments, in which the tracers and the inert part of the Janus particle are made from the same material (silica), implies the expectation that b t ≃ b i . From general considerations on the direction of motion of these Janus particles when far from the boundaries and on their rotations when in the vicinity of walls (see note S4), it is inferred that b c is negative and it is expected that 0 ≤ β i ≔ b i /b c < 1. Accordingly, the number of parameters is reduced to two, which we chose to be β i and β w ≔ b w /b c . Furthermore, by noting that the wall is made of glass (another form of silica), it is reasonable to expect that b w and b i have the same sign and ∣b w ∣ ∼ ∣b i ∣ (thus β w ∼ β i ).

Before proceeding with the analysis, we note the following aspects concerning the various terms in the right-hand side of Eq. 1. Owing to β t > 0, because β t ≔ b t /b c = β i , the phoretic component of the motion of the tracers (the last term in Eq. 1) corresponds to an effective repulsion (motion away from the source of chemical, i.e., away from the Janus particle). Consequently, agreement with the experimental observation of tracers accumulating in the vicinity of the active Janus particle can be achieved only if the in-plane (z t /R = h tr ) drift by the hydrodynamic flow u p + u w is toward the Janus particle and of sufficiently large magnitude. For a wall with osmotic slip, for b w < 0 (as it is expected for our system), the contribution u w to the motion of the tracer is always oriented toward a Janus particle in a cap-perpendicular configuration, irrespective of that being cap-up or cap-down; i.e., in this configuration, the osmotic-driven flow u w is providing an effective attraction component to the motion of the tracer.

The discussion above leads to the expectation that for the system of silica tracers near a silica/Pt Janus particle immobilized at a glass wall, the parameters β w and β i have similar values. Accordingly, we focus below on the case β w = β i and study the behavior of the tracer as a function of the parameter β i ( = β t = β w ). As shown below, for this choice there exist values β i for which the theoretically predicted effective interactions experienced by the tracers are compatible with the experimental observations. The alternative scenario that the two parameters take very different values cannot be ruled out a priori (but, anticipating, we have shown that it does lead to theoretical predictions in disagreement with the experimental observations). Accordingly, the discussion is complemented, in note S2, by an analysis of the case of a no-slip wall (β w = 0), representative for a situation with ∣β w ∣ ≪ ∣β i ∣. For completeness, in note S3, we also succinctly discuss, focused on the axis-perpendicular configuration, the case opposite to a no-slip wall; i.e., the case in which the response to the chemical gradients at the wall is much stronger (∣β w ∣ ≫ ∣β i ∣) than at the inert part of the Janus particle.

Axis-perpendicular configuration. A Janus particle stuck with its director perpendicular to the wall provides a configuration with axial symmetry (see Figs. 4 and 5), which is amenable to analytical treatment. The solutions c(x) and u(x) for the Laplace and Stokes problems defined above can be written in terms of series in bipolar coordinates by using the classical results from (35, 36), adapted to account for the phoretic slip at the surface of the particle and at the wall as in, e.g., (37). (These series solutions do not provide much physical insight, and thus, we do not list them here; the interested reader can consult the references noted above.)

The dotted lines indicate the values sg(v t ) Pe t = ± 1. The magenta markers and numbers indicate the ends of close-packed tracer layers (rings). As noted in the discussion of the experimental results, the optical microscopy cannot discriminate between cap-up and cap-down orientations. However, it turns out that, for a cap-down configuration, there is no combination of parameters β w and β i for which the experimental observations can be reproduced by the theoretical model, as shown below for the case β w = β i and—as noted above—in the Supplementary Materials for the case β w ≠ β i (see note S1). For reasons of brevity, we present here only the results in the case of the tracers of radius 1 μm because this is sufficient to rule out the cap-down configuration. [Nonetheless, we note that, for the smaller tracers (radius, 0.5 μm), the results are basically the same, with the only difference being in the somewhat smaller values of the corresponding Péclet numbers.] Figure 4 illustrates typical results for the solute density, hydrodynamic flow, and tracer flow (as well as the tracer Pe t number) corresponding to this case. It is seen that, at all values 0 < β i < 1, the tracers exhibit a repulsive effective interaction (see the tracer flows in the right column). Furthermore, the Péclet number of the tracers, shown by the background color in right column panels in Fig. 4, is very large (Pe t ≫ 1) even at large distances Δ ≃ 4R from the center of the Janus particle; i.e., in this case, the prediction is also a basically deterministic outward motion (contrary to the experimental findings of attraction toward the active particle). Accordingly, the cap-down configuration can be ruled out, in that there is no combination of parameters for which the theoretical predictions can be reconciled with the experimental observations. We turn now to the case of a cap-up configuration, and we study it for various values of the parameter 0 ≤ β i ( = β w ) < 1. (We remind that the analysis of the case β i ≠ β w is provided in notes S2 and S3.). For the cap-up configuration, the contribution from the wall-driven flows qualitatively influences the behavior exhibited by the tracers, as shown in Fig. 5 (for the tracers of radius R tr = 0.5 μm and R tr = 1.0 μm). When the osmotic slip is accounted for, the effective interaction exhibited by the tracers is attractive near the colloid and weakly repulsive very far from the colloid. The extent of the region where the effective interaction is attractive increases upon decreasing β i (compare the top and middle panels in the middle and right columns of Fig. 5). The Péclet number of the tracers, Pe t = ∣v t ∣R tr /D tr , which is shown color-coded in the panels in the middle and right columns of Fig. 5, provides additional insight into the behavior. [Note that throughout the following analysis, we account for the hindrance of the tracer diffusion by the wall, using the assumed tracer height (38)]. For the smaller tracers, it is only for β i < 0.5, and particularly β i ≲ 0.2, that regions of attractive interactions where the Péclet numbers are large (therefore, the deterministic biased motion toward the active particle dominates the Brownian motion) occur near the Janus particle. Similarly, for the larger tracers, for β i ≲ 0.5, there are regions of attractive interactions, starting from the point of steric contact with the Janus particle, where the Péclet numbers are large (i.e., Pe t ≫ 1). For β i ≲ 0.2 for the smaller tracers, and for β i ≲ 0.5 for the larger tracers, the spatial extent Δ (measured from the center of the active particle) of the region with attractive interactions and Pe t > 1 is in the range of three to five R (compare the red curve with the blue and green ones in Fig. 5J and the red and blue curves with the green one in Fig. 5K). These features are compatible with the experimental observations (discussed in the previous subsections) of concentric rings, with compact structure near the colloid (stronger attraction, large Pe t ), followed by a sparse structure toward the outer ring (Pe t ≳ 1) merging into Brownian motion (Pe t < 1) at larger distances. In summary, the analysis for the axis-perpendicular configurations implies first that the configuration with the axis perpendicular to the wall observed in the experiments is the one of cap-up orientation (see also note S1), and second that agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental observations requires that the wall is responsive (via the osmotic slip) to the chemical activity and that this response is relatively weak (i.e., β w = β i ≲ 0.2 − 0.3). The requirement of wall responsiveness can be further tested by analyzing walls with different β w . Because β w is a material property of the surface, different values of β w can be accessed by changing the material type of the bottom wall that is used in the experiments. We expect that, if the osmotic response at the wall is a relevant parameter for these systems, then different surfaces should lead to different levels of attraction or repulsion of the tracer particles to the active particle. We perform experiments similar to the ones described in the previous section, using the same active particles (silica-Pt) and tracers (silica, R tr = 1 μm), but using different wall surfaces made of glass, mica, and Ti. (For the case of Ti, a 25 nm layer of Ti is sputter-coated onto a plain glass slide.) In each case, we study the response of tracers near Janus particles stuck at the wall in an axis-perpendicular configuration. We ensure that the level of activity in systems with different walls remains the same by using the same batch of active particles (fabrication processes sometimes cause variations in the activity of the particles) and the same concentration of H 2 O 2 (3%, v/v). For all three surfaces, we observe that, upon addition of H 2 O 2 , the tracers in the vicinity of active particles are drawn in toward the active particle (see Fig. 6A). However, the magnitude and the spatial extent of this attraction clearly vary by surface type. For the case of a glass surface, we find that two strongly bound rings form around the active particle, and an additional weakly bound ring persists. For the case of a Ti surface, we only observe a single strongly bound ring and an additional weakly bound ring. The attraction on the mica surface is the weakest: Only a single weakly bound ring forms around the active particle. The difference in the level of attraction on the different surfaces is clearly visible in the probability densities of tracer positions in proximity of the active particles (see Fig. 6B). Fig. 6 Active-passive interaction for an immobilized Janus particle in an axis-parallel configuration for different surface types. (A) Snapshots showing accumulation of silica tracers around an active Janus particle and formation of circular ring segments for tracers of radius R tr = 1 μm for different surface types (glass, Ti, and mica). The tracers indicated in red are tightly bound to the active particle, tracers in yellow are weakly bound to the active particle, and the tracers in green are unbound in the solution. (B) Probability density of the silica tracer particles (R tr = 1 μm) accumulated near the active Janus particle on the three different surface types (glass, Ti, and mica). The magenta markers indicate the ends of close packed tracer layers (rings). Color code: Deep color corresponds to high probability, white to the “far” constant value (inverse of the average tracer density). (C) Signed Péclet number for a tracer with z tr /R = 0.41 in the vicinity of a cap-up Janus particle with β t = β i = 0.2. Negative values of sg(v t ) Pe t indicate radial attraction. Roughly speaking, the effective attraction dominates the Brownian motion when sg(v t ) Pe t < −1, and this condition is used to define the extent of the region of effective attraction. The various curves correspond to different values of the wall phoretic mobility ratio β w , such as would be obtained with different substrate materials. The dotted lines indicate the values sg(v t ) Pe t = ±1. The magenta markers and numbers indicate the ends of close-packed tracer layers (rings). Qualitatively, this dependence on the material composition of the wall can be recovered in the theoretical model. Specifically, we fix β t = β i = 0.2 (consistent with the range inferred from the analysis summarized in Fig. 5) to represent the fact that silica tracer particles and Pt/silica Janus particles were used throughout this series of experiments. We consider various values of the wall phoretic mobility ratio β w for an R tr = 1 μm tracer (z t /R = 0.41), as shown in Fig. 6C. Using the simple criterion that the biased motion (here attractive, v t < 0) prevails over Brownian motion when Pe t > 1, i.e., the signed Péclet number sg(v t ) Pe t < − 1, we find that the extent of the region of attraction (i.e., the region in which the sg(v t ) Pe t curve corresponding to a certain value β w takes values smaller than −1) increases with β w . Thus, by comparison with the trend observed in the experiments, we infer that β w, mica < β w, Ti < β w, silica , where here we assume that β w, silica ≈ 0.2. While quantitative agreement with the experiments (in terms of number of bound rings) may be possible upon tuning β t within 0 < β t < 0.3, we do not further pursue this aspect because these findings would have limited significance, considering the simplicity of the model used, the dilute tracer approximation, the somewhat ad hoc (although being a reasonable choice) character of the sg(v t ) Pe t < − 1 criterion for estimating the spatial extent of layering, etc. Overall, the experiments and modeling converge to the conclusion that the material composition of the substrate has a profound influence on tracer dynamics and that this dependence can be rationalized as being due to the material dependence of the chemiosmotic slip. A further brief comment concerning the conclusion of a cap-up orientation is in order. As noted in the discussion of the experimental results shown in Fig. 1, upon drying out of the suspension with Janus particles, one observes particles adhered to the glass slide in various orientations, with no obvious preference between a cap-down and a cap-up configuration (see also note S5). We think that the reason why only the latter persists once the chemical activity of the particles is turned on is the following. In the cap-down configuration, the moving up tendency of the active particle is strongly enhanced by the confinement, due to the wall, of the chemical field and can overcome the adhesion produced by the surface [via Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) forces]. In contrast, in the cap-up configuration, the tendency of the particle is to move into the wall, and thus, it cooperates with the surface interactions; in addition, in this configuration, the chemical field is only weakly affected by the wall confinement. Visual observations of events of detachment of Janus particle from the wall, followed by a fast turn to a sliding state, seem to better match with the picture of a rotation from a cap-down initial state than with one from a cap-up initial state.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabd0719/F1.large.jpg,"['active', 'interactions', 'confined', 'fig', 'b', 'response', 'nonequilibrium', 'tracer', 'near', 'particles', 'particle', 'janus', 'tracers', 'wall', 'β', 'inferring']", 
54,54,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Multiple substrate recognition by yeast diadenosine and diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase through phosphate clamping - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/17/eabf6744,"Abstract The yeast diadenosine and diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase DDP1 is a Nudix enzyme with pyrophosphatase activity on diphosphoinositides, dinucleotides, and polyphosphates. These substrates bind to diverse protein targets and participate in signaling and metabolism, being essential for energy and phosphate homeostasis, ATPase pump regulation, or protein phosphorylation. An exhaustive structural study of DDP1 in complex with multiple ligands related to its three diverse substrate classes is reported. This allowed full characterization of the DDP1 active site depicting the molecular basis for endowing multisubstrate abilities to a Nudix enzyme, driven by phosphate anchoring following a defined path. This study, combined with multiple enzyme variants, reveals the different substrate binding modes, preferences, and selection. Our findings expand current knowledge on this important structural superfamily with implications extending beyond inositide research. This work represents a valuable tool for inhibitor/substrate design for ScDDP1 and orthologs as potential targets to address fungal infections and other health concerns.

INTRODUCTION Inositol polyphosphates (InsPs) are small molecules, primarily derived from myo-inositol, the phosphorylation patterns of which generate second messengers, essential metabolites, or cofactors involved in a variety of cell processes (1). A subset of the InsPs is formed by the inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs), essential for vesicular remodeling, growth, phosphate, and energy homeostasis (2–4) and, particularly in yeast, critical for pseudohyphal growth (5). In humans, they are necessary for correct cell physiology and are involved in diseases leading to diabetes and cancer (6–8). From yeast to mammals, PP-InsPs with seven phosphates (diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate, PP-InsP 5 or InsP 7 ) and eight phosphates (bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate, [PP] 2 -1,5-InsP 4 or InsP 8 ) have been identified, as well as two different isomers of InsP 7 [1-InsP 7 (or 1-PP-InsP 5 ) and 5-InsP 7 (or 5-PP-InsP 5 )] (9). A very recently published work shows that 5-InsP 7 is an endogenous negative regulator of Na+/K+–adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) α1 (10). Regulation of these metabolites is achieved by the action of kinases and phosphatases that balance correct levels in cells. Two different families of kinases are responsible for their synthesis from inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP 6 ), the InsP 6 kinases and the diphosphoinositol-pentakisphosphate kinases (PP-InsP 5 Ks; named as Vip1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Asp1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe). However, three different families of phosphatases that are able to hydrolyze PP-InsPs at least in vitro have been identified, belonging in terms of their fold to the Nudix hydrolase [human diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolases (DIPPs)], tyrosine phosphatase (ScSiw14, essential for prion propagation), or histidine acid phosphatase (Vip1 enzymes) families. Regarding the latter, Vip1 and Asp1 yeast kinases are bifunctional enzymes containing tethered kinase and phosphatase domains. In this work, we focus on the structural and functional features of diadenosine and diphosphoinositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase (DDP1), a phosphatase that belongs to the Nudix hydrolase fold. DDP1 is a S. cerevisiae enzyme (also ScDDP1) that is able to hydrolyze several kinds of substrates in vitro. As mentioned, DDP1 displays PP-InsP phosphatase activity (11, 12). It hydrolyzes 1-InsP 7 , 5-InsP 7 , and InsP 8 , although it hydrolyzes 1-InsP 7 faster than InsP 8 and 5-InsP 7 (13). However, ScDDP1 is not exclusively a PP-InsP phosphatase, since it also hydrolyzes polyphosphates (polyPn) (11, 14) and diadenosine polyphosphates (Ap n A as Ap 5 A or Ap 6 A) (11, 15). ScDDP1 participation in cytoplasmic polyPn cleavage has been already proven (16). This has an important implication since polyPs are related to stress adaptation and metal toxicity resistance in some fungal pathogens and in the cell cycle of S. cerevisiae by providing phosphate to deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) synthesis for S phase (17). In humans, polyPs have health implications since they are relevant for platelet aggregation, inflammation, the immune system, and cancer (18–20). Similarly, Ap n As participate in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis equilibria, mediating extracellular stimuli (21). In higher organisms, these compounds can also act as neurotransmitters (22) or vasomodulators (23). All these catalytic activities position ScDDP1 at a key point for phosphate homeostasis through polyPs and InsP 7 degradation (24). Previous data have shown that both metabolisms (polyPs and PP-InsPs) are highly correlated (11). A hot topic over the past years is that PP-InsPs may act as Pi sensors in the phosphate-responsive signaling (PHO) pathway through binding to SPX domains (from SYG1/Pho81/XPR1 proteins) (25). Thus, InsP 7 in S. cerevisiae is necessary to activate the vacuolar transporter chaperone complex responsible for polyP synthesis and storage in yeast vacuoles and to control PHO transcription genes by activating the Pho81 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (17, 26). It has been shown that PP-InsPs can act as a glue for protein-protein complexes involved in PHO pathway (25). Certainly, the relationship of DDP1 with phosphorus homeostasis makes this enzyme a potential target for fungal infections, the virulence of which may depend on phosphorus as an essential nutrient (17). In parallel, ScDDP1 may also remove toxic dinucleoside polyphosphates synthesized during sporulation (27). ScDDP1 presents orthologs in humans (the DIPP family) and in S. pombe (Aps1). Five orthologs of ScDDP1 have been reported in humans (28): HsDIPP1, HsDIPP2, HsDIPP3α, HsDIPP3β, and HsDIPP3γ. Up to now, the structures of several HsDIPP isoforms are available, but only the HsDIPP1 isoform has been published (28, 29). These enzymes belong to the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, also known as the MutT/Nudix family. Briefly, the Nudix hydrolases are enzymes found in all organisms from all kingdoms and in viruses, having β-grasp domain architecture. They present diverse biological roles, being involved in cellular metabolism and homeostasis as well as in mRNA processing. This fold does not only serve exclusively the pyrophosphohydrolases but is also found in adenine/guanine mismatch-specific adenine glycosylases, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases, and proteins with nonenzymatic activities such as protein interactions and transcriptional regulation (30). Most Nudix enzymes contain a 23–amino acid motif named the MutT/Nudix box, which, in pyrophosphatases, is GX 5 EX 7 REUXEEXGU, where U is a bulky aliphatic residue (L, I, or V) and X is any amino acid. This displays a loop-helix-loop structure that binds one or more metals involved in diphosphate moiety orientation and catalysis. Therefore, it happens that the Nudix homology domain is an effective scaffold for many catalytic activities. DDP1 shares sequence homology in a limited region with other pyrophosphohydrolases named as MutT enzymes. In particular, ScDDP1 shares 33% sequence identity from Val47 to Glu99 with human MutT-Ap 4 A hydrolase, while human DIPPs reach 47% identity. Although the Nudix hydrolase superfamily is well characterized structurally, its broad range of catalytic activities and substrate recognition is poorly understood. In particular, the molecular basis for the multiple pyrophosphatase activity on different substrate types, as in the case of ScDDP1, remains unknown. Very recently, while this manuscript was in preparation, the structure of DIPP1 in complex with 1- and 5-InsP 7 became available (29), although no description of catalytic mechanism beyond that already postulated from the InsP 6 complex (28) was provided. Important issues such as InsP 8 recognition and why ScDDP1 is more active on 1-InsP 7 over 5-InsP 7 or InsP 8 are also still to be addressed. In addition, the human and yeast enzymes, while keeping high homology in the core, present distinctive elements, and not all the InsP-binding residues are conserved among them. The yeast enzymes display an insert (25 residues) not present in the human orthologs, with an unknown function. Last, this family of enzymes, as mentioned, exceptionally presents a pyrophosphatase function on a very diverse set of substrates, such as polyphosphates, Ap n A, and PP-InsPs, linking essential areas of metabolism within the cell. How ScDDP1 recognizes them and how it is capable of performing its catalytic activity on three completely different substrates are addressed in this current work. Extensive crystallographic studies together with mutagenesis analysis, enzyme assays, use of synthetic substrate analogs (4), and qualitative thermal fluorescence shift assays now allow a greater understanding of this family of enzymes.

DISCUSSION In the present work, we have provided the crystal structure of DDP1 from S. cerevisiae with a wide collection of possible substrates and analogs. The fascinating ability of DDP1 to bind very dissimilar substrates can be rationalized from this valuable structural information. DDP1 displays a ligand recognition ability absolutely dominated by phosphate moieties in all substrates. Thus, the phosphates of polyphosphate and diadenosine substrates delineate, through bond torsions, a pathway fully compatible with that for the positions of fully phosphorylated inositides, emulating a similar phosphate pattern substrate recognition. However, the higher stabilization achieved by inositide and polyphosphate substrates suggests an optimal fit for these kinds of substrates. Our results not only reveal structural similarities of ScDDP1 with human orthologs (HsDIPP1) and Nudix MutT hydrolases but also provide essential differences that can explain their different features and functionalities. ScDDP1 shows a marked extension projecting out from the Nudix core (that we name nose), which seems to be specific for this family in the yeast kingdom. We have designed a nose-lacking DDP1 mutant producing an active and folded protein that depicted the outstanding influence of the nose not only in polyphosphate binding but also in all kinds of substrates. Although direct interactions of nose with the ligands have not been observed, the presence of secondary inositide molecules close to the nose suggests a possible role of this region in substrate recruitment. Whether the nose has additional role in protein oligomerization, in signaling through interaction with other proteins, or in activity regulation, for example, by closing the entrance to the active site, awaits further investigations. As expected, the essential Nudix catalytic residues are well conserved among all these enzymes. Many of the phosphate-coordinating residues are shared between ScDDP1 and its human orthologs, while only a few are shared with the MutT-related enzymes. However, ScDDP1 has three residues involved in substrate coordination, two specific (Lys63 and Arg102) and one conserved with HsDDP1 (Arg129), which are involved in different inositide substrate accommodation and selection through movement of their long and flexible side chain. Moreover, the two latter residues (Arg102 and Arg129) exhibit large conformational changes that configure a very different cavity for nucleotide recognition. Focusing on inositide binding, we found seven positions for phosphate recognition: Six positions are defined by the InsP 6 complex plus a seventh defined by the “Pβ-to-be-cleaved” position in the PCP-InsP 7 complex (Fig. 2, C and D). As InsP 6 and further phosphorylated InsPs present high symmetry, we found a variety of nonproductive and productive binding forms that fit nicely into the DDP1 active site, satisfying in most cases six of the above-mentioned phosphate recognition positions. InsPs and analogs can fulfill this binding pattern in five binding modes, although exceptionally in the case of PCP-InsP 8 (bm5), just four phosphate positions are satisfied. Note that even enzyme substrates such as 5-InsP 7 can bind in nonproductive forms. We think that an explanation for obtaining nonproductive forms could be that our complexes were captured at an acidic pH in which the enzyme is not active, which in turn can account for the suboptimal occupancy of Mg2+ ions found in the active site. However, we find a correlation between the binding modes and the kinetic data reported by Kilari et al. (13). Thus, while the K m data for 1-InsP 7 , 5-InsP 7 , and InsP 8 are quite similar, the k cat is significantly greater for 1-InsP 7 than for the two other substrates. It has been proposed that a faster catalysis on 1-InsP 7 can compensate for its lower levels in cells (13). Among our ScDDP1-inositide complexes, while PCP-InsP 7 and 1-InsP 7 tend to bind in a productive form, 5-InsP 7 binds preferentially in a nonproductive form. This fact could explain the differences in k cat between both InsP 7 isomers while keeping similar K m values. A quite similar explanation could be suggested for InsP 8 . ScDDP1 must bind InsP 8 in two different ways to hydrolyze the PP moieties at both 1- and 5 positions. Published data conclude that DDP1 preferentially hydrolyzes the diphosphate at the 5-PP position in InsP 8 (13). In the present work, we solved the structure of a ScDDP1:PCP-InsP 8 complex in a pseudo-productive form for 1-PP hydrolysis, which neither satisfies the six phosphate positions for recognition nor positions the diphosphate moiety exactly as in other productive complexes, although it is still coordinated with the Nudix recognition motif through a Mg2+ ion. Thus, we propose here a model for InsP 8 binding based on 5-InsP 7 that satisfies both phosphate-binding positions and 5-PP diphosphate fitting. Therefore, we suggest that InsP 8 binds in a perfectly productive form to hydrolyze 5-PP, while it acquires a pseudo-productive form to hydrolyze 1-PP. This could explain why hydrolysis at the 1-PP position is less favored than hydrolysis at the 5-PP position and the lower activity rate toward InsP 8 than 1-InsP 7 , since InsP 8 binding could result in two alternate ligand positions, one of them being less efficient. The ScDDP1 structure also reveals which particular region is responsible for inositide accommodation, in contrast to Ap n A hydrolases, such as MutT enzymes that cannot act on these substrates. The ScDDP1 region 52-SSA presents two serine residues that are directly involved in phosphate coordination in all kinds of substrates recognized by the enzyme. This region always presents some degree of disorder in our complexes, and the double mutant on serine residues (S52A/S53A) produces a nonstable form of DDP1. Therefore, we conclude that these serine residues are essential for protein folding and/or stability and for binding all substrates, and they are responsible for the ability of ScDDP1 to accommodate inositides. Equivalent regions in Ap n A hydrolases from the Nudix family show residues with long side chains (Fig. 3, E and F) or longer loops, and while they are also able to coordinate phosphates, they fill the active site space destined to accommodate the inositide ligands in ScDDP1. In consequence, in DDP1, Ap 5 A- and polyphosphate-based substrates adopt conformations that follow the contour of the inositol phosphates instead of acquiring an extended conformation as in MutT enzymes. This tightened and constrained conformation of the polyphosphate chain in the ScDDP1 active site also explains why DDP1 is an Ap 6 A and Ap 5 A hydrolase and not an Ap 4 A hydrolase as well as the main hydrolysis products obtained in each case (15). Our study also shows how a longer polyphosphate chain binds in a Nudix enzyme. Following the serines mentioned above, the 54-AHKKR motif is involved in polyphosphate binding beyond the defined positions for phosphate recognition. This motif is not absolutely conserved in HsDIPP1 enzymes or in Ap n A hydrolases; therefore, we suggest that this could select different polyphosphate chain substrates or account for a possibly better activity of DDP1 on polyphosphate substrates (11). However, an additional contribution by the nose cannot be discarded. In addition, our structure of polyP binding in the ScDDP1 active site explains the endopolyphosphatase activity determined for this enzyme (11), although it does not exclude the possibility of an exopolyphosphatase activity. In conclusion, the structural knowledge provided by our ScDDP1 complexes generates a vast amount of information most valuable for several fields. First, many efforts are being undertaken to understand the metabolism of PP-InsPs due to the relevance of these compounds in essential cell functions such as apoptosis (9) and other emerging roles (10). Therefore, our DDP1 complexes add invaluable data to this inositide field. Second, Nudix enzymes represent a well-characterized superfamily able to act on very different substrates. To our knowledge, this is the first structural study showing how a Nudix enzyme shares three kinds of substrates including inositides, and the structural basis for this uniqueness has been established. But understanding the structure and function of multiple substrate enzymes is also a challenge that goes beyond enzymology or structural biology; how an enzyme attains specificity for its substrates and maintains the ability to act on different substrates represents a great challenge from both an evolutionary and a structural point of view. In addition, we depict the structural basis for recognition of a complete set of substrates and analogs, providing a huge source of information to design structure-based inhibitors for these enzymes. ScDDP1, as well as HsDIPP1, contribute to the regulation of inositide, polyphosphate, and dinucleotide metabolism and considering the participation of such molecules in signaling and other events, it follows that manipulating enzyme activity could potentially have important effects in health. It is now established that fungal infections and their virulence are related to phosphorus uptake. On the one hand, mobilization of phosphate from polyphosphates is one of the first responses evoked in fungi to phosphate limiting conditions and on the other InsP 7 , a signaling molecule for the PHO pathway, participates directly in phosphate sensing and signaling through binding to SPX domains (25). Moreover, it is known that InsP 7 is required for Cryptococcus neoformans pathogenicity (35, 36) and that ScDDP1 is implicated in phosphate homeostasis of S. cerevisiae by degrading InsP 7 and polyphosphates. Our findings presented here provide a tool to approach improved treatments for fungal infections. We propose that Lys63 and Arg102 are unique residues in yeast orthologs that should be considered for specific inhibitor design.

MATERIALS AND METHODS PP-InsPs synthesis PCP-InsP 8 or 1,5-[PCP] 2 -InsP 4 (37), PA-InsP 8 or 1,5-[PA] 2 -InsP 4 (37), and PCF or 5-PCF 2 Am-InsP 5 (38) were synthesized as previously described. PCP-InsP 7 or 1-PCP-InsP 5 was synthesized as previously described for 1,5-[PCP] 2 -InsP 4 (37) but starting from 1d-4-O-benzyl-2,3:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene myo-inositol. The PP-InsPs 1-InsP 7 and 5-InsP 7 were synthesized using similar methods to those previously described (39, 40). All the above synthetic compounds were purified by ion-exchange chromatography and fully characterized by 1H, 31P, and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cloning and site-directed mutagenesis The DDP1 gene was obtained from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA. For its bacterial recombinant expression, Scddp1 cDNA was inserted into sites Bam HI/Not I of pKLSL t vector, which expresses the target protein in fusion with LSL t (a fragment of Laetiporus sulphureus lectin) (41). The cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 1 and 2 (table S1) and inserted into the vector by megaprimer-mediated molecular cloning (42). Point and double DDP1 mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis using as template ScDDP1/pKLSL t , and the primers were indicated in table S1. To produce a truncated DDP1 enzyme lacking the Pro104-His126 residues (DDP1Δ104–126 or DDP1Δnose), we designed the primers 23 and 24 to change fragment 104–126 for three Gly residues by site-directed mutagenesis using the ScDDP1/pKLSL t plasmid as a template. Protein expression and purification wt-DDP1 fused to LSL t protein (LSL t -DDP1) was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2(DE3) (Novagen) strain after its transformation with the plasmid ScDDP1/pKLSL t . Bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol (both 50 μg/ml) at 289 K overnight (16 hours) and at 303 K until an OD 600 (optical density of 600) of 0.7 to 0.8 was reached. Expression was induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 or 6 hours at 303 K. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and pellets were stored at 193 K until use. DDP1 mutants were expressed exactly as wt-DDP1. Pellets were resuspended in buffer A [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)] plus deoxyribonuclease (4 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). After sonication, the filtrated lysate was applied onto a Sepharose CL-6B column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was washed with buffer A and eluted by adding 0.2 M lactose to the buffer. The fusion protein LSL t -DDP1 was diluted threefold with 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), loaded onto a heparin column (HiTrap Heparin, GE Healthcare), washed with buffer B [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT], and eluted with a NaCl 1 M gradient. The fused protein was cleaved overnight with tobacco etch virus protease (protease-protein mass ratio of 1:40) with slow rolling at 277 K. A second Sepharose column was used to separate wt-DDP1 from LSL t and the remaining fusion protein. wt-DDP1 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. Last, wt-DDP1 was concentrated and stored at 193 K. We obtained 5 mg of pure wt-DDP1 per liter of bacteria culture at concentration of 6.25 mg/ml. The purity of all the samples was confirmed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. DDP1 mutants were purified with the same protocol as wt-DDP1. DDP1 cocrystallization with ligands wt-DDP1 was cocrystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 291 K, with three groups of ligands: based on inositol, polyphosphates, or adenosine. The initial crystallization conditions [20% (v/v) polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 6000, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), and lithium chloride] were found after setting up four commercial crystallization screenings: PACT (Jena Bioscience), Crystal Screen (Hampton Research), Index (Hampton Research), and JCSG (Jena Bioscience) using a Nanodrop robot (Innovadyne Technologies Inc.), 250:250 nl protein:precipitant drop ratio in 96-well sitting drop plates. PCT Pre-Crystallization Test (Hampton Research) was performed to optimize protein concentration at 6 mg/ml. All wt-DDP1 crystals were obtained only in the presence of any of the three groups of ligands. The best cocrystallization conditions for each ligand were discovered by optimization in 48-well plates (Hampton Research). Drop sizes and protein:precipitant ratio were adjusted for each case. Final crystallization conditions for each crystal complex are listed in table S2. Sequentially microseeding and a protein:precipitant 3:1 ratio were necessary to improve the quality of the ScDDP1Δnose crystals. Several cryoprotectants were tested, being usually the original crystallization conditions with slightly increased precipitant concentration and plus 25 to 30% (v/v) of cryoprotectant. After gradually changing the crystal drop solution by cryoprotectant solution, crystals were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen (77 K). We performed similar crystallization experiments to obtain structures for mutants and, in the case of DDP1-K63A mutant, obtained crystals in the absence of any ligand. Structural determination Diffraction data were collected at 100 K in beamline BL13-XALOC, in ALBA Synchrotron (Barcelona, Spain) using a PILATUS 6M detector (43). Each dataset was indexed, integrated, and scaled in the XDS program (44), while merging, molecular replacement and refinement were carried out with the CCP4 package: Aimless (45), MOLREP (46), REFMAC5 (47), and Coot (48). All DDP1 crystals share the same spatial group (P3 2 21) and similar unit cell parameters with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. First, the human DIPP1 structure (PDB code 2FVV) was used as a model for molecular replacement of DDP1:InsP 6 structure. Our refined models became the template for the rest of the datasets. Diffraction statistics and final refinement parameters are shown in Table 1. Protein rendering was performed with PyMOL (49) and structural alignments with ESPript and SeaView programs (50, 51). Activity assays Activity assays were performed using the Malachite Green Phosphate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). In this assay, free orthophosphate generated in the sample reacts with molybdate and green malachite creating a colorimetric complex, measurable in the visible spectrum with high sensitivity. Activity of 10 nM wt-DDP1 was quantified with substrates HMP (5 to 50 μM) at 303 K, taking an aliquot every 2 to 3 min for 30 min. Reactions were carried out in buffer C [100 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 2 mM MgCl 2 ] (11). Transparent 96-well plates (Corning Costar) and a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG LABTECH) were used to measure absorbance at 620 nm of each sample. The activities of mutants were also quantified using the same procedure as for wt-DDP1. All data presented correspond to the mean of triplicate measurements. Fluorescence thermal shift assays Protein denaturation was recorded by measuring intrinsic protein fluorescence at 330 and 350 nm over a range of temperatures using Tycho NT.6 equipment (NanoTemper Technologies). The changes in fluorescence signal indicate transitions in the folding state of a protein. The temperature at which a transition occurs is called the inflection temperature (T i ). The fluorescence recorded during the thermal run is plotted as 350/330-nm ratio and used to calculate T i automatically by the Tycho NT.6 software. The protocol optimized by the manufacturer consists of 3 min of heating, 10 μl of sample in a very thin capillary, and a ramp from 35° (308 K) to 95°C (368 K). For the experiment, the DDP1 concentration was diluted to 0.25 mg/ml (11.5 μM) with buffer A and pH adjusted with final buffer of 0.1 M [MMT (pH 4.0), sodium acetate (pH 4.5), sodium acetate (pH 5.0), bis-tris (pH 6.0), Hepes (pH 7.0), tris-HCl (pH 8.0), or MMT (pH 9.0) depending on each experiment]. It was then mixed with ligands between 100 and 1000 μM.

55,55,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Mitochondrial respiration controls the Prox1-Vegfr3 feedback loop during lymphatic endothelial cell fate specification and maintenance - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabe7359,"Recent findings indicate that mitochondrial respiration regulates blood endothelial cell proliferation; however, its role in differentiating lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is unknown. We hypothesized that mitochondria could work as a sensor of LECs’ metabolic specific needs by determining their functional requirements according to their differentiation status and local tissue microenvironment. Accordingly, we conditionally deleted the QPC subunit of mitochondrial complex III in differentiating LECs of mouse embryos. Unexpectedly, mutant mice were devoid of a lymphatic vasculature by mid-gestation, a consequence of the specific down-regulation of main LEC fate regulators, particularly Vegfr3, leading to the loss of LEC fate. Mechanistically, this is a result of reduced H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in the genomic locus of key LEC fate controllers (e.g., Vegfr3 and Prox1). Our findings indicate that by sensing the LEC differentiation status and microenvironmental metabolic conditions, mitochondrial complex III regulates the critical Prox1-Vegfr3 feedback loop and, therefore, LEC fate specification and maintenance.

Recent studies suggested that cellular metabolism is a crucial regulator of endothelial cell (EC) function and (lymph)angiogenesis ( 5 – 13 ). For example, it was shown that Prox1-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a) promotes fatty acid oxidation (FAO); thus, it increases acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) levels that are necessary for LEC differentiation ( 10 ). Acetyl-CoA also participates in the histone acetylation of various lymphangiogenic genes catalyzed by the lysine acetyltransferase P300 as part of the Prox1-P300 complex ( 10 ). In addition, ketone body oxidation by 3-oxoacid-CoA-transferase-1 (OXCT1) generates acetyl-CoA, which sustains the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for aspartate and deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis that is required for LEC proliferation ( 13 ). It was also shown that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in LECs stimulates c-MYC expression, which, in turn, increases hexokinase 2 (HK2) levels and promotes glycolytic flux ( 7 ). Inactivation of FGF receptors or c-MYC/HK2 impairs LEC proliferation and lymphatic development ( 7 ). To evaluate metabolic requirements during mammalian developmental lymphangiogenesis, we functionally inactivated the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III QPC subunit. Mitochondrial respiration participates in three distinct mitochondria functions: oxidative phosphorylation for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, oxidative TCA cycle flux to produce metabolites for macromolecule biosynthesis, and release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and TCA cycle metabolites to determine cell fate and/or function. In blood endothelial cells (BECs), it was recently reported that mitochondrial complex III is required for their proliferation during angiogenesis ( 14 ). Using in vivo and in vitro approaches, we now demonstrate that functional inactivation of mitochondrial complex III impairs lymphatic development, resulting in mouse embryos fully devoid of a lymphatic vasculature. We show that this phenotype is because mitochondrial respiration–deficient LECs fail to maintain LEC fate, a consequence of the specific down-regulation of LEC markers, particularly that of Vegfr3, which, in turn, disrupts the maintenance of the Prox1-Vegfr3 feedback loop. We demonstrate that down-regulation in the expression of LEC genes is likely triggered by the reduction in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications at specific target promoters, particularly those of Vegfr3 and Prox1.

Recent discoveries have changed our conventional views about the roles of lymphatics in health and disease. In addition to its traditional role as a route for the transport of fluid and immune cells, increasing evidences suggest that lymphatics are important tissue-specific players in major physiological and pathophysiological processes. Work performed during the past few decades revealed the first molecular insights into lymphatic vascular development. The master transcription factor Prox1 and Vegfc/Vegfr3 signaling are key regulators of early lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) fate specification and developmental lymphangiogenesis ( 1 – 3 ). Our previous work identified a feedback loop between Prox1 and Vegfr3 critical for regulating the number of LEC progenitors and budding LECs produced in the murine cardinal vein (CV) during development and for maintaining LEC fate ( 4 ). However, how this feedback loop is turned on/off is currently unknown. Accordingly, identifying its control mechanisms will provide essential insights into this critical step in developmental lymphangiogenesis.

RESULTS

Mitochondrial complex III is necessary for lymphatic vasculature formation To investigate the role of the mitochondrial respiratory chain on LEC homeostasis, we took advantage of Uqcrq conditional knockout mice (QPC flox) (14, 15). Uqcrq encodes the QPC protein, a critical subunit of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. QPC floxed mice were crossed to PdpnGFPCre mice (16) to generate QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre null mice (QPC mutants) and control littermates. In those mutant mice, QPC starts to be deleted in Pdpn-expressing budding LECs once outside the CV at around embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). We were unable to obtain live born QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre pups, suggesting that mitochondrial respiration deficiency in LECs is embryonic lethal (table S1). Accordingly, QPC mutant embryos were collected at different stages to analyze their organ-associated lymphatic vasculature. At E14.5, QPC mutant embryos exhibit severe edema (Fig. 1, A and B). Whole-mount immunostaining of the embryonic dorsal skin using antibodies against VE-cadherin (VEcad) and Prox1 revealed that QPC mutants are largely devoid of a lymphatic network, although few scattered LECs are sometimes still detected at this stage (Fig. 1, C, D, and I). No obvious alterations were seen in the blood vasculature morphology or coverage (Fig. 1, D and J). We extended this analysis to other tissues and found that similar to the skin, at E16.5, no mesenteric or cardiac lymphatics are present in mutant embryos (Fig. 1, E to H and K and L). Therefore, we concluded that QPC deficiency in those differentiating LECs results in the complete absence of a lymphatic vasculature at mid-gestation. Fig. 1 QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre embryos show edema and lack LECs. (A and B) E14.5 QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre mutant embryos exhibit severe dermal edema (white arrow) (n = 5). (C and D) Whole-mount immunostaining of the dermal lymphatics of those embryos using Prox1 and VEcad antibodies (n = 4) shows that lymphatic vessels (red) are missing from the skin of the mutant embryos. Whole-mount immunostaining of control and mutant E16.5 mesenteric (E and F) and cardiac (dorsal view) (G and H) lymphatics (n = 4) revealed that lymphatics were also absent in these organs. Dermal lymphatic vessel length (I), blood vessel density (J), mesenteric lymphatic vessel length (K), and cardiac lymphatic vessel length (L) are quantified by ImageJ and shown as a percentage of the mean of total vessel length in the control group. All results are presented as means ± SEM and analyzed with a two-tailed Student’s t test. Scale bars, 2 mm (A and B), 200 μm (C and D), 75 μm (E and F), and 500 μm (G and H). To target LEC progenitors inside the CV, QPC floxed mice were also crossed with Prox1CreERT2 mice, and Cre recombination was induced by tamoxifen injection at E9.5 and E10.5. At E14.5, these mutant embryos also exhibit edema (fig. S1, A and B); however, different to QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre embryos, lymphatics are present, although their numbers were severely reduced (fig. S1, C, D, and I). Those lymphatics have less branch points such that they also fail to interconnect and form a normal-looking vascular network (fig. S1, C to J). In addition, Vegfr3 expression levels were reduced in the mutant lymphatics (fig. S1, G, H, and K). One possible explanation for the difference in the severity of the phenotypes when using the constitutive PdpnGFPCre or the inducible Prox1CreERT2 is that, in general, deletion is less efficient when using tamoxifen-inducible Cre strains. We found that deletion efficiency is about 75% in CD31+Lyve1+ LECs that were fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)–sorted from E16.5 QPCf/f;Prox1CreERT2 embryos, in which Cre was induced by tamoxifen injections at E13.5 and E14.5 (fig. S1L). In addition, Prox1 drives Cre activity to early LEC progenitors inside the CV; instead, as shown by green fluorescent protein (GFP) staining, PdpnGFPCre expression initiates later on in differentiating LECs outside the veins (fig. S2). Accordingly, as BECs and LECs have different transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic profiles (10, 17–19), it is likely that LEC progenitors inside the veins still retain much of their original underlying BEC metabolic profile; therefore, their mitochondrial respiration requirements are likely different than those from LECs outside the CV. However, once those LEC progenitors bud off outside the CV and start migrating, a consequence of their de novo expression of additional LEC makers (e.g., Pdpn), they differentiate further, acquiring a more definitive LEC fate. As LEC differentiation and migration progress, it is likely that their metabolic status changes accordingly such that, around mid-gestation, QPC becomes necessary for LEC fate maintenance. Hence, given the severity of the QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre phenotype, for the rest of this study, we only used this mutant strain.

LEC fate specification and migration take place in early-stage QPCf/f;PdpnGFPCre embryos To identify the mechanisms leading to the lack of LECs in QPC mutants, we examined earlier developmental stages. Immunostaining of the jugular region in E11.5 mutant embryos identified Prox1-expressing LECs budding from the CV into the surrounding mesenchyme (fig. S3, A to D), a result indicating that initial LEC fate specification and migration take place in mitochondrial respiration–deficient LECs. Nevertheless, quantification of the Prox1+ LECs outside the CV revealed that their numbers are reduced in E11.5 QPC mutant embryos (fig. S3I). To evaluate whether this reduction is a consequence of reduced proliferation and/or increased apoptosis, we performed Ki67 and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) analysis. The number of proliferating Ki67+ Prox1+ LECs is reduced in the mutant embryos at E11.5 and E12.5 (fig. S3, C, D, G, H, and J); however, TUNEL+ Prox1+ LECs are rarely observed in either control or mutant embryos (fig. S3, A, B, E, and F). We validated that the proliferating LECs were QPC nulls by costaining against the GFP reporter included into the PdpnGFPCre strain. As shown in fig. S4, A to H, the Ki67+ Prox1+ LECs were also GFP+, confirming that they are QPC null LECs. Their numbers were reduced when compared to controls (fig. S4).These data suggest that the lack of mitochondrial activity in LECs does not promote cell death, but similar to BECs (14), its activity is required for LEC proliferation.

LEC proliferation and migration in vitro require QPC activity Because QPC conditional mutant embryos lack LECs, we used an alternative in vitro assay to better characterize the observed in vivo phenotypes. We treated human LECs with the mitochondrial complex III inhibitor antimycin A, a drug known to reduce the oxygen consumption rate (OCR); however, cells can still generate ATP by glycolysis. As expected, in antimycin A–treated LECs, basal and maximal OCR is inhibited and maximal glycolysis is used (fig. S8, A to C). In addition, blockage of mitochondrial electron transport results in a decreased NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide)/NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) ratio as previously reported (fig. S8D) (14, 15) but does not affect mitochondrial content as quantified by fluorescence intensity using MitoTracker Green (fig. S8, E to G). In agreement with the reduced LEC proliferation observed in vivo, cell numbers are significantly reduced in LEC cultures treated with antimycin A for 24 and 48 hours (fig. S8, H and I). This reduction is a direct consequence of decreased cell proliferation as measured by phospho–histone H3 staining (fig. S8, H to J), whereas no changes in the number of TUNEL-positive cells are observed (fig. S8, H and K). This effect of mitochondrial respiration on LEC proliferation is similar to what was previously reported for BECs (14). Next, to distinguish alterations as a consequence of decreased cell proliferation from other ones resulting from defective mitochondrial respiration, we pretreated LEC cultures with mitomycin C to block proliferation and then treated these arrested cultures with antimycin A or vehicle control. As shown in fig. S9A, mitomycin C treatment efficiently inhibited LEC proliferation. Then, using a trans-well migration assay, we confirmed that LEC migration toward a vascular endothelial growth factor–C (VEGF-C) gradient is also reduced in the respiration-deficient LECs (fig. S9, B to D). In addition, we determined that respiration-deficient LECs migrate more slowly compared to controls in a wound scratch migration assay (fig. S9, E to I). Together, these results argue that mitochondrial respiration is required for LEC proliferation and migration in vitro.

Mitochondrial complex III inhibition also down-regulates Vegfr3 expression in vitro To determine whether the lack of mitochondrial respiration also affects LEC fate in vitro, LECs were treated with antimycin A and expression of the lymphatic markers Prox1, Vegfr3, and Nrp2 and the pan-EC marker VEcad was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of those LEC markers is reduced in the antimycin A–treated LECs, while that of VEcad is increased. These results were validated further using myxothiazol, another mitochondrial complex III inhibitor (Fig. 6B) (22). These qPCR results are also confirmed at the protein level using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 6, C and D). Similarly, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of QPC also reduces Vegfr3 and Prox1, but not VEcad, protein levels (fig. S10, A and B). Previous studies using cultured human LECs showed that Nrp1 and ICAM1 are up-regulated when LEC fate is lost upon Prox1 knockdown (19, 23, 24). We found that antimycin A or myxothiazol treatment of cultured LECs increases Nrp1 and ICAM1 mRNA levels; however, those of CD34 are reduced in LECs treated with antimycin A (fig. S11, A and B). These results suggest that there are some environmental (in vivo/cultured) or species (human/mice) differences among LECs in their response to those assays. To evaluate such possibility, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using LECs treated with vehicle or antimycin A and analyzed differences among previously reported BEC and LEC markers (25). We found that nearly all LEC genes included in that dataset were down-regulated, and half of the BEC genes were up-regulated, including Nrp1 and ICAM1 (Fig. 6, E and F). To further evaluate the specificity of mitochondrial complex III inhibitors on mitochondrial respiration in the observed phenotypes, we expressed the Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase (AOX) in LECs. This enzyme is capable of accepting electrons, therefore bypassing complex III and IV functions and restoring normal electron transport chain activity in the presence of complex III inhibition (14, 26–28).To do this, LECs were transduced with lentiviral particles containing AOX-GFP or with an empty GFP vector control and GFP+ LECs were enriched by FACS. We found that antimycin A diminishes OCR and the NAD+/NADH ratio in cells transduced with the empty vector (EV), while AOX expression restores normal OCR and NAD+/NADH ratio in antimycin A–treated LECs (Fig. 7, A and B). Furthermore, AOX restores proliferative capacity (Fig. 7C) and the expression levels of Vegfr3, Prox1, and Nrp2 (Fig. 7D) in antimycin A–treated LECs. Together, these data demonstrate the specificity of antimycin A treatment, and that its effects on Vegfr3 expression are a consequence of complex III inhibition. Fig. 6 Mitochondrial complex III respiration is required for Vegfr3 and Prox1 expression maintenance in cultured LECs. (A) Antimycin A (Anti) treatment reduces Prox1 (n = 9), Vegfr3 (n = 9), and Nrp2 (n = 5) mRNA levels but not those of VEcad (n = 3). (B) Myxothiazol (Myx) treatment also reduces Prox1 (n = 4), Vegfr3 (n = 6), and Nrp2 (n = 3) mRNA levels but not those of VEcad (n = 3). (C) Representative Western blot shows that antimycin A and myxothiazol treatment reduces VEGFR3 (n = 6) and PROX1 (n = 6) levels but not those of VECAD (n = 5 to 6). (D) Quantification of the densitometry of each protein normalized to GAPDH and shown as fold change compared to controls. Each data point represents a biological replicate. All results are presented as means ± SEM and analyzed by multiple t test in (A) and (B) or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in (D). (E and F) RNA-seq of LECs treated with vehicle or antimycin A shows that expression of most LEC genes in the dataset is reduced, while almost half of the BEC genes are up-regulated, including Nrp1 and ICAM1 (n = 3). Fig. 7 LECs expressing AOX restore oxygen consumption, NAD+/NADH ratio, proliferation, and Vegfr3 levels in the presence of antimycin. Antimycin A inhibits OCR (A), NAD+/NADH ratio (B), and cell proliferation (C) in LECs transduced with EV-GFP, while AOX rescues OCR (n = 3 to 4) (A), NAD+/NADH ratio (n = 3) (B), and cell proliferation (n = 3) (C) in the presence of antimycin A. AOX also rescued the Vegfr3, Prox1, and Nrp2 levels in the presence of antimycin A (D) (n = 5 to 6). Each data point represents a biological replicate. All results are presented as means ± SEM and analyzed by one-way ANOVA for (A) to (C) or two-way ANOVA for (D).

QPC-deficient LECs have reduced nucleotide synthesis Mitochondrial complex I oxidizes NADH to NAD+ and passes two electrons to ubiquinone within the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Blockage of electron transfer at mitochondrial complex III impairs the cells’ capacity to regenerate NAD+ and decreases TCA cycle flux (14, 15, 26). The TCA cycle metabolites succinate, fumarate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) competitively inhibit α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)–dependent dioxygenases, such as the Jumonji C domain–containing histone lysine demethylases (JmJC) and the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of 5-methlycytosine hydroxylases (29). Accumulation of these metabolites in mitochondrial respiration–deficient hematopoietic stem cells impairs their differentiation, a phenotype associated with hypermethylation of DNA and histones (30). In addition, the TCA cycle intermediate acetyl-CoA is the acetyl donor in histone acetyltransferase reactions. Loss of mitochondrial respiratory functions leads to hypoacetylation of histone 3 markers in cancer cells (26). Acetyl-CoA derived from FAO and ketone body oxidation is important for lymphangiogenic gene regulation and LEC proliferation (10, 13). Therefore, we performed metabolic profiling of antimycin A– or control vehicle–treated LECs. We found that respiration-deficient LECs exhibit reduced citrate, fumarate, and malate levels, but the succinate (Fig. 8A) and 2HG levels are increased (Fig. 8B). These changes could potentially influence histone methylation and acetylation. Next, we treated LECs with cell-permeable 1 mM dimethyl succinate or octyl-L2HG and found that octyl-L2HG, but not dimethyl succinate, reduces Prox1 and Vegfr3 mRNA and protein levels (fig. S12, A to F). We also treated the cultured LECs with 1 mM dimethyl α-KG with and without antimycin A. Although the Vegfr3 and Prox1 levels increased in the presence of antimycin A, the effect was not statistically significant (fig. S12, G and H). Fig. 8 Mitochondrial respiration is required for epigenetic regulation of Vegfr3 and Prox1. Mitochondrial complex III inhibition with antimycin A alters TCA cycle metabolites (A) and 2HG levels (B). Values are normalized to mean of control group. (C) ChIP-seq analysis of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1 histone modifications in LEC cultures treated with vehicle control (Ctrl) or antimycin A (Anti) for 48 hours. Track examples for LEC-specific genes (Prox1 and Vegfr3) and BEC genes (Nrp1 and ICAM1) are shown. Antimycin A–treated LECs show a marked reduction in the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac signal at the Vegfr3 locus and a reduction in H3K4me3 in the Prox1 locus, while H3K27ac peaks are increased in the Nrp1 and ICAM1 locus. (D) ChIP-seq analysis of the same modifications in (C) in LECs and BECs reveals that H3K27ac and H3K4me3 peaks are elevated in the Prox1 and Vegfr3 loci in LECs, whereas those of Nrp1 and ICAM1 are reduced in LECs and BECs. Scale bar, 5 kb. Each data point represents a biological replicate. All results are presented as means ± SEM and analyzed by multiple t test or two-tailed Student’s t test. We also found that the levels of most amino acids are not significantly changed after antimycin A treatment (fig. S13A). Glutamine metabolism in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) fuels the TCA cycle of ECs to support EC proliferation (9). Accordingly, we noticed that glutamate levels are diminished after antimycin A treatment of LECs (fig. S13A), a result that might be associated with the observed decrease in cell proliferation. We also found a general reduction in nucleotides (fig. S13, B and C). These data suggest that, in LECs, mitochondrial complex III mainly supports nucleotide synthesis.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/18/eabe7359/F1.large.jpg,"['prox1vegfr3', 'endothelial', 'antimycin', 'qpc', 'lymphatic', 'maintenance', 'feedback', 'fate', 'complex', 'loop', 'mitochondrial', 'respiration', 'lec', 'lecs', 'fig', 'prox1', 'vegfr3', 'specification', 'proliferation']",

Investigators conducted a literature search on PubMed from January 1990 to November 2020 about the etiology of rosacea, including the role of UV radiation and the exposome, and nonpharmacologic therapies that focus on photoprotection.1

Rosacea may be caused by the dysregulation of innate and adaptive immune systems and/or neurovascular dysfunction, a disrupted skin barrier, and a genetic predisposition. The exposome may be a leading factor in inducing this impaired immune or neurovascular response, according to the researchers.

Lifetime UV radiation exposure is significantly associated with rosacea and is the most important overall environmental variable, noted the study authors. UV radiation is involved in all key aspects of the disorder, including skin inflammation, neoangiogenesis, telangiectasia, and fibrosis.

Air pollution, smoking, nutrition, stress, and heat can all trigger or exacerbate rosacea. The use of soap-free gentle facial cleansers and cosmetically pleasing moisturizers without fragrance are recommended, according to the investigators.

Sun protection is key to effective management of the disorder. “Daily use of a very high-tolerance broad spectrum sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 is necessary,” stated the researchers.

Determining the best sunscreen for patients with rosacea can be challenging, however, as studies are lacking. The researchers cited a published report tested a novel water-based sunscreen SPF 50+ containing 5 UV filters, 2 emollients, and 3 skin conditioners that found that patients had significantly less erythema, dryness, and scaling after 21 days. Another study found that a tinted daily SPF-30 facial moisturizer improved skin appearance and dryness, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased electrical capacitance was also mentioned.

“Products with broadband UV protection, water-based, easy to remove, containing ingredients with emollient, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasoregulatory properties should be preferred,” advised the study authors. “The use of tinted sunscreens or those containing green pigment for camouflage could be considered and discussed with the patient.”

To address these targets classes, we explored kinetically controlled proteases as structural dynamics–sensitive druggability probes in native-state and disease-relevant proteins. By using low–Reynolds number flows, such that a single or a few protease incisions are made, we could identify antibody binding sites (epitopes) that were translated into short-sequence antigens for antibody production. We obtained molecular-level information of the epitope-paratope region and could produce high-affinity antibodies with programmed pharmacological function against difficult-to-drug targets. We demonstrate the first stimulus-selective monoclonal antibodies targeting the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, a clinically validated pain target widely considered undruggable with antibodies, and apoptosis-inducing antibodies selectively mediating cytotoxicity in KRAS-mutated cells. It is our hope that this platform will widen the scope of antibody therapeutics for the benefit of patients.

INTRODUCTION

Although there has been tremendous development of antibody technologies and antibody-based therapeutics over the past 20 years, it is unexpected that only 60 unique antibody therapeutics (based on target) are available to patients (1). Both G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels are particularly underexploited for antibody-based therapeutics. For GPCRs, there are only two marketed monoclonal antibody therapies (1) while several are in development (2). For ion channels, there are no market-approved monoclonal antibodies (1–3). A small number of monoclonal antibodies that target ion channels with large extracellular (EC) regions (e.g., P2X channels) have been developed; however, ion channels with small EC regions, including transient-receptor potential (TRP) channels, are extremely challenging to target with antibodies (2, 4).

Current technologies for antibody development largely rely on producing antigens, either from whole or parts of proteins. When these are structurally stable in solution and maintain their native disease-relevant state and meaningful epitope structure throughout the discovery cycle, they can successfully be used with the hybridoma technology (5), phage display, and other screening-based technologies (6). These approaches have been highly successful, in particular, for soluble proteins. Another strategy for antibody development is based on predicting suitable epitope regions based on, e.g., crystal structures or a bioinformatic (in silico) evaluation of the protein sequence.

Independent of approach, poor results have been obtained for antibody development against ion channels and other multipass transmembrane proteins, typically having poorly exposed surface area. In contrast, several single-pass membrane proteins with large exposed surface area such as SLAMF7, CTLA-4, HER2, CD30, PD-L1, and PD-1 (1) have been successfully developed. The fundamental problem with multipass membrane proteins has been that the native state is not preserved unless they are embedded or anchored in a lipid membrane and, furthermore, that they have complex structural dynamics that are difficult to capture in vitro or in silico. Multipass transmembrane proteins, such as ion channels, are flexible, exhibiting transitory structural variations that are kT-driven, but also state dependent (open-closed channels, desensitization, and association/binding) (7–10). Conformational transformations may be elicited principally by (i) changes in the membrane potential of a cell (11), (ii) changes of the physical (e.g., temperature) EC environment (12), or (iii) ligand binding (13). Thus, a native protein, such as an ion channel, has a broad spectrum of different structural conformations along with different exposures of regions that may constitute opportunistic targets for ligands or drugs, including antibodies. As visualization, a simulation showing thermally induced fluctuations and motions of a TRP channel at 37°C can be found in movie S1.

Here, we present a new platform technology for antibody development against currently undruggable ion channels and other membrane proteins. This approach can produce antigens for potential epitopes identified on native-state, disease-relevant proteins in motion. The methodology encompasses a series of distinct steps, which are described in detail in the following section. In the subsequent results section, we present example data resulting from different epitope-mapping protocols as well as antibodies developed toward two targets TRPV1 and KRAS, previously undruggable with antibodies.

A protein exposes different accessible regions on its surface dynamically, and the pivotal step of the presented technology is identification of potential antibody binding sites (epitopes) on such dynamic protein structures. For this purpose, first, we use “antibody-like” (see below) proteases as freely diffusing molecular probes, adapting to the real-time dynamics and structural motion of a protein. Second, as further described below, by controlling protease activity (kinetics), only epitopes on native and disease-relevant target structure are identified. A protease specifically cleaves a peptide bond in a native, tertiary structure if said peptide bond is surface exposed (14). The binding interface of several proteases is of similar size as the binding interface of an antibody variable region (Fig. 1A) [i.e., specifically immunoglobulin G (IgG) (15–19)], and the area of the exposed target surface required for protease docking is similar to that required for antibody binding (Fig. 1B). Therefore, these proteases can, in theory, be used as druggability probes for identification of antibody binding sites. The protease, when binding to a target, provides molecular-level information on the location of its catalytic triad, within the docking area of the target protein, and yields a protease-identified cut site (PIC). The produced PICs are translated into a central point or coordinate in the epitope. The key to success lies in identifying PICs only on relevant protein structure, obtained using limited digestions to avoid target denaturation (20). Suitably, proteolytic activity (kinetics) is controlled using microfluidic flow cells (Fig. 2A) operating at low–Reynolds number flow. Membrane vesicles or cells presenting the target are immobilized on the inner surface of a microfluidic device [an example of a suitable flow cell has previously been presented in detail (21)]. The target is exposed to a protease or sequences of proteases (at a given concentration for a controlled period of time) as step functions with additional treatments, wash steps, and sample collections in-between. Cleaved-off peptides are analyzed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) (Fig. 2A). Flow cells with various surface-to-volume ratios are available to accommodate detection of peptides from small sample volumes (22, 23).

Fig. 1 Schematic drawing comparing key structural features of importance in the protease-target and antibody-target binding interfaces. (A) Area comparison of protease and antibody binding interfaces, exemplified by the proteases proteinase K [Protein Data Bank (PDB), 2id8] and trypsin (PDB, 1h4w), respectively. The images display the bottom and side views of the respective proteases and the variable region in one antibody Fab fragment (the binding region of an antibody) (PDB, 6bae). The catalytic triad in the proteases, and the complementarity determining regions (CDR) of the antibody variable region have been colored red. (B) Binding of a protease to a protein results in a cut in the peptide sequence. Under controlled kinetics conditions in a native protein, this cut is denoted a protease-identified cut site (PIC) and can be used to identify molecular-level information of where protease binding to the target protein has occurred. Because of size similarity of the area of the protease-binding surface and the CDR of the variable region, a PIC is predictive of a region that can be bound by an antibody.

Fig. 2 Schematic drawing showing the workflow in the platform from identification of antibody binding sites to the final antibody product. (A) The protein target is immobilized within a microfluidic flow cell, either in whole cells or in membrane-derived vesicles, enabling exposure of the protein to sequential protease digestion under controlled kinetic conditions, resulting in the release of peptides that is identified with MS/MS. A combination of distinct kinetically controlled proteolysis steps are used. (1) The protein is exposed to a protease under cold kinetic conditions that creates one or a few cuts. Release of peptides for analysis occurs if cuts are close in sequence. To also detect single cuts, (2) a protease with complementary specificity is used under hot kinetic conditions for peptide harvest. Released peptides are identified using MS/MS where cold kinetic cut sites made on the native protein are considered for further analysis. Identified cold kinetic cut sites are denoted PICs. LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography–MS/MS. (B) Identified PICs are mapped onto a 3D structure of the target to visualize the distribution of accessible areas for antibody binding, identifying discontinuous and continuous epitopes, respectively. Epitope sequence is correlated against functional information to filter and sort epitopes that would yield binders, agonists, or antagonists. (C) Synthetic antigens mimicking the identified epitopes on the protein target are used to produce optimized antibodies using either immunization or antibody library screening (e.g., phage display). (D) Schematic of hASO where antigens and antibodies are optimized toward an epitope region through an iterative process. Small changes in antigen position/sequence/structure are introduced in each step, and the characteristics of each resulting antibody are evaluated until the desired properties (affinity, selectivity, and function) have been achieved.

Digestion protocols are tailored on the basis of target sequence. Proteases with different specificity are used in parallel to maximize amino acid sequence coverage, or they can be used sequentially to increase detection. A first step involves subjecting a target to a protease under “cold” kinetic conditions, i.e., controlled reaction rate conditions to make only one or few precision cuts in the target sequence that are predictive of surface exposure and potential antibody binding sites (Fig. 2A). To capture both single and dual cuts, a secondary protease is used under “hot” kinetic conditions to harvest peptides for identification (Fig. 2A). Primary PICs and secondary protease cut sites are easily differentiated by using first and second proteases with different sequence specificity.

Modeling and structure analysis are performed to fit PICs into a three-dimensional (3D) model, to visualize the structure of the exposed surfaces (Fig. 2B). Two types of epitopes are commonly identified. PICs, distant in the amino acid sequence, but within the same surface region of the 3D-folded protein, define a “discontinuous epitope.” PICs closely located in the amino acid sequence and within the same surface region of the folded protein define a “continuous epitope.” If an antagonistic or agonistic antibody is desired, then the epitope sequences are correlated against bioinformatic data on target function to identify epitopes overlapping or coinciding with functionally important regions (Fig. 2B).

Antibody production directed to epitopes identified through PICs and functional correlation is enabled using short synthetic peptide antigens. The antigens are designed on the basis of knowledge of the extended surface area surrounding the PICs that corresponds approximately to the surface area of an antibody-protein binding interface. Short synthetic antigens have few structural degrees of freedom and therefore result in less diverse antibodies using immunization (Fig. 2C) (24, 25). These antigens can be forced into conformations matching the target structure using peptide chemistry (e.g, cyclic, stapled, or nicked peptides). For a discontinuous epitope, multiple antigens are developed where each part, corresponding to the separate sequence segments in the discontinuous epitope, is translated into a peptide antigen. Both immunization and antibody library screening (e.g., phage display) can be used for production against a continuous epitope (Fig. 2C). With immunization, the antibody is in vivo affinity matured against the antigen and with library screening, by choosing suitable libraries; e.g., from patients with autoimmune disease, there is a possibility to select autoantibodies. For a discontinuous epitope, screening antibody libraries against multiple antigens developed for the epitope may select antibodies that bind all parts of the epitope. Subsequently, optimization of epitope-binding antibody candidates is done through a process named human antigen superoptimization (hASO) as shown in Fig. 2D. This is a systematic interrogation of the epitope area with many different antibodies, generated from a plurality of altered antigens. More specifically, antigen libraries are created, where small sequence alterations, i.e., elongations, truncations, and amino acid exchanges, are introduced into the antigens, to find a high-affinity binding antibody. This interrogation requires detailed knowledge of the epitope area, which is inherently provided by the presented technology. Ultimately, this results in an hASO-optimized antigen used to produce the final antibody with an optimal function and affinity profile. The pharmacological profile, and affinity, can be further optimized using traditional antibody engineering strategies, including in vitro affinity maturation. The end product is an antibody, tailored to elicit the optimal binding interaction toward the epitope region through detailed knowledge of both the epitope and paratope sequence, to yield the required disease-modifying functionality.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabe6397/F1.large.jpg,"['protease', 'using', 'binding', 'antibody', 'probes', 'controlled', 'biomolecular', 'surface', 'targets', 'protein', 'kinetically', 'epitope', 'sequence', 'undruggable', 'design', 'rational', 'antigens', 'target', 'antibodies']",

Here, we report that serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) intrinsically regulates the late stage of thymocyte development. Conditional deletion of SRSF1 resulted in severe defects in maintenance of late thymocyte survival and a blockade of the transition of TCRβ hi CD24 + CD69 + immature to TCRβ hi CD24 − CD69 − mature thymocytes, corresponding to a notable reduction of recent thymic emigrants and diminished periphery T cell pool. Mechanistically, SRSF1 regulates the gene networks involved in thymocyte differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and type I interferon signaling pathway to safeguard T cell intrathymic maturation. In particular, SRSF1 directly binds and regulates Irf7 and Il27ra expression via alternative splicing in response to type I interferon signaling. Moreover, forced expression of interferon regulatory factor 7 rectifies the defects in SRSF1-deficient thymocyte maturation via restoring expression of type I interferon–related genes. Thus, our work provides new insight on SRSF1-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of thymocyte development.

Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1; also known as SF2/ASF) is a pivotal posttranscriptional regulator for gene expression in various biological processes ( 16 ). A recent study demonstrated the essential roles of SRSF1 in controlling T cell hyperactivity and systemic autoimmunity ( 17 ). However, the roles of SRSF1 involved in thymocyte development remain unknown. In this study, we report that conditional ablation of SRSF1 in DP thymocytes leads to substantial defects on terminal maturation. We further verified that SRSF1 promotes proliferation and survival of thymocytes by modulating the T cell regulatory networks posttranscriptionally. In particular, SRSF1 controls the abundances of Il27ra and Irf7 via alternative splicing (AS), which are critical in response to type I interferon signaling for supporting thymocyte maturation.

The dynamic alterations of surface markers associated with functional changes are important for understanding the molecular mechanisms guiding T cell intrathymic maturation. For instance, the expression of Qa2 and CD24 (also called heat-stable antigen) is used to define the maturation degree of thymocytes ( 6 – 9 ). According to the expression of CD24 and CD69, TCRβ hi thymocytes can be further subdivided into TCRβ hi CD69 + CD24 + immature and TCRβ hi CD69 − CD24 − mature populations. The TCRβ hi CD69 + CD24 + immature cells are composed of four subsets, including postselection DP thymocytes, CD4 + CD8 lo intermediate cells (IMs), and immature CD4 SP and CD8 SP thymocytes, whereas the TCRβ hi CD69 − CD24 − mature population contains mature CD4 and CD8 SP subsets ( 10 ). During the transition from immature to mature thymocytes, the expression of Qa2, CD62L, and sphingosine 1–phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is up-regulated accompanied with CD69 and CD24 down-regulation to access the emigration ( 11 ). The transition of thymocytes throughout the processes of maturation is dependent on signals transmitted by TCR, cytokine receptors, and various cell surface molecules ( 12 , 13 ), which are critical to successfully sustain their differentiation, antiapoptosis, and proliferation. Over the decades, accumulating studies have shown that a series of mediators are required for these processes, which are largely involved in nuclear factor κB signaling pathway ( 14 ). A recent work by Xing and colleagues ( 15 ) reported that type I interferon signaling is correlated with terminal maturation via up-regulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) expression and promoting the surface Qa2 expression, which provided a new insight into T cell maturation in response to type I interferon signal. However, the complicated mechanisms of T cell terminal maturation are rarely understood.

Intrathymic T cell precursors undergo a step-wise development, originating from CD4 − CD8 − double-negative (DN) thymocytes—which can be further subcategorized into DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4 subsets by tracking the expression of surface markers CD25 and CD44—and then differentiate into the CD4 + CD8 + double-positive (DP) cells ( 1 ). Those DP thymocytes expressing αβ T cell receptors (αβTCRs) that can interact with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules undergo positive selection, resulting in commitment and differentiation into either CD4 + CD8 − or CD4 − CD8 + single-positive (SP) thymocytes, respectively ( 2 , 3 ). Both DP and SP thymocytes with high affinity for TCR-peptide-MHC interaction are forced into negative selection, also termed as clonal deletion by apoptosis, or diverted into alternative lineages, for example, Foxp3 + regulatory T cells ( 4 ). SP thymocytes that survive these processes must still undergo a series of steps for final maturation before they gain functional competency and enter the periphery T cell pool ( 5 ).

RESULTS

SRSF1 plays critical roles in the late stage of thymocyte development To elucidate the function of SRSF1 in the late stage of thymocyte development, we crossed Srsf1fl/fl mice (18) with Lck-Cre mice (19), which drives the Cre recombinase expression by proximal Lck promoter (20) and effectively deletes the floxed gene fragment at the DP stage (21, 22), to conditionally inactivate SRSF1 (Fig. 1A). The expression of SRSF1 at mRNA (fig. S1A) and protein levels (fig. S1B) was determined in distinct subsets including DN3, DN4, ISP, DP, CD4+ SP, and CD8+ SP thymocytes of Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice and littermate Srsf1fl/fl (henceforth called control) mice as controls. The results indicated that SRSF1 was initially ablated from the immature single-positive (ISP) stage and effectively deleted in DP and SP thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice. Compared with controls, Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice exhibited normal size and cellularity of thymus (Fig. 1B). The frequency and cell numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ thymocytes from SRSF1-deficient mice were substantially decreased (Fig. 1, C and D). Whereas no statistical difference in absolute numbers of DP and DN thymocytes was observed, there was a notable increase in the frequency of these two subsets (Fig. 1, C and D). Since SRSF1 was not deleted in DN3 and DN4 subsets (fig. S1, A and B), Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice exhibited normal early T cell development and TCRβ rearrangement in DN3 and DN4 subsets (fig. S1, C to F). Fig. 1 SRSF1 is critical for T cell late stage development. (A) Lck-Cre (proximal) mice were crossed with Srsf1fl/fl strain to generate conditional knockout mice.

(C) Representative pseudocolor plot shows classic subsets of thymocytes with CD4 and CD8 staining. (D) Frequency and numbers of DN, DP, CD4+, and CD8+ thymocytes are statistically shown, respectively (control: n = 9; Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+: n = 8). (E) Characterization of postselection thymocytes. TCRβhi thymocytes (top row) were detected by flow cytometry and further fractionated into CD69+CD24+ immature and CD69−CD24− mature subsets (second row). The immature subsets were subdivided into CD4+ SP, CD4+CD8lo, DP, and CD8+ SP populations (clockwise from top left in the third row), and the mature subsets were further subdivided into CD4+ and CD8+ populations (bottom row). (F) Frequency and numbers of indicated subsets are shown accordingly (control: n = 9; Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+: n = 8). (G) Qa2 and CD69 expression on TCRβhi SP thymocytes. (H) Frequency and numbers of Qa2−CD69−and Qa2+CD69− populations of TCRβhi SP thymocytes are shown, respectively (control: n = 4; Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+: n = 5). Cumulative data are means ± SEM. ns, not statistically significant; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). Data are from at least three independent experiments. We next focused on the postselection TCRβhi thymocytes. The frequency and cell numbers of TCRβhi thymocytes (top row in Fig. 1, E and F) and TCRβhiCD69−CD24− mature subset (second row in Fig. 1, E and F) were decreased by ~50% or more from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice compared with those from controls. The frequency of TCRβhiCD69+CD24+ immature T cell exhibited a relative increase, but the numbers were remarkably diminished (second row in Fig. 1, E and F). We further analyzed the subpopulations via the expression of CD4 and CD8, reflecting the subsequent developmental processes. Among the TCRβhiCD69+CD24+ immature subsets, the percentages of DP, CD4+CD8lo IMs, and CD4+ SP subsets were not significantly alerted, but the absolute numbers of these subsets were remarkably decreased in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (third row in Fig. 1, E and F). Both frequency and absolute numbers of CD8+ SP in TCRβhiCD69+CD24+ immature subset were notably reduced in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (third row in Fig. 1, E and F). In SRSF1-deficient TCRβhiCD69−CD24− mature population, the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ SP were markedly diminished, although the frequency of CD4+ SP was increased, whereas the frequency of CD8+ SP was reduced (bottom row in Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, TCRβhiCD4+CD69−Qa2+ and TCRβhiCD8+CD69−Qa2+ mature thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice were substantially decreased (Fig. 1, G and H). To exclude the possible effects of Lck-Cre transgene on thymocyte development, we next performed the phenotypic assay from littermates Srsf1fl/fl, LckCre/+ (Lck-Cre transgene heterozygous), and Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice, respectively. The LckCre/+ mice exhibited normal thymocyte development compared with that in control mice, whereas defective phenotype was only detected in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (fig. S1, G and H). These data indicated that aberrant development of thymocytes in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice was attributed to SRSF1 deficiency, but it was irrelevant to heterozygous Lck-Cre transgene. Collectively, these results suggest that SRSF1 is essential for the late stage of T cell development and terminal maturation of SP thymocytes.

Ablation of SRSF1 impairs recent thymic emigrants and the peripheral T cell pool We next investigated whether the peripheral T cell pool was affected in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice. The spleen exhibited normal size, but total cell numbers of spleen were noticeably decreased in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (Fig. 2A). Both size and cell numbers of lymph nodes (LNs) from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice were substantially reduced compared with those from controls (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, the mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations in spleens, LNs, and peripheral blood cells (PBCs) were remarkably diminished in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (Fig. 2, B and C). The residual peripheral T cells in spleen from SRSF1-deficient mice were predominantly CD44hiCD62Llo subset (fig. S2, A and B), exhibiting an activated/effector phenotype, which is generally associated with “homeostatic” expansion owing to lymphopenia (23). We further confirmed that the remaining T cells in spleen are “escapees” without effective deletion of SRSF1 (fig. S2C). Given that aberrant thymocyte emigration is one of the crucial factors contributing to impaired peripheral mature T cell pool (11, 24), we set up mice models to directly trace the recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) in vivo by crossing Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ or control mice to RAG2p-GFP (green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice (termed as Rag2GFP mice), which were applied for identifying the RTEs in periphery based on GFP expression (25). We observed that both the frequency and absolute numbers of RTEs were markedly decreased in spleens, LNs, and PBCs from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+Rag2GFP mice in comparison with those from Rag2GFP mice (Fig. 2, D to F). Expression of molecules related to migration such as CD62L, CCR7, and S1PR1 was determined in TCRβhiCD69−CD24− mature thymocytes. We found that all three makers had no altered expression in TCRβhiCD69−CD24−CD4+ SP thymocytes, and S1PR1 expression was not changed in TCRβhiCD69−CD24−CD8+ SP thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice. Whereas CD62L expression was down-regulated, CCR7 expression was up-regulated in SRSF1-deficient TCRβhiCD69−CD24−CD8+ SP thymocytes, respectively (fig. S2, D and E). We further performed analysis of the RTEs in spleen. Although most RTEs kept the naïve status right after egress from the thymus, the percentage of naïve RTEs (CD44loCD62Lhi) was still lower in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+Rag2GFP mice than that in littermate Rag2GFP mice, whereas the frequency of activated RTEs (CD44loCD62Lhi) was elevated due to SRSF1 deficiency (fig. S2, F and G). However, the absolute numbers of both naïve and activated RTEs were notably diminished due to the ablation of SRSF1 (fig. S2G). Meanwhile, the SRSF1-deficient splenic RTEs retained efficient deletion of SRSF1 (fig. S2H) and exhibited elevated apoptosis (fig. S2, I and J), resulting in failure to replenish the peripheral T cell pool. Collectively, SRSF1 deficiency resulted in notably diminished RTEs and impaired peripheral T cell pool. Fig. 2 SRSF1 deficiency impairs the peripheral T cell pool due to severe reduction of RTEs. (A) Images and cell numbers of spleens and LNs from control (n = 9) and Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ (n = 8) mice.

SRSF1 is critical for survival of postselection thymocytes and proliferation of mature thymocytes Given the elevated apoptosis in SRSF1-deficient RTEs, we extended the apoptosis assay in distinct subsets of postselection TCRβhi thymocytes during the maturation from CD69+CD24+ to CD69−CD24− thymocytes. We found that the percentages of annexin V+ cells were substantially increased in all subsets of TCRβhi thymocytes (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that SRSF1 is crucial for survival of thymocytes during the late stage development. To determine the role of SRSF1 in thymocyte proliferation, we performed 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay in DP and mature thymocytes. We found that SRSF1 deficiency leads to a substantial defect in proliferation of mature CD4+ SP and CD8+ SP thymocytes but does not affect the expansion in both TCRβloCD69−CD4+CD8+ pre-DP cells and TCRβhiCD69+CD24+CD4+CD8+ post-DP cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicated that SRSF1 deficiency specially caused defects in proliferation of mature thymocytes before egress. Given that interleukin-7 (IL-7) signaling is essential for T cell survival and proliferation of the late stage of thymocyte subpopulations (26), IL-7Rα is down-regulated in DP thymocytes but up-regulated in SP thymocytes (27). We then detected IL-7Rα expression in mature TCRβhiCD69−CD24− CD4+ or CD8+ SP thymocytes. The expression level of IL-7Rα was remarkably reduced in mature SP thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (Fig. 3, E and F). Accordingly, the expression of proapoptotic genes Bax and Bcl2l11 was notably up-regulated in SRSF1-deficient mature CD4+ or CD8+ SP thymocytes (Fig. 3G). These data thus demonstrated that SRSF1 deficiency resulted in defective proliferation, which is in accordance with the impaired IL-7Rα expression in mature SP thymocytes. Fig. 3 SRSF1 is required for thymocyte proliferation and survival. (A and B) Apoptosis in postselection thymocyte subsets was analyzed with annexin V staining. Representative histograms (A) show the percentages of annexin V+ cells in indicated subsets from control (n = 6) and Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ (n = 7) mice. Cumulative data on frequency of annexin V+ cells are shown in (B).

Representative contour plots (C) show BrdU+ cells in indicated subsets from control (top row) and Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (bottom row). Cumulative data on frequency of BrdU+ cells are shown in (D) (n = 7 per group).

Cumulative data on geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) are shown in (F). The geometric mean fluorescence intensity of IL-7Rα from control cells was set as 1, and its relative expression in cells from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice was normalized accordingly. (G) qPCR validation of genes involved in apoptosis in mature CD4+ and CD8+ SP thymocytes from control (n = 5) and Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ (n = 4) mice. The relative expression of each transcript (after normalization to Gapdh) in control cells was set as 1 and that in cells from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice was normalized accordingly. Cumulative data are means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). All data are from at least three independent experiments. To further confirm the defects in thymocyte survival and proliferation, excluding the microenvironment factors, we performed thymocyte transfer assay in vivo as depicted in fig. S3A. Compared with the well-maintained wild-type (WT) donor cells in the hosts, those cells derived from SRSF1-deficient donor were substantially decreased on both days 3 and 7 after transfer (fig. S3, B and C). The transferred cells did not undergo proliferation on day 3, and the expansion of donor cells can be traced on day 7 after transfer (28). Therefore, the results on these two check time points strongly suggested that SRSF1 deletion resulted in inherent survival and proliferation defects in the thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice.

SRSF1 regulates T cell development in a cell-intrinsic manner To determine whether the defects on thymocyte development in the absence of SRSF1 are caused in a cell-intrinsic manner, we generated bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice as the flowchart depicted in Fig. 4A, and the recipient mice were analyzed 10 weeks after reconstitution. Under the identical environment from recipients, Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ (CD45.2+) BM-derived thymocytes phenocopied primary SRSF1-deficient mice, exhibiting an increase in the frequency of DP cells and a remarkable decrease in percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ SP cells (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistently, Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ donor-derived thymocytes in chimeric mice exhibited the same developmental defects observed in primary Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice (Fig. 4, D and E). Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ donor-derived mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in spleens, LNs, and PBCs were notably reduced (fig. S4, A and B). Thus, these data indicated that SRSF1 is intrinsically required for the late stage development of thymocytes. Fig. 4 SRSF1 regulates T cell development in a cell-intrinsic manner.

Data are from at least three independent experiments.

Genome-wide analysis of SRSF1-binding genes in mouse thymocytes To further explore the molecular mechanisms by which SRSF1 regulates thymocyte development, we performed irCLIP-seq (infrared crosslinking-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing) to profile SRSF1-binding events in thymocytes, and two independent replicates with a high correlation in read counts (Spearman = 0.84) were pooled together for the following analysis (fig. S5, A and B). We found that more than half of the SRSF1-RNA cross-link sites mapped to exonic sequences (Fig. 5A). Through calculating the distributions of SRSF1-binding peaks within 100 to 300 nucleotides (nt) upstream or downstream of the constitutive splice site, we observed that SRSF1 “preferentially” bound to exons and enriched between 0 and 100 nt of the 5′ and 3′ exonic sequences flanking the constitutive splice sites (Fig. 5B). SRSF1-binding peaks in mouse thymocytes were significantly enriched in GA-rich consensus motifs (Fig. 5C), which was consistent with the consensus deduced from the mouse embryo fibroblast CLIP-seq (29). To gain insight into the potential function of SRSF1, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of SRSF1-binding genes and found that they were significantly enriched in critical events related to thymocyte development including T cell differentiation, T cell proliferation, apoptotic signaling pathway, and type I interferon signaling pathway (Fig. 5, D and E). It is worth mentioning that apoptosis-related genes Il7ra, Bax, and Bcl2l11 described in Fig. 3 (E to G) were directly bound by SRSF1. These data imply SRSF1 functions as a crucial regulator in the development of thymocytes. Fig. 5 Global landscape of SRSF1-binding sites in mouse thymocytes. (A) Pie chart shows the proportion of SRSF1-binding peak annotated to the 3′ or 5′ untranslated region (UTR), exon, intron, intergenic, promoter, pseudo, and transcriptional termination site (TTS), which were assessed by CLIP-seq (FDR < 0.05).

SRSF1 deficiency globally alters the gene expression and splicing To explore the underlying mechanism of SRSF1-regulated gene expression involved in the late stage of thymocyte development, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in TCRβhi DP thymocytes, which is the unique developmental stage with effectively deactivated SRSF1 and initially exhibited the defects in thymocytes from Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice. A total of 731 genes were down-regulated, and 485 genes were up-regulated in SRSF1-deficient cells (P value of <0.05, |log 2 FoldChange| ≥ 0.6) (Fig. 6A). Among these up-regulated genes, the pathways related to T cell apoptotic process and negative regulation of cell cycle were significantly enriched, and the down-regulated genes were involved in T cell proliferation, T cell differentiation, T cell activation, and pathways related to response to interferon-α, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma (Fig. 6B). We next performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which does not set a preset fold change threshold but interrogates the behavior of the whole gene set changes. The gene sets of interferon-α, interferon-β, and interferon-γ response were positively enriched in control cells (down-regulated in SRSF1-deficient cells) (Fig. 6C). By quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validation, several down-regulated genes that are essential for T cell development, proliferation, or survival were further confirmed (Fig. 6, D and E). Among these genes, Runx3, Myc, Foxo1, Il2rb, and Smad7 were directly bound by SRSF1 (Fig. 5E), whereas Icos and Irf4 without SRSF1-binding site were regarded as indirectly down-regulated genes in SRSF1-deficient cells. By contrast, the expression of several T cell regulators involved in the late stage development of thymocytes was not changed, including Bcl11b, Itk, Jun, Mcl1, Runx1, Ube2i, and Zap70, reflecting the specificity of the alterations in mRNA abundance due to ablation of SRSF1 (fig. S6A). Moreover, a group of type I interferon–related genes including Ifi27l2a, Ifit1, Il27ra, Irf7, Isg15, Oas3, Oasl2, Slfn1, Stat1, and Xaf1 were down-regulated in SRSF1-deficient TCRβhi DP thymocytes (Fig. 6, F and G). However, only Il27ra, Irf7, and Stat1 gene loci have the SRSF1-binding sites (Fig. 5E), reflecting that most of them were regulated by SRSF1 via an indirect manner. Together, these results indicated that ablation of SRSF1 directly or indirectly alters the expression of hallmark genes involved in T cell development, proliferation, survival, and type I interferon response. Fig. 6 SRSF1 deficiency altered the expression and splicing of transcripts in TCRβhi DP cells. (A) Volcano plots show the changes of mRNA abundance in RNA-seq of TCRβhi DP cells.

Border color represents the difference in AS with SRSF1 deficiency [ectopic splicing (blue) or not (orange)]. Solid line indicates the connected genes that were directly bound by SRSF1. Cumulative data are means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001 (Student’s t test). Data are from at least three independent experiments. Given the biological function of SRSF1 in modulating RNA splicing, the inclusion-level differences of five different types of AS events between Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ and control groups were calculated using the rMATS computational tool (fig. S6B). A total of 2317 AS events were identified, and those included 1742 skipped exons (SEs), 155 retained introns (RIs), 159 mutually exclusive exons (MXEs), 119 alternative 5′ splice sites (A5SSs), and 142 alternative 3′ splice sites (A3SSs). The abolishment of SRSF1 was associated with more skip of SEs and A3SSs or A5SSs, more retention of introns, and use of MXEs (fig. S6B). To better gain mechanistic insight into the direct role of SRSF1 in mRNA splicing of thymocytes, we further interrogated the SRSF1 CLIP-seq data and inferred that SRSF1 directly regulated AS events from the binding of SRSF1 in the vicinity of the AS events. The proportion of SRSF1 that directly regulated AS events varied according to the types of AS events. The fraction of SRSF1-binding events in more skipped AS was comparable with those in more included AS events (fig. S6C), which suggested that the AS factor SRSF1 both repressed and activated AS in thymocytes. Together, our data identified that SRSF1 functions as a posttranscriptional regulator in thymocytes and specifically controls the mRNA abundance and AS in direct or indirect manners. To address the direct targets that account for the T cell defects in SRSF1-deficient mice, we interrogated genes bound by SRSF1 and differentially expressed or alternatively spliced due to SRSF1 deficiency. Forty-six SRSF1 directly binding genes including Irf7 and Il27ra were differentially spliced and down-regulated (Fig. 6, H and I), and both of them were known as essential regulators for the late stages of T cell development (15, 30, 31). Irf7 also stands out as a common master regulator involved in response to type I interferons and interferon-gamma (32), both of which were impaired in SRSF1-deficient TCRβhi DP thymocytes (Fig. 6I). In addition, IL-27Rα functions as the receptor in IL-27 signaling, which is essential for the expression of Qa2 and IRF7 in the late stages of thymocyte development (31, 33). Thus, the down-regulation and differentially alternative splicing of Irf7 and Il27ra may account for the defective development of late thymocytes in Srsf1fl/flLckCre/+ mice.

SRSF1 directly regulates splicing and expression of Irf7 and Il27ra We next investigated SRSF1-mediated regulation on the expression of Irf7 and Il27ra via an integrated analysis of the RNA-seq and CLIP-seq data. A complex AS pattern in Irf7 mRNA with increased inclusion of distal 3′ splicing site of exon 6 and retention of intron 5 was exhibited, and Il27ra mRNA showed reduced abundance and increased the ratio of exon 3 skipping in SRSF1-deficient cells (Fig. 7A). Contrastively, a series of key T cell genes were bound by SRSF1 without ectopic AS, including Bcl11b, Mcl1, Ube2i, and Zap70. There is no difference in the number of reads for mapping to exon-exon junctions (fig. S7A), which suggested the specificity of SRSF1-related mRNA splicing. Further, the ectopic splicing due to SRSF1 deletion was confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The normal spliced full-length transcripts of Irf7 (the intron 5 was spliced out, and the proximal 3′ splicing site was used) and Il27ra (the exon 3 was included) were markedly reduced due to ablation of SRSF1 (Fig. 7B). Through sequence analysis, we found that the increased intron 5 retention in Irf7 mRNA gives rise to the premature termination codon (PTC) (fig. S7B), which resulted in the quick degradation of this transcript in both nucleus and cytoplasm as previously reported (34). On the other aspect, the increased usage of the distal 3′ splicing site of exon 6 with the loss of 96 base pairs (bp) compromised the abundance of full-length Irf7 transcript (Fig. 7B and fig. S7B). Meanwhile, the skipping of exon 3 in Il27ra mRNA caused a frameshift and introduced PTC (fig. S7C), which subsequently resulted in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (35). Western blot analysis further confirmed that AS events described as above led to severe reduction of IRF7 and IL-27Rα proteins in SRSF1-deficient cells (Fig. 7C). Fig. 7 SRSF1 directly regulates splicing and expression of Irf7 and Il27ra. (A) Analysis of Irf7 and Il27ra expression and exon-exon junctions. “Sashimi plots” show read coverage and exon-exon junctions (numbers on arches indicate junction reads), and the SRSF1-binding peaks of Irf7 and Il27ra transcripts are shown.

(E) Analysis of the splicing of Irf7 and Il27ra minigenes by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The constructs with (WT) or without (Mut) SRSF1-binding site were applied for splicing assay under the indicated conditions (KD: SRSF1 knockdown; EV: empty vector; OE: SRSF1 overexpression). The percentages of inclusion (in%; red) and skipping (sk%; blue) within exon 6 of Irf7 or exon 3 of Il27ra transcripts are presented, respectively. Data are means ± SEM. **P < 0.01 (Student’s t test). Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. CMV, cytomegalovirus; ND, not determined. To verify the role of SRSF1 via directly binding in regulating AS of Irf7 and Il27ra RNA, we constructed minigene vectors containing the mouse genomic DNA fragment with/without SRSF1-binding motifs of Irf7 exon 6 and Il27ra exon 3, respectively (Fig. 7D). Splicing assay in vitro was carried out in 293T cells transfected by minigene vectors together with KD/EV/OE plasmid of SRSF1. In accordance with the endogenous splicing pattern, the proportion of inclusion in Irf7 and Il27ra minigene was increased in the presence of SRSF1 compared with empty vectors, whereas SRSF1 knockdown markedly inhibited the inclusion of the relative exons (Fig. 7E). The deletion of SRSF1-binding site in exon 6 of Irf7 caused the switching of SRSF1-dependent inclusion to skipping of a part of exon 6. Similarly, the deletion of SRSF1-binding site in exon 3 of Il27ra caused the switching of SRSF1-dependent inclusion to skipping of exon 3 (Fig. 7E). These data thus suggested that SRSF1 controls the expression levels of IRF7 and IL-27Rα by directly binding and modulating their transcript splicing.","Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/16/eabf0753/F1.large.jpg,"['srsf1flfllckcre', 'late', 'critical', 'regulator', 'fig', 'cells', 'posttranscriptional', 'development', 'srsf1', 'thymocytes', 'stage', 'cell', 'irf7', 'expression', 'mice', 'sp', 'thymocyte', 'serves']",

The affected horse, a vaccinated weanling housed at a Nassau County boarding facility, experienced ataxia (incoordination) and urine dribbling, and was euthanized.

According to FDACS, three counties have experienced EEE cases in 2021: Nassau, Levy, and Volusia.

EEE 101

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:","Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehorse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NassauCo-Florida-Wiki.jpg,"['high', 'humans', 'county', 'equine', 'eee', 'confirmed', 'virus', 'nassau', 'mosquitoborne', 'horses', 'birds', 'fdacs', 'horse', 'florida', '2021']",

62,62,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Is Alfalfa Making My Horse Pee More? – The Horse - TheHorse.com,https://thehorse.com/199010/is-alfalfa-making-my-horse-pee-more/,"Q. I recently ended up with a ton of nice-quality alfalfa. I have a couple of ulcer-prone horses and started supplementing their forage ration with it. Within a few days, my oldest gelding, 21, started peeing in his stall, which is a new behavior for him. And it’s a lot of pee! Is the alfalfa making my horse urinate more and changing in his “bathroom behavior”?

A. Alfalfa is nearly always higher in protein and calcium than grass hays, and research has shown that it is also a better stomach acid buffer. Adding some amount of alfalfa to the rations of horses prone to ulcers or who live a lifestyle that puts them at greater risk of ulcers might help reduce ulcer development. Alfalfa has other benefits over grass hay, such as providing more lysine, which might help some horses build and support topline, hoof quality, and the myriad of other bodily functions that require quality protein.

However, as with many things, more is not always better. In the Western United States, high-alfalfa diets have been linked to a greater risk of developing enteroliths (intestinal stones). Alfalfa is also higher in calories per pound than most grass hays. I’m a big believer in keeping as much forage in front of horses as possible. When you feed a higher-calorie hay, you will need less of it to maintain condition. When feeding easy keepers that already seem to get fat on air, feeding alfalfa can further limit forage intake in an attempt to control calories. For these reasons I rarely recommend feeding more than 25-30% of the daily forage intake as alfalfa in super easy keepers, and in other individual situations I might skip alfalfa all together.

It is easy to overfeed protein, even when feeding controlled amounts of alfalfa. Alfalfa is a legume, meaning it’s able to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, resulting in its higher protein content. According to a leading forage testing lab, of 247,456 legume samples tested, the average crude protein content was 21.3% with a normal range of 18.7 to 23.9%. A 500-kilogram (1,100-pound) horse in light work requires 699 grams of crude protein each day. If the horse is eating 2% of its body weight per day (10 kilos or 22 pounds) in dry matter, the diet would need a crude protein concentration of 6.99%. This crude protein percentage is far lower than most people realize. I rarely ever see an equine diet deficient in crude protein.

If eating an alfalfa with a crude protein content of 18.7%, this horse would only need to consume just more than 8 pounds (3.7 kilos) of alfalfa to meet its daily crude protein requirement. If also feeding a 10% crude protein grass hay to make up the remaining 14 pounds of hay necessary to get to 2% of body weight as forage, that would provide an additional 636 grams of protein for a total crude protein intake of 1,335 grams. This is almost twice the horse’s crude protein requirement. Note that I am assuming the hays in question have a high dry matter value, so they have little difference between as-fed and dry matter consumed.

What does the horse do with protein in excess of his requirements? Protein is broken into its constituent amino acids, which are necessary for numerous bodily functions. However, amino acids superfluous to this requirement need to be broken down and the nitrogen they contain eliminated from the body. This is done by excreting it as urea in urine. Therefore, horses consuming diets containing far more protein than required or large amounts of low-quality protein will urinate more.

For most horses this is not an issue; however, it does lead to a greater need for water consumption and results in higher levels of ammonia in stalls, which is then breathed in and can irritate sensitive lung tissue. You might also find yourself going through more bedding in your stalls.

While it does sound like the increased urination coincides with starting to feed alfalfa, suggesting a likely cause, it is important to understand other potential causes of polyuria (abnormally high volumes of urine). One of these is pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID). Given the age of the horse in question, which puts him in an age bracket considered to be at greater risk of having PPID, I would observe him closely for other possible clinical signs and discuss with your vet.

64,64,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Miners seek gold under Egypt's desert sands - Middle East Online,https://middle-east-online.com/en/miners-seek-gold-under-egypt%E2%80%99s-desert-sands,"CAIRO - Mining companies awarded blocks in Egypt's Eastern Desert are set to start exploring for gold under a legislative overhaul that seeks eventually to unlock vast untapped mineral resources.

Despite plentiful reserves and a rich mining history that gave rise to elaborate Pharaonic gold jewellery, Egypt has just one commercial gold mine in operation. Foreign investment in oil and gas has grown, but mining has languished.

Now, the country is banking on high gold prices and amended mining laws that scrap red tape and a profit-sharing rule, unpopular in the industry, to lure interest.

One year after launching its first bid round under the new rules, it has so far clinched five gold exploration contracts in a first bidding round and kept the tendering system rolling as it tries to build momentum.

The government is looking to attract $1 billion in annual investments in mining, a target industry sources say could be within reach.

""Success is ultimately going to be measured by how many mines are going to be discovered and advanced to production,"" said Patrick Barnes, Head of Metals & Mining Consulting EMEARC at Wood Mackenzie, which advised Egypt's government on its mining law reforms.

""Early indicators show us that this bid round was much better than the ones held previously.""

'Healthy mix'

In its initial tender, Egypt in November awarded 82 exploration blocks to what metals analysts say is a healthy mix of 11 companies, ranging from junior explorers to industry giants such as Barrick Gold.

The blocks on offer are in the Arabian-Nubian shield geological formation, which flanks the Red Sea and is believed to be one of the most mineral rich areas in the world.

Egypt's mining drive is still at an early stage.

UK-based Altus Strategies told Reuters it was looking to build up its technical team and conduct remote sensing and mapping operations on the 1,500 square kilometres of land it has been awarded before starting exploration.

It expects to invest several million dollars in the short term but that could rise above $100-$200 million if a economic discovery is made.

A spokeswoman for Canada-based B2Gold, which also won concessions, said the company was looking forward to starting exploration soon ""given the relative under-investment in modern exploration, and therefore untapped potential in the historically prospective Arabian-Nubian Shield"".

Mining firms welcomed the elimination of a requirement to form joint ventures with the Egyptian government, and the capping of state royalties at 20%.

However, the retention of a tendering process for exploration blocks limits the chances of any gold boom, said Sami El Raghy, Chairman of Australia-based Nordana Pty Ltd.

""No other successful mining countries use this process. They all have a clear transparent mining laws stipulating the qualification, obligations and the rights of investors. (They) work on the principle first come, first served,"" said El Raghy, who was also a founder of Egypt's first and only commercial gold mine, Sukari.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources declined to comment.

Gold price

On average, a mining project goes from discovery to production in 10-15 years. While gold prices have eased after reaching a record in 2020, economists expect they will remain high by historical standards over coming years.

""If you get to a point where several discoveries are made, Egypt could be one of the largest gold producers in Africa... It had top-tier potential,"" said Steven Poulton, CEO of Altus Strategies.

Environmental campaigners, however, say there is no justification for gold mining. It generates emissions, can add to water-stress and in contrast to copper and battery minerals is not in demand from technologies that can bring about a low carbon economy.

The government has said it is open to other minerals, but gold is the focus for now.

""Gold is absolutely the best thing for them to start with, because there's a known amount of it,"" said Wood Mackenzie's Barnes.

""Egypt has immense potential for mining copper and gold and other commodities. The biggest concern in the industry is lack of supply for copper, places like Egypt which are considered underexplored and high potential are going to get a lot of attention if they can maintain investment conditions,"" he added.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.middle-east-online.com/styles/social_image/s3/2021-04/egypt%20gold%20mining.jpg?05xRNLHnZQK8VMalWrds.v.57xYHAxsb&h=28dfcd11&itok=Smil0qfk,"['seek', 'exploration', 'egypt', 'say', 'desert', 'mineral', 'blocks', 'mining', 'industry', 'potential', 'round', 'miners', 'gold', 'egypts', 'sands']",

The Italian organization Doctors for Human Rights (MEDU) said on April 26 that it will conclude a mental health project for refugees in Agadez, Niger. MEDU said in a statement that it has been active in the country since 2019, supporting over 1,000 refugees mainly hailing from Sudan.

The organization highlighted that ""the issues concerning each one of them call into question the responsibility of the international community, [and] of European countries over the management of migration flows that cannot be exclusively focused on their cynical containment."" It added that ""it remains essential to ensure for refugees of Agadez both humanitarian corridors towards third countries and concrete possibilities of integration in Niger.""

Nearly 4,000 psychological consultations

The project was promoted inside the humanitarian site and in a number of hosting facilities managed by the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR in Agadez, a key city for migration flows that start in western Africa and cross Saharan routes to reach Libya and then Europe. MEDU's team carried out 4,000 psychological consultations, over 2,700 medical checkups and over 3,100 psycho-social interventions.The organization also promoted initiatives like training, theatre, music, sport, small activities of craftsmanship.

MEDU is mainly composed of local personnel supported by experts from Italy. ""MEDU operators took care, in difficult conditions, of a population of men, women and children who survived unspeakable atrocities, first during the civil war in Sudan and then in torture camps in Libya.""

""Three out of four people treated by the clinical team presented the most serious forms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The people assisted had survived on average eight serious traumatic events including torture, detention, reiterated beatings, being in proximity to death, the prolonged deprivation of food and water, the violent death of family or strangers, sexual violence.""

Hundreds of stories of resilience

""Hundreds of the individual stories that were collected represent monumental proof not just of human cruelty but also of the extraordinary resilience of these people,"" MEDU stressed, recalling that the project in Agadez was promoted in partnership with UNHCR and with the support of the Waldensian Table.

Fortunately, though, healthy horses can get that microbiotal richness back within a day of eating normally. Even so, owners, veterinarians, and researchers alike need to be aware of the kinds of changes that happen in horses’ guts when they’re fasted, said Louise Southwood, BSc (Vet), Dipl. ACVS, ACVECC, a professor in emergency medicine and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine, in Kennett Square.

“Withholding food for a day definitely changes the microbiota, but it’s important to keep in mind that this is very reversible,” Southwood said. “Within 24 hours (after fasting ends), it can come back to normal.”

Southwood didn’t set out to determine whether fasting is good or bad for horses’ microbiota, she said. Rather, her main objective was from a research point of view, to help scientists better interpret microbiota test results in colicking horses.

That’s because veterinarians usually recommend withholding food from horses when they’re having a bout of colic (in case food in the digestive system is getting trapped, for example), she said. Researchers have already noted that colicking horses have a different microbiota compared to healthy horses. So Southwood’s team wondered how much of that change in microbiota might be due to the horse having been fasted because of the colic.

Fecal Analyses of Fasted Mares

Southwood and her fellow researchers worked with eight healthy mares of various breeds, aged 14 to 23, fed fresh hay without concentrated feeds. They muzzled the mares for a 24-hour period, which prevented them from eating hay but still let them drink water. For the sake of humane treatment, however, they gave all the horses a handful of senior feed once every six hours. The team collected fecal samples from the mares at several intervals before, during, and after fasting. Sequencing of those samples allowed the scientists to determine microbiota changes in each individual horse.

They found that the total number of bacteria living in the microbiota of the mares’ guts dropped significantly, especially after 10 hours of fasting, said Southwood. The number of different bacteria species also dropped, they reported in BMC Veterinary Research. Healthy gut microbiota is usually rich in the amount and diversity of different species of bacteria and other microorganisms. However, they also found that this diversity and amount returned very quickly, within 18 to 24 hours of the horses eating their hay again.

The study’s results confirm that colicking horses might have changes in their microbiota due, at least in part, to having been fasted, she said. That’s especially true when the horse has fasted for at least 10 hours. The findings also suggest that veterinarians should try to start feeding small amounts as soon as possible after the colic episode has ended to reestablish the gut microbiome, she said: “You don’t want to be withholding food longer than necessary,” she said.

Could Microbiota One Day Help Explain Recurrent Colic?

Beyond these main findings, the study gives hope that scientists might be able to eventually find clues in the microbiota to help explain why some horses experience recurrent bouts of colic, Southwood said.

“This study was really a building block to get more information on the bigger picture of the role of the gut microbiota in colic and especially recurrent colic,” she said. “My long-term goal is to try to understand what role, if any, the microbiota has in that—similar to some of the work with humans and inflammatory bowel disease.

“And maybe that will eventually lead us to ways of manipulating the microbiota and finally to help horses with recurrent colic have comfortable lives,” she continued. “And hopefully that can give some relief to owners and caregivers as well, because it’s so frustrating for them. We hope our research will help navigate through this puzzle of gastrointestinal disease in horses.”","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehorse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/horse-rolling-2.jpg,"['help', 'colic', 'mares', 'diversity', 'number', 'southwood', 'recurrent', 'gut', 'horses', 'hours', 'healthy', 'fasted', 'horse', 'reduces', 'fasting', 'microbiota']",

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden formally raised the nation’s cap on refugee admissions to 62,500 this year, weeks after facing bipartisan blowback for his delay in replacing the record-low ceiling set by former President Donald Trump.

Refugee resettlement agencies have waited for Biden to quadruple the number of refugees allowed into the United States this year since Feb. 12, when a presidential proposal was submitted to Congress saying he planned to do so.

But the presidential determination went unsigned until Monday. Biden said he first needed to expand the narrow eligibility criteria put in place by Trump that had kept out most refugees. He did that last month in an emergency determination. But it also stated that Trump’s cap of up to 15,000 refugees this year “remains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest,” indicating Biden intended to keep it.

That brought sharp pushback for not at least taking the symbolic step of authorizing more refugees to enter the U.S. this year. The second-ranking Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, called that initial limit “unacceptable” and within hours the White House made a quick course correction. The administration vowed to increase the historically low cap by May 15 — but the White House said it probably would not hit the 62,500 Biden had previously outlined.

In the end, Biden returned to that figure.

Biden said he received additional information that led him to sign the emergency presidential determination setting the cap at 62,500.

“It is important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin,” Biden stated before signing it.

Biden said Trump’s cap “did not reflect America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees.”

But he acknowledged the “sad truth” that the U.S. would not meet the 62,500 cap by the end of the fiscal year in September, given the pandemic and limitations on the country’s resettlement capabilities — some of which his administration has attributed to the Trump administration’s policies to restrict immigration.

The White House insisted it was unable to act until now because the administration was being taxed by a sharp increase in unaccompanied young migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras arriving at the southern U.S. border, though any link between the border and the government’s decision on refugees was not immediately clear. Refugee advocates, including Durbin, accused Biden of playing politics.

Biden said Monday it was important to lift the number to show “America’s commitment to protect the most vulnerable, and to stand as a beacon of liberty and refuge to the world.”

It also paves the way for Biden to boost the cap to 125,000 for the 2022 fiscal year that starts in October.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said work is being done to improve U.S. capabilities to process refugees in order to accept as many of them as possible under the new cap. Since the fiscal year began last Oct. 1, just over 2,000 refugees have been resettled in the U.S.

Travel preparations are being made for more than 2,000 refugees who were excluded by Trump’s presidential determination on Oct. 27, 2020.

Refugee resettlement agencies applauded Biden’s action.

“We are absolutely thrilled and relieved for so many refugee families all across the world who look to the U.S. for protection,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, head of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of nine resettlement agencies in the nation. “It has a felt like a rollercoaster ride, but this is one critical step toward rebuilding the program and returning the U.S. to our global humanitarian leadership role.”

Biden has also added more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America and ended Trump’s restrictions on resettlements from Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Some 35,000 refugees have been cleared to go to the United States, and 100,000 remain in the pipeline. Resettlement agencies that closed more than 100 offices during the Trump administration said the cap needed to be raised to unleash resources.

“The way you rebuild capacity is by setting ambitious commitments that signal to domestic and international stakeholders that U.S. leadership is back,” said Nazanin Ash of the International Rescue Committee.

A new Cold War – this time, between the US and China —is threatening to paralyze the UN’s most powerful body, even as military conflicts and civil wars are sweeping across the world, mostly in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

The growing criticism against the Security Council is directed largely at its collective failures to resolve ongoing conflicts and political crises in several hot spots, including Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, Ukraine and Libya — and its longstanding failure over Palestine.

The sharp divisions between China and Russia, on one side, and the Western powers on the other, are expected to continue, triggering the question: Has the Security Council outlived its usefulness or has it lost its political credibility?

The five big powers are increasingly throwing their protective arms around their allies, despite growing charges of war crimes, genocide and human rights violations against these countries.

Last week, Yasmine Ahmed, UK Director at Human Rights Watch, called on Britain “to step up as penholder on Myanmar and start negotiating a Security Council draft resolution on an arms embargo and targeted sanctions against the military”.

Over 580 people, including children, have been killed since the February 1 coup: “it is time for the Security Council to do more than issue statements and begin working towards substantive action,” she warned.

But in most of these conflicts, including Myanmar, arms embargoes are very unlikely because the major arms suppliers to the warring parties are the five Permanent Members of the Security Council, namely the US, UK, France, Russia and China.

Democracies and autocracies

US President Joe Biden has described the growing new confrontation as a battle between democracies and autocracies.

In a recent analytical piece, the New York Times said China’s most striking alignment is with Russia, with both countries drawing closer after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The two countries have also announced they will jointly build a research station on the moon, setting the stage to compete with US space programmes.

“The threat of a US-led coalition challenging China’s authoritarian policies has only bolstered Beijing’s ambition to be a global leader of nations that oppose Washington and its allies,” the Times said.

Ian Williams, President of the New York-based Foreign Press Association and author of ‘UN told: The Real Story of the United Nations in Peace and War’, told IPS that in the early years, with a secure majority in the General Assembly (GA), the US could pretend virtue and eschew using the veto. The embattled Soviets resorted it over and over.

“But as with so much UN and international law, the Israeli exception had the US making up for lost time. Now the Russians have been catching up with vetoes for Serbia and Syria”.

China, he pointed out, avoided using the veto unless Taiwan or Tibet was mentioned. In the old days there was a hint of an ideological element — Third World and Socialism versus Imperialism.

“But now it is entirely transactional, veto holders looking after their clients and allies, so no one should entertain illusions about China and Russia acting in a progressive and constructive way. But the US is in no position to point fingers about Syria while it protects Saudi Arabia and Israel”.

“We can hope that the majority of members will grow indignant enough to try to effect indignation. But sadly, historical experience suggests many governments have almost unlimited tolerance for mass murder in far-away countries of which they know little,” he noted, including Darfur, the Balkans, Rwanda and now Myanmar.

The breakthrough would be the US saying, end the Occupation and then inviting others to join in a reaffirmation of the Charter.

“But since I don’t really believe in the tooth fairy, I would have to settle for a coalition of the conscious-stricken in the GA united for peace – and international law and order”, said Williams, a senior analyst who has written for newspapers and magazines around the world, including the Australian, The Independent, New York Observer, The Financial Times and The Guardian.

Asked about the killings in Myanmar, and the lack of action in the UNSC, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters on March 29: “We need more unity in the international community. We need more commitment in the international community to put pressure in order to make sure that the situation is reversed. I’m very worried. I see, with a lot of concern, the fact that, apparently, many of these trends look irreversible, but hope is the last thing we can give up on.”

Vijay Prashad, Executive Director, Tricontinental Institute for Social Research, who has written extensively on international politics, told IPS the United Nations is an essential institution, a process, in many ways, rather than a fully-finished institution.

The agencies of the UN – including WHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, he said, provide vital service to the world’s peoples; “and we need to make these institutions more robust, and we need to ensure that they drive a public agenda that advances the UN Charter’s main goals (namely to maintain peace, to end hunger and illiteracy, to provide the basis for a rich life, in sum).”

The Security Council is a victim of the political battles in the world, he argued.

“There is no way to build a better framework to handle the major power differentials,” said Prashad, author of 30 books, including most recently ‘Washington Bullets’ (LeftWord, Monthly Review),

“It would be far better to empower the UN General Assembly, which is more democratic, but since the 1970s we have seen how the US – in particular – undermined the UNGA to take decision making almost exclusively to the UNSC”.

Ever since the fall of the USSR, he said, the UN Secretary-General has become subservient to the US government (“we saw this shockingly with the treatment of former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali”).

The new ‘Group of Friends to Defend the UN Charter’, which includes China and Russia, is a positive development, said Prashad.

US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters on March 31: “And then in terms of working with my counterparts in the Security Council, I know that there are areas – and this is a discussion that I’ve had – with both my Russian and Chinese colleagues – we know that there are red lines”.

Human Rights values

“There are areas where we have serious concerns, and we’ve been open and we’ve been frank about those concerns. In China, what is happening with the Uyghurs, for example. With Russia, in Syria, and there are many others. We know what the red lines are”, she added.

“We tried to bridge those gaps, but we also try to find those areas where we have common ground. We’ve been able to find common ground on Myanmar. With the Chinese, we’re working on climate change in, I think, a very positive way. We’re not in the exact same place, but it’s an area where we can have conversations with each other.”

“So as the top U.S. diplomat in New York, it is my responsibility to find common ground so that we can achieve common goals, but not to give either country a pass when they are breaking human rights values or pushing in directions that we find unacceptable,” she declared.

Meanwhile, harking back to a bygone era, during the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the United Nations was the ideological battleground where the Americans and the Soviets pummeled each other– either on the floor of the General Assembly hall or at the horse-shoe table of the UN Security Council.

Perhaps one of the most memorable war of words took place in October 1962 when the politically-feisty US Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (1961-65), a two-time Democratic US presidential candidate, challenged Soviet envoy Valerian Zorin over allegations that the USSR, perhaps under cover of darkness, had moved nuclear missiles into Cuba—and within annihilating distance of the United States.

Speaking at a tense Security Council meeting, Stevenson admonished Zorin: “I remind you that you didn’t deny the existence of these weapons. Instead, we heard that they had suddenly become defensive weapons. But today — again, if I heard you correctly — you now say they don’t exist, or that we haven’t proved they exist, with another fine flood of rhetorical scorn.”

“All right sir,” said Stevenson, “let me ask you one simple question. Do you, Ambassador Zorin, deny that the USSR has placed and is placing medium and intermediate range missiles and sites in Cuba?” “Yes or No? Don’t wait for the translation: Yes or No?”, Stevenson insisted with a tone of implied arrogance.

Speaking in Russian through a UN translator (who faithfully translated the US envoy’s sentiments into English), Zorin shot back: “I am not in an American courtroom, sir, and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor does. In due course, sir, you will have your reply. Do not worry.”

Not to be outwitted, Stevenson howled back: “You are in the court of world opinion right now, and you can answer yes or no. You have denied that they exist. I want to know if …I’ve understood you correctly.”

When Zorin said he will provide the answer in “due course”, Stevenson famously declared: “I am prepared to wait for my answer until hell freezes over.”

They'd have great times, making up rhymes, recording them on their phones as they drove.

""Because we didn't have a studio,"" Shine said.

A decade on, things are different.

Shine now records his songs in real recording studios and can be seen driving a Rolls Royce in his latest music video. It's a rental, but the song still snagged over a million views in its first five days on YouTube this month.

Shine's life and career are on the rise but he's also had his share of struggles. Born in war-torn Somalia, he grew up in a gritty public housing project. Shine found success with poetry in high school but then ran afoul of the law as a young man. His legal troubles behind him now, the father of three is focused on showing his children, as well as his community, that dreams are worth chasing.

""I want to spread the word that they're worth more than money,"" Shine said. ""And it's not really about fame.""

Shine came to the United States when he was five. By the time he was 10, his family had settled in Portland's impoverished and densely-packed Riverton Park. Shine said he has fond memories of playing basketball with his friends on the asphalt court at the bottom of the hill.

At Portland High School, he discovered poetry and a love for writing. It brought him notoriety and friends. It's also how he got his nickname.

""People started calling me Moon the Poet,"" Shine said. ""Poetry is the same feeling as rap. It's expressing.""

Moon, short for Munye, turned into Moon Shine, which was then shortened to just Shine.

In 2011, he competed in the state's Poetry Out Loud competition. Besting thousands, he made it to the regional finals. A few months later, however, he was arrested for breaking into cars in a movie theater parking lot. It was just the start. Over the next few years he had other misdemeanor scrapes with the law for theft and drugs.

Story continues

Out of trouble since 2019, Shine said those days are behind him now. He draws lyrical and motivational inspiration from his time in trouble.

""A lot of people will judge you on your past,"" he said. ""But your history can make you a better person.""

Shine started his indie music career in 2015, releasing a trippy, spoken word piece on YouTube called ""Pray for Me.""

Filmed entirely in Riverton Park, it starts with: ""Never let your mistakes ruin your future but look toward the future with your mistakes to see what you have learned.""

After that first track, Shine released almost a dozen more over the next five years, racking up hundreds of thousands of views, and almost 10,000 followers, on YouTube.

But this month, he got even hotter.

Released on April 1, his latest track ""Aspirations"" snagged shoutouts on Instagram from established hip-hop stars Fat Joe, Jadakiss and Lil Reese.

Five days later, the song hit a million views. By this week, it totalled just under 1.5 million. The track's lyrics continue with Shine's positive themes of looking ahead and striving for a better future.

""When you're down feeling low, I just want you to know that most people's lives aren't as great as they show,"" he raps. ""So, when you're down feeling hopeless, know that nobody's perfect.""

The ""Aspirations"" video was filmed last November in New York. Shine sank thousands of dollars of his own money into the project, hiring a professional director while renting a fleet of high-end cars, including a white Rolls Royce.

Childhood friend and fellow hip-hop musician Tanade Muse isn't surprised by Shine's success.

""He's always been a hardworking poet. It was just a matter of time before he blew up,"" said Muse, better known as Fetty 2-Times.

Fetty said he loves seeing someone from Riverton Park get a taste of success. It gives him hope and suspects it does the same for others.

""We're all just neighborhood cats,"" he said. ""He works so hard — this is just the beginning. He's going to make it out of the hood.""

Portland folk singer Jenny Van West first met Shine at an open mic she hosted a few years back at Mayo Street Arts. Van West became a fan right away, even before he was making slick music videos.

""He can make great recordings and videos, of course,"" she said, ""but it's his words that get straight into my heart.""

Despite his rocketing success online, Shine said he's keeping his day job in a laboratory, for now, and concentrating on getting his first full-length album out by fall. In the future, he hopes to keep doing his kids, and his neighborhood, proud.

""I want people, especially my community, to know anything is possible — anything you put your mind to,"" Shine said. ""Never let anyone tell you who you can, or can't, be.""

The Central Bank of Iran has declared that licensed banks and moneychangers in the country can use cryptocurrency that has been mined by officially sanctioned miners to pay for imports, according to a report from the Financial Tribune.

Hit hard by international sanctions, Iran likely sees the use of cryptocurrency as a way to operate outside of traditional financial controls. In October 2020, the Iranian central bank amended its regulations so that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be mined officially under government control, using subsidized energy, then supplied to the government for funding imports. Now, the central bank has apparently extended the legal use of cryptocurrencies to additional groups within the country.

“It said lenders and moneychangers have been notified about the regulatory framework for crypto payment,” per the Tribune. “No further details were announced, the CBI website reported.”

In 2019, Iran legalized cryptocurrency mining while instituting heavy-handed regulations to control it. Upon embracing the practice as a way to accrue sanction-resistant funds, some wondered if Iran were pivoting to become a “Bitcoin nation.” But Bitcoiners within the country were dubious about the idea that Iran would horde or directly deal with bitcoin, and this latest update to regulations indicates that it would like individual businesses within the country to leverage cryptocurrency.

“I don’t think the central bank will touch bitcoin in any way,” Ziya Sadr, a Bitcoiner based in Tehran, told Bitcoin Magazine last year. “The system will only provide rates and stuff and the bitcoin will be transferred from sender to receiver directly.”

They also noted that regulations about exactly how they can use bitcoin would only incentivize bitcoin miners in Iran to take the practice underground.

“Due to the high price of electricity and gas for the extraction of cryptocurrencies in Iran, the result of changing this decree will be the reduction of bitcoin production in Iran, because no miner is interested in providing his bitcoin to the government,” Omid Alavi, a CEO of an approved bitcoin mining farm in Iran, told Bitcoin Magazine at the time.

Mexico will hold the largest elections in its history on June 6, 2021. Candidates will run for, among other offices, the federal Chamber of Deputies, governorships in 15 states, and mayor in hundreds of municipalities.

Journalists and media workers covering the elections anywhere in Mexico should be aware of a number of risks, including physical attacks, harassment, intimidation, online bullying, surveillance, and government restrictions on reporting. In 2020, at least five journalists were killed in Mexico in direct relation to their work, according to CPJ research.

Contents

Criminal violence during the elections is of particular concern. During recent election cycles, most notably in 2018, dozens of political candidates were murdered, according to reports. In many cases, organized criminal groups are suspected of being involved in the violence.

“I think we’re never really sufficiently prepared,” Isaín Mandujano, correspondent of Proceso magazine in the southern state of Chiapas, told CPJ via phone. “Media often don’t train their reporters sufficiently, they’re not worried enough about their people’s safety, so we have to analyze where there may be possible violence ourselves.”

Others, such as editor-in-chief Adrián López of newspaper El Noroeste in the northern state of Sinaloa, are worried about digital threats. “I think we still need to prepare ourselves a lot better for online aggressions,” he told CPJ via phone. “Media are often attacked via social media, by disinformation campaigns, hacking and DDoS attacks.”

CPJ Emergencies has compiled a safety kit for journalists covering the elections. The kit contains information for editors, reporters, and photojournalists on how to prepare for the elections, and how to mitigate physical and digital risk.

PDFs of the election safety kit are available to download in English and Spanish.

Journalists requiring assistance in Mexico can contact CPJ’s Emergencies program via electionsafety@cpj.org or CPJ’s Mexico representative, Jan-Albert Hootsen, at jahootsen@cpj.org.

In addition, CPJ’s resource center has additional information and tools for pre-assignment preparation and post-incident assistance.

Physical Safety: Reporting from political rallies and crowd events

Tensions between political parties, candidates, their supporters and criminal gangs may affect journalists covering the election cycle across Mexico. Since September 2020, at least 66 political candidates have been assassinated, according to the AFP. This is in addition to over 150 political candidates who were murdered in the 2018 election cycle, in what analysts describe as a mix of political conflict and organized crime attempting to insert itself into the electoral process.

When attending political rallies, crowd events, and/or protests, media workers should be aware of the potential risk of getting caught up in assassination attempts of political candidates, as well as violence from opposition supporters and/or criminals who may clash at campaign rallies. To help minimize the risks at such events, media workers should consider the following safety advice:

Positioning & situational awareness

Regularly assess your position in relation to political candidates at public crowd events, noting that the closer you are, the greater the potential danger.

Avoid getting caught up in the crowd if political candidates–who could be targeted at close range by hostile individuals–move amongst the audience. If you intend on asking a candidate a question, do so from a safe distance (if feasible).

Regularly monitor the crowd for individuals who may present a threat. Pay attention to how people are behaving, if they are armed, and if/how they are communicating with others. Trust your instincts, and maintain a safe distance behind or to the side of any suspicious individuals. Alert the authorities if safe to do so.

Pay attention to vehicles parked close by and any individuals in or around them for signs of suspicious activity.

Remain alert to speeding vehicles or motorbikes approaching the location, which could be used to target political candidates in drive-by shootings.

Have an escape strategy in case circumstances turn hostile. You may need to plan this on arrival, but if possible try and do so in advance. Once at the event, familiarize yourself with your surroundings. Report from a secure location (such as a press holding area if there is one), taking into account the distance from all available exit routes.

If working with others identify an emergency rendezvous point. Regularly assess the safety of all routes leading to this point.

Avoid hanging around and/or questioning people if the crowd becomes hostile.

Park your vehicle facing the direction of escape in an accessible and secure location, or ensure you have an alternative guaranteed mode of transport.

Planning & general safety

Research in advance who is likely to be at the event. Consider wearing a protective body vest if in an area of high crime, if the political candidate is a potential target, or if violence can be expected from opposition supporters. For more information see CPJ’s personal protect equipment (PPE) guide here (available only in English) .

. If reporting from an outdoor event, consider the time of day and exposure to the sun, noting that you may be waiting for some time before an event starts. Keep hydrated, wear a sun hat, and apply sunscreen if necessary.

If event security is provided, try to find how professional/competent they are, and if they are likely to assist you if in danger, especially if harassment and/or physical or sexual assault is a potential risk.

Working with a colleague is sensible, so consider going with another reporter or photographer if possible, noting that election events may finish late into the evening. After dark the risk level increases.

Ensure that you have the correct accreditation or press identification with you. For freelancers, a letter from the commissioning employer is helpful. Have it on display only if safe to do so. Avoid using a lanyard around your neck; clip it to a belt or in a transparent velcro pouch around your bicep instead.

Avoid using a lanyard around your neck; clip it to a belt or in a transparent velcro pouch around your bicep instead. If the crowd might be or become hostile toward the media, avoid clothing with media company branding and remove media logos from equipment/vehicles if necessary.

Wear sturdy footwear with hard soles, laces, and some kind of ankle support. Avoid wearing sandals or slip-on shoes.

If spitting or projectiles from the crowd are a possibility, consider wearing a waterproof, discrete bump cap.

Try to gauge the mood of the crowd. If possible, call other journalists already at the event to assess the atmosphere. If the crowd/speakers are hostile to the media, mentally prepare for verbal abuse. In such circumstances, just do your job and report. Do not react to the abuse and avoid engaging with the crowd. Remember, you are a professional even if others are not.

Identify the closest point/location of medical assistance.

If the task was difficult/challenging, try not to bottle up your emotions or hide your feelings. Try to discuss any challenging experiences with your superiors and colleagues, which can often help release built-up tension and anxiety.

Physical safety: Surveillance and working in areas of high crime

Media workers may be required to report from areas of high crime throughout the election cycle, and may be harassed and/or targeted by criminals, politicians, or the police. They may also be subjected to physical surveillance. Although areas of high crime are often well-known, be aware that any location can be subject to criminal activity and violence.

General safety advice

Media workers should consider their profile and previous work before travelling to an area of high crime. Note that you could be at increased risk of surveillance and potential harm if you have reported on a criminal group/s or politician/s in the area before.

Research the location in advance. Understand the type of crime/s that is prevalent in the area, as well as the layout so that routes in/out can be assessed for potential issues, such as dead ends or choke points. Be fluid with your plans and prepared to adapt your itinerary accordingly.

Try to establish and work with trusted contacts in the area you intend to visit, who can provide advice/assistance during your assignment. Be aware that non-locals are often treated with suspicion, particularly in areas controlled by cartels. If working in a particularly dangerous area, consider the need for extra support or working alongside the authorities (if safe to do so).

It is sensible to maintain a low profile throughout the assignment, avoiding any overt displays of wealth or attracting undue attention.

Maintain constant awareness of your surroundings, and remain vigilant of activity around you and attentive to individuals approaching. Watch out for anybody taking photos or following you, whether on foot or in a vehicle.

Behave purposefully and with confidence. Try and avoid being distracted on the go (e.g. using your phone).

If possible, avoid working in high crime areas after dark, or in isolated locations with low footfall.

Minimize time on the ground as much as possible. Get what you need and get out.

Location safety & awareness

It is sensible to avoid meeting individuals in quiet, poorly lit, and/or remote locations, especially after dark, when the risk level increases. Nightclubs and bars, which can be targeted by criminals and armed gangs, should also be avoided.

Pay constant attention for individuals who could be monitoring you. This can include teenagers and younger children who are sometimes paid by criminal groups to act as informants.

If meeting in a public place, such as a restaurant or hotel, avoid sitting near windows where you can be more easily monitored.

On arrival make a mental note of the location layout, paying attention to all available exits and escape routes.

Remain alert to vehicles pulling up outside, who is coming in/out of the building, and individuals hanging around outside. Make a regular assessment of who is around you, and identify who might be able to assist you if necessary.

Make sure a colleague, friend, or family member knows where you are heading to and what time to expect you back. If in an area of high crime, consider setting up a check in and overdue procedure, and an action plan for when the check in does not happen at a designated time.

If driving, park your vehicle in a well-lit and busy area, facing the direction of escape. Conduct a visual inspection of the vehicle exterior for any signs of damage or tampering before departing.

Media workers should consider staying in a reputable chain hotel with decent security, noting that less well known hotels are sometimes used for illicit activities.

If working in the same location for a period of time, try to vary your daily routine as much as possible, and avoid setting patterns.

Transportation

Avoid using taxis when arriving at airports and bus stations, noting that some taxi drivers can work as informants for criminal groups. If possible, use a trusted driver from the local area to meet you on arrival instead.

If travelling by public bus/coach, be aware that petty crime and armed robbery are risks in certain locations, and that drivers sometimes work in cohorts with criminal groups.

If driving for the assignment, consider how appropriate the vehicle is relative to the location. Wherever possible use a vehicle that blends in (e.g. an expensive SUV will attract more attention, particularly in less well-off and rural areas). Note that if crossing from one state to another your vehicle registration plate will indicate that you may not be from the area.

Plan your journey along main federal highways (toll roads) as much as possible. Try and avoid using the secondary, minor, and side roads, where the chances of meeting illegal checkpoints and/or criminals are higher.

Ensure that vehicle doors are locked and windows are kept up when driving in slow traffic, and while at junctions and traffic lights, noting that journalists have been targeted while in their vehicles, as highlighted in the case of murdered journalist Carlos Domínguez Rodríguez .

. When driving, routinely check your rear view and side mirrors. If you suspect you are being followed, trust your instincts and drive to a place of safety as soon as possible.

While driving remain alert to the possibility of vehicle ramming, as seen recently in the case of journalist Albert Amaro .

. Avoid travelling at night unless absolutely necessary, and plan your journey to arrive at your destination during daylight hours.

Know your approximate planned journey duration and expected arrival time. Do not rely on apps to work out driving time/distance. Source reliable local information instead.

If travelling in a riskier location where a check-in procedure is deemed necessary, communicate any change of itinerary to your management team or trusted contact in good time. Always plan an alternative or contingency route in case you need to use it.

Limit the number of valuables you take. Do not leave any equipment in vehicles, which are likely to be broken into. After dark, the criminal risk increases.

Checkpoints

Checkpoints operated by the military and police can be a common sight along Mexican highways and roads. In addition, illegal checkpoints operated by local paramilitary groups or criminal gangs present a security risk in certain parts of the country.

Overview

According to sources CPJ spoke to, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their security, various types of checkpoints are particularly prevalent in (but not limited to) the following areas of the country:

Mexican states map. Alex Covarrubias, CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/), via Wikimedia Commons.

The states of Michoacán, Guerrero, Sinaloa, and the Tierra Caliente region (which covers parts of Estado de México, Michoacán, and Guerrero).

Chiapas and Tabasco states, in the south, and Tamaulipas state in the north, due to more stringent immigration policing and border security.

Militia- and community-controlled checkpoints are common in parts of the Costa Chica and La Montaña areas of Guerrero state.

Random checkpoints and roadblocks set up by protesting civilians can be an issue in states such as Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero, and can appear with little or no warning. Be aware of the potential for violence at such checkpoints if the police clash with civilians.

Unions and other social groups occasionally occupy toll booths on federal highways, and only allow traffic to pass when drivers pay a small amount of money. Note the potential for violence as the authorities attempt to remove such groups.

General safety advice

If feasible, identify known legitimate checkpoints along your route in advance.

Try and find out the location of any illegal checkpoints in advance by contacting local journalists, who are often made aware of them in real time through local contacts and networks. If feasible plan your route to avoid them.

Note that seemingly legitimate checkpoints may be operated by criminals with falsified identification who may be wearing fake uniforms.

Avoid driving in areas where illegal checkpoints are known to be a problem, especially after dark when the prevalence of checkpoints and level of risk increases.

When approaching and while at checkpoints you should:

Slow down, indicate if pulling over, dim headlights (if at night), and park where directed to do so.

Keep your hands visible at all times, and turn on the interior light (if dark).

Keep windows closed until asked to open them.

Do not use any devices such as mobile phones.

Keep equipment, such as laptops and cameras, out of sight. If asked, mention that you have them in the vehicle.

Have all travel and vehicle documents ready to hand over (e.g. passport, driving license, vehicle insurance policy etc.).

If wearing sunglasses and/or a hat, take them off.

Stay calm, maintain eye contact, a confident posture, and engage in a positive manner. Comply with instructions, and always be polite and courteous.

You should avoid:

Accelerating, swerving or trying to turn off the road.

Shouting or become hostile to an individual.

Turning your back on an individual if they are still talking to you.

Using confrontational body language (e.g. pointing or folded arms).

Physical Safety: Reporting from election protests and disorder

Demonstrations can occur during any election cycle, as witnessed in Mexico in 2012 and 2015. Media workers covering such protests can be exposed to a range of dangers if violence breaks out between protesters, counter-protesters, criminal groups, and/or the police, who are known to use tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds, as seen during a recent International Women’s Day march in Mexico City. Be aware that female reporters can be at a heightened risk from harassment and violence at protest locations, as documented by CPJ.

To help minimize the risk, media workers should consider the following safety advice:

Planning

Identify the material you require for your report. Lingering at a protest gathering material that will not be used increases the risk of harm.

If violence is anticipated, the use of protective safety goggles/glasses, helmets, tear gas respirators, and protective body vests should be considered, depending on the range of threats. For more information see CPJ’s PPE guide.

Research the layout of the location in advance by studying a map of the immediate area. Identify all potential safe routes in case you need to escape, which streets/roads are dead ends in order to avoid going down them, as well as an emergency rendezvous point if you are working with others.

Individuals should not be expected to work alone at protest locations. Try to work with a colleague and set up a regular check-in procedure with your base, family, or friends. Working after dark is riskier and should be avoided if possible. For more information, see CPJ’s advice for journalists reporting alone.

Clothing & equipment

Be aware that certain colors or combinations of colors are associated with political parties. Always consider who is likely to be at a protest location and wear colors that won’t attract a negative reaction. This includes red (Morena); red, white & green (PRI); blue and white (PAN); yellow and black (PRD); red and yellow (PT); green and white (PVEM); orange and white (MC); and purple and white (PES).

Avoid wearing loose clothing, military style patterns, political slogans, media branding, and flammable materials (e.g. nylon).

Wear footwear with hard soles, laces, and some kind of ankle support.

Fix long hair into a bun or a low braid that can be tucked into clothing. This will prevent individuals from pulling you from behind. Avoid wearing chains, lanyards, or jewelry around your neck for the same reason.

Take a medical kit if you know how to use it, and ensure you have a full battery on your mobile phone. If this is not feasible, try and take a portable power bank with you and a charger.

Only carry the minimum amount of equipment with you as necessary, which will help keep you agile and won’t weigh you down if you need to move quickly.

Limit the number of valuables you take. Do not leave any equipment in vehicles, which are likely to be broken into. After dark, the criminal risk increases.

Positioning & situation awareness

Consider your position and maintain situational awareness at all times. If feasible find an elevated vantage point that might offer greater safety.

If working close to a crowd, keep to the periphery and avoid being sucked into the middle, where it is hard to escape. All journalists should be conscious of not outstaying their welcome in a crowd, which can turn hostile quickly.

Continuously observe and read the mood and demeanor of the authorities in relation to the crowd dynamic. Police can become more aggressive if the crowd is agitated (or vice versa). Visual cues such as the appearance of police dressed in riot gear or throwing of projectiles are potential indicators that aggression can be expected. Pull back to a safe location, or plan a quick extraction when such ‘red flags’ are evident.

Photojournalists generally have to be in the thick of the action so are more at risk. Consider having someone watch your back, remember to look up from their viewfinder every few seconds to assess your position, and avoid wearing the camera strap around your neck to prevent strangulation or being pulled to the ground. Photojournalists often do not have the luxury of being able to work at a distance, so it is important to minimize the time spent in the crowd. Get your shots and get out.

Identify the closest point of medical assistance.

Dealing with tear gas

The use of tear gas can result in sneezing, coughing, spitting, crying, and the production of mucus that obstructs breathing. In some cases, individuals may vomit, and breathing may become labored. Such symptoms could potentially increase media workers’ level of exposure to coronavirus infection via airborne virus droplets. Individuals who suffer from respiratory issues like asthma, who are listed in the COVID-19 vulnerable category, should therefore avoid covering crowd events and protests if tear gas is likely to be deployed.

In addition, evidence suggests that tear gas can actually increase an individual’s susceptibility to pathogens such as coronavirus, as highlighted by NPR.

For further guidance about dealing with exposure to and the effects of tear gas, please refer to CPJ’s civil disorder advisory (available in Spanish here).

Physical harassment and assault

Media workers have previously been threatened and assaulted by protesters, criminal groups, and the police in Mexico, as highlighted by CPJ. When dealing with aggression, consider the following the safety advice:

Assess the mood of protesters toward journalists before entering any crowd, and remain vigilant for potential assailants. If the crowd is hostile, retreat to a safe location as soon as possible.

Read body language to identify an aggressor/s, and use your own body language to pacify a situation.

Keep eye contact with an aggressor, use open hand gestures, and keep talking with a calming manner.

Keep an extended arm’s length from the threat. Back away and break away firmly without aggression if held. If cornered and in danger, shout.

If aggression increases, keep a hand free to protect your head and move with short deliberate steps to avoid falling. If in a team, stick together and link arms.

While there are times when documenting aggression is crucial journalistic work, be aware of the situation and your own safety. Taking pictures of aggressive individuals can escalate a situation.

If you are accosted, hand over what the assailant wants. No equipment or money is worth your life.

Physical Safety: Reporting in a hostile community

During the election cycle, media workers may be required to work in areas or among communities that are hostile to the media or outsiders. This can happen if a community wants to protect illicit activities and individuals from being discovered, such as drug trafficking or human trafficking, and therefore view journalists as a threat that could potentially expose them. Others may believe that the media does not fairly represent them or portrays them in a negative light.

To help reduce the risks

Secure permission to access communities in advance, noting that turning up without an invitation or someone vouching for you can cause problems. Try and ascertain what the likely reaction to the media will be by researching the community and their views in advance. Adopt a low profile if necessary.

Be aware that certain parts of Mexico are governed by indigenous communities who have their own laws and/or their own civilian police force. If working in such a community you must obtain the permission of the community in advance, and thoroughly research the local laws, customs, and rules to prevent issues on location.

If you are not familiar with the area or are perceived as an outsider, consider hiring a local facilitator, community leader, or person of repute in the community who can accompany you and help coordinate your activities. Identify a local power broker who can help in case of an emergency.

If crime rates are high, and/or if there is endemic abuse of alcohol or drugs in the community, be aware that the unpredictability factor increases.

If visiting a community is particularly high risk, consider wearing a covert protective body vest.

Ideally work in a team or with back up. Depending on the risk level, the backup can wait in a nearby safe location, such as a shopping mall or petrol station, to react if necessary.

Think about the geography of the area and plan accordingly. Consider the need for security if the risk is high. A locally hired ‘backwatcher’ to protect you/your equipment can be attuned to a developing threat while you are concentrating on work.

–Park your vehicle in the direction of escape, ideally with the driver in the vehicle ready to go. –If you have to work remotely from your transportation, know how to get back to it. Identify landmarks and share this information with colleagues. –Know where to go in case of a medical emergency, and work out an exit strategy.

Always ask for consent before filming/photographing an individual. Be respectful to the individuals and their beliefs/concerns at all times.

When you have the content you need, get out and do not linger any longer than necessary. It is helpful to have a pre-agreed cut off time and to depart at that time. If a team member is uncomfortable, do not waste time having a discussion. Just leave.

Wear clothing without media company branding, which should be appropriate and respectful. Remove media logos from equipment/vehicles if necessary.

Take a medical kit if you know how to use it.

Limit the amount of valuables/cash that you take. Will thieves be attracted by your equipment? If you are accosted, hand over what they want. Equipment is not worth your life.

Avoid working in a hostile community at night, when the risk level increases dramatically.

Before broadcast/publication consider that you may need to return to this location. Will your coverage affect your welcome if you return?

Physical Safety: COVID-19 considerations

Large crowds are commonplace at election events and/or related protests. Maintaining physical distancing measures at such events will be challenging, members of the public may not wear face coverings/facemasks, and media workers could be confined to a particular area in close proximity to other journalists. Such confinement could potentially expose them to virus droplets, as well as verbal or physical attacks from hostile members of the public, who could cough or sneeze over them.

Be aware that people shouting or chanting can result in the spread of virus droplets, therefore increasing media workers’ level of exposure to coronavirus infection.

Always research what COVID-19 restrictions are in place where you will be reporting from, which will vary according to each location and may change with little or no notice. A useful state by state guide can be seen here.

Be aware that restrictions may limit the movement of individuals, as seen at the northern border with the United State and the southern borders with Guatemala and Belize, according to Politica Expansion, a digital magazine.

If travelling internationally to cover the Mexican elections you may be required to provide evidence of a recent COVID-19 test, and/or need to quarantine on arrival. Always check the latest requirements in advance.

Wearing a good quality face mask is essential at any crowded event or protest (i.e. N95 / FFP2 standard or higher). Be aware that fines can still be levied by the authorities for not wearing a face mask in public, despite recent court cases in Mexico finding the mandatory wearing of face masks unconstitutional.

Ensure you wash your hands regularly, properly, and thoroughly as often as feasible throughout the assignment. Ensure hands are dried in the appropriate way. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer regularly if you can’t wash your hands, but try not to make this a substitute for a regular hand washing routine.

All equipment should be thoroughly cleaned post-assignment.

All clothing and shoes should be removed before re-entering your home and washed / cleaned with hot water and detergent where possible.

For further detailed COVID-19 reporting guidance, please see CPJ’s COVID-19 safety advisory (available in Spanish here).

Editor’s safety checklist

Editors may require media workers to cover election-related events and stories at short notice, and should consider the increased level of risk when reporting from areas of high crime or an election event that could turn hostile (e.g. a protest). This checklist includes key questions and steps to consider to help reduce risk for staff.

Staff considerations

Does the profile, identity, or gender of any staff member make them a possible target?

Are selected staff experienced enough for the assignment?

Do any selected staff fall into the COVID-19 vulnerable categories or have family members/dependents who rely upon them? If so, have they been vaccinated with the required number of doses?

Are selected staff fit enough and/or have any health issues that could affect them during the assignment?

Does the specific role of any selected staff put them at more risk? For example, photojournalists who work closer to the action.

Equipment & transport

Have you discussed the risk of COVID-19 exposure with selected staff, and provided them with good quality face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitizer?

If violent protests are likely, have you made available the relevant PPE, such as safety helmets, safety goggles, body armor, tear gas respirators, and medical kits? Do staff know how to use such equipment properly?

Are selected staff driving themselves, and is their vehicle roadworthy and appropriate?

Have you identified how you will communicate with the team and how they will remove themselves from a situation if necessary?

General considerations

Is the level of risk to selected staff acceptable relative to the editorial gain?

Have selected staff been issued with the appropriate accreditation, press passes, or a letter indicating they work for your organization?

Have you recorded and securely saved the emergency contact details of all staff going on the assignment?

Have you set up a check-in procedure (if deemed necessary)?

Is the team correctly insured and have you put in place appropriate medical cover?

Have you identified local medical facilities in case of injury, and made team members aware of the details?

Have you considered and discussed the possibility of trauma-related stress that could result from the assignment?

Digital Safety: General best practice

Journalists face a range of digital threats as they cover the upcoming Mexican elections. The last election saw an increase in online harassment and misinformation campaigns targeting journalists, which has continued under the current administration. Newsrooms may also find that their sites are targeted by DDoS attacks which take down a website leaving media outlets with no platform on which to publish. This strategy was used against political candidates, according to reports.

The Cartel Project, a collaborative investigative journalism initiative, has reported that at least 25 companies have sold surveillance software to Mexican law enforcement, and some has been obtained by drug cartels. CPJ has collated reports of multiple Mexican journalists or family members targeted with spyware, as well as responses from the government and the Israeli company NSO Group, who are accused of supplying them with advanced Pegasus spyware. Learn more in CPJ’s Pegasus advisory.

Best practices

Secure your accounts against hackers by turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) and creating unique long passwords of more than 20 characters. Use a password manager, currently the most secure way of managing passwords, if possible.

Update devices, apps, and browsers regularly to protect against malware, including spyware.

Be aware of phishing attacks–messages tailored to trick you into installing malware that may be sent via WhatsApp groups, social media messages, email, or SMS. Avoid clicking on a link; instead, verify the information through a search engine or by calling the sender. Use the preview button in your email account to view documents and take screenshots to avoid downloading them.

Newsroom IT teams should increase security on websites to protect against DDoS attacks, including deploying web application firewalls and ensuring extra server capacity. Smaller newsrooms should sign up for services such as Cloudflare Project Galileo or Google Project Shield. Plan what to do if your site is taken offline.

Digital Safety: Preparing your devices for political rallies

Journalists covering the election campaign are likely to be using newsroom equipment as well as their own devices while out reporting. Journalists’ devices are at risk of being stolen, broken, or taken and/or searched either at an event or when travelling to it. Journalists using their personal devices are more at risk of others gaining access to their personal data, including information on family members. Taking steps to remove or limit access to information before travelling is key to better security.

Preparing your devices: best practices

Review what information is on your phone or laptop. Backup and delete documents, photos, videos, and other material that contain personal information about you, your family, or your sources.

Be mindful that documents gathered while doing research for stories on organized crime, political candidates, or the authorities could put you at risk should your devices be searched. Review footage from cameras and remove photos and videos that you would not want to fall into the wrong hands.

Set up your devices to remote wipe. Devices will only remote wipe if they are connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or data.

Secure your devices with a password.

Think about whether to use biometrics or not to unlock your phone. This can be useful if you need to gain access to your device quickly, but it also means that others are more easily able to unlock your phone by holding it up to your face or forcing your finger to unlock it.

Consider turning on encryption for your laptop or Android phone. The latest version of iPhone comes with encryption as standard. Encrypting your devices will ensure that if your device is stolen people will be unable to access your data without the password.

Log out of your accounts and delete your browsing history. This will better protect your accounts from being accessed should someone gain entry to your device.

Log out of and remove apps that you do not need to use when on the election trail, especially apps that contain a lot of personal information about you or your family.

Be aware that contact details of others are stored in the cloud account linked to the phone as well as on the device itself.

Take as few devices with you as possible. If you have a spare phone it is better to travel with that and leave your personal phone at home.

On the ground: best practice

Phone calls and SMS messages can be intercepted, so where possible use end-to-end encrypted messaging services, such as WhatsApp or Signal, to communicate with others. Where possible set messages to delete after a certain timeframe.

If you are live streaming be aware that this gives away your location, which has physical security implications.

Backup your work frequently in case you are detained or if your devices are broken or stolen.

Digital Safety: Online abuse and misinformation campaigns

Journalists are likely to face an increased level of online harassment, including targeted attacks and misinformation campaigns directed against them, during election time. This was the case in 2018, when political supporters, bots, and online harassers targeted media workers covering the election cycle, as documented by Freedom House. Journalists in Mexico have also been facing an increasingly hostile online environment under the current president, as documented by CPJ, indicating that online threats are likely to increase during the upcoming election. There are a number of steps that journalists can take to better protect themselves and their accounts.

To minimize the risk

Secure your accounts with 2FA, long passwords, and a password manager, as described above. Don’t reuse passwords.

Search for your name using various search engines and remove data that you do not want available in the public domain.

Review your social media accounts and remove or limit access to any personal data that can be used to verify your identity or locate you. Remove any contact details, such as personal phone numbers, that you do not want made public.

Look through your accounts and remove any photos or images that could be manipulated and used as a way to discredit you.

Monitor your accounts for signs of increased trolling activity or for indications that a digital threat could become a physical threat. See below for more details on what makes a greater threat. Be aware that certain stories are likely to attract higher levels of harassment.

Speak with family and friends about online harassment. Online abusers often obtain information about journalists via the social media accounts of their relatives and social circle. Ask family and friends to remove from or limit access to photos of you on their social media sites.

If you can, speak with your editor about having a plan in place should you need to leave your home as a result of an online threat. If you are a freelance journalist, speak with colleagues about online abuse and setting up a support network to help you should you need it.

During an attack

Try to ascertain who is behind the attack and their motives. This can help you gauge the risk of a physical threat.

Look at your messages and to see whether there is a high risk of a physical attack. The risk is deemed to be higher if data, such as your home address or phone number, is being circulated online. If you do not feel able to review your messages you should ask a colleague or trusted friend to do it for you.

Document any comments or images that are of concern, including screenshots of the trolling, the time, the date, and the social media handle of the troll. This information may be useful at a later date if you wish to report the abuse to a social media company, your editor, organizations that defend freedom of expression, or, in some cases, the authorities.

Inform your family, employees, and friends that you are being harassed online. Adversaries will often contact family members and friends as part of the harassment cycle.

Blocking, muting, and restricting who can reply to your messages may be helpful steps to take, although this restricts your ability to interact with others online and may mean that you miss potentially threatening messages.

Consider making most of your social media accounts private until the harassment has died down.

Work with your newsroom to decide if and how you should respond to online harassment. It is not feasible or useful to respond to each message. However, during a misinformation campaign it may be helpful to have a message of support from your newsroom pinned at the top of your and their social media feed.

Online harassment can be an isolating experience. Ensure that you have a support network to assist you. In a best-case scenario, this will include your employer. For more information about how to protect your mental health in the event of an online attack, consult CPJ’s safety note (available in Spanish here).

This article is brought to you in association with the European Commission.

Commissioner Lenarčič, who is currently in South Sudan, has announced today new funding of €43.5 million in humanitarian aid in the country. The funds will be used, among others, to help those most in need, including with protection and food assistance, as well as those affected by man-made and natural disasters.

Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčic, said: “The humanitarian situation across South Sudan is extremely dire. Parts of this youngest African country are facing famine-like conditions and the country as a whole is bracing itself for the worst food crisis ever. There seems to be little international interest in this acute situation in the country. Only five donors, including the European Commission, account for almost 77% of the total aid to South Sudan. This lack of interest risks turning this already disastrous situation into a forgotten crisis. A scale-up of the humanitarian response is urgently needed from all donors to ensure the adequate capacities are in place. Not getting things right now will make matters even worse next year with even more lives being lost.”

The EU funding announced today will help address acute humanitarian needs, provide humanitarian protection to communities affected by violence, and strengthen preparedness to deal with new shocks, including epidemics and natural disasters. With millions of children remaining out of school in South Sudan, part of the funding will also be allocated to Education in Emergencies.

Background

In South Sudan, there are over 8 million people whose fundamental needs are not met, including more than 7 million who are severely food insecure. Parts of the country are facing famine-like conditions. This alarming situation is mainly triggered by pervasive violence against civilians in large parts of the country also affecting the security and work of humanitarian aid workers

Since the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the EU has also mobilised a wide range of tools and instruments in direct response to the broader humanitarian and development challenges in South Sudan, ranging from emergency health assistance to supplying protective equipment to frontline health workers, to strengthening lab capacity and supporting peace in the context of the COVID-19 crisis.

Overall in 2020, the European Commission allocated over €21 million to the pandemic response in the country, including by financing two Humanitarian Air Bridge flights that brought 65 tons of personal protective equipment for frontline workers in July 2020. This year, the EU is supporting the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to South Sudan through the COVAX facility, which delivered its initial shipment at the end of March. Additionally, the Commission just launched a €100 million EU humanitarian initiative to support the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Africa.","Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://europeansting.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/sudan.jpeg?w=1200,"['million', 'aid', 'including', '43', 'response', 'situation', 'south', 'sudan', 'humanitarian', 'eu', 'covid19', 'country', 'allocates']", 
79,79,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,China's Creative Challenge—and the Threat to America - Hal Brands - Commentary Magazine,https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/hal-brands/chinas-geopolitical-challenge-threat-to-america/,"CHINA HAS the look of a self-confident superpower. Beijing is testing geopolitical limits and asserting its influence almost everywhere; it is no laonger content to accept second-tier status among the great powers. This much was clear from a stormy meeting between high-ranking U.S. and Chinese officials in Alaska in March 2021. After Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan began by briefly enumerating American grievances with Chinese behavior, their counterparts—Foreign Minister Wang Yi and foreign-affairs potentate Yang Jiechi—responded with a blistering critique of U.S. diplomatic and domestic practices. Their tirade was reminiscent of Soviet propaganda attacks during the Cold War. “Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States,” Yang taunted. “The leaders of China have the wide support of the Chinese people.”

Over the past half-decade, it has become ever more difficult for foreign observers to deny what Beijing itself admits—that China is pursuing a dramatic revision of the U.S.-led international order in Asia and globally. Yet that hegemonic challenge is not simply bringing China into competition with the established superpower. It is also bringing Premier Xi Jinping’s regime up against the most deeply entrenched patterns of modern geopolitics.

The impression Chinese officials seek to create is that history is now firmly on the side of a rising Communist regime rather than a decadent American democracy. History, however, might beg to differ. It shows that autocracies like China have consistently been outmatched by more liberal states over the past 400 years. History also suggests that China confronts a daunting strategic geography—including a beleaguered but intact international order—that is more likely to obstruct than enable its efforts. China’s path to primacy is harder than it might once have seemed since one traditional lane of advance—military aggression—is riskier than it was in previous eras. Finally, China is going up against a country that has destroyed, physically or geopolitically, every one of its great-power rivals over the last century. China may be the most formidable competitor America has ever faced—but America is perhaps the most dangerous enemy the world has ever produced.

The fact that China has risen so fast, so far, and with—until recently—so little global resistance is a tribute to the creativity of Beijing’s strategies for addressing these challenges. Yet many of those strategies worked best in a world that had been complacent about China’s trajectory. Today, America and other nations are beginning to focus in earnest on thwarting Beijing’s ascent. One wonders whether Xi and his subordinates are really as confident as they seem.

_____________

WHEN XI JINPING publicly declared in October 2017 that China was ready to take “center stage” in the world and blaze “a new trail” for others to follow, he wasn’t saying anything new. He was just articulating longstanding Chinese aims. Five years earlier, Xi had resolved that China must wage a long struggle for geopolitical primacy: It should lay “the foundation for a future where we will win the initiative and have the dominant position.”

Beijing has been pursuing a grand strategy featuring four goals of escalating aspiration. First, Chinese leaders intend to make certain that the Communist Party maintains its iron hold on power. Xi’s fundamental purpose, one official explained in 2017, was “ensuring the leading role of the Communist Party in all aspects of life.” Second, they are determined to make China whole again, by reincorporating alienated territories, such as Taiwan and Hong Kong, into the CCP-led state. Third, Xi wants to create “Asia for Asians,” a regional sphere of influence in which China dominates while outside actors, especially Washington, are pushed to the margins. Finally, Beijing is resolved to make China “a global leader in…composite national strength and international influence,” allowing it to weaken the U.S.-led international order and erect more Sino-centric arrangements. Beijing’s goal, said Xi, was a “stable international order” in which China’s “national rejuvenation” can be fully attained. These goals are connected. The imperative of defending an illiberal polity has solidified Beijing’s determination to reshape its regional and global environment.

In 2019, Xi described the CCP’s tangle with America as another “long march”—an epic struggle for survival and supremacy. China’s march is well underway.

It has already achieved the political reincorporation of Hong Kong and is issuing explicit threats, punctuated by menacing military exercises, against Taiwan. It has been building up its military for three decades; it put more ships, between 2014 and 2018, to sea than the Indian, Spanish, British, and German navies possessed combined. Looking forward, Beijing is seeking to dominate the high-tech industries that will produce economic and military power in the 21st century. It is using a multi-continental initiative, the Belt and Road, to propel its economic, diplomatic, and perhaps military influence into countries from Oceania to Latin America by greasing large-scale public-works projects. Not least, it is weaponizing its economic heft to coopt international institutions, deter other countries from challenging it, and suppress “hostile” speech in democratic societies around the world. In 2020, China used the COVID pandemic it helped create as an opportunity to aggressively push its agenda on multiple fronts at once.

Certain Chinese strategists and intellectuals are now openly advocating a “new China-centric global economic order” and saying that Beijing should cast aside a U.S.-led system that is no longer suited for its purpose. And given the zero-sum strains of Leninist thinking, the tendency for interests to expand with power, and the fact that the Chinese strategic tradition—like the American strategic tradition—has historically emphasized primacy rather than parity, it seems likely that Beijing will aim for something greater than a mere balance of power. “Empires have no interest in operating within an international system,” writes Henry Kissinger. “They aspire to be the international system.”

The question, then, is less what China wants than whether it can attain the things for which it is openly striving. Understanding the obstacles Beijing confronts simply underscores how ambitious—and fraught—its agenda is.

II

THE MOST OBVIOUS obstacle is that autocratic powers do not run the modern world. Napoleon, Hitler, and Stalin and his Soviet successors all mounted serious challenges to the global equilibrium. All were eventually defeated by their more liberal rivals and the coalitions they rallied. For at least 400 years, relatively liberal countries (by the standards of their time) have been the most powerful states in the international system. Autocratic powers start fights for global leadership—often causing cataclysmic damage—but democracies finish them.

There are good reasons for this. Democracies can typically borrow money more easily than autocracies, because they have deeper financial markets and can make more credible promises to repay. Open political systems underpin the open economic and intellectual ecosystems that deliver sustained growth and innovation: Democracies sometimes grow more slowly than high-performing autocracies, but their performance tends to be steadier over time. Democracies likewise excel at building alliances because domestic habits of tolerance and compromise also lubricate their foreign relationships. There is strong evidence that democracies have a military edge over autocracies, because they allow the decentralized decision-making and local initiative that modern warfare demands. Democracies even have a long-term advantage in decision-making, because the same constraints that water down brilliant strategic ideas help waylay terrible ones. Autocratic regimes, by contrast, may soar geopolitically for a time, but they usually crash back to earth in the end.

The Chinese Communist Party cannot cease being autocratic without ceasing to be the Chinese Communist Party. But its leaders understand, or did for a time, that it takes a smarter authoritarianism to compete with a democratic superpower. Post-Mao reforms, such as the rise of collective leadership and term limits, protected against the personalistic rule that produced two epochal disasters—the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution—in a single decade. The turn to authoritarian capitalism was meant to reconcile the demands of the market with the power of the party—and succeeded, beyond anyone’s expectations, for two generations. The People’s Liberation Army has acknowledged that its officers still struggle to take the initiative and adapt to the unexpected, and it has been trying to address these problems.

Meanwhile, the Party stole intellectual property on a historic scale to narrow the technological gap with the West. And it marshaled the resources of society to make potentially game-changing investments in AI, 5G technology, and other critical areas. Perhaps most ominous, Beijing is seeking to reduce the economic costs of repression by using pervasive surveillance and a big-data powered “social-credit system” to enforce political loyalty more subtly but more systematically. Over the past 40 years, Chinese governance has revolved around the effort to squeeze greater performance out of the system without surrendering an iota of political control.

Aspects of this strategy have delivered such remarkable results that it is now common to wonder whether smart autocracies will rule the future. Some observers fear that China will turn repression into a strategic advantage by using control of a captive population to vacuum up data that will power world-beating AI algorithms.

But the geopolitical limitations of autocracy are not so easily overcome. The Chinese army can streamline command-and-control, but its personnel will still be spending lots of time undergoing political indoctrination and lots of resources guarding against internal upheaval. The high-tech surveillance state in Xinjiang may be the future of authoritarianism, but the horrors inflicted there on the Uighur population—torture, mass incarceration, rape, forced sterilization—resemble the timeless methods of tyrannies past. The clash between control and dynamism remains real, as shown by Beijing’s support for economy-clogging state-owned enterprises and the decision to subjugate Hong Kong politically even at the risk of undermining its status as a global financial center.

When it comes to innovation, an autocracy can throw massive resources at particularly technologies or problems, but it is hard to unleash the creativity of a society over the long term without allowing the intellectual—and thus political—freedom that the party dreads. And if many democracies are economically interwoven with Beijing, few seem genuinely enthusiastic about the rise of a hyper-nationalist, Leninist power that perpetrates horrifying atrocities at home and unapologetically bullies other countries abroad. In sum, optimizing autocracy for competition seems to require tempering the most basic characteristics of illiberal regimes—an exercise that is inevitably difficult to sustain over time.

The exercise is not, in fact, being sustained. In concentrating power, purging his rivals, empowering political commissars to oversee private firms, and building a Mao-like cult of personality, Xi is making the Chinese system more responsive to his demands. American observers lament the fact that Chinese firms undertake geopolitically salient projects at Xi’s behest, whereas Washington can only encourage—often ineffectually—U.S. companies to do business in strategic hot spots. Yet Xi is also raising the odds of a neo-totalitarian future in which loyalty trumps competence, command trumps spontaneity, and the overall competitiveness of the system erodes. Indeed, if the Chinese state is getting “smarter” because of ubiquitous surveillance technologies, its institutions are getting dumber thanks to the return of neo-Maoist ideology and political tactics. China has gotten tremendous mileage out of its political model, but it may be becoming more vulnerable to the burdens autocracy imposes.

If anything, the strains on the Chinese system are about to get worse. Countries that fall off a demographic cliff—as will happen to China in the next two generations—almost always struggle to grow economically or underwrite successful military-modernization programs. A growing debt burden, severe environmental problems, and levels of inequality that should make a “socialist” system blush will pose progressively sterner demands on a political model that is becoming less supple—all while democratic countries are, presumably, closing off avenues for illicit technology acquisition and otherwise exacerbating China’s external pressures. The CCP has dreams of breaking through into a new era of global primacy. Yet muddling through may be the very best an increasingly autocratic system can manage.

EXPANSION IS THE NAME of the game for rising empires. In that respect, Beijing’s strategic geography is more advantageous than the Soviet Union’s was: China looks out on the vital trade routes of the Western Pacific rather than the (once) ice-blocked passages of the Arctic Ocean. Nonetheless, Beijing’s surroundings are, on balance, disadvantageous to hegemonic designs. For hundreds of years, would-be hegemons on the Eurasian landmass have provoked potent balancing coalitions that link the continental states they threaten with offshore powers who seek to keep that landmass fractured.

China is particularly vulnerable to this dilemma. On its Pacific frontier is a strategic cordon of actors—South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines—each of which enjoys a strong relationship with the United States. To the south are rivals India and Vietnam. To its north, China has a long land border with another ambitious, continent-size autocracy. America can project power globally because it is surrounded by weak or friendly states, but China is ringed by countries that are comparatively formidable and, in many cases, ill-disposed to its hegemony. Simply by giving support to China’s neighbors, America can create persistent insecurity along its competitor’s frontiers.

The predicament is worsened because China is challenging an order that is under stress but still very much exists. America still anchors alliances in the Western Pacific and around the globe. The liberal order is still embodied in organizations and relationships that benefit so many countries. We don’t live in 1945, when Soviet expansion seemed so easy because there were power vacuums everywhere. Even a frayed liberal order binds together many countries that, as they come to appreciate China’s intentions, may be inclined to counter its rise.

Beijing’s answer to its predicament has been multipronged and remarkably creative. First, China has chosen to coopt or exploit aspects of the existing order rather than confronting it head-on. For years, China reaped the benefits of an open international economy while pursuing a more mercantilist policy meant to yield eventual economic and technological supremacy. Within global institutions, China patiently placed its nationals or other friendly candidates atop key bodies, thus subtly turning their norms and operations to Chinese advantage. Where China built its own institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, it focused on filling obvious seams—such as shortfalls in funding for developing countries—in the existing architecture. Across these initiatives, Chinese diplomats used the language and logic of the liberal order—win-win cooperation, complex interdependence—to conceal a mounting challenge to the order’s underlying principles. The agonizing debates many democratic countries are having about the costs of economic and strategic rupture with China attest to the impressive results this strategy has yielded.

At the same time, Chinese officials have sought to turn the country’s geography to its advantage. Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative is many things, from a bid to export surplus goods and capital to an effort to develop overland lines of supply and communication. Most broadly, it involves using Chinese economic and technological influence—loans, telecommunications infrastructure, smart cities, and other projects—to create a vast Eurasian zone oriented toward Beijing and thus unable or unwilling to resist its ascent. Belt and Road can, for example, help China encircle rivals such as India with projects that convey influence—and potentially military access—in Sri Lanka and Pakistan; it can allow Beijing to build global influence without confronting America’s Pacific alliances directly.

Meanwhile, Beijing has endeavored to weaken those alliances through hard and soft measures. Warnings that U.S. friends might be caught in the cross-fire of a Sino-American war, the use of economic inducements to lure away wavering allies, and the employment of economic sanctions against countries deemed hostile to Beijing are counterparts to the massive military buildup and steady gray-zone coercion meant to convince key countries that American protection isn’t worth much anymore. If the countries of maritime Asia drift away from Washington, America will lose the regional footholds it uses to constrain Chinese power.

Beijing has made some progress. U.S. alliances with Thailand and the Philippines are fraying, while Malaysia and Indonesia are desperate not to have to choose between America and China. Even Seoul might deny the Pentagon use of its South Korean bases in a conflict with China. Yet in other ways, the landscape is hardly reassuring. The growing cohesion and ambition of the Quad—a U.S.-Japan-India-Australia combination that unites democracies at nearly every point on Beijing’s compass—is precisely the strategic encirclement one might expect a country in China’s position to produce.

The Eurasian gambit faces great uncertainties, too. It requires, as a minimum condition of success, keeping Russia pacified—a task Xi and his predecessors have managed very well. But if history is any guide, the long-run prospects for cooperation between two revisionist, continent-size powers are not encouraging, and those prospects may dwindle further as the audacity of China’s Eurasian game comes into view. Meanwhile, Chinese resources are hardly inexhaustible, and the plunge in Belt and Road financing in 2020—after years in which announced funding significantly exceeded actual funding—raises questions about whether the project’s reality can match its hype. Even if it can, expansion creates vulnerabilities as well as advantages: Any strategy that involves major infrastructure projects in the roughest parts of Pakistan is begging for blowback.

That blowback could be quite severe. China needs Belt and Road because it is a resource-poor country that has badly depleted key assets such as arable land and fresh water in recent decades. This poverty makes China highly dependent on foreign imports of food, energy, and other commodities—the sort of dependencies a hostile superpower might squeeze in a conflict. Belt and Road is envisioned as a solution to this problem, but it cannot change the fact that Beijing is dependent on long, vulnerable supply lines it may have to pay a great deal to sustain. The project indicates China’s weakness—the fact that it is an increasingly barren country that must look elsewhere for sustenance—as much as its strength.

Finally, China is discovering what profound structural advantages Washington enjoys by dint of its position in the existing order. During the Trump presidency, America used existing relationships and institutions—whether NATO or the Five Eyes intelligence partnership—to begin building international coalitions against Chinese power. If Washington indeed constructs a liberal “tech coalition,” it may well do so by expanding the Group of Seven, a venerable club of advanced democracies. None of this will be easy, as Germany’s recent decision to cut an EU-China investment deal over American protests confirms. But the array of America’s strategic options for countering China’s ascent shows just what an uphill climb awaits Beijing.

IV

CHINA’S PATH to the top is also impeded by another obstacle—the fact that outright military revisionism is more difficult than it once was. War, even great-power war, is not obsolete: If it was, the Chinese army wouldn’t be preparing menacingly to invade Taiwan, and Chinese and Indian soldiers wouldn’t be bashing each other with studded sticks high in the Himalayas. But since 1945, the combination of nuclear weapons and U.S. security guarantees has made it incredibly risky for a revisionist power to overturn the balance of power in a key region. Thanks to this intersection of technology and strategy, the postwar world has been biased toward the stability of a U.S.-dominated status quo.

Chinese strategists have fashioned two answers to this problem. One involves coercion short of war—for instance, the literal island-building and the subtler incremental pressure Beijing has used to assert control of the South China Sea without triggering a military showdown with the United States. This strategy exploits ambiguities along the front lines of geopolitical contention; it tests, but typically stops just short of, “red lines” associated with U.S. military commitments. The goal is to shift the calculations of regional states, by making them question whether their relationships with Washington are relevant to the most pressing threat they face—the continuing erosion of their maritime sovereignty. Over time, this strategy might produce a “win without fighting” outcome, in which Manila, Hanoi, and other players realize that resistance is futile, so they make their peace with Beijing.

The other strategy involves rupturing the status quo by preparing for short, sharp wars rather than an all-out rush for regional hegemony. Beijing has so far avoided the sort of nuclear-arms race Moscow lost during the Cold War (although that restraint may be slipping, given reports of a major nuclear buildup). Instead, the military has emphasized planning for limited, conventional wars meant to conquer Taiwan or subdue the Philippines in the South China Sea, while using anti-ship missiles, quiet submarines, and other “anti-access/area denial” capabilities to keep Washington from rushing forces to the rescue. One should never underestimate the potential for nuclear escalation in a confrontation between great powers. But insofar as the possibility of war figures in the PRC’s agenda, Chinese leaders appear to envision relatively quick, Bismarckian clashes that reorder the psychological landscape—and thus the strategic landscape—of Asia without triggering all-out conflict.

These strategies reveal serious dilemmas for the United States. One reason it was so risky for the Soviet Union to exploit its conventional edge in Europe during the Cold War was that Moscow’s conquest of the continent would have so changed the global balance of power that Washington might plausibly have used nuclear weapons to stop it. But precisely because the immediate stakes are lower in the Taiwan Strait or the South China Sea, so is the credibility of any threat to use nuclear weapons to avoid defeat. Chinese strategy thus creates the prospect that America would have to make a huge conventional effort, potentially suffering heavy casualties and losing lots of expensive assets, to deny relatively limited territorial gains on the other side of the world. Meanwhile, American officials acknowledge that the creeping enhancement of China’s position in the South China Sea—the building of what Admiral Harry Harris called a “great wall of sand”—has given Beijing control of that body in all situations short of war. “America has lost” the struggle for East Asia, Prime Minister Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines declared in 2016.

Fortunately, it’s not that simple. Clever strategies aside, successful operations in the Western Pacific require projecting lots of power over lots of water—something that is extremely hard for any military, let alone one like China’s that hasn’t faced serious combat in generations. Darkening American assessments of what China wants have made it more likely that the United States would fight to defend Taiwan, while the Pentagon is making that scenario the centerpiece of its war planning and preparations. Defending that island would be incredibly demanding for the United States, but attempting to subdue it would still represent an existential gamble for the Party. And even if China succeeded in grabbing Taiwan, the geography of maritime Asia precludes a regional knockout blow of the sort that Germany administered to Europe in 1940. Other countries, namely Japan, would have the time and space needed to respond, perhaps by quickly building nuclear weapons that they would certainly use to defend their own soil.

Meanwhile, gray-zone coercion has pushed certain frontline states in Southeast Asia toward neutralism, but it has pushed other countries—notably the members of the Quad—toward stronger balancing with the United States. And as Beijing runs out of strategic space in the gray zone, it will face harder decisions about whether to test clearer American red lines—a dilemma the Trump and Biden administrations both worked to sharpen by clarifying what sort of Chinese behavior might trigger U.S. defense obligations to the Philippines or Japan. Even in the nuclear age, there is no easy way to defend U.S. positions in the Western Pacific. But there is no easy path to Chinese primacy, either.

V

FINALLY, CHINA is testing the patterns of history simply by taking on the United States. America is the most lethal competitor of the modern era, and it now has its sights set squarely on Beijing.

Consider the historical record. In an environment populated mostly by hostile autocracies, America became a continental behemoth and the world’s strongest economy within a century. It then achieved something no other modern great power has managed—lasting, if periodically contested, hegemony in its home region. During the 20th century, America or the coalitions it supported decisively defeated a series of illiberal powers—Germany (twice), Japan, the Soviet Union—that challenged its vital interests. Along the way, Washington peacefully wrested global leadership from the United Kingdom. For over a century, the surest path to destruction has been inviting the focused hostility of the United States.

America’s formidable record is the product of many factors. Vast resource endowments and uniquely advantageous geography have allowed America to project power globally without facing severe geopolitical threats near home. Similarly, the fact that America is powerful and far away leads countries all around the Eurasian periphery to ally with the United States against nearby predators that threaten their independence. The country’s relatively open economy has created great dynamism and innovation; its democratic institutions have allowed it, more often than not, to use its other advantages effectively. And the slowness with which America sometimes mobilizes to confront threats contributes to the single-mindedness with which it eventually combats them.

The type of superpower America is also matters. Because America is a liberal nation, it has taken a liberal approach to global power. Since 1945, it has delivered freedom of the seas, a global reserve currency, and a massive market for foreign goods, in addition to providing security and stability in key regions. Those attributes have made other countries support the American cause, which makes American hegemony even harder to overturn. Neither China nor any other country can compete on these dimensions: Beijing lacks the ability to act as a global security provider and the willingness (as a neo-mercantilist actor) to anchor a truly open global economy. It cannot fully open its market without exposing key industries to competition and wrecking plans to reduce strategic dependence on the West. Even if China’s raw power exceeded America’s, its ability to act as a comparatively benign and popular hegemon would not.

Having helped the United States defeat the Soviet Union, Chinese leaders understood the peril of provoking American hostility: This was the crux of Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum about “hiding” capabilities and “biding” time. Chinese statecraft in the post-Tiananmen era was meant to increase Beijing’s power while delaying an American response. The building of deep commercial and financial ties with the United States not only fueled Chinese growth; it also made it more painful for America to turn toward competition. The cultivation of American elites in academia, business, and politics strengthened supporters of continued engagement. Even as Chinese statecraft become more assertive after 2008, Beijing moved incrementally—in the South China Sea and elsewhere—to avoid giving America an eye-opening “Sputnik moment.” And even as the relationship deteriorated during the Obama years, the Chinese leadership used the lure of cooperation on climate change and talk of a “new type of great-power relations” to discourage a sharper pivot in American policy.

Historians will one day marvel at how well this strategy—combined with America’s post-9/11 distraction—worked. It took two decades, from the time serious observers began warning about the Chinese challenge, for the United States to adjust its statecraft decisively. During that time, China gained access to technology, capital, and markets that powered its ascent; there emerged an incredibly complex interdependence that continues to retard multilateral mobilization against Beijing. If the United States loses the competition with China, it will be—in no small part—because Beijing successfully anesthetized Washington to a growing peril.

The bad news, from Xi’s vantage point, is that the game is up. Predatory economic behavior that America once tolerated has become more threatening as Beijing worked its way up global value chains. Small nibbles at the status quo eventually added up to larger, more alarming shifts. The Chinese government prematurely let the mask slip after the 2008–09 financial crisis, with more assertive diplomacy that gradually made the thesis of America’s engagement policy—that Beijing would mellow over time—impossible to defend. And by the Trump era, China had simply gotten tired of waiting and disguising its ambitions. COVID then did more than any Committee on the Present Danger could ever have done to reveal both the utterly cynical nature of the CCP regime—which sought to stymie the virus’s spread within China even as it allowed continued travel from Wuhan to the world—and the fact that this behavior could mortally imperil Americans’ well-being.

China is no longer the “stealth superpower”—there is now a bipartisan consensus that America must thwart its global designs. From here onward, Beijing must forcefully wrest influence from a dangerous hegemon that is alert to a new authoritarian challenge.

VI

STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS don’t determine everything: History wouldn’t be very interesting if they did. The United States always had profound advantages over the Soviet Union, but it wouldn’t have won the Cold War had it not worked feverishly to shore up Western Europe in the late 1940s and maintain a military balance that made Soviet aggression seem suicidal. Strategic urgency and commitment were what ultimately allowed America to make the most of its strengths.

That’s worth keeping in mind today. The fact that Chinese power and influence have grown so markedly in recent decades and that the resulting challenge has become so stark show the impact that determined, innovative strategy can have. The dilemmas that the United States confronts, in areas from 5G technology to the military balance in the Taiwan Strait, illustrate the costs of strategic lethargy.

Indeed, America is fully capable of squandering its advantages if it degrades or destroys its own democracy, declines to make domestic reforms and investments to maintain its competitive edge, fails to rally the overlapping coalitions needed to resist Chinese ambitions, or delays in driving the military innovation required to shore up a sagging balance in the Western Pacific. The list of hard policy problems America must urgently solve to prevail against China is itself long and formidable. And even if Washington does prevail in that rivalry, America may absorb significant setbacks—and the international order may absorb significant damage—in the process.

Yet as rough as the road ahead looks from Washington, it ought to look even rougher from Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party runs a profoundly illiberal regime that is trying to overcome centuries of liberal dominance. China is straining against a strategic geography and international system that surely seem more constraining than inviting. Chinese strategists must find a way of breaking America’s position in the Western Pacific while avoiding the potential cataclysm of major war. And Beijing is taking on a superpower that has thrashed all previous comers. Smart strategies have permitted Beijing to do remarkably well, so far, in managing these problems. But many of those strategies face an uncertain future, in part because the international complacency that allowed them to flourish has been replaced—gradually, but increasingly—with international concern.

This isn’t to say that China’s ambitions are hopeless illusions. In the coming years, there will be an intense interaction between an America that is adapting its strategies to deal with a pressing threat and a China that will have to adjust its own approaches in light of that response. Even American success in this interaction could bring new dangers: If Chinese leaders perceive that their window to achieve grand geopolitical goals is closing, then the regime could become even more aggressive in seeking to revise the global order while it still can.

Much thus hinges on the quality of decisions made in Washington and other capitals around the world. But the fact that so many characteristics of modern great-power politics seem to favor the United States probably gives the reigning superpower better options and more room for error than its autocratic challenger. Nothing is predetermined: Beijing may still succeed in displacing the United States as the primary power in Asia and, eventually, the world. Yet if it does, that outcome will represent a catastrophic failure of American statecraft—or an awesome triumph of Chinese strategy in overcoming the great obstacles that litter Beijing’s path to hegemony.

Environmental concerns cast a shadow over the crop in other parts of the world. What will African farmers do differently?

Baker Ssengendo's vision for the future of Uganda starts with an avocado seedling. ""The avocado tree has a lifespan of about 50 years. The life expectancy of an average Ugandan is about 60 years. A tree can benefit them their entire life,"" he told DW.

Ssengendo works on the 1,000 hectares of Musubi Farm in Nansana, central Uganda -- the largest Hass avocado farm in the country. ""By working in avocado farming, I am fulfilling my life dream. We want to lift our communities out of poverty.""

Due to high global demand, avocado has become a lucrative export product. Its consumption per capita increased by 406% between 1990 and 2017 in the US alone.

The so-called green gold is rapidly gaining popularity on the African continent. Both Nigeria and Uganda aim to drastically increase their avocado production and become top exporters in the next ten years. Kenya is already amongst the global top ten. Export revenues in the East African country surged by a third between 2019 and 2020. Farmers are hailing the crop as an antidote to poverty in rural areas.

But the sought-after fruit has been making negative headlines around the world. Water shortages and the destruction of biodiversity have been linked to its production. The environmental issues have cast a dark shadow over the commercial farming of avocados in Latin America's top exporting countries, such as Mexico and Chile.

On the other hand, African avocado farming is promising a brighter future, according to both farmers and scientists. Due to an emphasis on smallholders and beneficial rain patterns, the crop's production is expected to be less environmentally harmful than on the American continent.

Avocados the new oil?

""Avocado is actually a godsend because farmers can use it as an alternative to coffee farming,"" Sammy Carsan, agroforestry scientist at the World Agroforestry Center in Nairobi, told DW.

In recent years, fierce competition between large retailers has driven down coffee prices. In 2019, coffee farmers' earnings dropped to their lowest in 13 years. Now, hopes are high for avocado to fill the income gap.

According to The Guardian Nigeria, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called the fruit ""the new oil of Nigeria"" during a meeting with members of the Avocado Society of Nigeria (ASN) late last year. The politician-turned-avocado-enthusiast is the largest stakeholder in the society and owns 20 hectares of Hass avocado farming land himself -- the avocado variety most commonly used for exports.

""He gave us the mandate of making the country Africa's largest avocado exporter by 2030,"" Adeniyi Sola Bunmi, Executive Director of ASN, told DW. Currently, there are only 120 Hass avocado farmers in Nigeria. ASN is training smallholders wishing to switch to the crop and provides them with Hass seedlings.

In Uganda, the Ministry of Agriculture recently partnered with Musubi Farm, hoping to start commercial export next year. Musubi is already employing 1,000 people from the local community. ""We are also financially supporting a local school and are providing land for a local police force in order to deal with crime in the community. Avocados can transform our community,"" director of communications, Ssengendo, said.

The promise of smallholder farming

Large-scale commercial avocado farming is at the core of environmental issues, such as soil degradation, in Latin America. However, in East Africa and Nigeria, smallholders are at the center of a more sustainable avocado farming approach.

""Our plan is to have 75% of avocados produced by smallholder farmers and 25 percent by our farm,"" Ssengendo said of his vision for Uganda. In neighboring Kenya, smallholders are already spearheading avocado production, with most avocado farmers only owning about two hectares of land, according to Carsan.

Small farms mean less strain on the environment, Ruben Sommaruga, Professor of Limnology of the University of Innsbruck, told DW. ""Large industrial production always implies a large use of pesticides. That is usually not the case with smallholder farmers, who can control their small number of trees more easily.""

In smallholder settings, the crop is often complemented with other farming enterprises, such as maize and bean crops, planted for subsistence. According to Samson Ogbole, a sustainable farmer in Nigeria, mixing avocado trees with agroforestry systems can curtail negative environmental effects. ""Planting crops like legumes around the tree crops helps replenish the soil.""

Avocados for rainy days

According to the Water Footprint Network, it takes 2,000 liters of water (528 gallons), or 10 full bathtubs, to grow just one kilo of avocados. Planting the fruit has been linked to water shortages in Chile, for example, where farming has affected water availability for human consumption.

But the water consumption of the crop shouldn't be removed from its local context, according to Sommaruga. ""It's always a matter of how much and what kind of water you have in the countries where you grow the trees.""

In Uganda and Nigeria, avocado farms are mainly located in areas with beneficial rain patterns, according to Sommaruga.

""The central and southern part of Nigeria receives relatively high precipitation. The south of Uganda does as well. In Kenya, much of the avocado farming is done north of Nairobi, where mountains retain most of the rain.""

Frequent rainfall means farmers do not have to rely on irrigation systems, which artificially apply water to the soil. ""In smallholder settings, avocado is produced on a rain-fed basis with few irrigation systems,"" Carsan said about avocado farmers in Kenya.

For now, avocado production has not been linked to water shortages across African farmlands. But, as Sommaruga points out, the rain patterns that avocado farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are benefitting from today are expected to decrease in the future due to climate change.

Bunmi from the Avocado Society of Nigeria has also been farming avocados on his land, hoping to export to Ukraine and the United Kingdom in five years. ""Regarding water, I don't see any problem in the next 20 years. But maybe as time goes on,"" Bunmi said.","Sat, 01 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn04.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00561700:70c9361024ffd7050aced2414e5bf1cb:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['green', 'uganda', 'water', 'africa', 'export', 'avocado', 'farming', 'smallholder', 'rise', 'farmers', 'production', 'african', 'nigeria', 'gold']",

This article is part of the Global Policy-ORF publication — A 2030 Vision for India’s Economic Diplomacy.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant global lockdown measures have had an unprecedented social and economic impact, disproportionately affecting poorer nations. Global GDP is estimated to contract by 4.3 percent in 2020, sending an additional 130 million people into extreme poverty[1]. This effect will be particularly devastating in the 46 least developed countries (LDC), with the already low standards of living falling further and high poverty rates steadily rising. Prior achievements on education, nutrition and health are being undone by the crisis, and there is an added stress on fragile healthcare systems.

With effects of this global crisis expected to continue until the next decade, human security and development will need to take centre stage in global affairs in the next few years. The massive economic fallout of the pandemic has made it imperative to expand foreign policy focus beyond traditional concerns of states around geopolitics into more complex global development challenges like public health and climate change. Currently, India’s immediate economic and security interests — such as maintaining regional stability, ensuring balance of power and meeting energy requirements — play a key role in the development cooperation with African countries and those in the neighbourhood. These interests need to be realigned to emphasise the linkages between traditional diplomacy and new economic diplomacy, with its focus on development and human security.

India’s immediate economic and security interests — such as maintaining regional stability, ensuring balance of power and meeting energy requirements — play a key role in the development cooperation with African countries and those in the neighbourhood.

COVID-19 should be seen as a turning point, where India’s foreign policy agenda should prioritise its development partnerships. India will need to craft new strategies with a broader vision to engage in international development and global security as it bids for greater power status with agenda-setting abilities.

India’s economic diplomacy is shaped by solidarity with past associations and is largely anchored in its neighbourhood and Africa. But future economic diplomacy agencies will have to be located in a new geopolitical dimension that goes far beyond the impulse of the Bandung Conference of 1955, which set up cooperation channels between Asia and Africa in the colonial and post-colonial era[2]. The Indian Development and Economic Assistance (IDEA) programme, which began in 2003-04 as an initiative to provide grants and project assistance to developing countries in Africa, South Asia and other parts of the world, remains crucial in the post-pandemic world.

Shifting priorities

India’s commitment to international development cooperation in the financial year 2019-20 stood at US$ 1.32 billion, a significant increase over the three preceding years[3]. Although the allocation is less than 1 percent of India’s overall budget, it is still a significant contribution as compared to other high-income countries, such as Australia (US$ 2.8 billion, 0.22 percent of GDP), South Korea (US$ 2.5 billion, 0.15 percent of GDP) and Austria (US$ 1.2 billion, 0.27 percent of GDP), considering India’s US$ 2 billion in credit lines[4]. India pledged its highest foreign assistance budget so far in the financial year 2015-16, with commitments of US$ 1.52 billion that included US$ 290 million to large-scale projects like the Afghan–India Friendship Dam[5].

India’s capacity-building initiative, one of the key aspects of development cooperation, is channelled through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, which was constituted in 1964 and emerged as a prominent aspect of the development cooperation by 2015.

The country’s overseas development assistance increased substantially in the 1990s and significant changes came in 2004 when India launched the second phase of line of credit (LOC) programme to extend concessional loans to partner countries in Asia and Africa through the Export Import Bank of India (EXIM). The LOCs are provided to developing countries on the recommendations of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), with over 300 LOCs worth US$ 30.66 billion extended to 64 countries until 2020. About half this amount, US$ 15.90 billion, has been extended to Asian countries, with the largest value going to India’s neighbours — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mauritius, Maldives, Myanmar and Seychelles[6]. The funds cover critical infrastructure sectors — transport connectivity through railways, roads and ports; power generation and distribution; agriculture and irrigation; manufacturing industries, healthcare, education and capacity building.

India’s capacity-building initiative, one of the key aspects of development cooperation, is channelled through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programme, which was constituted in 1964 and emerged as a prominent aspect of the development cooperation by 2015[7]. In one of the first signs of shifting priorities for development cooperation during the coronavirus crisis, ITEC conducted a multi-country training programme on COVID-19 in June 2020 titled ‘Good Governance Practices in a Pandemic’ through a webinar, with participation from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan, Kenya, Morocco, Nepal, Oman, Somalia, Thailand, Tunisia, Tonga, Sudan and Uzbekistan[8].

Currently, India employs multiple instruments, such as grant-in-aid, line of credit, and capacity-building and technical assistance, to achieve its development cooperation objectives. The Development Partnership Administration (DPA), housed within the MEA, is responsible for the overall management, coordination and administration of India’s development partnerships[9].

Vision 2030

Official development assistance (ODA), an indicator of international aid flow, by traditional donors was severely impacted during the COVID-19 crisis[10]. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has urged the international community to safeguard ODA to face challenges to basic health infrastructure and social protection programmes from COVID-19[11]. It is becoming increasingly clear that emerging powers like the BRICS nations will play a significant role in the future, with China and Russia already showing a readiness to lead on global issues and provide international development aid. The New Development Bank (NDB), a multilateral development bank established by BRICS, has promised to provide up to US$ 10 billion in assistance to combat COVID-19 crisis and has already provided loans to Brazil, China, India and South Africa for their economic recovery[12].

India needs a clear vision to lead a sustainable development agenda while positioning itself as a global power with interests beyond its immediate neighbourhood.

Despite the slowdown induced by the pandemic, India’s GDP could reach US$ 5 trillion by 2026-27 with optimistic prospects for domestic growth and an increase in spending ability[13]. It remains to be seen whether the country will be able to continue to ramp up its ODA.

India needs a clear vision to lead a sustainable development agenda while positioning itself as a global power with interests beyond its immediate neighbourhood. To achieve this, there is an urgent need to push for reforms in existing institutional structures on development cooperation. The new institutional architecture should be able to address better delivery, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, and should engage with new actors, especially from civil society and the private sector[14].

India must move beyond government-to-government negotiations and agreements to include more plural and diverse stakeholders — such as representatives from the private sector, academia, philanthropic institutions and civil society — most of whom will be operating in distant locations. Economic diplomacy necessitates a collective beyond the government that will place ‘brand India’ at the centre of all diplomatic relations.

In January 2020, the MEA began a restructuring process to renew its focus on development cooperation along with other verticals such as cultural diplomacy, economic and trade coordination, multilateral organisations and global summits[15]. A ‘New, Emerging and Strategic Technologies’ (NEST) division is also being set to facilitate collaboration with foreign countries on advanced technologies, as well as geographical divisions for better coordination[16].

Economic diplomacy necessitates a collective beyond the government that will place ‘brand India’ at the centre of all diplomatic relations.

This paper makes a case for revisions to India’s existing institutional architecture for development cooperation through five key approaches: the Development Cooperation Act (2022), the establishment of an independent development partnership agency, private sector and civil society engagement, multilateralism, and plurilateralism.

India’s Development Cooperation Act, 2022

India must redefine its ‘development cooperation’ as a set of activities with clearly defined objectives (such as environmental protection, strengthening of public health systems and eradication of poverty) and that can be financed through the Union Budget. India can seek to take up larger goals such as the strengthening of democracies across the world by promoting human rights and good governance in other countries under the umbrella of development cooperation. A vision such as this may be a slight departure from the current focus of providing only need-driven and demand-driven aid for friendly neighbouring countries, but it reflects the growing ambitions of the country to project itself on a global scale. This calls for a revision in India’s approach to be more in line with the changing world, while respecting the sovereignty of the recipient nation[17].

There are indications that the future of development cooperation will be heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and focused international cooperation is necessary to deal with the emerging global crisis[18]. This can be achieved through the exchange of material, services and knowledge. India’s upcoming Development Cooperation Act should reflect that a focused approach towards addressing global crisis is in its national interest.

India can seek to take up larger goals such as the strengthening of democracies across the world by promoting human rights and good governance in other countries under the umbrella of development cooperation.

Currently, India’s development cooperation objectives are broadly based on the South-South cooperation (SSC) framework — a technical cooperation tool among the developing countries in the Global South to collaborate on areas such as agricultural development, human rights, urbanisation, health and climate change. At the global stage, SSC is seen as an expression of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South, and as a complement to North-South Cooperation (NSC) not as a substitute to ODA[19]. While India views SSC as an alternative to the traditional NSC that can help a country become a major international player in the business of aid, many analysts suggest that SSC does not represent the country’s ambitions to the fullest. There is a need for India to make a strong independent commitment to global causes and initiate change through its development aid[20].

A criticism of India’s aid programme is the absence of detailed information in the public domain and confusion on available details[21]. This lack of clarity is hindering India from becoming a major player in the international aid dynamics and from influencing the global aid architecture in a significant way. India’s Development Cooperation Act must address these issues and articulate a clear vision that guides the development partnerships and diplomacy.

A criticism of India’s aid programme is the absence of detailed information in the public domain and confusion on available details.

Furthermore, India must prepare these policies keeping in mind accountability to the public, as growing foreign aid contributions will increasingly come under scrutiny. For example, the enormous goodwill that India had generated by providing aid to other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic was challenged by domestic situations such as the plight of migrant workers. It will be increasingly difficult to justify overseas aid when there are domestic lapses in public health, minority protection and social development[22].

India could draw lessons from the UK’s International Development Act of 2002 which detailed the country’s objective to contribute towards global poverty reduction[23]. The UK was one of the first countries to provide aid without being tied to any domestic policy considerations, making the 2002 Act an effective and successful framework[24]. The UK had also established the Department for International Development (DfID), to administer its development assistance budget. DfID is mandated to have close interdepartmental relations with key stakeholders and sharing of resources to achieve best results. Unfortunately, a June 2020 decision to merge the DfID with the Foreign Office has attracted wide criticism, but is seen as an inevitable consequence due to the slowdown of the UK’s economy[25]. For India, it is an opportunity and a clear indication that emerging powers with fast growing economies can provide an alternative structure to global development objectives. A vision that is independent of short-term geopolitical gains can ensure continuity in development aid regardless of policy fluctuations of different administrations, thereby building greater trust and credibility for the programme.

For India, it is an opportunity and a clear indication that emerging powers with fast growing economies can provide an alternative structure to global development objectives.

The mandate for cooperation must also incorporate changing requirements at the domestic and international levels, which can help in uncertain crisis situations. For instance, the German development agency GIZ, under the federal development ministry, was able to expand current projects to include measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic without any additional financial resources[26].

Development partnership agency

To realise an institutional architecture for development cooperation, India needs an independent development partnership agency that develops long-term and short-term strategies, identifies priorities, builds knowledge and facilitates learning.

Autonomous body

In its current form, the DPA is unlikely to be an authoritative agency that can realise the wider mandate of India’s development partnership. As a department under the MEA, there are several limitations to its functioning, including the lack of authority to undertake inter-ministerial coordination when required. To address this issue, changes must be made to transform the DPA into a more autonomous entity within the MEA, led by a Secretary-rank officer and empowered to address long-term and short-term strategies, including concerns around accountability. The need for an independent agency is recognised by several countries in the Global South. For instance, the Brazilian Cooperation Agency, affiliated to the country’s foreign ministry, has a mandate to negotiate, coordinate, implement and monitor technical cooperation projects and programmes between Brazil and other countries[27]. Similarly, the Thailand International Cooperation Agency and Egyptian Agency of Partnership for Development are independent entities empowered to implement development cooperation objectives of their countries[28].

If empowered as an autonomous agency, the DPA can facilitate information sharing and create platforms for policy coordination across government departments, ensure coordinated efforts needed for development gains and mobilise resources quickly. The agency must have the mandate to articulate roles and responsibilities from various government ministries. The agency can also ensure continuity in India’s overseas development cooperation during changes in administration after elections.

The proposed independent agency must provide transparent access to information on budgets and programmes, and clearly articulate policy outcomes so it is not subject to the changing ideologies and priorities of different governments.

As India’s development cooperation grows, the spending will come under public scrutiny; this requires an effective accountability and evaluation framework[29]. The lack of information disseminated in the public domain about India’s current development cooperation framework has been widely criticised by policy experts. The few strands of information that is available is widely dispersed and highly disaggregated, and has been further criticised in global platforms[30]. This opacity makes monitoring and evaluation difficult and creates a credibility crisis. The proposed independent agency must provide transparent access to information on budgets and programmes, and clearly articulate policy outcomes so it is not subject to the changing ideologies and priorities of different governments. Commitments to ensure the periodic review and revision of India’s international development cooperation policy based on broader strategic goals are also needed.

Resource centre

The proposed agency could be a resource centre that can help other developing countries in developing their cooperation framework. The resource centre can maintain careful documentation of the projects that are implemented through development cooperation. Over time, it can become a repository of knowledge that can inform future interventions. Knowledge sharing can also become a tool to engage with other Global South countries that seek India’s expertise in development cooperation. For instance, during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, knowledge sharing among donor countries helped in strategising an effective response[31].

A successful knowledge hub will require proactive participation from civil society, national governments, private sector, academia and others. There will also need to be clear coordination with existing knowledge hubs, especially those by multilateral forums.

Progressive ethos

The development objectives of the proposed agency must reflect the progressive values of the emerging world with specific emphasis on diversity, gender empowerment and addressing social inequalities while preserving cultural identities. The agency must work towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) coordinating the government, private sector, academia and civil society.

Private sector and civil society engagement

The demand-driven approach of India’s development cooperation emphasises that the partner country does not have any obligations associated with the funding and is free to follow its laws and national interests while implementing cooperation projects[32]. With increasing geopolitical influence, India’s development cooperation is moving towards a need-driven approach where meeting the partner country’s development objectives goes hand-in-hand with India’s objective for strengthening the bilateral relationships through private sector investments.

The OECD plans to build on the capacity of civil society members to bring forth the voices of those who are engaged in programmes related to poverty alleviation and other development objectives.

The DPA is exploring innovative public–private partnership (PPP) models with Indian businesses to leverage their expertise in helping realise India’s development cooperation goals. In a recent review, the MEA has included about 27 new partner institutions of technical excellence, with seven new private sector institutes/universities selected to provide training[33]. The ITEC constitutes capacity-building partnerships with a footprint in 160 partner countries in Asia, Africa, East Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands, as well as small island countries.

Development cooperation projects across the world are adapting a PPP model in their implementation. In its 2030 Agenda, the OECD is prioritising engagement with civil society organisations to implement and monitor the SDGs. The OECD plans to build on the capacity of civil society members to bring forth the voices of those who are engaged in programmes related to poverty alleviation and other development objectives[34].

India’s efforts towards collaborations with the private sector and civil society can be achieved by engaging with existing platforms such as the Forum for Indian Development Cooperation (FIDC) — an initiative by the DPA, academia and civil society organisations, and launched in 2013 — that has been working to raise awareness on various dimensions of development cooperation policies through public engagement at the domestic level[35].

Multilateralism

Cooperation among countries can accelerate the response within individual nations and across regions during a global health crisis. It involves creating, adapting, transferring, and sharing knowledge and experiences to improve health, while making the most of existing resources and capacities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) made important strides in addressing shared health goals through cooperation. Within this landscape of cooperation, there has been a shift away from ODA towards effective development cooperation. The benefits include cooperation among countries to support and reinforce national efforts for health development and knowledge sharing. These exchanges have the potential to impact sub-regional and regional integration processes as well as global health debates. India must support these global health initiatives by the WHO and encourage knowledge sharing through SSC and triangular cooperation, BRICS and health cooperation in Small Island Development States[36].

Efforts are also underway to include a pro-climate sustainable development cooperation in the OECD’s 2030 agenda that aligns with the Paris Agreement.

Traditional development cooperation providers are moving to align their efforts with ambitious climate action. OECD member states are building strategies to reorient aid to address the climate emergency in a way that can further help in their national and regional efforts. Efforts are also underway to include a pro-climate sustainable development cooperation in the OECD’s 2030 agenda that aligns with the Paris Agreement. The OECD has called for efforts to integrate the climate imperative into providers’ mandates and performance systems while establishing the right capacities and tools to deliver[37].

The LDCs are among the most vulnerable to climate change. It might become extremely challenging for some of these countries to recover from climate stress as their economic growth is highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors. For India, aligning with the Paris Agreement brings opportunities for development in the region. Fundamentally, alignment means ensuring that development pathways are low emissions, climate resilient and sustainable in the face of the multi-layered challenges that developing countries now face. India must recognise and take up the vast evidence that sound climate change policy is also sound development policy. India is currently in a unique position to mediate some of these crucial dialogues related to climate change at the various multilateral forums[38].

India could utilise this opportunity and further assert itself by providing sustained long-term cooperation as a response to the crisis and reiterating its commitment to development cooperation. While India strives to assert itself globally using every opportunity for development cooperation, it could further its agenda by articulating its contributions towards the SDGs and efforts to mitigate climate change. By doing so, India needs to reassert and reaffirm its commitment to bilateral and multilateral cooperation such as the SSC. The ODA response to the COVID-19 pandemic remains insufficient, given the additional financing needed, and risk-informed development cooperation at multilateral forums will be vital in building back better systems after the pandemic[39].

Plurilateralism

The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the serious drawbacks of multilateralism as well as the need for plurilateralism. The paralysis of the World Trade Organisation and the WHO’s credibility crisis amid the pandemic have exposed the deep-rooted issues plaguing multilateralism, and severely impacting the response to the pandemic. It was evident that multilateralism, in its current form, is incapable of dealing with its misuse by strategic rivals. To counter this, countries have always come together in smaller groups to formulate, influence or negotiate in or outside multilateral frameworks. India needs to realise its development cooperation objectives through engagements at plurilateral forums like the G20, BRICS and South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

India should promote healthy development cooperation among G20 member countries and complement global development finance in meeting the disastrous consequences of COVID-19.

India should actively participate in the G20’s efforts in mobilising development finance and cooperation amid the COVID-19 crisis. G20 leaders have expressed a need to consider aid for displaced people, vulnerable groups and LDCs that are seriously affected by the pandemic[40]. Some African countries and small island nations will need greater support from ODA along with other emergency finance support systems. India should promote healthy development cooperation among G20 member countries and complement global development finance in meeting the disastrous consequences of COVID-19.

At the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit in November 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the importance of building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future, and called for effective global governance in the post-pandemic world and reformed multilateralism[41].

Engagement with regional bodies need to be more strategic through the clear articulation of India’s policies on development issues. India can utilise the NDB established by BRICS to raise direct new resources for development partnerships. As of November 2020, the NDB has approved 65 sustainable development and infrastructure projects worth US$ 21 billion across all BRICS economies[42]. These projects touch key development areas for the partnering countries, spanning clean energy, transport infrastructure, water resource management, urban development, environmental efficiency and social infrastructure.

India can utilise the NDB established by BRICS to raise direct new resources for development partnerships.

Through the SAARC, India engages with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka as an active development partner, with several ongoing projects in these countries. The engagement is based on a consultative, non-reciprocal and outcome-oriented approach, while focusing on delivering benefits such as greater connectivity, improved infrastructure and strong development cooperation in various sectors.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that India needs a new institutional architecture for development cooperation that is more aligned with its global ambitions. It must take into account emerging global development challenges in the post-COVID-19 world, such as public health and climate change. To assert itself at a global scale, India must employ development cooperation objectives and utilise multilateral and plurilateral forums through a strategic plan.

In its current form, the DPA does not reflect the growing mandate of India’s development partnership. The DPA must be strengthened into a standalone body that can have long-term and short-term strategies, including addressing concerns around accountability, autonomy and responsiveness. A comprehensive policy on India’s development cooperation can be addressed only by a strong and autonomous agency that can coordinate with various departments of the government.

India needs to move from providing need-driven and demand-driven aid to friendly neighbouring countries to a much more focused approach with clearly defined objectives, such as environmental protection, strengthening of public health systems and eradicating poverty. India’s Development Cooperation Act must articulate a policy roadmap for this vision that reflects the aspirations of the country in the post-COVID-19 world. Furthermore, there is a need to create strategic clarity and public accountability as the contributions to development cooperation overseas grow and projects come under increased scrutiny.

84,84,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Ethiopia Preparing for Third Round Massive Afforestation Campaign - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104210513.html,"Two years ago Ethiopia has announced a vision of planting some 10 million indigenous trees in three years. This year the country has been preparing to hit the target set of planting some six billion trees.

The objective of this campaign is to contribute to the worldwide effort to reduce pollution, address climate change and restore the natural habitats that contribute positively to the climate crisis. The reforestation programme of planting 40 tree seedlings per head has been an inspiration for the people of Ethiopia, to come together for a noble goal.

Ethiopia has been preparing 7 billion tree seedlings for its third-year tree planting campaign, out of which one billion will be allocated to the neighbouring countries to expand Ethiopia's Green Legacy Initiative.

Agriculture State Minister, Sani Redi said that neighbouring countries have been showing interest to join the initiative.

""So far, Djibouti and South Sudan have shown interest to take their shares as they have been preparing to receive the seedlings,"" he said.

As climate change is a regional and global threat, Sani hopes that other invited East African countries will follow suit to fight the challenge together.

The state minister stressed that Ethiopia shares 1 billion tree seedlings not because it is in a better position, but because of concern about the challenges the region is facing in terms of climate change and to encourage collaboration with other nations to mitigate the problem.

""We have invited all East African countries to be part of the initiative to develop together for the challenges of climate change have been affecting the entire region without any barrier that requires strong collaboration at sub-regional, regional and global level,"" Sani noted.

Despite the upcoming general election and the challenges of COVID-19, among others, the nation is determined to continue with the Green Legacy Initiative by planting 6 billion seedlings this year. Over 110,000 sites are now growing saplings and over 3.24 billion tree seedlings have been readied, it was learned.

Regional states of Ethiopia bordering the neighbouring countries have also been informed to produce saplings so that they could share them with adjacent neighbouring countries or states.

Afar, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Gambella and Oromia regional states are the regions preparing the tree seedlings for the two countries. The Green Legacy Initiative launched in 2019 aspires to plant 20 billion trees in Ethiopia in four years.

The national initiative is led by steering and technical committees drawn from ministries of Agriculture, Water, Irrigation and Energy, Innovation and Science, Education, Urban Development and Construction, and Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission.

Biodiversity Institute Deputy Director-General, Feleke Woldeyes said on his part the focus on planting indigenous trees are highly ignored. Out of over four billion trees planted two years ago, only 1 million were indigenous trees, it was learned. There is now a plan to increase the number by tenfold in the coming three years.

Feleke, who pointed out the multiple benefits of indigenous plants for sustainable climate, productivity and preserving biodiversity, added that ""30 different kinds of indigenous trees suitable for various agro-ecological zones have been identified.""

He stated that Ethiopia is among the 20 megadiverse countries in biodiversity resources in the world as it has got over 6,000 plant species.

The country's current forest coverage is 15.5 per cent after consecutive planting initiatives and campaigns as well as after the inclusion of dense lowland forests rather than plantings in high lands, it was learned.

Last Ethiopian year, the nation has already planted 5 billion seedlings by building on the success of the ""Green legacy"" project which planted 4 billion trees seedlings two years ago.

Over the last several years, Ethiopia has lost billions of trees and forest resources because of many reasons including a lack of awareness around afforestation and sustainable development. Today, most of the seedlings planted are from indigenous trees that are very well adapted to the local environment.

Ethiopia has set a high bar for itself, and the world: in its development blueprint, the Climate Resilient Green Economy (CRGE) Strategy, it aims to achieve middle-income status by 2025 while transitioning to a climate-resilient green economy.

Protecting existing forest and promoting tree-based landscape restoration is central to these goals as trees contribute not only directly to economic development and higher living standards, but also climate change mitigation and adaptation. Increasing the number of trees will also contribute to Ethiopia's international commitments, including to the Sustainable Development Goals, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, and the African (AFR100) and global (Bonn Challenge and New York Declaration on Forests) restoration targets.

While trees have played a significant role in many of Ethiopia's successful restoration initiatives, tree-based landscape restoration needs to be scaled up in Ethiopia is going to meet its ambitious goals.

No single governmental or nongovernmental institution can singlehandedly scale-up tree-based landscape restoration in agricultural, pastoral and forest landscapes to regain needed ecological functionality and achieve targeted standards of living across Ethiopia. Scaling up the restoration of degraded landscapes will require many state and non-state actors to act in concert.

Version 0.0 of the National Tree-Based Landscape Restoration Potential and Priority Maps presented here constitutes a first step in coordinating Ethiopia's large-scale restoration efforts. The maps aim to guide decision-makers as to where additional trees could benefit Ethiopian landscapes; which tree-based landscape restoration options could be implemented in these landscapes; and where to prioritize cross-sectoral implementation. The maps are the product of a cross-sectoral effort of national and regional experts led by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MEFCC).

While conducting a study on the factors affecting the survival of tree seedlings in the drylands of Northern Ethiopia, Abraham Mahari said establishing forest plantation on degraded lands can play a key role in harmonizing long-term forest ecosystem rehabilitation or restoration goals. Forest plantations, using appropriate tree species can play an important role in the tropical ecosystem rehabilitation. In such cases, planting of nursery-raised seedlings may accelerate regeneration. Successful seedling establishment and growth depends on the soil condition and the stored soil moisture to ensure survival into the next growing season.

In the dry and more degraded lands of Northern Ethiopia particularly the Sekota District, farmers have been planting many seedlings of different tree species year after year but the survival of those seedlings are very poor as the area is mainly affected by moisture stress, termite and soil fertility problems.

Again, the area has not been given much research attention and are still lacking. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the major factors that affect seedling survival in this particular area as it is critical to understand forest establishment and development.

The study focused on assessing factors affecting the survival of tree seedlings in the degraded drylands of Northern Ethiopia. Most of the problems or factors that are highly affecting the survival of tree seedlings are compounded by environmental factors.

However, the contribution of livestock grazing and termite impacts were also pointed out by the farmers as the main barriers for forest development in the study area. Therefore, proper allocation of species into the site is needed to address the problem and improve forest development.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['climate', 'campaign', 'planting', 'afforestation', 'trees', 'development', 'restoration', 'billion', 'tree', 'preparing', 'round', 'massive', 'ethiopia', 'seedlings', 'forest']",

Mr. Duannah was speaking when he and his management team were invited by the House to give reasons why the LWSC has failed over the years to address the issues of leakages of sewage pipes at several points down waterside and Mechlin Street in Monrovia.

Addressing Plenary on Thursday, Duannah said the sewage problem was and aged-old situation inherited by his team, but they were doing all within their reach to tackle it. He said the sewage line was built in 1966 to serve about 200,000 people but now the number of people accessing the sewage system has quadrupled.

""Now, we have about one million people living in Monrovia. The pipes have overstayed and the sizes are small,"" he said.

""Every time we send our team in these drainages to remove the raw feces and clean the streets early in the morning hours, vendors return and just fill the streets again like nothing was done. This is the problem. The pipe size is too small and the population size has quadrupled.""

Speaking further, he disclosed that the more than 50-year old sewage line is only 70 kilometers and runs from Point Four Junction on the Bushrod Island to Nigeria House in Congo Town. Along the line, there are several pumping stations -at the Barclay Training Center (BTC), Capitol By-pass and Sinkor. But all these stations are blocked and not functioning well because residents have built structures along these lines.

To address the situation, he proffered a short and long term solutions. The short term, he said, is to purchase more running trucks to clean the drainages and the streets regularly, while the long term is to address the problem permanently by installing a new layout. And in the process, breakdown all of the structures built on the waterway. This, he said will cost the country close to US$100 million.

86,86,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,"Global Ramadan challenge encourages people to get active, fundraise for charity - Arab News",https://www.arabnews.com/node/1850771/world,"LONDON: A global Ramadan challenge is enabling people to get active while fundraising for humanitarian causes.

People from more than 20 countries — including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Pakistan, India, the US, Canada, Mexico, Kosovo and Austria — have signed up for the UK-based Ramadan Challenge 3.0.

It hopes to raise £100,000 ($139,419) for Penny Appeal’s Emergency Response Program, which helps deliver humanitarian aid to people suffering from natural disasters, conflict and extreme poverty.

“I’ve launched the Ramadan Challenge to encourage people to get active over the 30 days of Ramadan,” Haroon Mota, head of challenge events at Penny Appeal, told Arab News.

“They can do it in their own way with no rules — it’s your challenge, your way. It’s a great opportunity to get out of your comfort zone a little bit and try something new.”

Exercise during Ramadan is uncommon as people tend to think that it is a time to conserve energy, but the body is capable of doing a lot even if one is not eating or drinking.

The challenge encourages people to use the numbers three and zero to get creative with the activity they set themselves, such as exercising 30 minutes per day or walking 3 km daily.



Last year, Mota, a professional athlete from the English city of Coventry, had planned to run the Berlin, London, Chicago and New York marathons, but they were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

So instead, he decided to run 10 km every day during Ramadan to raise money for charity. He documented his journey and raised £55,000.

“That was something different, and I discovered that I inspired a lot of people,” Mota said. “It also opened my horizons, because it showed me that there’s an appetite from Muslim communities to remain active in the month of Ramadan.”

Mota, 35, encourages people to live a healthier lifestyle through several campaigns, mostly via social media.

However much money is raised via the Ramadan Challenge 3.0, “it’s the cause that counts, and it’s people’s intentions for doing good and uniting toward goodness, which is the most important thing,” he said.

Mota is also a Sports Direct ambassador for the retail company’s campaign “Fast and Slow,” where experts, Muslim athletes, and influencers help communicate guidance around safe exercise and exercising slowly while fasting.

Haroon Mota’s top tips for exercising during Ramadan:

1. Be sensible and listen to your body — take it easy and slow down by reducing the intensity, volume or frequency of exercise.

2. Pay attention to hydration and nutrition when not fasting — take regular sips of water and try to drink at least 2-3 liters daily. Eat in moderation, prioritize carbohydrate intake for energy, and try to avoid unhealthy fried food.

3. Choose when to exercise — try to avoid warm weather, particularly in hot countries, as you might sweat and dehydrate more. Do what works for you depending on your tolerance and routine.

4. Prioritize rest and sleep — set a minimum time for sleep, and try to have afternoon naps for strength and general wellbeing.

5. Use this downtime to focus on neglected areas of exercise or fitness — whether that is flexibility, core strength, yoga or pilates, some of these exercises might be less strenuous.

6. Focus on mindfulness — Ramadan is important for self-reflection and spirituality, and you can do that while exercising slowly.

Mota added Ramadan is still not over, and said we should not worry about what we may have missed, but to make the most of the opportunities that we do have.

“I advise people not to stress and worry too much about losing fitness during the month,” said Mota. “It’s only 30 days, and people can work out a lot more once Ramadan is over, so maybe use this time to prepare your mind for what your goals might be after Ramadan.”","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2021/04/29/2596166-21612919.jpg,"['active', 'try', 'mota', 'exercising', 'lot', 'worry', 'fundraise', 'challenge', 'charity', 'global', 'exercise', 'encourages', '30', 'ramadan']",

Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.; President Biden; Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images, Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images, Drew Angerer/Getty Images)

President Biden’s decision to keep a strict Trump-era cap on refugees was met with harsh condemnation from progressives in the House and two powerful committee chairmen in the Senate.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called the decision “simply unacceptable and unconscionable” in a statement on Friday. She also mentioned Biden’s promise to lift the refugee cap, which is currently at its lowest-ever ceiling since the start of the refugee resettlement program 40 years ago.

“After four painful years of fighting Trump’s all-out draconian assault on immigrants, President Biden promised to restore America as a beacon of hope and committed to increasing our refugee resettlement numbers,” Japayal said.

“By failing to sign an Emergency Presidential Determination to lift Trump’s historically low refugee cap, President Biden has broken his promise to restore our humanity. We cannot turn our back on refugees around the world, including hundreds of refugees who have already been cleared for resettlement, have sold their belongings, and are ready to board flights.”

Biden committed in February to raising the cap of refugees allowed into the United States from the 15,000 set by Trump to up to 62,500. This was significantly lower than the 125,000 he had promised as a candidate last year. The decision has left thousands of refugees who have already been vetted stuck in limbo across the globe.

The administration had said the decision was due to stress on the system from the number of migrant children at the southern border. It also said it needed to evaluate “how ineffective or how trashed” the refugee processing system was under Trump. On Thursday, CNN reported that Biden’s decision not to immediately lift the refugee cap was political in nature.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a Somali refugee who immigrated to America after four years in a camp in Kenya, said, “There are simply no excuses for today’s disgraceful decision. It goes directly against our values and risks the lives of little boys and girls huddled in refugee camps around the world. I know, because I was one.”

Story continues

Omar also tweeted a video of Biden from the campaign in which the then candidate signaled that he wanted the U.S. to do more to help refugees. “We, the United States, used to do our part,” Biden says in the clip.

“Completely and utterly unacceptable,” tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. “Biden promised to welcome immigrants, and people voted for him based on that promise. Upholding the xenophobic and racist policies of the Trump admin, [including] the historically low + plummeted refugee cap, is flat out wrong. Keep your promise.”

Jayapal, Omar and Ocasio-Cortez were among approximately three dozen legislators to send a letter to the Biden administration calling for the cap to be raised.

After the initial round of criticism, White House press secretary Jen Psaki issued a statement late Friday afternoon saying Biden's directive had ""been the subject of some confusion,"" suggesting that he had never intended to keep the record low refugee cap in place for the remainder of the fiscal year. Psaki said the White House expected to set a ""final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15.""

However, the directive Biden signed Friday makes no mention of a plan to raise the ceiling by a May 15 deadline, stating instead that ""the admission of up to 15,000 refugees remains justified by humanitarian concerns and is otherwise in the national interest"" and that ""should 15,000 admissions under the revised allocations for FY 2021 be reached prior to the end of the fiscal year and the emergency refugee situation persists, a subsequent Presidential Determination may be issued to increase admissions, as appropriate.""

It was not only progressives in Congress who criticized the decision. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., a centrist, also called for the administration to bring in more refugees.

“The United States has a proud, bipartisan tradition of providing refugees protection through resettlement,” Menendez, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, said in a statement. “In this time of great global need, the United States must demonstrate its robust commitment as a nation by resettling the world’s most vulnerable refugees.”

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., issued a statement calling the decision “unacceptable.”

“These refugees can wait years for their chance and go through extensive vetting,” said Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. “Thirty-five thousand are ready. Facing the greatest refugee crisis in our time, there is no reason to limit the number to 15,000. Say it ain’t so, President Joe.”

Human rights organizations and refugee advocacy groups also condemned the decision.

“Today, President Biden is turning his back on tens of thousands of refugees around the world who have been approved to come to the United States,” Amnesty International said in a statement, adding, “Communities across the United States, from local groups to faith-based institutions, are ready to welcome these refugees.”

The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank funded by the Koch family, likewise issued a statement condemning Biden’s refusal to lift the refugee cap.

“From keeping ports of entry closed to legal asylum seekers at the border to keeping most consulates around the world closed to visa applicants, the Biden administration is keeping America’s gates almost as shut as they have ever been,” the group said.

New businesses sought to entertain visitors to Rottnest Island

‘Pop-up’ businesses to operate during peak holiday period

Innovative and exciting businesses are being asked to take part in an expression of interest process to operate on Rottnest Island during the summer of 2021-22.

The expression of interest includes specific calls for Aboriginal cultural tourism, recreational leisure activities, an inflatable water park for North Thomson Bay, and for ‘pop-up’ businesses to service increased demand during December and January and to diversify island offerings.

The new businesses would complement the existing businesses on Rottnest Island and further contribute to the visitor experience.

The island benefited from a number of major improvements in 2020 including the upgrade of 10 kilometres of roads in the Settlement, construction of a new $3 million Fuel Jetty and a $1 million revamp of the Island museum, which is now known as Wadjemup Museum. The main retail mall in the Settlement will undergo a major upgrade this winter.

Previous expressions of interest for new businesses resulted in seven new leisure activities in the summer of 2018-19. In 2019, a targeted EOI saw the establishment of Aboriginal cultural walking tours on the Island.

Further information on the process is available at https://www.ria.wa.gov.au. The expression of interest closes at 4pm AWST on June 3, 2021.

As stated by Tourism Minister David Templeman:

“This expression of interest is a great opportunity to expand the range of businesses on Rottnest Island and grow awareness of the island’s Aboriginal heritage through new cultural tourism ventures.

“Establishing new tourism ventures that raise awareness of Aboriginal culture and history on Wadjemup is important for all visitors.

“Creating new, vibrant and sustainable businesses on the Island helps Rottnest to remain one of Western Australia’s most appealing destinations for local and interstate visitors – and for overseas visitors when international travel resumes.”","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/webcms/webcms.nsf/resources/file-parliament-house-front-day/$file/parl-house-front-day.jpg,"['island', 'cultural', 'aboriginal', 'leisure', 'tourism', 'rottnest', 'businesses', 'recreational', 'interest', 'expression', 'visitors', 'awareness']",

Treasury yields, which had sparked overvaluation concerns, have been falling lately, providing a big boost to the mega-cap tech names. Notably, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped below 1.6% for the first time since Mar 25.



Additionally, the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy as well as the new stimulus has been rekindling hopes in investors for the technology sector. Further, a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson's JNJ COVID-19 vaccine sparked doubts over a global economic rebound, which is expected on a wider and rapid vaccine distribution. This in turn prompted investors to rotate out of stocks poised to profit from a post-pandemic economic recovery and into the companies that could benefit from a slower vaccine rollout (read: JNJ Vaccine Pause Gives Stay-at-Home ETFs a Shot in the Arm).



Added to the strength is the optimism over stronger Q1 earnings growth. The technology sector earnings are expected to be up 22.3% from the figure reported for the same period last year while revenues are projected to grow 17.2%. This will follow earnings and revenue growth of 21.5% and 14.7%, respectively, seen in fourth-quarter 2020.



Moreover, the sector outlook remains solid given the global digital shift even in the post-COVID world with the acceleration in e-commerce for everything, ranging from remote working to entertainment and shopping. The rapid adoption of cloud computing, big data, IoT, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, AI, machine learning, digital communication and 5G technology will continue to drive the sector higher (see: all the Technology ETFs here).



Against this backdrop, we highlighted a number of tech ETFs that hit all-time highs in the last trading session and are the popular choices in the space. Any of these could be excellent plays for investors looking to ride out the bullish trend in the coming months given their high momentum and a broad exposure across industries in the sector.

92,92,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Africa: Commander Says Africa Is Too Important for Americans to Ignore - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/202104220368.html,"Stuttgart — Africa has 13 of the 25 fastest growing economies in the world, holds resources critical to 21st century progress, and is at the crossroads of the world.

Africa is a fascinating continent of tremendous possibilities but also tremendous dangers, and the U.S. ignores the nations of Africa at its own peril, the commander of U.S. Africa Command said during an interview.

""China and Russia don't ignore Africa, and that alone should say something,"" U.S. Army Gen. Stephen Townsend said.

Africa has 13 of the 25 fastest growing economies in the world, Townsend said. In a time of climate change, Africa has 60% of the arable land on the globe. ""This fact alone should show how important Africa is for the world,"" he added.

The continent also has a plethora of strategic materials, such as cobalt, chromium, tantalum and more. African resources are critical to 21st century progress.

Africa has a growing population, and demographers estimate that by 2050 one in four people on Earth will be African.

The country is also a crossroads of the world. The Bab el-Mandeb Strait between Djibouti and Yemen is a choke point at the southern end of the Red Sea. There is another choke point between Sicily and Libya. The Strait of Gibraltar is between Europe and Africa. The recent blockage of the Suez Canal threw light onto two more choke points: the Mozambique Channel and the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, Townsend said. These sea lines of communication are vital around the globe and are ever in Townsend's mind as he engages the nations of the continent.

A number of Africa countries are among the ""most fragile"" in the world, Townsend said. These countries have ungoverned or little governed areas that attract violent extremist organizations, which capitalize on economic and political dysfunction to extend their reach.

He said governments in these areas need help. ""An African leader once said to me 'A drowning man will reach for any hand,'"" Townsend said. ""They are drowning in poverty and will take help from whomever it comes from.""

This offers a perfect opening for Russia and particularly China, Townsend said. ""The Chinese sometimes refer to Africa as their 'second continent,' and some Chinese military leaders refer to the east coast of Africa as China's 'fifth island chain,'"" the general said.

China has its first overseas military base in Djibouti and has invested heavily in ports around the continent, he said. The Chinese are playing a long game on the continent. The Chinese Communist Party wants to change the international rules-based architecture to favor China.

Economic pressure on African nations could gather votes in the United Nations and in other world bodies to do just that.

The U.S., actually, is the preferred partner on the continent, Townsend said. ""We were never a colonizing power in Africa, and we are regarded as an honest broker by many nations,"" he said. ""In addition, our values are their values.""

Townsend said the U.S. could use this to gain access and influence with the nations of Africa without ""debt-trap diplomacy"" - a term that refers to China's lending practices.

A number of violent extremist organizations operate in Africa, including al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab in Somalia and ISIS allies. Al-Shabab has stated it wants to attack the U.S. homeland, and it is a major contributor to global Al-Qaeda.

Townsend said the U.S. can help Africans confront these groups. ""We say we work 'by, with, and through' our African partners, so much it is almost a cliche, but it is true,"" he said. ""It's the only way to get a handle on this problem: African solutions for African problems is the way we work at AFRICOM.""

More engagement is needed, the general said. Exercise African Lion and the Express series of naval exercises are important to develop the personal contacts needed to operate on the continent. In addition, having more African military officers and noncommissioned officers going to American professional military education would also benefit U.S. relations with the nations of the continent.

The Ebola outbreak of 2014 is an example of what U.S. aid can achieve in Africa. When the disease first appeared, U.S. military epidemiologists worked closely with African medical professionals to contain the disease. They worked to educate populations on ways to stop transmission and developed procedures to care for those infected. U.S. Army units deployed to the region to build care facilities, laboratories and more.

The epidemic ended without becoming a global pandemic. ""Ebola is still present in some countries in Africa, but they learned how to contain it,"" Townsend said.

The Syracuse men's head basketball coach is part-owner of a horse named 'Hidden Stash' that has been selected to compete in the first leg of the Triple Crown, set for Saturday, May 1, in Louisville.

Adam Weitsman, owner of Upstate Shredding- Weitsman Recycling first purchased the horse, then gifted part-ownership to Coach Boeheim as a birthday gift, according to The Post Standard:

Weitsman is the majority stakeholder of Hidden Stash. He bought the horse for $50,000 along with BBN Racing, whose co-founders include Troy native Brendan O’Brien and Skidmore College alumnus Brian Klatsky. Braxton Lynch, a thoroughbred breeder in Kentucky, is also among the owners.

Weitsman told the Post Standard of his seemingly odd gift to Boeheim, 'He's a tough guy to buy gifts for.'

The Kentucky Derby is the first of the horse racing industries three premiere races, drawing widespread attention from those who don't fancy themselves as fans of the sport. The other Triple Crown events are The Preakness - set for May 15 at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore - and the Belmont Stakes - scheduled to first weekend in June, and held at Belmont Park in Elmont, NY.

The Post Standard also reported:

Hidden Stash last week was ranked 22nd on the Kentucky Derby’s leaderboard, but has enough points to move up to the top 20 horses for the derby after other horse owners pulled out.

Weitsman told the outlet that Hidden Stash's odds in the 20-horse field are about 20-1. However, as of this posting on Thursday afternoon at 3:00PM, WIBX was unable to find odds for Hidden Stash on a few major betting/odds-making websites.

Television coverage of the race on May 1 race can be found on NBC. The broadcast runs several hours and includes some other races from the track. The Kentucky Derby itself is set to step-off at 6:57PM.

Meanwhile, local harness horse racing track Vernon Down is set open for the season this weekend.

After an odd COVID-laden 2020-21 season, Boeheim's Syracuse Orange made a splash at the Big Dance last month, picking up two wins and earning a Sweet 16 appearance.

94,94,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,June 4th Options Now Available For Sirius XM Holdings - Nasdaq,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/june-4th-options-now-available-for-sirius-xm-holdings-2021-04-22,"Investors in Sirius XM Holdings Inc (Symbol: SIRI) saw new options begin trading today, for the June 4th expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the SIRI options chain for the new June 4th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $6.00 strike price has a current bid of 5 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $6.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $5.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of SIRI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $6.36/share today.

Because the $6.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.83% return on the cash commitment, or 7.07% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Sirius XM Holdings Inc, and highlighting in green where the $6.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $6.50 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents. If an investor was to purchase shares of SIRI stock at the current price level of $6.36/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $6.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.77% if the stock gets called away at the June 4th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if SIRI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Sirius XM Holdings Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing SIRI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $6.50 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $6.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 99%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 1.57% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.35% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $6.36) to be 32%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Leading watch brand Skagen has launched a range of vegan leather watches made from apple, bark and cork.

The Denmark-based company launched the Aaren Naturals collection in celebration of Earth Day.

Environmentally-friendly materials

It’s the brand’s latest collection, and each features a case and strap made from ‘pro-planet’ materials, including the vegan apple leather.

It comes as part of Skagen’s practices to reduce water consumption as part of the leather tanning process.

Additionally, at least half of the stainless steel featured in the design is also recycled.

Each watch is available for £119 in eight colors and two different sized cases.

Skagen Chief Brand Officer, Steve Evans says the collection is just one of more ‘exciting’ sustainability efforts to come.

He added: “As a brand influenced by Danish design, we look to Denmark for constant inspiration with the progressive steps they’ve made.

“We’re dedicated to being an environmental partner and consistently evolving our position by finding great collaborators, such as Copenhagen Fashion Week, aligned on a similar path.

“By championing our passions for sourcing, design, innovation and creativity, our teams are working diligently to transform our processes for a greater, more sustainable future.”

Vegan apple leather

Skagen isn’t the first brand to use vegan leather made from apples. The cruelty-free fashion house, Samara, released a collection of purses made from the fruit’s skins last year.

Moreover, Volkswagen is set to launch an electric SUV this year with an interior made with apple-based vegan leather. The company said the material is both raw and renewable.

96,96,DR-2021-000054-SOM_waterstress,Evonik Enters Photopolymers Segment with New 3D Printing Materials - 3DPrint.com,https://3dprint.com/281038/evonik-announces-high-performance-additions-to-infinam-3d-printing-material-range/,"Within the last couple of years, specialty chemicals company Evonik revealed that it was organizing a range of ready-to-use AM materials, from its Additive Manufacturing Innovation Growth Field, under the relatively new INFINAM brand, which includes the recently launched INFINAM® PEEK 9359 F. Now, the company is entering the photopolymer space with INFINAM TI 3100 L and INFINAM ST 6100 L for industrial 3D printing applications.

“With the new product line, we are entering the market-relevant photopolymer technology stream, strengthening our long-term market position as materials experts for all major polymer-based 3D printing technologies. With the new ready-to-use formulations, we are also continuing our materials campaign and driving industrial-scale 3D printing as manufacturing technology along the entire value chain,” Dr. Dominic Sttörkle, head of the Additive Manufacturing Innovation Growth Field at Evonik, stated in a press release.

These two new materials are the beginning of Evonik’s new polymer resin product line, which can be used in common vat polymerization technologies, like digital light processing (DLP) and stereolithography (SLA or SL). By making a move into photopolymers, the company is definitely gaining a stronger long-term position in the AM market.

INFINAM TI 3100 L is a high-performance photopolymer, and Evonik says the properties this material possesses can ensure impact-resistant DLP and SLA 3D printed industrial components with high toughness. Featuring good processability and high mechanical resistance, parts 3D printed with this material measured 30 J/m3 impact resistance and high elongation—120%—at the break. This means that INFINAM TI 3100 L is able to hold up well under permanent mechanical effects or strong impacts, like impact or pressing, and can be used to make parts in the automotive, consumer goods, and industrial sectors.

Evonik’s second new photopolymer resin formulation is INFINAM ST 6100 L, which the company says has high green body strength and great “weatherability.” With flexural stress of 145 MPa, HDT of 120 °C, and tensile strength of 89 MPa, this material could definitely be called high-strength. INFINAM ST 6100 L is durable and tough, and all of these properties combined make it an excellent choice for applications that require high mechanical strength and high temperature resistance.

According to the SmarTech Analysis report “Polymer Additive Manufacturing Markets and Applications: 2020-2029,” some of the major accomplishments and progress reported in polymer AM markets have “been registered in material science and development/optimization of new materials for current technologies,” which definitely describes what Evonik’s been doing.

“With INFINAM® TI 3100 L and INFINAM® ST 6100 L we have brought the group’s first photopolymer materials for additive manufacturing to market maturity. In doing so, we draw on the enormous chemical expertise of our researchers in component development and formulation,” explained Dr. Rainer Hahn, Head of Evonik’s photopolymer market segment in the Additive Manufacturing Innovation Growth Field. “On this basis, we can offer the market a unique product with excellent properties and help our customers to conquer new application areas.”

Evonik’s new range of high-performance, ready-to-use photopolymers can be processed on a variety of common, commercially available SLA and DLP 3D printers. The company will present its newest materials to the industry for the first time at TCT Asia, which will take place live and in-person from May 26-28 at Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Convention Centre (NECC), hall 7.1.

Actor and model Ludi Lin has praised the benefits of a plant-based diet while declaring the world has a ‘meat addiction‘.

The Mortal Combat star made the comments in a recent interview about his diet with Mens’ Health.

Ludi Lin plant-based diet

“I eat a plant-based diet for many reasons,” Lin told the publication. “One of the reasons is because it’s healthy. The other reason is that I want to.

“I have everything I need in a plant-based diet. My proteins are usually hemp [and] peanut butter. They’re complete proteins, especially hemp, it’s one of the biggest and best plant-sourced proteins.”

The celeb says his diet consists of ‘a lot of vegetables’ – with a particular liking for the skin of pumpkins. He also eats sheets of nori seaweed when he wants a snack and stays hydrated with plenty of water.

Lin also receives help from vegan chef Daphne Cheng. She cooked the actor zucchini pasta with mushrooms, bell peppers, and a peanut sauce – as well as chocolate protein balls for dessert.

The star says eating plant-based is ‘inevitable’ because it’s good for him and the planet

‘The world has a meat addiction’

“I think the world has a meat addiction because we evolved to love meat,” Lin added.

“It gives us the flavor umami, which usually we associate with meat.

“And basically, our brains are hacked to think that we need this meat -the more meat the better – but for me, it’s not the case because I re-hacked it and I get my umami from mushrooms…

“Eating plant-based and staying away from animal products is something I think is inevitable because it’s good for the Earth, it’s good for my body. I feel good about it because animals are cute and also it’s the only thing that’s sustainable.”

Introduction

The new decade is witnessing rising volatility across global systems. Pick any random “system” today and chart out its trajectory: Are our education systems becoming more robust and affordable? What about food security? Are our healthcare systems improving? Are our pension systems sound? Wherever one looks, there are dark clouds gathering on a global horizon marked by volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA).

But what exactly is a global system? Our planet itself is an autonomous and self- sustaining mega-system, marked by periodic cycles and elemental vagaries. Human activities within however are not system isolates as our banking, utility, farming, healthcare and retail sectors etc. are increasingly entwined. Risks accrued in one system may cascade into an unforeseen crisis within and/or without (Choo, Smith & McCusker, 2007). Scholars call this phenomenon “emergence”; one where the behaviour of intersecting systems is determined by complex and largely invisible interactions at the substratum (Goldstein, 1999; Holland, 1998).

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a case in point. While experts remain divided over the source and morphology of the virus, the contagion has ramified into a global health crisis and supply chain nightmare. It is also tilting the geopolitical balance. China is the largest exporter of intermediate products, and had generated nearly 20% of global imports in 2015 alone (Cousin, 2020). The pharmaceutical sector is particularly vulnerable. Nearly “85% of medicines in the U.S. strategic national stockpile” sources components from China (Owens, 2020).

An initial run on respiratory masks has now been eclipsed by rowdy queues at supermarkets and the bankruptcy of small businesses. The entire global population – save for major pockets such as Sweden, Belarus, Taiwan and Japan – have been subjected to cyclical lockdowns and quarantines. Never before in history have humans faced such a systemic, borderless calamity.

COVID-19 represents a classic emergent crisis that necessitates real-time response and adaptivity in a real-time world, particularly since the global Just-in-Time (JIT) production and delivery system serves as both an enabler and vector for transboundary risks. From a systems thinking perspective, emerging risk management should therefore address a whole spectrum of activity across the economic, environmental, geopolitical, societal and technological (EEGST) taxonomy. Every emerging threat can be slotted into this taxonomy – a reason why it is used by the World Economic Forum (WEF) for its annual global risk exercises (Maavak, 2019a).

As traditional forces of globalization unravel, security professionals should take cognizance of emerging threats through a systems thinking approach.

Methodology

An EEGST sectional breakdown was adopted to illustrate a sampling of extreme risks facing the world for the 2020-2030 decade. The transcendental quality of emerging risks, as outlined on Figure 1, below, was primarily informed by the following pillars of systems thinking (Rickards, 2020):

Diminishing diversity (or increasing homogeneity) of actors in the global system (Boli & Thomas, 1997; Meyer, 2000; Young et al, 2006);

Interconnections in the global system (Homer-Dixon et al, 2015; Lee & Preston, 2012);

Interactions of actors, events and components in the global system (Buldyrev et al, 2010; Bashan et al, 2013; Homer-Dixon et al, 2015); and

Adaptive qualities in particular systems (Bodin & Norberg, 2005; Scheffer et al, 2012) Since scholastic material on this topic remains somewhat inchoate, this paper buttresses many of its contentions through secondary (i.e. news/institutional) sources.

Economy

According to Professor Stanislaw Drozdz (2018) of the Polish Academy of Sciences, “a global financial crash of a previously unprecedented scale is highly probable” by the mid-2020s. This will lead to a trickle-down meltdown, impacting all areas of human activity.

The economist John Mauldin (2018) similarly warns that the “2020s might be the worst decade in US history” and may lead to a Second Great Depression. Other forecasts are equally alarming. According to the International Institute of Finance, global debt may have surpassed $255 trillion by 2020 (IIF, 2019). Yet another study revealed that global debts and liabilities amounted to a staggering $2.5 quadrillion (Ausman, 2018). The reader should note that these figures were tabulated before the COVID-19 outbreak.

The IMF singles out widening income inequality as the trigger for the next Great Depression (Georgieva, 2020). The wealthiest 1% now own more than twice as much wealth as 6.9 billion people (Coffey et al, 2020) and this chasm is widening with each passing month. COVID-19 had, in fact, boosted global billionaire wealth to an unprecedented $10.2 trillion by July 2020 (UBS-PWC, 2020). Global GDP, worth $88 trillion in 2019, may have contracted by 5.2% in 2020 (World Bank, 2020).

As the Greek historian Plutarch warned in the 1st century AD: “An imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics” (Mauldin, 2014). The stability of a society, as Aristotle argued even earlier, depends on a robust middle element or middle class. At the rate the global middle class is facing catastrophic debt and unemployment levels, widespread social disaffection may morph into outright anarchy (Maavak, 2012; DCDC, 2007).

Economic stressors, in transcendent VUCA fashion, may also induce radical geopolitical realignments. Bullions now carry more weight than NATO’s security guarantees in Eastern Europe. After Poland repatriated 100 tons of gold from the Bank of England in 2019, Slovakia, Serbia and Hungary quickly followed suit.

According to former Slovak Premier Robert Fico, this erosion in regional trust was based on historical precedents – in particular the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland to Nazi Germany. As Fico reiterated (Dudik & Tomek, 2019):

“You can hardly trust even the closest allies after the Munich Agreement… I guarantee that if something happens, we won’t see a single gram of this (offshore-held) gold. Let’s do it (repatriation) as quickly as possible.” (Parenthesis added by author).

President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia (a non-NATO nation) justified his central bank’s gold-repatriation program by hinting at economic headwinds ahead: “We see in which direction the crisis in the world is moving” (Dudik & Tomek, 2019). Indeed, with two global Titanics – the United States and China – set on a collision course with a quadrillions-denominated iceberg in the middle, and a viral outbreak on its tip, the seismic ripples will be felt far, wide and for a considerable period.

A reality check is nonetheless needed here: Can additional bullions realistically circumvallate the economies of 80 million plus peoples in these Eastern European nations, worth a collective $1.8 trillion by purchasing power parity? Gold however is a potent psychological symbol as it represents national sovereignty and economic reassurance in a potentially hyperinflationary world. The portents are clear: The current global economic system will be weakened by rising nationalism and autarkic demands. Much uncertainty remains ahead. Mauldin (2018) proposes the introduction of Old Testament-style debt jubilees to facilitate gradual national recoveries. The World Economic Forum, on the other hand, has long proposed a “Great Reset” by 2030; a socialist utopia where “you’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy” (WEF, 2016).

In the final analysis, COVID-19 is not the root cause of the current global economic turmoil; it is merely an accelerant to a burning house of cards that was left smouldering since the 2008 Great Recession (Maavak, 2020a). We also see how the four main pillars of systems thinking (diversity, interconnectivity, interactivity and “adaptivity”) form the mise en scene in a VUCA decade.

Environmental

What happens to the environment when our economies implode? Think of a debt-laden workforce at sensitive nuclear and chemical plants, along with a concomitant surge in industrial accidents? Economic stressors, workforce demoralization and rampant profiteering – rather than manmade climate change – arguably pose the biggest threats to the environment. In a WEF report, Buehler et al (2017) made the following pre-COVID-19 observation:

The ILO estimates that the annual cost to the global economy from accidents and work-related diseases alone is a staggering $3 trillion. Moreover, a recent report suggests the world’s 3.2 billion workers are increasingly unwell, with the vast majority facing significant economic insecurity: 77% work in part-time, temporary, “vulnerable” or unpaid jobs.

Shouldn’t this phenomenon be better categorized as a societal or economic risk rather than an environmental one? In line with the systems thinking approach, however, global risks can no longer be boxed into a taxonomical silo. Frazzled workforces may precipitate another Bhopal (1984), Chernobyl (1986), Deepwater Horizon (2010) or Flint water crisis (2014). These disasters were notably not the result of manmade climate change. Neither was the Fukushima nuclear disaster (2011) nor the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004). Indeed, the combustion of a long-overlooked cargo of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had nearly levelled the city of Beirut, Lebanon, on Aug 4 2020. The explosion left 204 dead; 7,500 injured; US$15 billion in property damages; and an estimated 300,000 people homeless (Urbina, 2020). The environmental costs have yet to be adequately tabulated.

Environmental disasters are more attributable to Black Swan events, systems breakdowns and corporate greed rather than to mundane human activity.

Our JIT world aggravates the cascading potential of risks (Korowicz, 2012). Production and delivery delays, caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, will eventually require industrial overcompensation. This will further stress senior executives, workers, machines and a variety of computerized systems. The trickle-down effects will likely include substandard products, contaminated food and a general lowering in health and safety standards (Maavak, 2019a). Unpaid or demoralized sanitation workers may also resort to indiscriminate waste dumping. Many cities across the United States (and elsewhere in the world) are no longer recycling wastes due to prohibitive costs in the global corona-economy (Liacko, 2021).

Even in good times, strict protocols on waste disposals were routinely ignored. While Sweden championed the global climate change narrative, its clothing flagship H&M was busy covering up toxic effluences disgorged by vendors along the Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. As a result, countless children among 14 million Indonesians straddling the “world’s most polluted river” began to suffer from dermatitis, intestinal problems, developmental disorders, renal failure, chronic bronchitis and cancer (DW, 2020). It is also in cauldrons like the Citarum River where pathogens may mutate with emergent ramifications.

On an equally alarming note, depressed economic conditions have traditionally provided a waste disposal boon for organized crime elements. Throughout 1980s, the Calabria-based ‘Ndrangheta mafia – in collusion with governments in Europe and North America – began to dump radioactive wastes along the coast of Somalia. Reeling from pollution and revenue loss, Somali fisherman eventually resorted to mass piracy (Knaup, 2008).

The coast of Somalia is now a maritime hotspot, and exemplifies an entwined form of economic-environmental-geopolitical-societal emergence. In a VUCA world, indiscriminate waste dumping can unexpectedly morph into a Black Hawk Down incident. The laws of unintended consequences are governed by actors, interconnections, interactions and adaptations in a system under study – as outlined in the methodology section.

Environmentally-devastating industrial sabotages – whether by disgruntled workers, industrial competitors, ideological maniacs or terrorist groups – cannot be discounted in a VUCA world. Immiserated societies, in stark defiance of climate change diktats, may resort to dirty coal plants and wood stoves for survival. Interlinked ecosystems, particularly water resources, may be hijacked by nationalist sentiments. The environmental fallouts of critical infrastructure (CI) breakdowns loom like a Sword of Damocles over this decade.

Geopolitical

The primary catalyst behind WWII was the Great Depression. Since history often repeats itself, expect familiar bogeymen to reappear in societies roiling with impoverishment and ideological clefts. Anti-Semitism – a societal risk on its own – may reach alarming proportions in the West (Reuters, 2019), possibly forcing Israel to undertake reprisal operations inside allied nations. If that happens, how will affected nations react? Will security resources be reallocated to protect certain minorities (or the Top 1%) while larger segments of society are exposed to restive forces? Balloon effects like these present a classic VUCA problematic.

Contemporary geopolitical risks include a possible Iran-Israel war; US-China military confrontation over Taiwan or the South China Sea; North Korean proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies; an India-Pakistan nuclear war; an Iranian closure of the Straits of Hormuz; fundamentalist-driven implosion in the Islamic world; or a nuclear confrontation between NATO and Russia. Fears that the Jan 3 2020 assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani might lead to WWIII were grossly overblown. From a systems perspective, the killing of Soleimani did not fundamentally change the actor-interconnection-interaction- adaptivity equation in the Middle East. Soleimani was simply a cog who got replaced.

Geopolitics will still be dictated by major powers. However, how will the vast majority of nations fare during this VUCA decade? Many “emerging nations” have produced neither the intelligentsia nor industries required to be future-resilient. Raw materials and cheap labour cannot sustain anaemic societies in a volatile world. Advances in material sciences and robotic automation as well as technological “ephemeralization” (Fuller, 1938; Heylighen, 2002) may shift manufacturing back to the Developed World.

In an attempt to mask the looming redundancy of these nations, untold billions have been wasted on vanity studies, conferences and technological initiatives drawn up by an army of neoliberal experts and native proxies. Risks were rarely part of the planning calculus. National and regional blueprints ranging from Malaysia’s Vision 2020, Saudi Vision 2030, ASEAN 2025 to Africa 2030, amongst others, will fail just as their innumerable precursors did.

The author defines a redundant nation as one which persistently lacks a comprehensive brain bank and an adaptive governance structure in order to be future-resilient. Redundant nations are preludes to failed states. They will lack native ideations and coherent policies that are critically needed in a VUCA decade. While policies intended to “promote growth in developing countries” had traditionally acted “as agents for conflict prevention” (Humphreys, 2003), the trade-off was often bureaucratic overgrowth, corruption, ethnoreligious discrimination and resource wastages.

Attempts to re-use these nations as geopolitical proxies a la the Cold War may prove too costly for potential sponsors. The Fat Leonard scandal (Whitlock, 2016) in Southeast Asia – which entrapped senior US naval officers in a web of sleaze – may be a harbinger of similar breaches on friendly territory, particularly as China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) challenges US geopolitical hegemony worldwide. The BRI however snakes through many potentially- redundant nations and may expose China to a “death by a thousand cuts” via geo-economic extortion. Beijing’s recent attempts to portray itself as a humanitarian superpower has somewhat backfired after numerous defects were discovered in its “medical aid” exports (Kern, 2020).

Ultimately, one should not underestimate the possibility, however remote, of national boundaries being redrawn before the Great Reset period is over. The global map was different only 100 years back. The once-mighty Soviet Union no longer exists while its former nemesis, the United States, faces social clefts of ominous proportions. Alarming parallels are now being drawn between the inauguration of President Abraham Lincoln on March 4, 1861 – which led to the US civil war – and the swearing in of Joe Biden as 46th President of United States on January 20, 2021 (Waxman, 2021). How will a weakened United States affect NATO and the larger Western-led global alliance?

Societal

The WEF (2017) had pencilled “global social instability” as the biggest threat facing our collective future. A similar outcome was gamed out in a 2007 study by the Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre at the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence (DCDC, 2007).

According to Peter Turchin (2016), a professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Connecticut, the United States may experience “a period of heightened social and political instability during the 2020s” – marked by governmental dysfunction, societal gridlock and rampant political polarization. To blame this phenomenon on the presidency of Donald J. Trump is to wilfully ignore the gradual build-up of various fissiparous forces over decades.

The social media plays a force multiplier role here. While risks metastasize at the bedrock levels of society, policymakers are constantly distracted from the task of governance by a daily barrage of recriminations, fake news and social media agitprops. As a result, long- term policy imperatives are routinely sacrificed for immediate political gains. The importunate presidential impeachment sagas and electoral fraud accusations in the United States are reflective of wider social fissures, state fragilities and policy paralyses worldwide.

There is nothing new in this panem et circenses (bread and circuses) phenomenon. Juvenal had noted a similar trend during Rome’s imperial decline circa 100 A.D. Recently, despite clear signals that the world was facing an economic catastrophe, the United Nations seemed more focused on the discovery of gender bias in virtual assistant software like Siri and Alexa (UNESCO, 2019). How will this revelation benefit the bottom 99% of humanity in dire economic conditions; one where the victims will be preponderantly women and children?

Just like in Imperial Rome, bread and circuses are symptomatic of an economic system that relentlessly benefits the elite. The mountain is ignored and the molehill is prioritized through controlled public narratives. The issue of “stolen childhoods”, for example, is now couched in terms of climate change rather than on sexual exploitation. Few take note that nearly “100,000 children – girls and boys – are bought and sold for sex in the U.S. every year, with as many as 300,000 children in danger of being trafficked each year.” Child rape, as John Whitehead (2020) further notes, has become “Big Business in America.” Not surprisingly, human trafficking has emerged as a $150 billion global industry (Niethammer, 2020).

Such shocking human rights failures do not figure prominently in the calculus of various “social justice” movements. The Top 1% needs their “useful idiots” – a phrase misattributed to Lenin – to generate a constant supply of distractions. Activist-billionaire George Soros, for example, is pumping $1 billion into a global university network to “fight climate change” and “dictators” which curiously include elected leaders such as former US President Donald J. Trump and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. These “academically excellent but politically endangered scholars” (Open Society, 2020), as Soros calls them, may turn out to be the very disruptors who will “undermine scientific progress” in the West – just as Turchin (2016) predicted in his seminal study. Soros’ pledge was coincidentally made when COVID- 19 began to decimate the global economy and healthcare systems.

Elite philanthropy is now an avenue for global subversion. An assortment of scholars, government officials and NGOs are already channelling the agendas of their well-pocketed patrons, backed by Big Tech’s control of the mainstream and social media (Maavak, 2020c). Their narratives are reminiscent of giddy sophistries which fuelled a variety of communist and anarchist movements during the build-up to WWII.

Under these circumstances, some nations may eventually seal their borders and initiate authoritarian measures in order to maintain internal stability. This is no longer an unthinkable proposition as dissatisfaction with democracy has peaked worldwide (Foa et al, 2020). Measures perfected by COVID-19 lockdowns may have inadvertently served as a test run in this regard.

Technological

Job displacements caused by automation, robotics and Artificial Intelligence will be a fait accompli. The foundations of our global Technopia are alarmingly propped by neo-slavery and coding worth $9 per hour, leading to disasters such as the recent Boeing 737 Max fiasco (Maavak, 2019b).

While technological ephemeralization exacerbates Black Swan-type risks (Maavak, 2019b); the Internet of Things (IoT) doubles up as a playground for cyber-savvy malcontents. Consider the following cyber-facilitated crime sequence: vehicles are sent on a collision course to freeze traffic while a truck rams into a sensitive entry point at a bank. A drone-borne electromagnetic pulse (EMP) device disables all nearby surveillance systems even as communications systems are compromised to send police in the wrong direction. That is just an illustration of the tech-enabled crime of the future. Malware can now be stored inside a strand of DNA. Biohackers can unleash a CRISPR-engineered COVID-XX from the comfort of their homes. Attempts at creating a gene-engineered super society, like the one China is attempting, may backfire horribly but not before other nations jump into the fray (Greenberg, 2017; Regalado, 2016; Maavak, 2020b).

In the pre-coronavirus era, the fortunes of Big Tech were significantly generated by “surveillance capitalism”; one where private data from billions of individuals were indiscriminately harvested, repackaged and sold off as invaluable “business insights” (Zuboff, 2019). This is the basis for what is now called Big Data Analytics (BDA). COVID-19 has legitimized this racket through a panoply of “contact tracing” tools that have shoddy levels of security. Recently, four-terabytes of sensitive data belonging to 1.2 billion people was discovered on an unsecured Google Cloud server (Newman, 2019). The identity of the owner remains a mystery.

When another Great Depression does occur, there will be fewer businesses, products and advertisements to sustain Big Tech’s free email and social media platforms. Will the provision of such services be left to governments or will Big Tech be bailed out in their trillions? COVID-19 has transposed this radical hypothesis into a rapidly emerging reality. How will society function without the basic means of communications that were largely gratis till now (Maavak, 2019b)? One could argue that the bailout is already occurring as governments increasingly cede control of the public narrative, means of communications and COVID-19 response measures to Big Tech.

Mass interconnectivity is also creating complex vulnerabilities in our infrastructure systems. As Choo, Smith & McCusker (2007, p.2) warned:

Tight couplings between different areas of critical infrastructure (CI) – information technology and communications, banking and finance, water, energy and utilities, transportation, mass gatherings, food, and emergency services – may result in rapid escalation of seemingly modest disruptions from within one sector to others. If insecure sectors are compromised, they can then be used as launching pads to attack other CI sectors.

Cyber-couplings are becoming tighter and more complex with each passing year. We may reach a point where cybersecurity is subsumed into a larger panoptic complex in a VUCA world. Access to a variety of services and products, including the Internet itself, may be contingent on real-time biometric validation (Maavak, 2019b). Such measures may be introduced as a desperate, real-time response to contain successive waves of COVID-19. It may thereafter acquire several levels of function creep until privacy is reduced to a bygone vestigial ideal.

Alternately, the Internet may undergo radical fragmentation in some parts of the world. As China perfects its Great Firewall and social credit systems, the Wuhan outbreak has demonstrated its ability to electronically lock down hundreds of millions of people. Russia, in the meantime, is creating an entirely new national Intranet system from scratch. The Runet, as it is called, has the potential to operate independently of the World Wide Web in order to buffer the state against a variety of Western sanctions and exogenous cyberattacks (Maavak, 2019b).

Conclusion

Complex risks require complex adaptive responses. Due to its transcendental qualities, global risks cannot be tackled through a Cartesian or siloed approach.

It is also a damning indictment of this era that hardly any faculty, graduate or post- doctoral program exist on the study of trans-sectoral global risks. The WEF, which specializes in this area, appears incapacitated by the portents ahead. The 2020 Davos session, themed an insipid “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World” (WEF, 2020), was ironically held against the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak.

COVID-19 has also exposed an institutional lack of “multiple motors of adaptation” (Eisenhardt & Piezunka, 2011) among governments – leading to the 21st century paradox where the greater the local volatility; the louder the call for global governance by elitist institutions that are perennially detached from native realities.

Table 1, below, exemplifies this detachment. The Global Health Security Index, published in October 2019 as “the first comprehensive assessment of global health security capabilities in 195 countries” (GHS Index, 2019, p.5) was grossly flawed in light of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak two months later.

The index was developed by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in collaboration with The Economist Intelligence Unit. Its major funders were the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Open Philanthropy Project and the Robertson Foundation. How could a welter of experts and prestigious institutions, who set detailed metrics and parameters in their study, get it so wrong? With the exception of Thailand and Sweden, the 15 “most prepared nations” are the ones now reeling from COVID-19. China, once the global epicentre for COVID-19, was the only nation to register an actual GDP growth for the year 2020 (Bloomberg, 2021). Singapore, another success story, was also notably missing from the list.

According to Philip Tetlock (2005), the forecasts of experts are often scarcely better than those of laymen. Part of the problem lies with elite philanthropies which deliberately groom “next-generation rubber-stampers for the privileged 0.1%” (Maavak, 2018). These experts “follow the money” and are incapable of providing ideas outside the commissioned elitist agenda.

As a result, the current global order will likely unravel before the decade is over. The primary drivers will be economic, acting primarily through technological agencies. Primary outcomes will be felt in the societal, environmental and geopolitical areas. Only cohesive societies, with extant crisis management ecosystems, will emerge stronger. These are societies that have been historically adept at social mobilization in the face of an existential threat e.g. WWII. Prime examples include Russia, Finland and Israel.

A surge in nationalism (societal) and militarization (geopolitical) should be anticipated during this decade. Trade pacts may eventually be forged outside the WTO framework (economic) and commerce may be contingent on geopolitical non-interference and civilizational affinity. National cyber-defences and electronic interactions (technological) may co-exist with Intranets and panoptic controls. Climate change programs (environmental) may take a backseat to the crises du jour during this decade.

Cautionary Notes for Security Professionals

With risks snowballing throughout the interstices of global systems, the intelligence community needs to take stock of multitudinous threats in real-time. Establishing a robust “whole systems” risk detection and mitigation mechanism – specific to national needs and organizational peculiarities – will however take time, as the author discovered during his doctoral research. The basic structure, functions and modus operandi of such a mechanism deserves a separate study altogether.

For the time being, security professionals should boost their situational awareness through Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) methods. This task is however getting more difficult as Big Tech censors information that is otherwise invaluable to security professionals. By censoring the digital commons, Big Tech is also effectively neutering the OSINT capabilities of the intelligence community. As the methodology section revealed, “diminishing diversity of actors” (or information) naturally leads to a build-up of risks in a system as traditional checks and balances are removed.

Wherever possible, it is vital to identify the generators of actionable data at the open source level. In Tetlock’s (2005) study, these individuals were described as nimble “foxes” as opposed to the scholastically-rigid hedgehogs – a juxtaposition inspired by the ancient Greek poet Archilocus (c. 680 – c. 645 BC). Despite the Big Data hype, the success or failure of Collective Intelligence (CI) in high-octane crisis situations is more dependent on the quality of analyses and analysts rather than on machine-generated insights (Maavak, 2019a). Identifying and co-opting risk-sentient individuals into institutional risk studies is a viable way forward but this may require political support.

It is also worth asking whether a Big Tech-led global oligarchy will even tolerate the existence of various “deep states” in the long run. “Initially, both groupings may cooperate to their mutual benefit but their respective raisons d’être are too contradictory to be reconciled. One thrives on an “open society” run by obedient hirelings who will administer a global Ministry of Truth while the other depends on secrecy and a degree of national sovereignty to justify its existence…Surveillance technologies ushered in by the ongoing ‘coronapsychosis’ may end up being the deciding factor” (Maavak, 2020c).

It is high time for security professionals and the intelligence community to wake up to the new reality. If Big Tech can systematically censor and impugn the President of the United States – routinely dubbed as the “most powerful man on earth” – think of the repercussions to both the common and covert domains?
