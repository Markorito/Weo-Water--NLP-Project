The drought has cut the hydro-power generation in half to 15 percent of the nation’s total electricity production as the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) seeks to save water for household and irrigation requirements, the firm said.

That has resulted in a four-hour rolling power cut on weekdays, between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. (0300-1630 GMT), that began without notice on Friday and was then announced on a scheduled basis for Monday. The four-hour daily cuts hit different places at different times.

If the power cuts are extended for any length of time they could hurt Sri Lanka’s already weak economy. Its GDP growth slowed to just 3.2 percent in 2018, the lowest in 17 years.

Sri Lanka’s peak demand is 2,400 MW and the country is generating 1,950 MW at the moment, CEB officials said.

“We have to impose power cuts to bridge the shortage,” Saumya Kumarawadu, head of the CEB Engineers Union, told Reuters. “The main reason for the power cut is the government’s failure in implementing the planned power plants,” he added.

Officials from the Power and Energy Ministry were not immediately available for comment on the power cuts.

Health Ministry officials said key hospitals in the country had emergency power backup.

In an indication of how severe the situation has become, a Power and Energy Ministry official said the government had on Friday started trying to produce artificial rain with the help of Thailand’s Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation - so far only a pilot project.

The power cuts come after delays in power plant projects.

In 2016, the government canceled a 500 MW coal power plant through a joint venture between CEB and India’s National Thermal Power Corporation in the eastern port district of Trincomalee, citing environmental pollution. That coal power plant was originally due to start producing later this year.

A 300 MW liquefied natural gas plant (LNG), which was to be started in January this year, has been held up for more than two years due to a court battle between local firm Lakdhanavi and a joint venture between China’s GCL and a Sri Lankan firm.

Lakdhanavi had filed a legal case against the Power and Energy Ministry in 2017 for awarding the LNG tender to the joint venture for $307 million against its bid of $175 million.

Sri Lanka has total electricity generating capacity of 40 GWH, as it mainly relies on thermal power, including a Chinese built coal power plant, which account for 45 percent of its supply.","Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190325&t=2&i=1369981389&r=LYNXNPEF2O1GS&w=800,"['venture', 'nationwide', 'cuts', 'ministry', 'raise', 'sri', 'plant', 'mw', 'lankas', 'drought', 'ceb', 'power', 'officials', 'force', 'failure', 'capacity']", 
1,1,Drought Sri Lanka,Cloud seeding bears no rain in Sri Lanka - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2019/04/when-cloud-seeding-bears-no-rain/,"An experimental attempt by Sri Lanka to induce artificial rain amid a prolonged drought fell short of expectations when the anticipated rain materialized a day late.

Despite the setback, the government appears committed to exploring the technology further as it seeks to address power cuts caused by low water levels in its hydropower reservoirs.

Scientists have called for comprehensive studies on cloud microphysics, meteorology and observational studies to ensure that such an expensive endeavor is backed by adequate scientific data.

With no cost-benefit analysis, climatologists fear that artificial rainmaking may cause adverse impacts over the long term.

A recent attempt to induce rain amid a prolonged drought in Sri Lanka has fallen short, but that hasn’t stopped the government from embracing the project, to the dismay of scientists who have urged greater studies into the technology and its long-term impacts.

The drought conditions have brought soaring temperatures and regular power cuts in a country where about 8 percent of electricity comes from hydropower. These conditions have frayed the public mood, and the power crisis is expected to continue as water levels in the hydropower reservoirs remain low.

To trigger rains in the catchment areas that feed the dams, the government recently carried out an rainmaking experiment. Though it recorded only marginal success, with the results now under review, the government is looking to adopt the technology as part of its long-term solutions, including creating a department for artificial rainmaking under the Ministry of Power and Energy.

“We require more rain to meet the country’s hydropower requirement,” Sulakshana Jayawardena, spokesman for the Ministry of Power and Energy and Business Development, told Mongabay.

He said Sri Lanka had experienced severe drought conditions in the past two years, with many catchment areas not receiving adequate rain to generate sufficient hydropower. Jayawardena said the reservoirs were only filled up to about 50 percent of their capacity.

“We had to explore artificial rainmaking. The annual average rainfall of 2,000 mm [79 inches] is completely insufficient to meet the demand for power,” he said.

And the electricity board is keen to avoid the costly exercise of thermal power generation, which accounts for 91 percent of the country’s electricity. Just under half of that comes from burning coal, with the rest from oil. “When there’s limited capacity to generate hydropower, we resort to expensive power purchasing from the private sector,” Jayawardena said. “Besides being expensive, it does not offer a long-term solution.”

Jayawardena said generating thermal power cost the state about 12 times as much as hydropower per unit of energy. As such, the government is likely to pursue more rainmaking exercises, he said.

But the failed attempt at rainmaking has drawn criticism, with experts calling for scientific assessments before long-term programs are envisaged.

Lareef Zubair, a climate scientist dubbed artificial rainmaking an “unproven technology,” and called for comprehensive research on cloud microphysics, meteorology and observational studies.

“Let’s first take a holistic look at things,” he said.

An expert committee that looked into the rainmaking initiative has called for a better monitoring system and catchment conservation, before making big decisions. Concerns have also been expressed abut poor management of rainfall, with experts saying that Sri Lanka has failed to make maximum use of rain received.

Ranjith Punyawardene, principal climatologist at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya has also called for a complete cost-benefit analysis coupled with an environmental impact assessment before undertaking any expensive rainmaking exercise.

Meanwhile, Kapila Jayasinghe, chief engineer of the state-owned utility, Ceylon Electricity Board, ruled out any long-term side effects from cloud triggering, citing a past attempt at artificial rainmaking in the 1980s.

“The initial feasibility has been concluded and now it is about making a national plan and implementing it,” he said.

Late rain

The rainmaking experiment took place March 22, with a Sri Lanka Air Force plane spraying chemicals onto clouds above the Maussakelle reservoir in Central province.

The previous month, a team had been sent to study artificial rainmaking at Thailand’s Department of Royal Rainmaking and Agricultural Aviation, comprising officials from the Air Force, the CEB, and the departments of meteorology and irrigation.

During the experiment, assisted by engineers from Thailand, the rainmakers expected an artificially created downpour over the catchment area later the same day. However, rainfall observed from satellites and in the nearby area of Norwood indicated that the rain occurred the following day, March 23.

The Thai experts determined it was still possible to generate artificial rain in Sri Lanka, provided certain environmental conditions were met, top sources from the energy ministry told Mongabay. The source said the team working on the technology had been sent back to the drawing board to gather more atmospheric data before more experiments can be carried out.

Meanwhile, Buddhi Marambe, professor of crop science at the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Peradeniya and chairperson, national experts committee on climate adaptation said there should be sufficient checks and balances if rainmaking is to become a long-term program to address the island’s energy crisis.

Marambe told Mongabay that it is important to further study rainmaking, if the country intends continuing with more experiments.

“If the experiments continue, then certain types of chemicals commonly used for rainmaking, are likely to impact soil and plants. The process also creates cumulonimbus, known as ‘rain clouds.’ Triggering such clouds is expected to trigger high intensity rainfall. This could result in increasing rainfall in the catchment areas but likely to also result in severe soil erosion in the same areas due to the intensity,” he said.

COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government, on Friday, for the first time, successfully tested artificial rain in a drought-hit area to provide clean water for hundreds of families.

The Power and Energy Ministry, in a statement, said the Ceylon Electricity Board together with the Sri Lanka Air Force conducted the project, which caused rainfall for 45 minutes in the catchment areas of the Maussakelle Reservoir, in the Central Province.

A Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter was used to spray chemicals on the clouds, 8,000 feet above the reservoir, resulting in 45 minutes of rainfall.

""Observing the success of the pilot project which commenced today, Power and Energy Minister Ravi Karunanayake has instructed relevant authorities to take necessary measures to create artificial rains in the next few days until the dry weather exists in the country,"" the ministry said.

The pilot project was launched following assistance from a special team who had arrived in Sri Lanka from Thailand.

The ministry said the aim of the project is to create rains during the drought seasons.

Hundreds of families remain affected by months of severe drought due to lack of rains and delayed monsoonal rains in the central parts of Sri Lanka.","Fri, 22 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['minutes', 'reservoir', 'rain', 'ministry', 'artificial', 'lanka', 'sri', 'xinhua', 'pilot', 'project', 'tests', 'rains', 'power', 'successfully']", 
3,3,Drought Sri Lanka,Resolving long felt water scarcity in Anuradhapura - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/resolving-long-felt-water-scarcity-anuradhapura,"Anuradhapura is the largest district in the country with a population of around 893,000 across 717,900 hectares. There were nearly 3,000 major, medium and small-scale tanks and irrigation works in ancient Sri Lanka dating from the reign of King Pandukabhaya in 300 BC.The government has given priority to provide potable drinking water to the people. Around 1,500 tanks in the Anuradhapura district are in a state of dilapidation, filled with sediment. The tanks have been contracting due to sediment disposal and thus, water capacity is dwindling. The people in the district suffered from the acute shortage of both drinking and irrigational water during the last two years due to the prolonged drought.

The government spent around Rs. 3,000 million to extend drought relief facilities such as dry food rations for the victimised families. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), in collaboration with the National Community Water Supply Department and the Sri Lanka Navy, is engaged in remedying the problem of acute shortage of drinking water by installing reverse osmosis filtering devices in the dry zone which includes the North Central Province as well. It is learnt that the government spent Rs. 109,153 million in 2018 for the provision of potable drinking water. Between 2015 and 2018, eighteen new water supply projects were commissioned, while 440,220 new water connections were given to the people.

Anuradhapura-North water project - Phase I

Three mega water supply schemes are emerging in the Anuradhapura district. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Chinese government are providing financial and technological assistance for these water projects. Under the Anuradhapura-North mega water project - Phase I, Mihinthale - Mahakanadarawa tank which holds a water capacity of 35,000 acre feet has been selected as the main water source. The tank would release 6,700 cubic metres of water per day on the basis of 2,000 acre feet annually. Under the proposed water project, Rs. 300 million is to be spent for the modernisation of the tank and the irrigation canal system as a prerequisite to the water project.

The construction work of Phase I of the Anuradhapura-North water project is due to be completed before the end of 2020.

The construction work of the water project is now in progress. It has been estimated that a population of around 75,000 in 30 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions in the Medawachchiya, Rambewa and Mihinthale Divisional Secretariat (DS) Divisions which are considered as kidney disease-prone areas will benefit from the emerging Anuradhapura-North water project Phase I.

A water purification plant with a capacity of treating 9,400 cubic metre water per day is coming up adjoining to the Mahakanadarawa tank bund. Its capacity of water intake is 39,600 cubic metres. There are three ground reservoirs in Rambewa (1,500 cubic metres), Medawachchiya (1,000 cubic metres) and Pihimbiyagollewa (250 cubic metres), in addition to the four main water towers put up in Isinbassagala, Rambewa, Ethakada and Pihimbiyagollewa which together hold a water capacity of 4,000 cubic metres.

The main transmission pipeline is 89 kilometres long. The distribution sub-pipeline is 340 kilometres in length. The uPVC sub-distribution main which is 3,400 kilometres long has been completed. It has been designed to feed the Mahakanadarawa water source with an additional 56,750 acre feet of water from the Moragahakanda reservoir through the Upper Elahera and the NCP canal via the Manankattiya and Eruwewa tanks within the next five years.

Anuradhapura-North water project - Phase II

The JICA extends financial support for the proposed Anuradhapura-North water supply project Phase II. The remaining areas of Anuradhapura-North will receive water through the Anuradhapura-North water supply project Phase II. The Yan Oya reservoir in the Horowpathana DS Division will supply water for this project.

The main target of the Phase II is to ensure the supply of safe pipe borne drinking water to the population of around 193,319 in the DS divisions - Padaviya, Horowpathana, Kahatagasdigiliya and Kebithigollewa in the Anuradhapura district, covering 119 GN divisions. Under this scheme, Kallikulam and Vedivaiththakalu GN divisions in the Vavuniya district will also be partially covered, in addition to the 119 GN divisions.

The project is partly funded by the JICA with the Sri Lankan government funding the balance. The consultancy contract for design and procurement commenced on May 1, 2018. The detailed design and procurement are expected to be finished in February 2020 and thereafter, the implementation will follow immediately. A loan of JPY 23,137,000,000 has been granted for the project.

In the meantime, the construction work of the Thambuththegama water project in the Mahaweli H Area is to be started shortly. This project will cater to around 14,000 people in 42 GN divisions in the Thambuththegama, Galnewa and Thalawa DS Divisions. Here, the water source is the Rajangane reservoir (85,000 acre feet) and the intake of water per day would be 42,000 cubic metres.

The water treatment plant is capable of treating 18,000 cubic metres of water per day and the project consists of three towers with 1,500 cubic metres water capacity in each. A transmission pipeline extends to 52 kilometres, while the main distribution line is 135 kilometres in length. The capacity of raw water transmission is 27,000 cubic metres a day. It is learnt that submissions of preliminary design are in progress and construction work is scheduled to be completed by June 2021. However, farmers who come under the Rajangane reservoir project have vehemently objected to the daily water intake in fear that such a move would badly affect their cultivations and at present, the NWSDB in collaboration with irrigation authorities is trying to convince them of the benefits of the water project and explain to them that the water intake would not affect their crops.

Yan Oya reservoir project

Apart from these major water projects, the Anuradhapura Yan Oya reservoir project is nearing completion at a cost of Rs. 39,000 million. The reservoir’s water capacity is 149,000 acre feet. The project is to be completed shortly once the construction of the left and the right bank canals is over.

The Padaviya area has been suffering from an acute shortage of water since the Padaviya reservoir (85,000 acre feet) depends on rainfall as it has no permanent water source to feed it. The reservoir will be provided adequate water through the 20-kilometre long right bank canal. Also, the construction work of lower Malwathu Oya reservoir will commence soon.The reservoir which emerges in the proximity of historic Thanthirimale holds a water capacity of 169,000 acre feet and costs Rs. 15,000 million.","Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['scarcity', 'metres', 'supply', 'felt', 'cubic', 'lanka', 'water', 'sri', 'phase', 'capacity', 'long', 'feet', 'project', 'reservoir', 'divisions', 'anuradhapura', 'resolving']", 
4,4,Drought Sri Lanka,"Drought worsens lives of 117,000 people across island | The Sunday Times Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190407/news/drought-worsens-lives-of-117000-people-across-island-344009.html,"Drought worsens lives of 117,000 people across island View(s):

More than 117,000 people from 33,775 Sri Lankan families across the island are once again facing the double whammy of debilitating drought and the lack of water for drinking, livestock, and cultivation as of this month.

The numbers of people suffering from the drought has been rising since January.

Many small tanks and reservoirs have dried up despite the reasonable rains during the monsoon, according to the Department of Meteorology.

The worst drought hit regions are Puttalam, Vavuniya, Jaffna, Gampaha, Matara, Polonnaruwa and Kandy.

According to the Disaster Management Center (DMC), some 117,378 people from 33,775 families are suffering.

The Ministry of Disaster Management, via its arm the DMC, has allocated Rs 6.65 million for the affected families. Meanwhile, 300 water tankers and 4,471 water tanks have been distributed across 13 districts, so far.

This came in the wake of a renewed heat index advisory issued by the Department of Meteorology this week forecasting severe heat until April 15.

In Puttalam, 8 of 16 divisions are suffering without water.

Dankotuwa, Aarachchikattuwa, Mundalama, Pallama, Mahawewa, Naththandiya and Nawagathhena divisions have 8,000 — the highest number — affected.

The District Secretary N H M Chitrananda said water collection points have been set up. “We have not begun issuing dry rations, but we are monitoring the conditions.” Mr Chitrananda added the heat wave arrived unusually early.

Puttalam’s coconut yields have also declined. According to the District Secretary, many plantation owners have complained that the heat was to blame.

The Jaffna District Secretary, N Vedanayahan, told the Sunday Times that usually the drought is experienced by the end of April following the Sinhala and Tamil new year festivities.

Neduntivu, Kayts, Delft, Maruthankerni and Karainagar are provided with drinking water points for the people.

“We have taken adequate steps to provide drinking water to the northern islands where it has become a major issue during the drought,” he said. At least 50 non-irrigation category tanks were renovated by the District Secretariat to store rain water for livestock, and farming.

According to Mr Vedanayahan, the department has taken steps to implement an ambitious water project called ‘Aarumugam Plan’ to use rain water stored in the Vadamarachchi lagoon.

Dr Shiromani Jayawardena, the deputy director for Research and Climate Change at the Department of Meteorology, predicts higher temperatures by 2050. She has been studying the weather patterns of Sri Lanka over the years.

“There is no predominant wind now, but a very calm one. The high humidity makes people uncomfortable and they continuously sweat,” said Dr Jayawardena explaining why many feel that their body temperature is higher compared with the environment.

According to Dr Jayawardena’s study of Sri Lanka’s weather patterns over the years, two weather scenarios emerged based on emissions of greenhouse gas. In a moderate emissions scenario, the maximum temperature will increase from 1 to 1.6 degrees Celsius, whereas with high emissions, it would rise from 1.6-2.5 degrees by 2050.

Usually, by the third week of March, thundershowers were likely but it was not to be.

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board issued a notice this week urging the public to use water wisely.

A joint bulletin by the World Food Programme and Ministry of Public Administration and Disaster Management, titled “Climate and Food Security Monitoring,’’ shows that the current reservoir water level is 65%, and that more water is needed for a successful Yala season.

Heat-related risks rise

The Department of Meteorology has issued a severe heat index advisory for the Northwestern Province and the districts of Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Hambantota and Monaragala, warning that the human body temperature may spike up to 42 centigrade as the sun will be moving directly overhead Sri Lanka until April 15.

The heat is expected to increase from 32-41 centigrade and people are being advised to watch out for heat cramps and heat exhaustion. There is also the risk of heat stroke.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, advised those working outdoors to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade whenever possible.

The elderly and children may suffer bouts of heat exhaustion and should limit strenuous outdoor activities.","Sun, 07 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/190407/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/101-300x109.jpg,"['weather', 'tanks', 'week', 'heat', 'water', 'sri', 'temperature', 'drought', 'worsens', 'district', 'lives', 'island', 'department', '117000']",

Catholics in Sri Lanka have expressed concern about their ability to hold regular services during Holy Week due to the scorching weather, lack of rain and the continued threat of government-imposed power cuts.

Mary Patricia, a laywoman who volunteers with the Legion of Mary in capital Colombo, said Catholics in many parishes were planning a three-hour outdoor Way of the Cross pilgrimage around Easter but added this may now have to be called off.

""All of these power cuts, combined with the sweltering weather, could affect services scheduled for Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday,"" she said, explaining that the services from April 18-20 were due to include outdoor activities.

With the mercury hitting 38 degrees Celsius this month, the sweltering heat is potentially dangerous, especially for young children and the elderly.

The punishing heat and lack of rainfall have caused reservoirs, rivers and water tanks to dry up at an alarming pace as another drought ravages Sri Lanka's potable and other water supplies, threatening crops, livestock and people's livelihoods.

""Many reservoirs and rivers have emptied due to the lack of monsoon rains this year,"" said Naveen Kosgoda, a farmer activist from Anuradhapura in North Central Province.

""The country is suffering from chronic water shortages. Power cuts at day and night are making matters worse because they disturb the production schedules of small businessmen.""

The government has been imposing daily power cuts as an urgent measure since the dried-up waterways have put a dent in the amount of hydropower available.

However, officials proudly announced in recent days that there had been no such outages during the Sinhala Tamil New Year, celebrated by Buddhists and Hindus from April 13-14.

According to the Disaster Management Center, the dry weather has affected over 580,000 people nationwide.

This prompted the Department of Meteorology to issue an advisory urging manual laborers to seek shade and take regular breaks.

The Ministry of Health has also released a set of guidelines, including a reminder that children should not be allowed to play outside in the midday heat nor left waiting in vehicles when it is baking hot outside.

Chandana Jayaratne, a professor of physical science at Colombo University, said Sri Lanka was experiencing its warmest weather in 140 years, partly as a result of global warming.

Meanwhile, Power and Energy Minister Ravi Karunanayake pledged to thwart future power outages by issuing more licenses for solar farms to diversify the country's energy supplies and rely less on hydropower.","Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ucanews.com/uploads/2019/04/5cb6c791d5082_600.png,"['weather', 'cuts', 'mother', 'week', 'attack', 'daily', 'heat', 'lanka', 'sri', 'holy', 'water', 'sweltering', 'lack', 'nature', 'power', 'services']",

Brief scores - Australia 220/3 (54 overs) at tea vs Sri Lanka. Joe Burns (107*), Travis Head (91*), Vishwa Fernando (2/63). Current partnership - 192 runs off 276 balls. Full Scorecard

Opener Joe Burns smashed Australia's first century of the home season as he and Travis Head weathered early trouble against Sri Lanka's makeshift pace attack to put the hosts in a solid position at tea in the second and final Test on Friday.

Burns, who had scored the last of his three Test hundreds against New Zealand in early 2016, was batting on 107, the first century by an Australian batsman since Usman Khawaja's 141 in the drawn Dubai Test against Pakistan last October.

Australia vs Sri Lanka 2nd Test, Day 1 in Canberra: Live Cricket Score

Travis Head was unbeaten on 91, following up on his 84 in the victory in Brisbane last week, and the duo had added 192 in an unbroken fourth-wicket stand to take the hosts to 220 for three at the interval on the opening day.

On a chilly and overcast morning at the Manuka Oval, which made its debut as a Test venue, Australia captain Tim Paine finally had some luck with the coin toss, winning for only the second time in nine Tests he had led the team in.

But his joy was short-lived as Sri Lanka made early inroads despite being forced to go with a completely new pace attack with the injured Suranga Lakmal joining Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Kumara in the sidelines after playing the opening Test at the Gabba.

Left-armer Vishwa Fernando, who was not in the original squad and joined only as a replacement for Nuwan Pradeep, struck twice in two overs to dismiss left-handers Marcus Harris and Khawaja with his outswinging deliveries.

Opening batsman Harris started strongly to race to 11 before finding Chamika Karunaratne at point with a square drive, while number three Khawaja guided one to the slip fielder before opening his account.

Debutant Chamika, who arrived in Australia only couple of days back as a replacement, then picked up a wicket with only his fourth delivery in Test cricket, getting Marnus Labuschagne (six) to edge behind.

The hosts, who lead the series 1-0 after their win in Brisbane by an innings and 40 runs, were reduced to 28-3 at that stage before Burns and Head steadied the innings.

As the new ball lost its shine and the Sri Lankan pacemen their swing, the batting pair grew in confidence and upped their scoring rate.

Burns, who returned to the side in the ongoing series after being dropped against Pakistan and India, played some flowing off-drives and survived a dropped chance at slip by Dhananjaya de Silva against off-spinner Dilruwan Perera when batting on 34.

The right-hander also cut and pulled ferociously against Sri Lanka's pace attack, who have a combined experience of five Tests between themselves, to hit 17 fours in his knock so far.

9,9,Drought Sri Lanka,"Extreme weather puts traditional livelihoods in peril in Sri Lanka, studies warn - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2019/05/extreme-weather-puts-traditional-livelihoods-in-peril-in-sri-lanka-studies-warn/,"New assessments identify Sri Lanka’s northern region as a hotspot for climate change impacts, with the district of Jaffna named the top hotspot.

The Global Climate Risk Index 2019 lists Sri Lanka as the second most impacted country in 2017 for having faced extensive losses due to climate catastrophes in a single year.

With extreme weather events predicted to increase with rising levels of impact, the assessments call for rapid adaptation, particularly in terms of livelihoods vulnerable to an increasingly unpredictable climate.

JAFFNA, Sri Lanka — For Nataraja Kumar, 47, a fisherman from Guru Nagar, a sleepy coastal village in Sri Lanka’s north, it’s no longer possible to continue with his traditional livelihood.

“I went fishing as a 10-year-old boy with my father and grandfather. But I will not train my son to be a fisherman. There’s no fish to catch,” he tells Mongabay.

Fishing is Kumar’s only life skill, and he has five mouths to feed. Having failed to eke out a living in the past two years as a fisherman, Kumar is now slowly letting go of his traditional livelihood to work as a day laborer at a construction site in another town, earning around $3 a day to keep food on the table. Many other fishermen, he says, are making the same switch.

“The sea seems to have changed. We find less [fish] and fewer species,” Kumar says, adding that the northern waters no longer yield the highly popular black tiger prawns, a top seafood export.

It’s the same story for those engaged in growing traditional crops, like onion farmer Sudhiran Kanapathipillai, 51, from Jaffna, the capital of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province.

For three consecutive seasons, his crops have failed due to unpredictable weather. “We cannot rely on wet and dry spells any longer. They just don’t happen that way,” he tells Mongabay. “Paddy farmers suffer more than us due to their dependence on the monsoon pattern. North was once agriculturally productive. Our soil is good but the weather has failed us.”

The island’s north is feeling the heat – literally – with two separate studies highlighting Sri Lanka’s increased risk to changing weather patterns that are driving extensive changes in both living standards and livelihoods.

Increasing climate risks

A briefing paper titled the Global Climate Risk Index 2019 published by Germanwatch looks at the impacts of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods and heat waves from 1998 to 2017. It ranked Sri Lanka as the second most impacted territory in 2017.

In 2015, Sri Lanka ranked 98th, but made a swift jump to the second slot two years later after the island suffered extensive losses, both in terms of deaths and property damage, from a series of exceptional catastrophes.

In May 2o17, heavy landslides and floods hit Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in the country’s southwest. More than 200 people died in the worst rains experienced on the island since 2003. The extreme weather displaced more than 600,000 people and affected 12 out of 25 districts.

The Sri Lankan experience corresponds well to the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report of the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts an increase in risks associated with extreme weather events as global mean temperatures rise, also linking global warming to El Niño events.

Smart agriculture and alternate livelihoods

On the ground, communities are now being asked to deal with the reality, not as individuals but as entire communities.

S. Sivakumar, director of the department of agriculture at the Northern Provincial Council, says these are among the “hot” issues faced by the provincial administration.

“As weather turns extremely unpredictable and extreme weather events are causing repeated crop failure in a region that was battered by nearly three decades of war, it is a fight against poverty which requires a new approach toward ensuring food security and livelihoods,” he told Mongabay.

Sivakumar says that the inadequacy and unpredictability of rainfall, coupled with prolonged spells of drought, are affecting traditional livelihoods such as fishing and agriculture. “We recommend smart agriculture and the reintroduction of ancient systems such as the water cascading system Sri Lanka was once known for,” he said.

“Through pilot projects on ‘climate smart integrated agriculture’ in the three northern districts of Jaffna, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi, we promote solutions to overcome impacts climate change.”

But it’s not that easy for a region that was once a hotbed of ethnic violence to make that journey toward normalcy while battling against weather events that pose a new challenge.

The challenge before Sri Lanka, and the island’s north in particular, is well documented in a September 2018 World Bank Group study that looked into South Asia’s climate profiles, analyzing how temperatures have risen considerably and will continue to rise, with precipitation patterns becoming less predictable.

“Sri Lanka’s proximity to the ocean makes it vulnerable to increase in extreme tropical storms and sea level rise,” the study says. It says the country also contains “hidden hotspots,” areas that are economically at risk from climate change that are not often discussed. It adds that by 2050, annual average temperatures on the island are projected to increase by about 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) under a climate-sensitive scenario, and 1 to 2 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) under a carbon-intensive scenario.

The study says Sri Lanka has 19 million people living in locations that would become “moderate or severe hotspots” by 2050 under the carbon-intensive scenario, or more than 90 percent of the total population.

And if the projection holds true, Sri Lanka’s Northern and North Western provinces will emerge as the top hotspots.

The island’s north, home to a large population of poor and displaced communities, will have to bear the brunt of the vagaries of the weather, adding a new challenge to its long-term recovery, the country snapshot says.

As such, Jaffna will become the top hotspot, followed by Puttlam in North Western province, followed by Mannar and Kilinochchi in Northern province, making the island’s north highly vulnerable.

Likewise, Western province too is projected to be highly impacted, with a decline in living standards of about 7.5 to 8 percent, including in Colombo, Sri Lanka’s economic hub that contributes over 40 percent of the country’s GDP.

The projections call for drastic changes in traditional livelihoods and for urgent economic adaptation.

With a projected decline in living standards of 1 to 7 percent, it is suggested that non-agricultural jobs will shoot up by 30 percent, marking a huge shift from the agriculture-based rural economy and livelihood patterns.

Adaptation and mitigation

Measures are being taken to mitigate impact caused by extreme weather events, even as adaptation holds the key, says the director of Sri Lanka’s Climate Change Secretariat (CCS), R.D.S. Jayathunga.

He told Mongabay the actual problem lay with the increase in the nighttime temperature fluctuations, impacting a multitude of crops and reducing agricultural productivity, making it a main focus of the country’s national policy and the adaptation plan to combat climate change impact.

Sri Lanka needs to improve its resilience through targeted programs, he said, identifying future challenges such as agriculture, heat stress, indirect health impacts and biodiversity loss. “We need to be ready as a resilient nation,” Jayathunga said.

A statement from the presidency said: “the State of Emergency exists on account of the natural disaster of drought in all regions of the Republic of Namibia.”

“Offices, Ministries and Agencies and all other stakeholders will be mobilized to ensure that the necessary assistance is rolled out to affected communities,” the statement added.

Declaration of a National Drought Emergency pic.twitter.com/MvtqyX6PwO — Presidency | Republic of Namibia (@NamPresidency) May 6, 2019

The government has this month confirmed that it will subsidise farmers who reduce their herds as part of its drought intervention.

The top official of the department of agricultural development, Sophia Kasheeta, is quoted by the Namibian news portal as saying the ministry will give marketing incentives to farmers who want to sell their livestock to encourage them to reduce the numbers.

Kasheeta added that they would pay N$80 per head of small stock, and N$400 per head of large stock sold. However, the ministry said the government will only pay the subsidy for up to 100 livestock units per farmer, the report added.

Other initiatives the ministry was implementing in the face of drought relief interventions was the provision of water tankers for communities with no alternative sources of water in all regions, except Khomas.

The water tankers will benefit 10 000 households. Except Khomas, the ministry will also rehabilitate and restore boreholes in all regions. Farmers adversely affected will also benefit from lick supplements.

Information minister Stanley Simataa is on record to have admitted that this is the worst drought the country has experienced. “It will be coming. It is in the process. You will be alerted when the time comes for the authorities to make such a declaration (i.e. state of emergency),” he said days ago.","Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/990625/1024x538_990625.jpg?1557156563,"['farmers', 'state', 'national', 'ministry', 'tankers', 'regions', 'statement', 'namibia', 'water', 'stock', 'drought', 'emergency', 'declares']",

Production of 2019 paddy crop forecast at bumper level Cereal import requirements in 2019 expected to decline for second consecutive year Prices of rice declined since beginning of 2019, while prices of wheat stable Food security conditions generally good

Production of 2019 paddy crop forecast at bumper level

Harvesting of the 2019 main “maha” paddy crop finalized at the end of March, while planting of the 2019 secondary “yala” paddy crop is ongoing and will be completed by the end of May. The “maha” output is officially estimated at 2.9 million tonnes, 22 percent above the five-year average, reflecting above-average planted area, mainly driven by remunerative prices and average yields, supported by adequate and well-distributed rainfall. Similarly, production prospects for the secondary “yala” crop, to be harvested in August and September, are favourable on expectations of average yields and an increase in the planted area compared to last year’s average level. Overall, the 2019 aggregate paddy output is preliminarily forecast at a bumper leve of 4.5 million tonnes, 18 percent above the near-average level in 2018.

Harvesting of the 2019 main “maha” maize crop finalized in March and production is estimated at about 275 000 tonnes, 25 percent above the five-year average, as the expansion in plantings more than offset the damage inflicted by the Fall Armyworm infestation in the districts of Anuradhapura, Ampara, Badulla and Monaragala. In these areas, as of 15 April, official reports indicate that about 50 percent of the area cultivated with maize was affected and crop losses were estimated at 10 percent of the initially expected output. Assuming an average output of the ongoing secondary “yala” maize crop, to be harvested between August and September 2019, the aggregate 2019 maize production is forecast at 310 000 tonnes, about 23 percent above the five-year average.

Cereal import requirements in 2019 expected to decline for second consecutive year

Cereal import requirements in the 2019 calendar year are forecast at 1.4 million tonnes, accounting for the second consecutive annual decline since 2017, when imports reached a record high due to the impact of drought on local production.

Import requirements of wheat in the 2019 calendar year, which account for the largest share of imports, are forecast at 1.2 million tonnes, virtually unchanged compared to the average level in 2018, reflecting sustained demand from the milling industry. Similarly, import requirements of maize are expected to remain at 130 000 tonnes, close to the above-average level in 2018, reflecting growing demand for food and feed use. By contrast, import requirements of rice in the 2019 calendar year are forecast at a well below-average level of 50 000 tonnes, reflecting ample domestic availabilities from the 2018 paddy output and expectations of a bumper crop in 2019.

Prices of rice declined since beginning of 2019, while prices of wheat stable

Prices of rice firmed up steadily since September 2018 until January 2019, in line with seasonal trends and declined between February and April 2019, pressured by the harvest of the main “maha” paddy crop. Overall, prices of rice in April 2019 were close to their year-earlier levels.

Prices of wheat flour remain overall stable in 2019 so far, reflecting adequate availabilities from imports. Overall, prices of wheat were slightly above their year earlier levels in April 2019.

COLOMBO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center (DMC), issued a severe heat warning for several districts across the island country on Friday as temperatures were expected to rise as high as 40 degrees Celsius.

In a statement, the DMC said that the heat advisory had been issued for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and districts such as Polonnaruwa, in North Central Sri Lanka, Batticaloa and Ampara in eastern Sri Lanka were urged to remain cautious.

DMC spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said that hot and humid days were expected to continue in Sri Lanka for over a month while the Meteorology Department had cautioned that temperatures in some regions could rise to extreme caution ranges.

""Public are advised to stay hydrated and be in the shade as much as possible,"" Kodippili said.

""The dry conditions will dominate most parts of the country and there will be no rains in most regions,"" he added.

According to the DMC, already over 100,000 people from many dry parts of the island are facing a severe drought due to the lack of rains and water browsers were being sent into the affected areas.","Fri, 28 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['warning', 'celsius', 'dmc', 'heat', 'regions', 'lanka', 'temperatures', 'sri', 'parts', 'issues', 'xinhua', 'rise', 'degrees', 'rains', 'severe', 'reach']",

Nearly 50% of the country is currently facing drought with at least 16% falling in the “exceptional” or “extreme” category, according to IIT Gandhinagar scientists managing India’s real time drought prediction system.

This ongoing drought will pose a lot of challenges in water availability this summer, Vimal Mishra, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Gandhinagar, told PTI.

The real-time monitoring system run by his team, which includes Ph.D. student Amardeep Tiwari, collects weather and precipitation data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is then used to simulate soil moisture and other factors that contribute to drought.

The results of the simulations, prepared by the Water and Climate Lab at IIT Gandhinagar, are available on the website of the IMD.

“About 47% of the country is facing drought — with 16% facing extreme, or exceptional category of drought — which we show from our real time monitoring system that we have developed for the country,” said Mr. Mishra, who heads the lab.

“Arunachal Pradesh did not get good rain this year, and parts of Jharkhand, southern Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and northern part of Tamil Nadu are under drought,” Mr. Mishra said.

If these areas experience very hot summer before the onset of monsoon, it could lead to a crisis, he warned.

According to him, continuing drought will further burden the already depleting groundwater resources of the country.

“We are not enhancing groundwater recharge. On the other hand, drought conditions are making us extract more and more water,” he said.

While famine-like conditions are not expected, the drought will have a massive impact on the economy.

“It can create long-term stress, if not mortality for poor, marginalised farmers,” Mr. Mishra said.

The scientist said global warming and climate change are likely to exacerbate drought in the coming years.

Difficult situation ahead

“If our groundwater is not recharged and managed sustainably, we could face a very difficult situation in the coming years,” Mr. Mishra said, adding that groundwater is being used irresponsibly at present.

“You can reduce groundwater by selecting appropriate crops. If we already have depleted groundwater we should not grow water-intensive crops. For example, Punjab should not be growing rice,” Mr. Mishra said.

“The government needs to take some tough decisions as far as groundwater, and water conservation is concerned,” Mr. Mishra said.

Conserving water in urban homes is just a drop in the bucket compared to steps that can be taken in the agriculture sector, he said.

“Of course, conservation should be encouraged at every level, but the elephant in the room is agriculture. 80% of our total fresh water is used in agriculture sites, rather than residential sites,” he said.

He also stressed the need to equip ourselves better to tackle a drought situation,

“The government thinks drought is a reactive situation, that they will provide a relief only once there is a crisis But with the data available they can take proactive measures to prevent a water crisis,” Mr. Mishra said.","Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/orycle/article26396058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK26-DROUGHT-STANDALONE,"['india', 'facing', 'situation', 'nearly', 'water', 'drought', 'currently', 'mr', 'groundwater', 'country', 'used', '50', 'scientists', 'mishra', 'iit', 'gandhinagar']",

Failed rains across eastern Africa, southern Africa, and the Horn of Africa are seeing another dire season for farmers, increasing food prices and driving up the aid needs of tens of millions of already vulnerable people across the three regions.

All told, more than 45 million people will struggle to find enough food across 14 countries in 2019, many feeling the compounded effects of years of drought.

It’s the second time in three years that an El Niño event has disrupted weather patterns. In 2017 – a year in which the UN labelled the crisis the worst in decades – some 38 million people were in need.

Drought again in 2018 was followed by significantly below-average rains at the beginning of this year – down by 50 percent in parts of southern Africa.

In the Horn and eastern Africa, delayed rains finally arrived in May, allowing some regrowth of pasture for grazing. But it has not been enough to offset the damage to people’s livelihoods and overall food security.

“We need to move to a system where we act much earlier on the warning signs of drought and hunger so that we can cut response times and costs, and reduce deaths and human suffering,” the UN’s Emergency Relief Coordinator, Mark Lowcock, said in reference to the drought in the Horn.

The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund has released $45 million to encourage major donors to do more to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya.

With an El Niño forecast more than six months ago, World Food Programme climatologist Jesse Mason argues there should have been time for governments and aid agencies to put in place risk-reduction measures: drought-resistant seeds, irrigation systems, and cash transfers to cushion the impact on farmers.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt.”

It can no longer be business as usual, Mason told The New Humanitarian. Southern and eastern Africa are on the front lines of climate change, and mitigation measures must now be much more data-driven, comprehensive, and innovative.

“We need to recognise the seasons are changing and we need to adapt,” said Mason, project manager at WFP’s forecast-based financing initiative. “The pieces need to come together, from the global forecasting to the way we interact with farmers on the ground based on that information.”

The following is a snapshot of needs across southern, eastern, and the Horn of Africa.

The term “food crisis” The term “food crisis” means households that are just about able to meet their basic food needs, but only by selling some essential assets like livestock. There may also be cases of malnutrition. A “food emergency” refers to very high levels of malnutrition and some deaths. All assets are liquidated, making recovery so much harder.

Angola

In need: 2.3 million

The government declared an emergency in the three southern provinces of Cunene, Huila, and Namibe in January. Angola has been pursuing a humanitarian self-reliance policy but the response has been inadequate and the situation is deteriorating.

Ethiopia

In need: 8.3 million

The most vulnerable communities have suffered consecutive years of drought. This season’s Gu long rains (March to May) were poor or delayed. Although a late burst of rainfall has helped replenish pasture in the south and southeast, it came too late for some crop-producing areas and the food security situation is expected to deteriorate. Numbers in need are exacerbated by mass internal displacement as a result of inter-communal violence – affecting some 2.6 million. Concerns are also rising over potential food aid pipeline breaks that could interrupt life-saving operations. It’s $1.3 billion aid appeal is only 15 percent funded.

Kenya

In need: 2.5 million

The long rains were similarly poor – less than half the expected amount fell by April. By July the number of severely food insecure is projected to more than double from the current 1.1 million to 2.5 million. Below-average terms of trade and reduced household incomes during the July to September dry season could push parts of eastern Kenya into crisis by August.

Lesotho

In need: 640,000

Four districts are at crisis or emergency levels – Mohale’s Hoek, Maseru, Quthing, and Qacha’s Nek. A total of 640,000 people are projected to be food insecure over the next 12 months. Lesotho has a population of 2.2 million.

Madagascar

In need: 1.3 million

By March, 1.3 million people were severely food insecure. Although the vulnerable southern region received fair rainfall this season, the harvest is forecast to be well below average. The south is yet to recover from the effects of the 2015/16 El Niño and the 2017/18 drought, and the number of children who are acutely malnourished is expected to rise in 2019.

Malawi

In need: 3.3 million

Some 2.8 million people are projected to be in crisis and 450,000 at emergency levels of food needs during the October to March lean season in the country’s southern and central districts.

Mozambique

In need: 1.85 million

More than 1.7 million people were identified as in crisis between September and December 2018 across 11 provinces. As a result of Cyclone Idai in March and Cyclone Kenneth in April, an estimated 1.85 million are now in need of aid.

Namibia

In need: 550,000

At the beginning of May the government declared a drought-induced state of emergency – the third time in six years. All regions of the country are affected, with 24 percent of the 2.3 million population facing food shortfalls.

Somalia

In need: 5.4 million

After two consecutive poor rainy seasons Somalia is facing yet another drought. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) have failed, on top of a poor 2018 Deyr season (October to December), contributing to widespread crop failure and lower livestock productivity. Pastoral communities in the worst-affected areas – in the north and centre of the country – are facing acute food insecurity. Drought-related displacement is underway and malnutrition rates are rising. Food aid levels have “significantly declined” compared with last year. A $700 million drought response plan has been launched.

South Sudan

In need: 7.1 million

Conflict and drought has created a disastrous situation. Some 6.9 million people – close to 60 percent of the population – are currently facing severe food insecurity with an estimated 50,000 in “famine-like” conditions. In many areas, malnutrition levels remain critical, with some 860,000 children under the age of five estimated to be severely malnourished. Out of the overall 7.1 million people in need, only 5.7 million are targeted for aid. The aid appeal stands at $1.5 billion, but so far only $346 million has been received.

Sudan

In need: 5.6 million

Around one million people are facing emergency conditions – concentrated in the states of Khartoum and South Darfur. The Darfur region accounts for 45 percent of all Sudanese in need (crisis and emergency levels). Sudan’s crisis is less weather-related and more a consequence of food price rises. Overall, prices of grains were at record or near-record levels in March despite an above-average 2018 harvest. The depreciation of the local currency, fuel shortages and input costs combined to push up the cost of living - one of the triggers for the protests that led to the toppling of former president Omar al-Bashir in April.

Uganda

In need: Unknown

The arid Karamoja region – bordering Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia – has been hit by a second failed rainy season. Numbers in need are not yet known, but staple food prices are expected to remain high through to September, well above the five-year average.

Zambia

In need: 1.3 million

Maize producing areas in the south experienced their worst drought since 1981. Maize production is estimated to have dropped to two million tonnes from approximately 2.4 million tonnes last season and exports have been banned – which will impact prices in the region. The projected number of households needing food aid from July to February 2020 is 220,000 – a 38 percent increase from last season.

Zimbabwe

In need: 5.3 million

Total cereal production this season was estimated at 852,000 tonnes, against a national requirement of 1.8 million tonnes for human consumption and 450,000 tonnes for livestock. Compared to the 2017/18 season, the provinces of Manicaland, Matabeleland South, and Matabeleland North all saw their maize production drop by more than 70 percent. Climate shocks have compounded severe economic difficulties. By September, most of the country is expected to be in “crisis”.

20,20,Drought Sri Lanka,Kenya's herders adapt to drought with new land management deals - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/kenyas-herders-adapt-to-drought-with-new-land-management-deals/a-48757247,"Green acacia trees polka-dot the dull brown soil in Laikipia, a county in the shadow of Mount Kenya. Grass has begun to spring up after a period of good rains, but the landscape can't quite hide the scars of drought and overgrazing. The ground has bare patches and gullies have formed through the eroded soil, exposing deep red earth.

Kenya is recovering from two years of drought, which killed an estimated 40 to 60% of cattle in areas where livestock accounts for almost 90% of an average household's income. Some 3.4 million people went short of food.

""We are really suffering,"" says Priscilla Senteina Lekurtut, 26, from a cattle-herding community in Il Polei in Laikipia North. ""There is not much land, there is climate change, animals are dying and people are getting poor.""

Lekurtut says pastoralist communities like hers, which traditionally roam the land, moving their animals to wherever there is something for them to eat, now have nowhere to go. And if families can't graze their cattle, they can't earn a living.

""Your children won't go to school, people even might die because of the hunger. We are very desperate,"" she told DW.

That desperation has lead to conflict erupting on land owned by private wildlife conservancies and ranches, where herders are only allowed to graze with permission from the owners.

'We moved for miles and miles'

Pastoralists have roamed Kenya for centuries, but since the British colonized the country at the turn of the 20th century, land has been privatized and their livelihoods restricted.

Almost half of land in Laikipia is owned by big ranchers, but it borders the pastoralist counties of Baringo, Samburu and Isiolo, where herders are coming under increasing pressure.

""I lost about 30 [head of cattle] or more,"" Timothy Lemosiany, a herder from Musul, a rural area of Laikipia, told DW. ""Some people lost their whole herd and became poor. It completely changed people's lives. We moved and moved for miles and miles, and… encroached onto private property — that means conflicts with others.""

For a community that depends so intimately on the land and seasons, the increasing irregularity of weather patterns is felt viscerally.

""The land is crying,"" says Joseph Lentunyoi, a Maasai who has spent much of his life in northern Laikipia. ""We expect [droughts] as something that we need to prepare for, but we never know how the weather patterns will change.""

Recognizing that his people have to adapt to survive, Lentunyoi set up the Laikipia Permaculture Center (LPC) in 2012.

Lentunyoi believes better land management can breathe life back into over-grazed land, and revive struggling communities

A golden oasis

Atop of a rolling plain in Musul, is a fenced-off area of abundant golden grass. With trees in full green leaf, the contrast with the barren landscape beyond the barbed wire is stark. The midday sun beats down on a group of Maasai wading through the grass, which is tall enough in places to brush their knees.

The 300 or so pastoralists who live here in Musul have agreed to let this land rest by keeping cattle out of the 50-acre (20-hectare) plot for over a year — even during severe drought. They are growing two types of grass — Maasai love grass and buffel grass — that they can store for times of scarcity, and the seeds of which they can sell on or resow in other areas of pasture.

One of the men, Morongo, leans on his walking stick, surveys his lush surroundings and explains how things have changed from the days when too many cattle grazed the land bare, and died when there was nothing left to eat.

""Now, there's no bare land with this initiative,"" Morongo says. ""Before, our cows would eat everything and then a lot of topsoil was gone when it rained. But now at least there is some vegetation cover.""

Priscila Leketurt surveys the golden grass that the community here in Musul has allowed to regrow

'The soil is like our body'

Lemosiany, of the Ole Ntile wildlife conservancy in Musul, works with the Maasai here, teaching them about sustainable land management. He remembers the conflict that came in the wake of last year's drought and hopes the community can avoid this happening again.

""We need to protect our land first before we disturb other people,"" says Lemosiany, who is a member of the Maasai himself. ""We discovered we were wrecking our own environment at the same time annoying other people. It's time to start doing good for ourselves.""

The community in Musul is just one of 300 that the LPC has worked with over the past seven years. Funded through private donations and grants, the organization teaches herders how to revive soil, reseed native grasses and diversify their income by growing organic vegetables or aloe — which is native to the area — or keeping bees.

""The soil is like our body,"" Lentunyoi, LPC's founder, says. ""It's a life, and if we continue creating a system which is making the soil dead, then we're going the wrong direction.""

But small local projects aren't enough turn things around. ""It could really change the lives of people here — if it was on a large scale,"" he says.

Giving pastoralism a future

Lance Robinson of the International Livestock Research Institute says there is a ""race going on for pastoralist communities, between climate change and their ability to adapt,"" and the government needs to take action to ensure they win.

Read more: Curfew ordered after deadly clashes between herders and farmers in Nigeria

To scale up projects like LPC's, issues of land ownership must be resolved, to establish ""a form of land tenure that gives pastoralist communities some security so they can know this territory, this conservancy or this grazing area, is ours,"" Robinson told DW.

""If they can be given enough support, enough room to adapt, and the right kind of investment from county and national governments, then I see pastoralism modernizing, rather than disappearing,"" he adds.

Lekurtut believes that to preserve her people's ancient way of life, herders and landowners must now work together.

""As Maasai, we say the land belongs to everyone,"" she says. ""We love the land because it gives us everything. When it rains we get grass and the animals feed on it, and the pastoralists have a relationship with animals — we are attached together.""","Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/48745049_6.jpg,"['land', 'cattle', 'adapt', 'grass', 'drought', 'kenyas', 'herders', 'management', 'community', 'pastoralist', 'soil', 'deals', 'musul', 'laikipia', 'maasai']",

Farmers in the southern Philippine region of Soccsksargen have resorted to selling their farm animals to survive the impact of a drought that has reportedly ravaged about 15,000 hectares of farmland.

Father Ariel Destora, director of the social action center of Marbel Diocese, said the scorching heat brought about by the El Nino phenomenon that has hit the region in Mindanao this year had dried up grasslands.

El Nino is a climate cycle in the Pacific Ocean caused by warm water. The warm water pools, which causes droughts.

""Some farmers are being forced to sell their cows because they have nothing to eat,"" said Father Destora as he appealed for donations to help farmers and residents affected by the arid conditions.

Several farmers and fisherfolk groups appealed to the government last week for ""livelihood assistance"" of at least US$197 per affected family.

""Some parts of the diocese have no water,"" said the priest. ""Life has become hard for those severely affected.""

Marbel Diocese straddles the provinces of South Cotabato and Sarangani and parts of Sultan Kudarat in the Soccsksargen region that includes North Cotabato province and General Santos City.

North Cotabato province, which is suffering the brunt of the drought, had already declared a state of calamity after crop losses reached at least US$12 million.

Of the 18 local government units in the province, nine were reported to be severely affected.

In South Cotabato province, the dry spell already damaged agricultural crops worth about US$232,000 as of the end of March, according to data from the local agriculture office.

""We are doing our best to help the farmers,"" said Ray Embajador of the Department of Agriculture.

He said his office is still in the process of looking into the impact of the drought in order to provide ""appropriate intervention."" He said at least 11,604 hectares of rice fields and 3,120 hectares of cornfields in the region have been affected.

About 71,909 families or 359,545 individuals have been hit by the dry weather in North Cotabato province alone, according to the National Disaster Risk and Reduction Management Council.

COLOMBO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on Friday said it aimed to transform the island's capital Colombo into South Asia's first green city by strengthening its infrastructure, power and energy, solid waste disposal, construction and transport.

Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told local media that the concept of a green city was the direct answer to overcome global warming and save the human race from natural disasters such as drought, flood, rising of sea levels and temperature and global warming calamities.

""The best example was the recent flash floods in Australia that destroyed a number of species due to global warming. Therefore we must act now to control the use of fossil fuel, promote the use of renewable energy or green energy and thereby minimize carbon dioxide emissions and global warming,"" Ranawaka said.

In order to promote and spread awareness among the public on the importance of the concept of green city, Sri Lanka will host an international academic seminar on the green city from Sep. 29 to Oct. 4, the minister said.

Earlier this month, the White House, in the 2020 fiscal year budget submitted to Congress, called for a 24-percent cut in US foreign assistance.

Recently released data from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSN) predicts worsening drought, severe hunger and crop failures of up to 30 percent in parts of the region in the coming months.

“We’re very concerned by the deteriorating conditions in the region where we are seeing families – whose lives rely on the land – unable to cope,” said Matt Davis, the East Africa regional director for Catholic Relief Services, which oversees a major US government-funded food assistance programme in the region.

“We are concerned the administration’s budget could abandon millions of families around the world just when they need help the most.”

Climate change is also dramatically impacting crop yields in some of the poorest areas of the world.

The number of extreme climate-related disasters including severe heat, droughts, floods and storms has doubled since 1990, according to The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report released by the United Nations last year.

These disasters destroy crops, resulting in tragic consequences for people who live off the land. In the Horn of Africa, up to 80 percent of the population is subsistence farmers.

“We have not seen an improvement in the climate situation,” said Birhan, a mother of four from rural Hawzen district in Ethiopia’s Tigray region.

“The drought is becoming recurrent. But if there is rain, it is excessive and destroys the crops.”

Birhan is one of around 1.5 million people who receive food through a USAID-funded programme that provides emergency assistance to people affected by the drought.

“Without this assistance, our only chance would be to migrate. I don’t even know where I would go,” she said.

To make matters worse, rainfall from October to December of last year was 55 percent less than normal in some parts of the Horn. As a result, widespread hunger is expected to increase in the coming months.","Sun, 24 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/3024786a319a4152b96c74abeb1d1314_8.jpeg?resize=1200%2C630,"['prolonged', 'world', 'horn', 'suffering', 'millions', 'assistance', 'drought', 'food', 'region', 'united', 'severe', 'africa', 'released']",

Unlike the simplicity of this definition, the actual scenario is devastating.

Droughts don’t just affect the plants or livestock of a region, but they also pose a great threat to human lives. It is regarded as a natural disaster considering the damage it does to the entire ecosystem.

We have seen examples of how droughts can create great economic instabilities, owing to the lessened production of resources. In the past 40 years, no natural disaster has affected more people than droughts.

RELATED: 6 MAJOR RIVERS FACING DROUGHT-LIKE SITUATIONS FROM OVERUSE

Climate change has been a major factor in the creation of droughts in several parts of the world. As the earth is heating up, many regions of the world are experiencing less precipitation and droughts are becoming more common than ever before.

However, we humans have the ability to think and use our skills to engineer solutions, and in this article, we will go through some of these methods.

1. Desalination of water

Even though more than 70% of the earth’s surface is covered with water, only 0.003% of it is fresh water. In many places of the world, annual rainfall is the only way to replenish the freshwater sources.

But what if we could desalinate water? Then we have oceans to help us get fresh water.

But it is easier said than done. Desalination of water is pretty resource intensive. First, the water needs to be boiled, converted to steam and then condensed.

This requires a significant amount of fossil fuels to produce heat. But hope is still at hand as the developments in the field has made filters made up of graphene that can desalinate water with nothing more than hydrostatic pressure.

2. Rainwater harvesting

Rainwater harvesting has seen major growth in recent years and this is something everyone should adopt. With rainwater harvesting, homes can store the water they get from rain and then use it when they need it in dry conditions.

In urban areas, only 15% of rainwater enters the ground while in rural areas 50% of rainwater is absorbed into the ground. Rainwater harvesting provides both urban and rural areas with an efficient option to store rainwater and then reuse it in times of drought.

If a house has a primary water source, then rainwater harvesting provides them with an auxiliary option that they can use when water is not available. Rainwater harvesting is a great way to combat drought and is now encouraged among farmers and herders to provide their agriculture with water in times of drought.

3. Drip irrigation

Drip irrigation hopes to achieve optimum water delivery for plants and optimum moisture in the soil. The advantage of such a system is that it does not result in water wastage.

Nowadays, many companies have come forward providing the market with cost-effective and intuitive drip irrigation systems.

Technologically advanced farms are moving towards IoT inspired drip irrigation systems that can operate without human intervention. The highly targeted nature of drip irrigation ensures that each plant gets the right amount of water delivered right on its roots.

4. Harvesting water from the air

Air as we know it contains many elements, and one among it is moisture. If we could build something efficient to harvest that moisture and condense it, we could harvest water from the air.

And this is what researchers from MIT have done!

This solar powered device uses a large surface area of the pores in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) to catch water vapor and pass it between two temperatures zones to condense it. A field test conducted in Arizona was a success and now the team hopes to scale up the system so that it can produce many liters of water within a short period of time.

The two major advantages of this system are that it can harvest water without the use of electricity and the ability to produce water in desert climates.

5. Crop engineering

We can build new mechanisms outside of the plants to keep them watered and safe from drought, but we could also genetically engineer them to be resilient to conditions where the water content in the soil is very low.

Food production is a crucial part of keeping the population alive. However, droughts can affect the productivity and tip the balance of food available to the masses.

Crop engineering hopes to tweak the genetics of existing crops to help them increase their yield and provide them with better resistance to drought.

A research project from Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE) has successfully improved corps in the way they use water, up to 25% more efficiently.

Researches have been done by various organizations around the world in efforts to engineer crops that can withstand the harshness of droughts.

6. Solar pumps

The most common method that we use to water crops or provide water to livestock is by pumping it out of the earth. However, pumps do consume electricity, which in turn, consumes more fossil fuels.

Advertisement

Solar pumps are gaining popularity because they do not use up electricity from the mains to pump water for irrigation. The governments around the world are realizing the potential of solar pumps and some have even started granting subsidies for farmers to install them cost-effectively.

7. Recycling organic waste

One of the best ways to improve water retention capabilities of soil is to add organic matter into it. Organic material has been found to increase the water retention capabilities of the soil.

Nowadays, many farmers use organic wastes from supermarkets to mix with the soil so that the crops can thrive in it without needing frequent water. As the temperatures rise, the soil starts to lose its water faster and this is a viable way to reduce organic wastes from shops and markets and also improve crop yields.

8. Planting more trees

This might sound like old-age advice, but planting tree is the best way to reduce damage from drought, improve the quality of the environment and increase the success of precipitation.

Many countries have started their efforts by turning arid lands into forested by planting trees and saplings.

26,26,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought in other habitats makes greater flamingos stay longer at Okhla sanctuary - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/drought-in-other-habitats-makes-greater-flamingos-stay-longer-at-okhla-sanctuary/story-5oCJhGDwLB65S1s6iowIWL.html,"The waters of the Okhla Bird Sanctuary have taken on a blush of colour, one that has been lingering longer than usual, with the greater flamingos deciding to stay put, the longest they have done so in the sanctuary so far.

The flamboyance of flamingos, from Kutch and Rajasthan, started reaching the Okhla sanctuary from November onwards for roosting and feeding. Their white plumage have taken on a near-perfect pink sheen — a sign that they have been getting good feed— rich algae and phytoplankton.

The reason for their prolonged stay, according to foresters and ornithologists, is the lack of water and drought-like situation at their alternative sites, in Rajasthan and elsewhere across the NCR, where the Greater flamingos species often roosts annually.

Currently, the shallow southeastern and the mid-yamuna region of the sanctuary are home to the flamboyance of about 150 to 200 greater flamingos, offering a breathtaking view of the blush pink birds against the blue-grey water this far out in June.

According to forest officials, the last such sighting was in May 2016-17, which came after the drought of 2015-16.

“This year, as lots of places such as Rajasthan have no water, the flamingos, which often search for shallow water where they can wade, couldn’t find places to roost. Okhla is one of the few options left for them in the region,” Neeta Shah, principal scientist, and flamingo expert at Bombay Natural History Society, told HT.

She said the salinity in the water of river Yamuna due to the pollution and the temporary influx of fresh water could have created the right conditions for algae and planktons to grow, and these are what flamingos feed on.

Greater flamingos are native to the Indian subcontinent, Africa and Sri Lanka, and adapt well to the higher temperatures in these regions.

The distinguishing feature of the greater flamingos is the pinkish-white plumage. Their wing coverts are mostly red, while the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. Forest officials said the birds have a pink bill with a black tip, and legs that are entirely pink. Their call is called a murmur, a bit like the honk of a goose.

According to the experts, after feeding in the shallow waters, they head back for breeding to Kutch in Gujarat, while a few make a beeline to Sambhar Lake in Rajasthan, and others to South Africa and Sri Lanka.

“Their major breeding ground is Kutch, like Vachharaj Bet in Little Rann of Kutch and Hanjado Bet in Great Rann of Kutch. They migrate elsewhere temporarily for food. Most of the northern region receive the birds that breed in Kutch and Rajasthan. The coastal areas and habitats such as Sewri in Maharashtra receive flocks from South Africa while Point Calimer in Tamil Nadu gets migrants from Sri Lanka,” Ashish Prashad, senior researcher and a flamingo expert at Wildlife Institute of India, said.

Known for nesting on mudflats (which are surrounded by water and also act as the first line of defence against predators) the greater flamingos breed from around June-end to August-end and lay eggs around October.

“If the region gets a good rain during monsoon, the greater flamingos also breed twice a year,” Shah said.

Experts pointed out that the pink plumage of the flamingoes, which appears after a good feed of algae, later helps the male attract females for breeding.

The species, except the birds with chicks, migrate to temporary habitats from November

“The greater flamingos have turned up in good numbers. It has been two years since we saw them in Okhla in such great numbers. Last year, the flamingos had given the sanctuary a miss,” Pramod Kumar Srivastava, divisional forest officer, said.

There are several hot spots of flamingos in India, with around six wetlands in the NCR that attract the greater flamingos to roost, experts said. However, of those six wetlands, it’s only the Okhla Bird Sanctuary and the Najafgarh Jheel where the birds are still being sighted.

“They are filter feeders. They stand in the shallow waters, dip their heads in the water and rake up the soil and then hold up their heads to filter their food by seeping out the waste through their beaks. So the richness of food is one factor for why they are staying put in Okhla,” Rahul Kaul of Wildlife Trust of India said. He added that not all flamingos breed, and given the present scenario, some juveniles might stay back even longer.

According to experts, it is, however, not a reason to rejoice as their prolonged stay also indicates that the wetlands elsewhere are in a bad shape.

“I would call this aberrant behaviour and not something to rejoice about, because by this time, they should be gone. But they are staying back and that indicates that other wetlands are in a poor shape or are being encroached upon as is the case with Basai near Gurugram,” eminent birdwatcher Bikram Grewal said.

Speaking of their local habitats, conservationist Ananda Banerjee also raised concerns over the lack of study on the local habitats of the flamingos and the algae, despite there being a healthy presence of both in the region.

“Okhla and Najafgarh are temporary microhabitats of the flamingos. They don’t breed here but migrate from one habitat to another to roost. But in case there is not enough water, they will naturally go where they can. However, there are no studies on the quality of algae which may affect these birds and their numbers in the long run,” Banerjee said.

According to bird expert Anand Arya, some of the prime habitats of greater flamingos are Okhla, Najafgarh, Dhanauri, Sultanpur, Jhajjhar, and Basai. However, sighting happens majorly in Okhla and Najafgarh.

“The Dadri wetland has been destroyed and the last sighting there was in 2009,” Arya, who lives in Noida, said.","Sun, 09 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/06/09/Pictures/okhla-bird-sanctuary-greater-flamingo_ddbbfc84-8a97-11e9-9370-840d0e5b15b9.jpg,"['makes', 'greater', 'sanctuary', 'rajasthan', 'water', 'okhla', 'drought', 'stay', 'longer', 'habitats', 'flamingos', 'kutch', 'pink', 'birds']",

Today, the same farmers say nothing has changed. The onslaught of this year's dry season has brought about new threats amid what they described as ""government inaction.""

The Department of Agriculture estimates the total damage to agricultural produce this year has already reached about US$8.78 million. The amount translates to about 23,000 metric tons of production loss, affecting more than 16,000 farmers and fisher folk.

In provincial capital Kidapawan, almost crops worth almost US$1 million have already been damaged, according to farmers' group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas.

The dire conditions farmers are facing now bring to mind the days and months leading to the march that ended in the shooting tragedy on April 1, 2016.

""I cannot remember the details, but I can always remember how I dodged bullets and evaded the arrest teams,"" said Win Sulang.

In the aftermath, then Davao mayor Rodrigo Duterte was quick to tell then president Benigno Aquino that hungry farmers do not deserve to be shot.

Almost three years under President Duterte, farmers continue to endure the same ineptness. Sulang says the people's calls for help have seemingly fallen on deaf ears just like before.

The Philippines is no stranger to the El Nino phenomenon and about a dozen droughts have hit the area in the past 50 or so years. But the country's leaders are almost always caught off guard.

Sulang's source of income has already been affected. His rubber trees are drying up. He earns about US$60 a month, compared to more than double that in the past.

""We sell the latex for about US$0.40 per kilogram, but the price of rice has soared to about US$1 per kilogram. How do you expect us to eat decently?"" he said.

The vegetable patch in his backyard has already turned brown because of the heat.

It does not help that the likes of Sulang continue to endure centuries-old problems, such as a lopsided work scheme with landowners that gives farmhands only a third of the produce.

""We have been collectively struggling for a more equitable share. We want at least 50 percent,"" said the farmer.

Sulang said children suffer the brunt of dry spells and the poverty they bring. ""My eldest son does not want to attend school anymore because he said he does not want to be a burden on the family,"" he said.

He hopes the government will heed farmers' demands instead of dismissing them outright by tagging protesters as communist rebels.

28,28,Drought Sri Lanka,More than 13 million people internally displaced across Asia in 2018 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/more-13-million-people-internally-displaced-across-asia-2018,"10 May 2019, Geneva - Tropical storms, monsoon floods, conflict and violence displaced 13.4 million people across South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific last year, according to a new report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).

The Global Report on Internal Displacement reveals that 9.6 million new displacements were recorded in East Asia and the Pacific, and 3.8 million in South Asia, an overall increase compared with 2017.

“It is the same countries affected year after year and, while the relative impacts and resilience to respond varies hugely across the region, over time resources and coping mechanisms are being eroded. We must invest more heavily in strategies that reduce people’s exposure and vulnerability to the risks that cause internal displacement, said Alexandra Bilak, IDMC’s director.

East Asia and the Pacific was a disaster hotspot as in previous years, generating more internal displacement associated with natural hazards than any other region. The Philippines and China recorded 7.6 million new displacements between them, mostly pre-emptive evacuations as typhoons approached.

Geophysical events such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions accounted for most of the new displacement in Indonesia, and monsoon rains and flooding displaced hundreds of thousands more in Myanmar. Japan was struck by an unusually high number of disasters from storms to landslides, and small island states in the Pacific were also affected by geophysical activity and floods.

Conflict and other forms of violence triggered new displacement in the region on a much smaller scale, mostly in the Philippine region of Mindanao and Myanmar’s Kachin and northern Shan states.

In South Asia, India recorded around 2.8 million new displacements, among the highest figures in the world. Monsoon floods, particularly in the south-western state of Kerala, and cyclones were responsible for the majority. Conflict and communal violence also triggered around 170,000 new displacements. The monsoon season also brought significant flooding to both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Drought triggered 371,000 new displacements in Afghanistan, a similar number to those associated with the country’s ongoing conflict. Intercommunal violence in Pakistan also triggered a similar number of new displacements to localised floods.

Internal displacement is an increasingly urban phenomenon. Conflict, climate shocks and large-scale development projects often drive people from rural to urban areas. Dhaka, for example, is the preferred destination for many IDPs fleeing climate change impacts in coastal regions of Bangladesh. Displacement can also originate in cities, as was the case in Marawi in the Philippines, where intense urban warfare was waged by ISIL affiliates in 2017. A year later, reconstruction has begun but around 65,000 people remained displaced as of the end of 2018.

Rapid urbanisation has increased displacement risk. Cities in East Asia and Pacific are expanding in areas highly exposed to hazards, such as the tropical cyclone belt and the Pacific Ring of Fire. Nor does urbanisation in South Asia equate with development gains, exposing already vulnerable people to the risk of secondary displacement in the form of evictions.

“The fact that cities have become sanctuary to more and more internally displaced people represents a challenge for municipal authorities, but also an opportunity. Leveraging the positive role that local government can play in finding solutions to displacement will be key to addressing this challenge in the future,” said Alexandra Bilak.

29,29,Drought Sri Lanka,Why NTJ Sri Lanka allegedly attacked Christians and churches - Quartz,https://qz.com/india/1601189/why-ntj-sri-lanka-allegedly-attacked-christians-and-churches/,"Over 200 people including several Americans were killed in several coordinated bomb attacks on churches on hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter.

Several Christian communities spread across the island nation were targeted in the attack: Suicide bombers detonated one set of bombs at churches in the cities of Colombo and Negombo on the western coast, home to many Sinhalese-speaking Catholics. Another was detonated in a Protestant church 200 miles away—in Batticaloa, a city in the Tamil majority eastern side of the island.

As a Catholic religious studies researcher and professor, I lived in Sri Lanka in the fall of 2013 and did research on Catholicism in both the southwest and northern parts of the country. Approximately, 7% of Sri Lanka’s 21 million are Christian. The majority of them are Roman Catholic.

Sri Lanka’s Christians have a long history that reflects the dynamics of colonialism as well as present-day ethnic and religious tensions.

Entry of Catholicism

It was Portuguese colonialism that opened the door for Roman Catholicism into the island nation.

In 1505, the Portuguese came to Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then called, in a trade agreement with King Vira Parakramabahu VII and later intervened in succession struggles in local kingdoms. Among those converted included Don Juan Dharmapala, the king of Kotte, a small kingdom near present-day Colombo on Sri Lanka’s southwestern coast.

Later, when the Dutch and the Dutch East India Company displaced the Portuguese, Roman Catholicism was revived through the efforts of St. Joseph Vaz.

Vaz was a priest from Goa, Portugal’s colony in India, and arrived in Sri Lanka in 1687. Popular folklore credits Vaz with a number of miracles, such as bringing rain during a drought and taming a rogue elephant. Pope Francis made Joseph Vaz a saint in 2015.

By 1948, when Sri Lanka gained independence from Great Britain, Catholics had established a distinct identity. For example, Catholics would display the papal flag along with Sri Lanka’s national flag during independence day celebrations.

But tensions rose in 1960 when the Sri Lankan government compromised the Catholic Church’s independence by taking over church schools.

In 1962, there was an attempted coup by Catholic and Protestant Sri Lankan army officers to overthrow the government of then prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, allegedly in response to increased Buddhist presence in the military.

Ethnic and religious divides

The 25-year-long Sri Lankan Civil War, starting in 1983, divided the Catholic community.

The war was fought against the government by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or LTTE, who sought a separate state for Sri Lanka’s Tamil community in the northern and eastern parts of the island.

The rebels included Catholics in military positions. But, the Sri Lankan army also had Christian members holding leadership ranks.

Catholic bishops from Tamil and Sinhalese areas could not develop a coherent response to the conflict. They would not even agree on recommending a ceasefire during the Christmas season.

Recent years have seen the rise of militant forms of Buddhism in Sri Lanka and Christians have been among its targets. For example, the ultra-nationalist Buddhist organization, the Bodu Bala Sena (also known as Buddhist Power Force) demanded that Pope Francis apologize for the “atrocities” committed by colonial powers.

While being Catholic and being Sri Lankan are not considered to be contradictions, Catholicism in Sri Lanka still struggles with its colonial past.

Part of global Catholicism

At the same time, Catholicism has a strong cultural presence in the country.

For example, in the North, there is a large pilgrimage site, Madhu, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which Pope Francis visited in 2015.

There is also an internationally known healing and prayer center, Kudagama, northwest of the Buddhist holy city of Kandy.

Sri Lankan Catholics have also become prominent in global Catholicism. The cardinal archbishop of the capital Colombo, Malcolm Ranjith, was mentioned as papabile, or candidate for pope, prior to the conclave that eventually elected Pope Francis.

Protestants of Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka’s Protestant community is quite small, constituting only 1% of Sri Lanka’s population. Like Catholicism, it was through colonialism that Protestant Christianity gained a foothold on the island. With Dutch traders and governmental officers came Calvinism and Protestant missionaries who worked in Sri Lanka’s coastal areas.

While Calvinist Protestantism declined under British colonial rule, there was a revival in the Tamil-speaking northern areas of the island. The American Ceylon Mission began in 1813 and established a number of medical dispensaries and schools. Jaffna College, opened in 1872, remains an important Protestant educational institution that still has ties to America.

AP Photo/Chamila Karunarathne St. Sebastian’s Church, the site of a blast, in Negombo.

The churches in Negombo, where I did research work and where one of the attacks took place, are beautiful Renaissance and Baroque-style structures that are centers of activity throughout the day. Not only are there daily masses, but Catholics often come to light candles and pray to the saints. During worship ceremonies, women wear veils as was the Catholic tradition in the West until the mid-20th century.

Shrines to the Virgin Mary are a common sight on Negombo’s roads along with arches decorated with coconuts, which are the usual markers of a parish festival and procession. In honor of this Catholic culture, Negombo is popularly called “Little Rome.”

But now this “Little Rome”—with its beautiful churches, beaches, and lagoon—will also be known as the site of a horrific act of anti-Christian violence.

After Sri Lanka had Australia wobbling a 28-3 inside Friday's first hour, Burns and Head hit centuries in a record-breaking 308-run fourth-wicket stand in the second test - the first to be played at Manuka Oval.

Burns went to stumps unbeaten on 172, becoming the first Australian opener to bat through the first day of a test in more than two years.

Kurtis Patterson is with him on 25, but only after Head had compiled a stylish 161 including a run-scoring spree after tea of 63 runs from 50 balls.

Batting together for the first time in a test, the pair took few risks early but punished anything loose from a Sri Lankan attack, missing their three quicks from the Gabba through injury.

MARK KOLBE/GETTY IMAGES Travis Head celebrates his maiden test century for Australia during day one of the second test against Sri Lanka in Canberra.

Burns was particularly strong off the back foot, pulling all three of their replacement quicks for boundaries through mid-wicket after getting off the mark with two cover drives for four.

He brought up his fourth test century with a drop-and-run off Kasun Rajitha, taking a load of pressure off Australia's otherwise barren top order in the process.

The Queenslander has put forward the strongest case possible for a ticket to the Ashes in August, when he might push to open with David Warner or bat in the middle order like he had done on debut.

Head looks a certainty to be there, with his maiden hundred coming after three half-centuries earlier this summer.

He again cut extremely well - with eight of his 21 boundaries coming through the point region - while he brought up his century when he danced down the wicket to Dilruwan Perera and whacked him to the boundary.

RYAN PIERSE/GETTY IMAGES Joe Burns, left, embraces Travis Head who had just reached his maiden test century against Sri Lanka.

His downfall eventually came when he was trapped lbw to Vishwa Fernando (3-99), but not before he and Burns had combined for the team's highest partnership against Sri Lanka in Australia.

Sri Lanka were also their own worst enemies, dropping Burns and Patterson once each and Head twice - all from relatively simple chances at test level.

But still, the pair's runs came after Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne and the out-of-form Usman Khawaja failed to impress in their last tests before the Ashes.

Harris was out for 11 when he drove Fernando to point, Khawaja for a third-ball duck when his feet failed to move edging the same bowler, before Labuschagne nicked off to debutant Chamika Karunaratne for six.","Fri, 01 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/t/o/q/y/g/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1tor4i.png/1549006407797.jpg,"['australian', 'head', 'end', 'century', 'sri', 'lanka', 'maiden', 'drought', 'travis', 'day', 'test', 'australia', 'burns', 'joe']",

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.

On our radar

Ethiopian PM in Sudan mediation effort

On Friday, Abiy Ahmed began mediation talks in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, aimed at restarting negotiations between Sudan’s military rulers and the opposition. The urgent efforts of Ethiopia’s young reformist prime minister follow the worst violence since the ouster of former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir two months ago. At least 100 people were reported to have been killed on Monday when members of the Rapid Support Forces – linked to the notorious Janjaweed militia – attacked a Khartoum protest. The protestors want immediate civilian-led rule and for militias to hand over their weapons to the army. One man holding the keys to the negotiations is Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemeti"" Dagolo, an ex-Janjaweed commander and the No. 2 in the ruling military junta. Dagalo, a former al-Bashir ally whose forces are accused of war crimes in Darfur, has been the lead in recent negotiations with Western diplomats.

Bad numbers in Libya

It has been two months since fighting began around Libya’s capital of Tripoli. The numbers speak for themselves: more than 90,000 people have fled their homes, 100,000 civilians are said to still be near conflict zones (41 have been reported killed, with another 116 injured since 4 April). On Monday, almost 100 people were brought out of Zintan, a Tripoli migrant detention centre where UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, described conditions as “dire.” That brings the number of migrants and refugees held in Tripoli down, but not necessarily in the country as a whole. That’s because people are still trying to escape Libya, only to end up right back where they started. UNHCR says it evacuated or resettled 1,000 people out of the country in all of 2019. Last month alone more than 1,200 people were taken to detention centres by the Libyan Coast Guard after they were rescued or intercepted at sea. Given the horrific conditions documented by aid agencies and here at TNH, these numbers are cause for concern.

Cash injection for Horn drought

A UN fund has released $45 million to combat the effects of drought in parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Announcing the decision, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock said Somalia would get the bulk of the funds, $30 million, after forecasters predicted a failure of the April to June rainy season. Some 2.2 million Somalis are expected to face severe food problems by September. The new allocation is roughly 10 percent of the Central Emergency Response Fund's annual spending. The CERF is a pooled fund whose biggest donors last year were the UK, Germany, and Sweden. The Somalia NGO Consortium warned last month that the donor reaction to new projections on food security and nutrition had been sluggish, with director Nasra Ismail describing it as ""very concerning"" not to see ""strong commitments"". Keep an eye out next week for our Africa drought round-up, looking at southern Africa as well as the Horn.

Mergers and acquisitions

Are there too many NGOs overlapping and competing with each other? The UK manager at Mercy Corps – one of the BINGOs (Big International NGOs) – thinks so. Simon O’Connell points out that there are 115 international NGOs working in South Sudan, most with separate arrangements for accommodation, transport, and security. Adding to that apparent duplication, coordination between so many players is itself an effort, argued O'Connell in a recent commentary. The recipients of aid, and the public who are asked to fill the collection tin, may find this all less than ideal. ""There are too many organisations duplicating each other’s work and needlessly competing with each other,"" O’Connell wrote. To hear more about his proposals to merge NGOs together, tune in to a discussion hosted at the Overseas Development Institute this Tuesday, 11 June.

Weighing need

Until recently, there was no agreed ranking of the severity of humanitarian need – no fair way to know which place is worst off. To address the “apples and oranges” problem, humanitarian analysts have agreed on a pilot index that combines 31 variables across three ""dimensions"". The Global Crisis Severity Index combines indicators of impact, conditions of affected people, and complexity. That could make for some necessary comparisons: according to this system, Venezuela is more severe than Central African Republic. These measures are a key ingredient in a new service from humanitarian needs analysts ACAPS. Its latest offering adds measures of risk and humanitarian access to the cocktail as part of a new resource called CrisisInSight.

In case you missed it CAMEROON: Hundreds of opposition members are still being held in Cameroon after a government protest crackdown last week. More than 350 people were arrested, including hundreds from the main opposition party. Protests have been mounting against President Paul Biya and his government over the release of opposition leader Maurice Kamto. COLOMBIA: One third of the 6,000 FARC fighters who handed in their weapons as part of a 2016 peace accord have taken up arms again and joined dozens of “dissident” groups operating in the coca-producing regions the FARC once controlled, Reuters reports, citing a confidential military intelligence report. For more, read our recent report on dissident groups in Tumaco. INDIA: Drought in India’s western state of Maharashtra has sent vegetable prices soaring by 50 percent in the last week, according to local media. Farmers also reportedly sowed only one third of their recent crop, while late monsoon rains are raising fears for the upcoming harvest. Several Indian states are facing the worst drought in years, which is having a life-altering impact on land-dependent farmers. MEXICO-US: Mexico agreed to deploy 6,000 National Guard personnel to its southern border with Guatemala to stem the flow of migrants as it seeks to ward off tariffs on Mexican goods threatened by US President Donald Trump. SRI LANKA: A Catholic Pakistani family seeking asylum in Sri Lanka is facing imminent deportation. Amnesty International fears the situation is part of an anti-Muslim backlash that has also hit refugees and asylum seekers following April’s Easter Sunday attacks, which killed more than 250 people. This week, all nine Muslim members of parliament resigned, urging the government to protect civilians from hate crimes. YEMEN: The Yemen Data Project said it recorded 149 civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Saudi Arabia- and UAE-led coalition in May, including 41 deaths and 108 injuries – the highest figures since last October.

Four nights this Ramadan, under the shadow of refugee returns in Lebanon Mariam Al Kotob/TNH

It’s not just in Lebanon that governments are increasingly putting pressure on Syrian refugees to return: it’s happening in Turkey, in Jordan, even in European countries. Journalist Laura Gottesdiener spent this Ramadan in one Lebanese neighbourhood where such pressures are beginning to be felt acutely, especially as the government has announced plans to demolish informal camps that house around 5,000 Syrian families elsewhere in the country. What she found will perhaps surprise many. Yes, there were problems – grumbles over government incompetence, corruption, international aid bureaucracy. But Jabel Beddawi, a community of Lebanese, Syrians, and Palestinians – almost all refugees from war – was thriving despite it all. In turbulent times, particularly for those living far from their homelands, Gottesdiener’s tale is one of hope: “At no other time of the year is the daily resistance – to hatred, austerity, and exile – more evident than over Ramadan: the Muslim holy month that ended this week and during which daily fasting transforms, each night at sunset, into collective feasts.” The illustrations themselves, from Mariam al Kotob, are a feast for the soul. Enjoy.

And finally…

It’s a question close to our hearts here at TNH. A lot of what we cover falls into the neglected crisis category – whether that’s media neglect or actual neglect from governments or the aid community. Every year, the Norwegian Refugee Council publishes a list of the 10 most neglected displacement crises and this year its top three are Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Central African Republic. “Large-scale displacement and soaring humanitarian needs in the English-speaking parts of Cameroon have been met with deafening silence,” its report says. We wouldn’t quibble with any of the suggestions on this list, nor with the NRC’s depressing conclusion: “The level of media attention is not necessarily proportional to the size of the crisis. Even when the media does report on a conflict, the situation for civilians may be overshadowed by coverage of war strategies, political alliances and fighting between armed groups.” Click on the countries above for our latest reporting, or here for own list of 10 humanitarian crises and trends to watch in 2019.

33,33,Drought Sri Lanka,"Drought is not just about water. It affects air pollution, too - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/04/drought-not-just-about-water-it-affects-air-pollution-too,"Drought is not just about water. It affects air pollution, too

The severe drought that struck California from 2011 to 2015 had an obvious impact on rivers, forests, and wildlife. Now, a new study shows it also had some surprising effects on the state’s notorious air pollution, adding new wrinkles to the state’s efforts to clear the skies.

Researchers have long known that plants can both help create and cleanse one dangerous air pollutant: ground-level ozone, which causes breathing problems and exacerbates lung damage. Plants can scrub ozone from the air by absorbing the pollutant through their stomata, or pores. But certain plants also emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that react with other atmospheric chemicals to create ozone.

Understanding how drought influences these two processes can be tricky. Dry conditions could cause ozone levels to rise, because plants shrink their stomata to prevent water loss, reducing their ability to remove pollution. But drought might also reduce ozone levels, because the stress could cause plants to produce fewer ozone-forming VOCs.

California’s lengthy drought, and the state’s extensive network of air pollution sensors, gave researchers a rare opportunity to see what happens in the real world. The team, led by atmospheric chemistry Ph.D. candidate Angelique Demetillo and environmental science professor Sally Pusede at the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, examined more than a decade’s worth of satellite and sensor data that documented atmospheric conditions over Bakersfield and Fresno, two California cities that suffer from ozone pollution.

The drought’s impact on air quality changed over time, the researchers report this week in Environmental Science & Technology . Plants did remove less ozone, with absorption dropping by about 15% during the most severe years of the drought. But during the early years of the drought, trees and other plants were able to maintain their production of one key ozone-forming VOC, isoprene. The chemical helps plants like oak trees withstand heat stress, and it appears the trees draw on carbon stores to sustain isoprene production. “It’s like a person exercising; when you’ve burned through your recent consumption the body switches over and starts burning fat,” says Manuel Lerdau, an organismal ecologist at UVA and a co-author of the study.

After about 4 years of drought, however, the stress took its toll. In 2013, plant isoprene levels fell dramatically, by 65% in Bakersfield and 54% in Fresno. Overall, that meant up to a 20% dip in ozone pollution. And even after the drought ended, isoprene levels didn’t immediately rebound.

The plant VOC reduction might sound like good news for reducing California’s smog. But the complexity of atmospheric chemistry means droughts could actually complicate clean air efforts. That’s because, currently, regulations mostly focus on controlling nitrogen oxides (NOx) from sources like cars and factories, which react with VOCs to form ozone. When VOC levels are higher, those NOx controls help choke off smog-creating reactions. But reduce the VOCs, and NOx limits go from “being very effective to less effective,” Pusede says.

Such findings offer yet another complication for U.S. states and cities struggling to meet federal clean air standards, especially in drought-prone western states. Regulators have little ability to control VOC emissions from plants, notes Pusede, and “I don’t know if we’d want to even if we could.” But the study could help regulators do a better job of factoring drought into their air pollution models.

The work also “provides a road map for better quantifying these impacts in other places,” says atmospheric scientist Jessica Neu of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who reviewed the paper. And because much of the needed data can now be collected by satellites, she says it opens the door to investigating “drought impacts on air quality globally.”","Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/California%20Drought-1280x720.jpg?itok=UjqPBj84,"['levels', 'affects', 'plants', 'ozone', 'water', 'voc', 'atmospheric', 'drought', 'air', 'states', 'pollution', 'isoprene']", 
34,34,Drought Sri Lanka,Tomato prices go through the roof as drought hits crop - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tomato-prices-go-through-the-roof-as-drought-hits-crop/article26985240.ece,"Vegetable prices have almost doubled

As the vegetable-growing belt around the city reels from a severe drought, the crops have failed and the supply of produce has fallen drastically, pushing the prices of vegetables upwards.

Tomatoes, especially, have turned into a costly commodity and a kilo costs between ₹45 and ₹60, up from ₹24 to ₹30 for a kilo two weeks ago.

“There is no supply of tomatoes in the market and it is down by over 70%,” said a senior procurement official of a reputed retail chain in the city.

Drought in A.P.

The drought in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh as well has further aggravated the market situation.

G.R. Srinivasan, director, HOPCOMS, said that most borewells have dried up and many areas did not receive rain in the recent spell around Ugadi, creating an acute shortage of water.

Papa Reddy, a tomato farmer from Kolar, said most plants had wilted away as temperatures soared and there is a severe shortage of water.

A few farmers have found a way to beat this – water the plants through tankers.

“Most farmers now have dug sumps in the fields in which they store water through tankers – around five tankers per week. Each tanker of 6,000 litres costs ₹600. This has only driven up the input cost manifold, which is reflected in the selling price as well,” he said, adding that he could not sustain buying water through tankers any more and had stopped it two weeks back.

“Tomatoes are a three-month crop and the present crop has failed causing huge losses to farmers. We will sow the next crop in a couple of weeks in time for the onset of monsoon,” he said, indicating that it may be a couple of months before the supply of tomatoes resumes.

Ahead of World Environment Day tomorrow, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is calling for urgent additional support to help people affected and displaced by drought in Somalia.

Below average rains during the “Gu” (April-June 2019) and “Deyr” (October – December 2018) rainy seasons have caused worsening drought in many parts of the country. An estimated 5.4 million people are likely to be food insecure by July.

Some 2.2 million of these will be in severe conditions needing immediate emergency assistance unless aid is urgently scaled up.

The drought has also forced more than 49,000 people to flee their homes since the beginning of the year as they search for food, water, aid and work mostly in urban areas. People who are already displaced because of conflict and violence are also affected by the drought, at times disproportionally.

More than 7,000 people were displaced last month alone.

Three main regions of Somalia - South Central, Puntland and Somaliland – have been affected, despite marginal to average rains and flash flooding in some regions. The worst affected areas include the Sanaag, Sool, Awdal, Bari, Nugaal, Mudug, Galgadud, Hiran regions of the country.

The latest drought comes just as the country was starting to recover from a drought in 2016 to 2017 that led to the displacement inside Somalia of over a million people. Many remain in a protracted state of displacement.

UNHCR and humanitarian partners fear that severe climatic conditions combined with armed conflict and protracted displacement could push the country into a far bigger humanitarian emergency. Decades of climatic shocks and conflict have left more than 2.6 million people internally displaced.

To avert a humanitarian crisis, aid agencies launched a Drought Response Plan on 20 May, appealing for US$710.5 million to provide life-saving assistance to 4.5 million people affected by the drought. To date this is 20 per cent funded.

UNHCR has been working with partners and government agencies to assist those affected and displaced by the drought by providing emergency assistance in some of the most affected areas.

Worldwide, weather-related hazards, including storms, cyclones, floods, droughts, wildfires and landslides displaced 16.1 million people last year alone.

With climate change amplifying the frequency and intensity of sudden disasters, such as hurricanes, floods and tornados, and contributing to more gradual environmental phenomena, such as drought and rising sea levels, it is expected to drive even more displacement in the future.

UNHCR is calling for more international action to prevent climate-related disasters, scale up efforts to strengthen resilience and to protect people affected by climate change using all available legal frameworks.

Between FY 2009 and FY 2018, USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and USAID’s Office of Food for Peace (USAID/FFP) provided humanitarian assistance in response to a diverse range of natural and man-made disasters in the region. Examples include cyclones in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan; earthquakes in India, Nepal, and Pakistan; floods and landslides throughout the region; displacement-related needs in Bangladesh; and complex emergencies in Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

USAID provided more than $2.6 billion to assist disaster-affected populations in South Asia between FY 2009 and FY 2018. USAID/FFP support included nearly $1.8 billion for emergency food assistance and nutrition support in the form of U.S. in-kind food aid, locally and regionally purchased food, cash transfers for food, food vouchers, and related activities. USAID/OFDA assistance included nearly $826.3 million for programs in agriculture and food security; economic recovery and market systems; health, humanitarian coordination and information management; logistics support and relief commodities; nutrition; protection; risk management policy and practice; shelter and settlements; search and rescue; and water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the last decade, USAID responded to 54 disasters in South Asia and deployed humanitarian teams to the region as needed, including four Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs). Recent DARTs in South Asia responded to a magnitude 7.8 earthquake in Nepal in FY 2015 and emergencies in Pakistan, including an earthquake and conflict and related displacement in FY 2009 and flooding in FY 2010.

UN, Asean: Drought in region may intensify

Drought in many parts of Southeast Asia may become even more frequent and intense if action is not taken now to build resilience, according to the latest joint study by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Escap) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) released on Wednesday.

Escap released the study titled Ready for the Dry Years: Building Resilience to Drought in South-East Asia during the 34th Meeting of the Asean Committee on Disaster Management.

It offers clear analysis on the principal risks in the region and was released against the backdrop of the ongoing drought in almost all countries in Southeast Asia, with social and economic impacts already being felt strongly in Cambodia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

As reported by the study, the cumulative impacts of drought in the region strike hardest at the poor and heighten inequality, as well as degrade land and increase the prospect of violent conflict.

Droughts can also be particularly damaging in countries where many people rely on agriculture for primary employment.

Currently 61 per cent of people in Lao PDR, 41 per cent in Vietnam, 31 per cent in Indonesia, 27 per cent in Cambodia and 26 per cent in the Philippines live under these circumstances.

Over the past 30 years, droughts have affected over 66 million people in the region.

However, due to their slow onset, droughts are often under-reported and under-monitored, resulting in conservative estimates on their impact in the region.

The study points out that the future could be even worse. With climate change, many more areas are likely to experience extreme conditions with severe consequences.

“More dry years are inevitable, but more suffering is not. Timely interventions now can reduce the impacts of drought, protect the poorest communities and foster more harmonious societies,” said UN under-secretary-general and executive secretary of Escap Armida Alisjahbana.

The report proposes three priority areas of intervention for Escap and Asean. These include strengthening drought risk assessment and early warning services, fostering risk financing instruments that can insure communities against slow onset droughts, and lastly enhancing people’s capacities to adapt to drought.

National Committee for Disaster Management spokesman Keo Vy said that drought has always impacted

Cambodia, including in terms of water shortages, agricultural production and the health of citizens.

He added that government measures to help ease the impact of drought have focused on building irrigation systems, reservoirs and dams to retain water in times of need.

Hean Vanhorn, Secretary of State for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said drought has hit Cambodia’s agricultural sector hard in recent years, pushing the government to promote the use of drought resistant seeds for farmers.

“For rice seeds or crop seeds, we make them endure areas that frequently face drought, and for areas facing flooding, we choose any seeds that can endure flooding for a long time such as those that take one week before they are damaged.

“There is another seed that can endure up to two weeks before being damaged which we are studying,” he said.

Drought continues to prove a major problem in the Kingdom as the country suffered the ill effects of an unusually hot and dry period in the first four months of this year as a result of the El Nino weather phenomenon.

In February, local communities in rural areas across the Kingdom expressed grave concerns over the severe lack of water for their daily consumption amid a prolonged drought that caused streams, creeks, lakes and ponds to gradually dry up.

Low water levels in reservoirs have also resulted in electricity shortages hitting the country, leading to widespread blackouts.","Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/shortage-of-water.jpg,"['dry', 'study', 'asean', 'seeds', 'southeast', 'water', 'cent', 'asia', 'region', 'drought', 'intensify', 'areas']", 
41,41,Drought Sri Lanka,Lanka end three-year drought with first bilateral series win - Ceylon Daily News,https://www.dailynews.lk/2019/05/22/sports/186250/lanka-end-three-year-drought-first-bilateral-series-win,"EDINBURGH, Tuesday – Dimuth Karunaratne made a winning debut as ODI captain when Sri Lanka beat Scotland by 35 runs on the Duckworth/Lewis rule to win the second ODI played at the Grange here on Tuesday.

Scotland chasing Sri Lanka’s total of 322-8 were 132-3 after 27 overs when the rain came down and reduced the contest.

When play resumed Scotland’s target was reset to 235 off 34 overs and they required a further 103 off 7 overs. It was a tall task and no doubt they failed in their valiant effort.

Paceman Nuwan Pradeep dashed whatever hopes Scotland they had in mind of chasing down the target by snapping up two wickets in the 32nd over including that of top scorer left-hander George Munsey for 61 off 42 balls as Scotland gradually fell away in their brave run chase.

They eventually dismissed for 199 in the final over to hand to Sri Lanka their first bilateral series win since June 2016.

With the first ODI being washed out without a ball bowled Sri Lanka took the two-match series 1-0. The win also broke a losing sequence of eight straight defeats.

Dimuth Karunaratne on his ODI captaincy debut led a top order batting charge as Sri Lanka piled up an impressive 322 for eight wickets after being invited to bat first by Scotland.

Sri Lanka, of course, capitalized largely on poor Scottish catching to post this total.

Making capital of these lapses openers Karunaratne and Avishka Fernando posted a 123-run partnership which laid the base for the final total although lost their way somewhat in the middle order losing five wickets for 54 before a late revival saw Sri Lanka add 99 off their last 10 overs, including 35 off their last 12 balls, to compensate for the earlier stumble.

Karunaratne top scored with 77 off 88 balls and it was one of three half-centuries in the innings for Sri Lanka as his opening partner Avishka Fernando struck his maiden ODI fifty – 74 off 78 balls (5 fours, 3 sixes).

Both men were spilled during Brad Wheal’s opening spell, Karunaratne at first slip by George Munsey on 13 in the seventh over, and Avishka on 22 at mid-off by Alasdair Evans in the ninth.

Karunaratne received a third life in the 21st over as well, on 36, when Calum MacLeod couldn’t hang on to a sharp chance at midwicket off the bowling of left-arm spinner Mark Watt. It took the intervention of off-spinning all-rounder Michael Leask to break the stand, striking with his first ball after being introduced in the 23rd over to induce a loose flick to Munsey at deep square leg by Avishka for 74.

Karunaratne continued to drive Sri Lanka forward, raising his 50 off 65 balls with a reverse paddle sweep for four off Watt in the 26th. After 33 overs, he was on 77 and constructing another ominous stand with Kusal Mendis, as Sri Lanka looked certain to sprint past 300 with their score on 203 for 1.

But the reintroduction of Wheal in the 34th put the brakes on their innings. Karunaratne fell, skying a pull to substitute fielder Gavin Main at mid-on. The decision to promote Thisara Perera to No. 4 with a terrific platform and a free license to swing big backfired spectacularly, as a cross-batted swipe at a back of a length ball angled across by Wheal resulted in an edge behind for a golden duck.

Tom Sole made it 3 for 6 in the space of 20 balls when Angelo Mathews charged the offspinner and heaved a catch to Leask at long-on to make it 210 for 4. Kusal focused on stabilising the innings through the 40th over before getting back into attack mode, heaving a six over long-on in an 11-run over. He eventually made 66.

Lahiru Thirimanne made 44 off 40 balls and with Suranga Lakmal playing a cameo knock of 12 off 4 balls (1 six, 1 four) Sri Lanka posted a challenging total.","Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/styles/node-detail/public/news/2019/05/22/z_p12-dimuth.jpg?itok=rKg31iGh,"['series', 'avishka', 'total', 'end', 'balls', 'overs', 'threeyear', 'lanka', 'sri', 'odi', 'karunaratne', 'drought', 'bilateral', 'win', 'wickets']",

With Centre’s financial aid for drought mitigation to take more time, the Cabinet on Tuesday increased the limit of the State contingency fund from ₹150 crore by an additional ₹2,000 crore.

The decision would ensure that the money can now be released immediately to farmers without waiting for approval or preparing the proposal for its disbursement.

Additional 4,000 crore

Two weeks ago, the State government had announced that it would release ₹2,900 crore from its treasury to extend immediate assistance to farmers. With the Union government announcing a ₹4,714 crore financial package for Maharashtra, the State later announced that it will pay an additional ₹4,000 crore from its treasury, which will later be reimbursed after arrival of Centre’s aid.

Initially, the contingency fund limit was ₹50 crore, which was increased to ₹150 crore and now stands at ₹2,150 crore.

The money from this fund can be released immediately without waiting for any approval and at the discretion of the Chief Minister.

Ready money

An official from the Relief and Rehabilitation department said, “The Centre’s aid may take more time to arrive and with winter season coming to an end, demand for funds would increase in the coming time. We want to keep the money ready to be disbursed immediately and therefore the limit has been increased.”

The government had said that the Centre’s package would be used for 151 tehsils that had been declared drought-prone first.

Later, drought was declared in 318 revenue circles (each with 15-20 villages) and another 931 villages.

As per the government estimate, 82.27 lakh farmers and 85.76 hectares were hit by drought.

The government, in its proposal to the Centre, had sought ₹7,103 crore as compensation for crop losses, ₹535 crore for fodder supply and ₹323 crore for drinking water supply.","Wed, 13 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['immediately', 'farmers', 'state', 'contingency', 'limit', 'money', 'drought', 'increased', 'fund', 'waiting', 'aid', 'crore', 'centres', 'fight']",

For Nataraja Kumar, 47, a fisherman from Guru Nagar, a sleepy coastal village in Sri Lanka's north, it's no longer possible to continue with his traditional livelihood.

""I went fishing as a 10-year-old boy with my father and grandfather. But I will not train my son to be a fisherman. There's no fish to catch,"" he tells Mongabay.

Fishing is Kumar's only life skill, and he has five mouths to feed. Having failed to eke out a living in the past two years as a fisherman, Kumar is now slowly letting go of his traditional livelihood to work as a day laborer at a construction site in another town, earning around $3 a day to keep food on the table. Many other fishermen, he says, are making the same switch.

""The sea seems to have changed. We find less [fish] and fewer species,"" Kumar says, adding that the northern waters no longer yield the highly popular black tiger prawns, a top seafood export.

It's the same story for those engaged in growing traditional crops, like onion farmer Sudhiran Kanapathipillai, 51, from Jaffna, the capital of Sri Lanka's northern province.

For three consecutive seasons, his crops have failed due to unpredictable weather. ""We cannot rely on wet and dry spells any longer. They just don't happen that way,"" he tells Mongabay. ""Paddy farmers suffer more than us due to their dependence on the monsoon pattern. North was once agriculturally productive. Our soil is good but the weather has failed us.""

The island's north is feeling the heat—literally—with two separate studies highlighting Sri Lanka's increased risk to changing weather patterns that are driving extensive changes in both living standards and livelihoods.

Increasing Climate Risks

A briefing paper titled the Global Climate Risk Index 2019 published by Germanwatch looks at the impacts of weather-related loss events such as storms, floods, and heat waves from 1998 to 2017. It ranked Sri Lanka as the second most impacted territory in 2017.

In 2015, Sri Lanka ranked 98th, but made a swift jump to the second slot two years later after the island suffered extensive losses, both in terms of deaths and property damage, from a series of exceptional catastrophes.

In May of 2017, heavy landslides and floods hit Sri Lanka after strong monsoon rains in the country's southwest. More than 200 people died in the worst rains experienced on the island since 2003. The extreme weather displaced more than 600,000 people and affected 12 out of 25 districts.

The Sri Lankan experience corresponds well to the findings of the Fifth Assessment Report of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts an increase in risks associated with extreme weather events as global mean temperatures rise, also linking global warming to El Niño events.

Smart Agriculture and Alternate Livelihoods

On the ground, communities are now being asked to deal with the reality, not as individuals but as entire communities.

S. Sivakumar, director of the department of agriculture at the Northern Provincial Council, says these are among the ""hot"" issues faced by the provincial administration.

""As weather turns extremely unpredictable and extreme weather events are causing repeated crop failure in a region that was battered by nearly three decades of war, it is a fight against poverty, which requires a new approach toward ensuring food security and livelihoods,"" he told Mongabay.

Sivakumar says that the inadequacy and unpredictability of rainfall, coupled with prolonged spells of drought, are affecting traditional livelihoods such as fishing and agriculture. ""We recommend smart agriculture and the reintroduction of ancient systems such as the water cascading system Sri Lanka was once known for,"" he said.

""Through pilot projects on ‘climate smart integrated agriculture' in the three northern districts of Jaffna, Vavuniya and Kilinochchi, we promote solutions to overcome impacts of climate change.""

But it's not that easy for a region that was once a hotbed of ethnic violence to make that journey toward normalcy while battling against weather events that pose a new challenge.

The challenge before Sri Lanka, and the island's north in particular, is well documented in a September of 2018 World Bank Group study that looked into South Asia's climate profiles, analyzing how temperatures have risen considerably and will continue to rise, with precipitation patterns becoming less predictable.

""Sri Lanka's proximity to the ocean makes it vulnerable to increase in extreme tropical storms and sea level rise,"" the study says. It says the country also contains ""hidden hotspots,"" areas that are economically at risk from climate change that are not often discussed. It adds that, by 2050, annual average temperatures on the island are projected to increase by about one to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.8 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) under a climate-sensitive scenario, and one to two degrees Celsius (1.8 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) under a carbon-intensive scenario.

The study says Sri Lanka has 19 million people living in locations that would become ""moderate or severe hotspots"" by 2050 under the carbon-intensive scenario, or more than 90 percent of the total population.

And if the projection holds true, Sri Lanka's northern and north western provinces will emerge as the top hotspots.

The island's north, home to a large population of poor and displaced communities, will have to bear the brunt of the vagaries of the weather, adding a new challenge to its long-term recovery, the country snapshot says.

As such, Jaffna will become the top hotspot, followed by Puttlam in north western province, followed by Mannar and Kilinochchi in northern province, making the island's north highly vulnerable.

Likewise, western province is also projected to be highly impacted, with a decline in living standards of about 7.5 to 8 percent, including in Colombo, Sri Lanka's economic hub that contributes over 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

The projections call for drastic changes in traditional livelihoods and for urgent economic adaptation.

With a projected decline in living standards of 1 to 7 percent, it is suggested that non-agricultural jobs will shoot up by 30 percent, marking a huge shift from the agriculture-based rural economy and livelihood patterns.

Adaptation and Mitigation

Measures are being taken to mitigate impact caused by extreme weather events, even as adaptation holds the key, says the director of Sri Lanka's Climate Change Secretariat, R.D.S. Jayathunga.

He told Mongabay the actual problem lay with the increase in the nighttime temperature fluctuations, impacting a multitude of crops and reducing agricultural productivity, making it a main focus of the country's national policy and the adaptation plan to combat climate change impact.

Sri Lanka needs to improve its resilience through targeted programs, he said, identifying future challenges such as agriculture, heat stress, indirect health impacts, and biodiversity loss. ""We need to be ready as a resilient nation,"" Jayathunga said.

While Ramanathapuram has been a perennially drought-hit district, this year, locals say that even water-bodies in the island have virtually gone dry and water levels in the wells hitting a new low.

However, the 22 wells inside the temple complex, considered sacred, continue to be a perennial source of water despite thousands of pilgrims lining past them to have a symbolic dip in each of those wells before offering worship to Lord Shiva, who presents as Ramanatha Swamy and his consort Parvathavarthini Ambal.

How is this phenomenon possible? Traditionalists and astrologers like Nagendran say that the area around the sanctum-sanctorum is imbued with a divine quality as Lord Ram himself worshipped Lord Shiva here, to get rid of his ‘Brahmaharthi Dosha’ for having killed a Brahmin King in Ravanna in Sri Lanka. The Shiva Linga is believed to have been shaped from the seashore mud by Seetha on their return.

This traditional belief apart, what is more empirically significant, even according to Nagendran, is that the water from these wells are still fetched in the centuries-old way of lifting little quantities in buckets tied to ropes. There is an in-built economic usage of water in this method that irrespective of the number of pilgrims who have a dip daily, the wells continue to be replenished at all times, he explained. The moral of the story is: Use less to conserve more water.

A visiting German tourist, Johnshon, was also amazed at this phenomenon of the 22 wells being perennial and their water having a sweet taste. “There is drought all around, yet these wells are brimming with water, it is amazing,” said Johnson. The underlying message is groundwater if used prudently, can be a limitless source.","Mon, 24 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-1ig9ufme8fj03sodnit2o8ips2-20190624012627.Medi.jpeg,"['source', '22', 'wells', 'beating', 'save', 'water', 'perennial', 'shiva', 'sri', 'drought', 'temple', 'say', 'lord']",

(Representational) In what could signal a reversal of change, both are now trading well above their MSP as the ongoing drought takes a toll on production. (Representational)

Like most other agricultural commodities, wholesale prices of jowar (sorghum) and maize for the most part of 2018 were much below their government-mandated Minimum Support Price (MSP). In what could signal a reversal of change, both are now trading well above their MSP as the ongoing drought takes a toll on production. In the case of maize — the third most important cereal in the country — the scarcity has led to calls for relaxation of tariff duty for imports.

Grown extensively across the country, maize is only the third most important cereal after rice and wheat for India. The annual consumption figure is estimated to be 220 lakh tonnes (lt), with poultry (as chicken feed) and starch industry alone cornering 70 per cent of it. India also exports around 7 lt of maize annually to countries such as Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Nepal.

While it is mainly a Kharif crop in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana, growers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh also sow the crop during the rabi season.

For the 2018 Kharif season, Maharashtra reported 8.16 lakh hectares of maize plantation as against the normal 7.36 lakh hectares. Sowing, however, has taken a hit during the rabi season with the state reporting just about 1.15 lakh hectares of maize as against the normal 2.25 lakh hectares.

Across the country, industry estimates talk about an 8-10 per cent dip in availability of maize. Other than the drought, in Maharashtra, the dip in rabi area is also due to the low realisations in wholesale markets, which have weaned many farmers away from the crop.

Correspondingly, wholesale prices of maize have seen a positive move, with the average trade price of Rs 1,723.47 per quintal in the state being above the mandated MSP of Rs 1,700. In fact, this would be the first time prices have crossed the MSP in the last one year. Between September and November, when arrivals peaked due to the new crop, prices were in the range of Rs 1,200-1,300 per quintal. The present upward mobility in prices, industry sources point out, is only to be enjoyed by stockists who have raised inventories during the last few months. All eyes are on the rabi crop of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which is to hit the markets by April.

Rohit Pawar, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pune-based poultry firm Baramati Agro Limited, said the present Rs 2,000 per quintal rate has increased the cost of production for all poultry farmers. “The effects will be soon seen in retail prices of chicken,” he said.

Industry bodies have opened talks with the government given that imports at present would attract a steep duty of 60 per cent. Import of maize is governed by tariff rate quota norms, which require government intervention for easing of duty.

Prasanna Pedgaonkar, the Deputy General Manager of Pune-based poultry firm Venkateshwara Hatcheries Private Limited — popularly known as Venky’s — said the industry had asked for phase-wise import of around 20 lt of corn, but the government is yet to consent to it. “It would be three years since the last imports of maize in the country,” he said.

But with general elections round the corner, chances of imports seem dim given the effect it might have on prices.

Like maize, the reversal in the price trend of jowar has much to do with the dip in sown area reported in Maharashtra. An important millet, especially for rural parts of the state, Maharashtra reports around 30.98 lakh hectares of jowar sowing, 23.79 hectares from rabi season alone. This year, till January 25, the state had reported 12.46 lakh hectares of sowing — an almost 50 per cent dip.

Accounting for around 30 per cent of the national production, Maharashtra is the largest producer of the millet in the country.

In tandem with the dip in sowing, wholesale prices of jowar in the state have started rising. The average traded price of jowar now stands at Rs 2987.05 — a whopping Rs 500 per quintal above the mandated MSP of Rs 2,450 per quintal for maldandi and Rs 2,430 per quintal for hybrid jowar. Prices have risen 14.68 per cent since December, with trade sources talking of a further rise.

Amit Wadikar, a trader operating out of Baramati’s wholesale market, reasoned that the present price hike is mostly to do with the dip in the rabi crop due to drought. “Other than Solapur, Ahmednagar, a similar drop has been reported from neighbouring Karnataka,” he pointed out.

At the Baramati market, prices have been averaging around Rs 3,800 per quintal mark. Prices however were much below the MSP threshold, with the state reporting prices in the range of Rs 2,200- 2,300 per quintal, in the months of September, October. It was only since November, when the effects of drought became clearer, that prices have firmed up.

Besides, jowar and maize are also an important source of green fodder for animals, giving the farmers an extra source of income. With fodder scarcity looming large over the state, the farmer is faced with a double loss. Ankush Padvale, a farmer from Khupsangi in Solapur’s Mangalwedha taluka, lost 5 acres of his rabi jowar due to moisture stress, he says. “There was no water for the corp to grow, my investment was in vain.”

Noting the bull run in the jowar prices, Padvale says it comes at a time when farmers like him have no crop to sell.","Thu, 31 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/12/Foodgrain-l-ie-1-1.jpg,"['maize', 'rs', 'state', 'poultry', 'quintal', 'lakh', 'pushes', 'jowar', 'drought', 'msp', 'prices', 'rabi', 'units', 'losses', 'maharashtra']", 
51,51,Drought Sri Lanka,Repayment and Relief: Addressing microfinance debt in Sri Lanka - Groundviews,https://groundviews.org/2019/04/10/repayment-and-relief-addressing-microfinance-debt-in-sri-lanka/,"Nadaraja Devakrishnan stumbled on the gravity of the microfinance debt issue purely by chance. He was attempting to begin community gardening in a small village, to respond to rising cases of CKDu in the district. On returning to check the progress of cultivation, he found none, as all the people had been physically and monetarily drained trying to pay back their microfinance loans. Through the People’s Movement for Community Awareness, he has been grappling with the predatory practices of microfinance companies on villagers in Vavuniya for the last few years.

“The way the microfinance companies are treating people is as much a violation of human rights as enforced disappearances, or things done to people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act” he says to a group of women who have come together to share their struggles, and to think of ways to respond to agents of these companies, who harass them for repayment.

“In the immediate aftermath of the war, there were about 3 or 4 microfinance companies working in the North, but after the government changed in 2015, there are about 34 operating now, including companies run by prominent politicians.”

Cascading loans and predatory repayment tactics

As of March 28 2019, around 170 people are reported to have taken their own lives after being unable to meet debt repayments. In 2018 alone, 15 people in Vavuniya and 55 people around the Province have taken their own lives as a direct result of this crippling debt, says Devakrishnan. He works with several women whose lives have been altered by these companies, and details the immense pressure placed on them for repayment. “They come and harass the women in the house, ask them to sleep with them, take away possessions from the home, and refuse to leave unless they are given the money.”

*Meenakumari and her husband wanted to build a grinding mill, much like the one he had worked in as a child, to operate as a source of income. After a few years of seeking support from microfinance companies to support this dream, she now has ten loans to her name.

“Berendina, Ceylinco Leasing Company, Vision Fund Lanka, LOLC, Commercial Leasing, Kanrich, MBSL, Nation Lanka and HNB Grameen”, she counts off on her fingers.

Her first loan, for Rs. 50,000, was from Berendina, and she paid a monthly instalment of Rs. 4,800 for one year. In order to complete the next phase of their building, they took a loan of Rs. 100,000, paying Rs. 4,600 weekly. Their current loan, from HNB Grameen, is for Rs. 200,000, with a weekly payment of Rs. 3,900 due. It is this loan that has sent Meenakumari and her husband spiralling into debt.

The grinding mill brings in only a limited income of around Rs. 5,000 a month. The price of goods produced at home is higher than those of mass-produced spices and flour that people can buy at a store. For this reason, they are forced to price their goods lower, and this severely impacts their ability to repay their loans.

They took two more loans to settle the borrowing of Rs. 200,000. However they find the largest chunk of their money goes towards settling what are called ‘metre loans’. These are informal agreements with the credit agent,that requires a daily interest payment. Meenakumari has a total of 7 metre loans that she is now paying off.

*Madhavi is the mother of two young girls. One day, her neighbour left their house to hide, fearing a credit agent who was due to collect a payment. The agent refused to believe Madhavi’s explanation that the person was in hospital, and loitered around the house. Madhavi was then forced to ask some money from the nearby shop and pay the agent on behalf of her neighbour.

Her house now functions as a loan centre for Vision Fund Lanka, set up by the company to operate locally within small villages. From here, they give out and accept applications, take payments and supply information. There is no written acknowledgement however that Madhavi’s house is being used for this purpose. She acts as the loan centre leader, again a role that has no written confirmation. When asked what happens if people borrowing through her centre are unable to repay, she says “the leader has to find the money and pay the agent, somehow”.

Sajee, who acts a centre leader in her village, says that the agents do supply a lot of information to borrowers. They explain forms, interest and repayment to the villagers clearly. While there is a policy that loans need to be income-generating, the agent never checks on this, to account for the strain on the borrower if this is not so.

She lists the documents necessary to obtain a loan. Copies of one’s NIC and for women, a copy of one’s husband’s NIC, a family card, issued by the local grama sevaka, and a note of income and expense. There are some issues with these documents. Family cards are not regularly updated, and might not account for any children born since the time of issuance. Since the income is a self-declaration, and requires no certification, people often increase the value to better their chances of getting a loan, but also distorting the agent’s perception of their ability to repay the loan.

They are required to send all this in an envelope with a Rs. 50 stamp. Also required is a signed copy of a slip, provided by the agent that can be produced in court if they cannot repay the loan. The information is filled in by the agent should the need arise. Alarmingly, the women note that they sign on a blank document when submitting it.

*Shanthini, who has taken loans through the centre Sajee leads, says that the agent does not keep track of individual loans, and the strain placed on them by multiple companies. “Unless we’ve taken loans from a particular agent before, the rest of our loans don’t register on any of the records. Many people do not disclose this to lenders as they apply for new loans either.”

She explains the schemes for loans from Vision Fund Lanka, a subsidiary of World Vision. An education loan of Rs. 15,000 can be paid in December, to prepare for the child’s new year in school. Rs. 150,000, with a monthly interest payment of Rs. 54,000, is the value of a housing loan. Finally, their ‘Saviya’ loans give Rs. 100,000 to individuals wanting to start small businesses in their homes. Monthly payments for each of these loans are Rs. 15,000, Rs. 8,600 and Rs. 7350 respectively.

If an agents thinks that a particular borrower is able to make regular repayments of their loan, they extend their housing loan to as high as Rs. 500,000. However, if a borrower signs on to this extension, they allow the agent to take the deed or permit of their house as collateral for non-repayment.

LOLC has a similar policy, where personal loans of Rs. 500,000 must carry signatures of two guarantors who are government servants, and require house documents as collateral. Lawyer Lakmali Hemachandra, who is working on relief for these women, notes that this is possibly just a tactic of intimidation. “Given that a lot of the land in the North, after release, is state land, residents would only have a permit. Permits cannot be transferred between individuals, so it is unsure what they plan to do when the deed is surrendered, or if they can do anything with the land. It’s probably just to make people more fearful and dependent on their support.”

The women say there are people who have left the country to escape being choked by these loans. Due to the harassment and threats meted out by agents, it falls on others to pay what is left. The prevailing drought has compounded the uncertainty and strain on these individuals and their families – it impacts the gains that could be made from agriculture. Existing employment options are limited, and loans do little to alleviate the burden.

Community and legal relief

Community organisations are doing their best to provide some relief for the people. This begins with debt mediation boards, where a compromise is reached to reduce the loan amount. Prashan, leader of a Rural Development Society, says that he refused loan agents entry into the village one day, so they would not harass people who could not pay that month. In some villages, men have even physically chased away agents, running after them as they attempt to approach the houses of those struggling with repayment.

Attorney-at-Law Radika Gunaratne is representing several women across the North-Central province in courts, as they file cases against predatory microfinance companies. ‘’Cases should ideally be dealt with at the district courts, but police intervene before legal action is even taken, threatening people to pay. They know where to visit them at home because the companies openly share their details with the police’’. Gunaratne says the cost of such a case, if it is eventually taken to court, once again only serves to trap the person with more expenditure on legal fees.

“The people need a two year grace period” Devakrishnan says “no loans taken, no repayments made, just time to revive the economy and make some money.”

Debt relief programmes and their effectiveness

In July 2018, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented a paper in Cabinet that proposed to write off loans less than Rs. 100,000 for communities in the North. In addition, the Central Bank proposed to set a cap of 35% on interest rates on these loans. While hailed for their attempts in addressing a crippling issue, there is some hesitation as to the full impact of these measures.

Ministry of Finance officials noted to Groundviews that the 35% cap is only applicable to those firms in the formal economy, and it is those in the informal economy who are inflating borrowing costs with high interest rates. They claim that a rate cap of below 35% is likely to push the formal players out of the industry, creating more space for the informal sector that charges high interest rates from borrowers.

“In my opinion, the debt relief and regulatory measures are not enough to address the debt problem the women are facing”; economist Niyanthini Kadirgamar has a range of reasons to claim so. This begins with the fact that the interest rate cap comes into effect only if companies sign a voluntary Memorandum Of Understanding. Even if they were to comply with the standards therein, then the 35% interest rate cap is still too high. The companies are raking in profits while these women and their families face hardships. “These loans are obtained by very poor women for small self-employment efforts; there is no way they can earn enough incomes to pay off such high interest rates” Kadirgamar says.

Currently, the Government’s debt relief program targets only those who have defaulted payments for three months. Kadirgamar says that this doesn’t take into account the fact that many women somehow try to pay off the loan, often resorting to extreme measures to do so, such as skipping meals for children, selling their land, or taking another loan. The women pay their monthly dues due to pressure and aggressive collection practices adopted by the companies. “I know of women who have gone into hiding to escape the debt collectors”, Kadirgamar says, stressing that the reality is very different from what these companies tend to advertise about microfinance – ‘poverty alleviation’ and ‘women’s empowerment’ are words that have no depth in the way microfinance is affecting families across the Northern province.

She suggests that an effective strategy would be a complete write-off of all the predatory loans. Poor women should not be made to pay unfair interest on their small loans. The UN expert on foreign debt also highlighted that human rights standards must be upheld with micro-credit lending. A moratorium of at least two years would also be helpful for drought-affected areas, until they are able to revive their livelihoods.

The officials claim that debt write-off is not a sustainable policy, and that these debt relief operations were targeted for women especially vulnerable due to the ongoing drought. Comprehensive legislation that will protect consumers, and regulate the steps that microfinance institutions can take to collect repayments, is necessary, and is presently being drafted.

Provisions for relief in the 2019 Budget

The 2019 Budget proposed the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme as an avenue to relieving these individuals from the debt trap. These concessionary loans are primarily for those engaged in the agricultural sector, with no collateral needed to be eligible for it. While the Ministry states the rates are much less than those offered by a microfinance institution, it is nevertheless offering more loans as a remedy for issues that loans have caused.

The Ministry believes that since these loans are given to invest in revenue generating activities, chances are that in the medium- to long-term, households would be able to create sustainable avenues of income that can be used to pay-off previous debt. However, this assumption must be considered alongside the fact that the North, Eastern and North-Central provinces have accounted for the lowest GDP by province in the years 2016 and 2017. In addition, the agricultural sector accounts for the lowest percentage of economic activity in these three provinces. As discussed above, individuals might take loans for cottage industries or agricultural work that does not always generate a high income, and could once again serve to affect repayment. Whether this strategy as it stands will actually translate into sustainable income for the individuals, given the structures and opportunities currently in place in these regions, will only play out in the years ahead.

The Ministry notes that financial literacy is being accelerated by the Central Bank, to educate possible borrowers on the risks of taking loans from the informal sector. However, there is a long road ahead in ensuring that microfinance becomes a sustainable tool to improve lives of the individuals who take these loans, many of whom constitute the most vulnerable segments of the population. Framed as legislation for consumer protection, the new act could result in more responsible lending practices and also lay out consequences for companies or agents who do not adhere to these. If new loans do not act as a solution to the individuals who have suffered deeply as a result of old ones, then it is necessary for moving toward alternative models – such as cooperative credit schemes, as Kadirgamar suggests – that are developed based on what is most beneficial for the community and individuals who need it most.

Several publications emphasized that Pacific island nations are seen as facing particularly high risks, and highlighted adaptation and policy challenges.

Multilateral and bilateral adaptation finance activities, including for projects seeking to enhance climate resilience and targeting vulnerable communities in other regions, were also announced over the last month. Yet a study released in April by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) shows that the most vulnerable nations are the least likely to be selected as finance recipients by both bilateral and multilateral donors. This Update discusses these developments and challenges to achieving the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Adaptation Fund Supports Climate Vulnerable Communities in Bangladesh

Climate change remains the major challenge faced by many economies. Bangladesh is one of the highly-exposed countries in Asia, threatened by impacts of both slow- and rapid-onset climate-driven disasters, including sea level rise, saline intrusion, cyclones, storm surges, floods, extreme heat and droughts. The Adaptation Fund approved USD 10 million in support of a five-year project in Bangladesh titled, ‘Adaptation Initiative for Climate Vulnerable Offshore Small Island and Riverine Charland in Bangladesh.’ Jointly implemented by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the project supports the country’s national priorities set out in the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan and its Nationally Determined Contributions.

A total of USD 32.5 million was approved by the Fund’s Board in March in Bonn for new projects in Armenia, the Dominican Republic, Bangladesh and Western Balkans to serve Paris Agreement implementation.

ADB Promotes Adaptation Finance in the Asia-Pacific Region

ADB’s Board of Governors addressed the socioeconomic impacts and costs of climate change in the region during its annual meeting, held in Nadi, Fiji, from 1-5 May, where ADB agreed to provide a USD 2 million grant for the Nadi Flood Alleviation Project. Meeting participants examined challenges in the area of disaster recovery, high-cost structures, social service delivery, gender and labor. These were assessed in ADB’s Pacific Economic Monitor, which highlights that Pacific island nations are among the most risk-exposed nations globally, and provides the near-term economic outlook for the Pacific and specific policy challenges, as presented in the Asian Development Outlook 2019. On disaster recovery, the reports note that a significantly higher debt burden than expected was observed, demonstrating the heavy cost of necessary infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and upgrading when grant funds are limited.

The meeting revealed ADB’s standing, showing that the Bank’s lending and grant operations in 2018 grew to a record USD 21.6 billion, compared to USD 13.9 billion in 2013, an increase of 55%. ADB’s report titled, ‘2018 Development Effectiveness Review’ (DEfR), assesses the Bank’s performance and progress in implementing its strategy. The DEfR demonstrates that ADB’s response to climate change and support for gender equality accelerated. The share of ADB operations supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation during the 2016-2018 review period reached 56%, surpassing the 2020 target of 45%. The share of committed sovereign operations supporting gender mainstreaming increased to 52%, exceeding the 2020 target of 50% of overall ADB operations. Achievement of gender equality results also remained above target, with 76% of completed operations successfully delivering their intended results in this priority area.

In spite of targeting groups vulnerable to climate change, multilateral donors do not prioritize the most vulnerable within those groups.

Speaking about implementation of ADB’s Strategy 2030, ADB President Takehiko Nakao said priority will be given to: reducing poverty and inequalities; climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts across the Pacific; accelerating progress in gender equality; as well as support for regional cooperation and integration, and expanding the Bank’s activities in education, health and agribusiness.

Among other activities in April, the ADB:

New and Ongoing Adaptation Support for Farming and Forest Communities in Sri Lanka, El Salvador and Paraguay

In April, the World Bank announced its support of USD 150 million to Sri Lanka for projects aiming to improve the climate resilience and agricultural productivity of small-scale farmers, and support priority infrastructure through public-private partnerships (PPPs). The two supported projects include: a USD 140 ‘Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project’ in the dry zone of the country, including a USD 125 million credit from the International Development Association (IDA), with a USD 10 million contribution from the Government of Sri Lanka and a USD 5 million contribution from the project beneficiaries; and a ‘Framework Development and Infrastructure Financing to Support Public-Private Partnerships Project,’ supported with a USD 25 million loan to mobilize and sustain development investments. The loan has a 20-year maturity, including a nine-year grace period. The project receives USD 2 million counterpart funding.

The Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) signed the funding agreement for the five-year USD 127.7 million ‘RECLIMA Project,’ aimed at building climate resilience in farming systems in El Salvador’s Dry Corridor. The FAO-designed projects aims to strengthen resilience of smallholder farmers by promoting the use of seeds tolerant to drought. It will benefit from USD 35.8 million in funding support, originally approved by the GCF in October 2018. In addition to the GCF grant, the project will receive USD 91.8 million from the Government of El Salvador and the Initiative for the Americas Fund (FIAES).

In Paraguay, vulnerable families, including from indigenous communities, depend on forests for their livelihoods, energy and income. They actively safeguard Paraguay’s forests, and support the government’s efforts in this regard. The GCF and FAO signed the funding agreement for a five-year USD 90 million project titled, ‘Poverty, Reforestation, Energy and Climate Change’ (PROEZA), which will be supported with a USD 25 million grant from the GCF. The Government of Paraguay, which co-finances the project with USD 65 million, will work together with the GCF and FAO to build the climate resilience of local populations through investments for low-emission development. The GCF approved the project in March 2018.

SEI Study: Most Climate Vulnerable Countries Are Unable to Access Finance Proportionate to Level of Need

A study by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) titled, ‘Climate Change Adaptation Finance: Are the Most Vulnerable Nations Prioritized?’ warns that “the allocation of adaptation finance is not consistently aligned with the sentiment of the Paris Agreement.” The findings demonstrate that:

The most vulnerable nations are the least likely to be selected as finance recipients by both bilateral and multilateral donors;

Multilateral donors are found to allocate more adaptation finance to SIDS, yet they are not observed to prioritize vulnerable nations in the selection stage;

Multilateral donors are less orientated towards recipient need than their bilateral counterparts; and

Countries that are most vulnerable to climate change receive smaller allocations of adaptation finance from bilateral donors than their less vulnerable counterparts.

The paper finds that bilateral donors allocate more adaptation finance to recipients with: a higher level of need, determined by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita; more strategic importance, for example with whom they share a larger amount of bilateral trade; and higher levels of good governance, where aid is presumed to be more effective. Multilateral donors, the authors note, prioritize well-governed nations. In spite of targeting groups vulnerable to climate change, multilateral donors do not prioritize the most vulnerable within those groups. The study concludes that there are barriers that limit the ability of the most climate vulnerable countries to access a share of adaptation finance proportionate to their level of need.

OUT AND ALL OUT! Lasith Malinga nails another yorker and this time hits the base of Hamid Hassan's middle stump. Afghanistan all out for 152, Sri Lanka wins by 34 runs on DLS method.

WICKET! That could be the clincher for Sri Lanka! Dimuth Karunaratne, fielding at cover, attacks the ball and hits the bull's eye, Najibullah Zadran is caught short of his crease and Sri Lanka can celebrate. Najibullah's gone for 43 with Afghanistan 145 for nine after 32 overs. Lasith Malinga continues.

One run, via a wide, off the 31st over. Afghanistan 136 for eight. Sri Lanka, thanks to some accurate bowling, is inching closer to its first win of the tournament. Isuru Udana comes into the attack.

WICKET! Lasith Malinga nails his yorker and it's too good for Dawlat Zadran. It swings in and hits the base of middle stump. Dawlat is dismissed for 6, Afghanistan 136 for eight. Hamid Hassan is the new batsman in.

Just two runs off the 30th over, Afghanistan 135 for seven, needs a further 52 runs in 11 overs. Lasith Malinga's into the attack.

Three runs off the 29th over, Afghanistan 133 for seven, needs a further 54 runs in 12 overs. Najibullah Zadran didn't want to expose Dawlat Zadran for four deliveries from Nuwan Pradeep. He decided against taking a single off the second ball of the over, but then collected a two and a single before leaving Dawlat only a ball to face. Suranga Lakmal continues.

Three singles from the 28th over, Afghanistan 130 for seven, needs a further 57 runs in 13 overs. Dawlat Zadran has defended well since walking in at the fall of Rashid Khan's wicket, but Najibullah Zadran holds the key to this match. The ball is nipping around if the bowlers hit the length and Afghanistan has a stiff task in its hand. Nuwan Pradeep continues, into his ninth over.

Four runs off the 27th over, Afghanistan 127 for seven. Another successful over from Nuwan Pradeep and the four off the blade of Dawlat Zadran could have been avoided. It was a forward push that should have been stopped by Lasith Malinga at mid-on. An untimely slip and the ball, despite the best efforts of Angelo Mathews, races to the boundary. Afghanistan needs 60 more runs from 14 overs. Suranga Lakmal's into the attack.

WICKET! Rashid Khan is bowled for 2, Nuwan Pradeep's the bowler again. This one straightens after pitch and Rashid is neither forward nor back to play it. Afghanistan 123 for seven, and you've got to say, it's advantage Sri Lanka at this stage. Dawlat Zadran is the new batsman in.

End of the 25th over, Afghanistan is 122 for six, needs a further 65 runs from 16 overs. Pradeep delivers a wicket after conceding five wides and leave the match hanging in the balance again. Sri Lanka needs another wicket, though, to tilt the balance of the match.

WICKET! Nuwan Pradeep traps Gulbadin Naib with a ball that nips back in sharply and hits the batsman on the kneeroll. Umpire Paul Wilson signals out, but Naib reviews and DRS says it's umpire's call. Gone for 23, Afghanistan 121 for six. Rashid Khan is the new batsman in.

Seven runs off the 24th over — Afghanistan needs 73 more runs from 17 overs — which ends with Najibullah Zadran reverse-sweeping Dhananjaya de Silva for a four to the backward point region. Najibullah had to dive and hope that Lasith Malinga didn't hit the stumps direct, after hesitating for a single, but he nervelessly middles the ball keep the momentum going for Afghanistan. Nuwan Pradeep continues.

18 overs left, Afghanistan needs 80 more runs to win. Gulbadin Naib and Najibullah Zadran look settled and don't have the pressure of run rate, too. Sri Lanka bowlers need to be patient and keep bowling the right lines and lengths, with the pitch offering plenty of assistance. Off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva's into the attack.

Naib brings up the team 100 with a brace to deep backward square leg. Udana is back into the attack. Six runs from that over. Afghanistan needs 82 runs to win.

Naib keeping Afghanistan in the hunt. Two back-to-back fours off Malinga but Perera keeps the duo quiet: just three runs off it. Suranga Lakmal is back into the attack.

10:10 pm: Najibullah Zadran isn't going down without a fight: he hammers two boundaries off one over. Eight from the over. Afghanistan needs 114 runs to win.

10:03 pm: And Nabi follows suit, Perera cleans him up. Najibullah Zadran at the crease. Three runs and a wicket from it.

9:59 pm: Another one bites the dust, and Sri Lanka's in command now. Pradeep grabs his second wicket, snaps up Shahidi for four. AFG 57/4 after 13 overs. Gulbadin Naib is in next. A wicket maiden that.

9:50 pm: Fifty comes up for Sri Lanka in the 11th over. Nabi pulls Pradeep over mid-on's head to bring up the first boundary in 40 balls. AFG: 51/3 in 11 overs

10 overs done with and Afghanistan needs 141 runs in 31 overs.

Udana's figures so far: 3-0-6-1

9:41 pm: Nuwan Pradeep comes into the attack and immediately gets into the act! Zazai goes for the pull and can only top edge it to the fine leg boundary. Thisara Perera comes in and takes a splendid, low catch. Mohammed Nabi walks in at no. 5. AFG: 44/3 in 9 overs

End of powerplay overs

9:38 pm: Udana bowling a good spell here as Sri Lanka pulls things back a bit. Udana keeps bowling in the fourth stump line and manages to get a thick edge of Rahmat's bat. Matthews is on hand to snaffle that catch. Afghanistan two down! Hashmatullah Shahidi comes in.

9:26 pm: Isuru Udana comes on and doesn't let Zazai clear his front leg to get under the ball. Just three single from his first over. AFG: 37/1 in 6 overs

9:22 pm: DROPPED! Malinga isn't impressed. Zazai pulls one high into the air and the deep-midwicket fielder Kusal Mendis floors it! WICKET! Shahzad isn't too lucky, however. He balloons a slower ball straight into the hands of Karunaratne at short mid-wicket and departs for 7. Rahmat Shah is the new batsman. SL: 34/1 in 5 overs

9:13 pm: Zazai with some ferocious striking here! Malinga over pitches and gets the rough treatment before Lakmal errs in line, too. He dispatches those deliveries and the ball reaches the boundary in no time. AFG: 29/0 in 4 overs

9:03 pm: Pick that one out! Hazratullah Zazai with the sweetest of connections to that lofted shot over deep mid-wicket! It was in the slot from Lakmal for the southpaw and he accepts the invitation. Shahzad, too, joins the party with a back-footed punch through the point region for a four. AFG: 17/0 in 2 overs

8.59 pm: Malinga gets started against Mohammad Shahzad. Six runs in the opening over to start the chase. AFG: 6/0 in 1 over

Afghanistan's innings

Mohammed Nabi on his career-best four-wicket figures: ""The pitch had nothing for spinners. I tried best to bowl with the conditions. I tried to turn and get some loop from my deliveries. It was also very good for me to bowl against many left handers. I set to a plan and tried to bowl my best in right areas with a slip to new batsman.""

Afghanistan's revised target after DLS is 187 in 41 overs. (Correction)

8:43 pm: Too good for the no.11 batsman from Rashid. A leg spinner on the line of the middle and off, Pradeep misses and the ball hits the top of off-stump! SL: 201 all-out. Rashid finishes with two wickets.

Rashid Khan to no. 11 Nuwan Pradeep as 200 comes up for Sri Lanka.

8:38 pm: Lakmal showing some intent, too. Dawlat making the error by bowling short, allowing Lakmal to hang back waiting and hit it baseball style over mid-wicket and mid-on regions for boundaries. WICKET! Dawlat responds better by bowling a back of the hand slower ball yorker and Malinga misses it to have his stumps shattered. SL: 199/9 in 36 overs

8:32 pm: Malinga comes out flying... with the bat. Makes room and slaps a Dawlat short delivery over mid-off. SL 189/8 in 34 overs

Statsman Mohandas Menon says, ""If Afghanistan can restrict/dismiss Sri Lanka to about 200 runs, then its target will be 186 in 41 overs."" I think Afghanistan will take that score.

MATCH TO RESUME AT 4 PM LOCAL TIME (8:30 IST). 41 overs per side with a 10-minute innings break.

The rain has picked up here and the umpires call for the covers. The players are walking off the field with Afghanistan well and truly on top in this contest after a roller-coaster passage of play in the last one hour.

The covers are finally coming off.

7:40 pm: Lunch has been taken in Cardiff. Good news at last: it has stopped raining and the groundsmen are busy draining the water off the ground.

6:52 pm: It is still drizzling and covers are in place.

6:24 pm: Bad news fellas... it's still raining in Cardiff. We haven't lost overs yet, yet being the operative word here. But we will in another 20 minutes.

5:32 pm: Deary me... Kusal Perera tries to reverse sweep Afghanistan's best bowler Rashid Khan and the ball gets an edge of his glove and its an easy grab for Shahzad! He departs for 78. Malinga is out in the middle and it seems like he doesn't want to hang around too long either. He was nearly run-out and stumped off consecutive deliveries. SL: 182/8 in 33 overs

Angelo Matthews now has three ducks in World Cups, the joint-most for Sri Lanka alongside Mahela Jayawardena and Arjuna Ranatunga.

5:24 pm: WICKET! Dawlat Zadran bowls a fast, full delivery and Isuru Udana's slog doesn't connect get bat on ball and is castled for 10! Perera will be left seething at the other end with that effort from his partner. Surunga Lakmal is the new batsman. SL: 179/7 in 32 overs

Perera, somehow, manages to remain unscathed amidst all the carnage at the other end.He is batting on 75 off 67 balls.

5:02 pm: The Perera's do manage to get a run-out among them. *insert hands on head emoji* Thisara taps it to cover and takes off but Kusal stays put. Hashmatullah Shahidi is quick to the ball and releases it to Shahzad, who collects the ball and disturbs the stumps to leave Thisara short of his crease. SL: 159/6 in 26 overs

4:59 pm: Sri Lanka is losing its heads here. Now, there is confusion in running between the wickets between Kusal and Thisara Perera, which nearly runs the former out. A direct hit would have had him. SL: 155/5 in 25 overs

This is the first time Nabi has claimed four wickets in his career.

11 balls bring five runs for Sri Lanka and four wickets for Afghanistan! Maddening stuff this!

4:50 pm: The conditions are still overcast and Hamid Hassan finds his groove again with the ball. Dhananjaya nicks one behind and Shahzad snaffles it! What on earth is happening! Four wickets in 11 balls and Sri Lanka is on the mat! SL: 149/5 in 23 overs

Dhananjaya de Silva is the new batsman at no. 6.

4:37 pm: WICKET! It's Nabi again! A nothing shot from Thirimanne as he tries to drag a ball spinning away to the leg side but only manages to inside edge it on to his stumps. Kusal Mendis falls cheaply again! After getting a sneaky edge of his bat from the first ball, he bowls a similar delivery next up and Mendis prods at it with a big stride, gets an edge to first slip. Angelo Matthews is the new man and he is on his way back too! Nabi, you beauty! Matthews pokes one on the back foot and he only manages to edge it to first slip. What is going on here at Cardiff?! SL: 146/4 in 22 overs

HUGEEEEE NEWS coming in! South Africa pacer Dale Steyn is ruled out of the World Cup and will be replaced by Reeza Hendricks.

4:31 pm: Sri Lanka has brought up the best start at the end of 20 overs so far in the World Cup and is set for a big total. SL: 139/1 in 20 overs

Staggering stat shown by the official broadcaster. Sri Lanka has used 57 different players and has had five different captains in ODIs since the 2015 World Cup.

4:20 pm: Naib with another no ball and follows it up with two wides to Perera. Shehzad tries to change the field but the umpire Nigel Llong tells him he can't do that. Naib bowls one in the slot and Perera lofts it over covers to bring up his fifty! The southpaw in the process ends his 21-ball boundary drought. Really poor stuff from Naib as he bowls another no-ball in the over and Perera accepts the free hit with another hit to the fence. 19 off the over. SL: 128/1 in 17 overs

Nelson!! 111-1 after a risky two. It lasts just one ball before Thirimanne gets a single down to third man.

Yikes! Afghanistan has already conceded 15 wides in this match; the most recorded during an innings so far in this World Cup. The previous high also came from Afghanistan against Australia with 14.

Sri Lanka do not have a great record at Sophia Gardens. Can it improve on its poor run today? Read more to find out.

Rashid Khan is into the attack now.

4:06 pm: 100 up for Sri Lanka. The boundary drought is over for Sri Lanka after Thirimanne slaps a Naib free-hit straight past the bowler. SL: 104/1 in 15 overs

3:59 pm: The pressure pays off in the form of a wicket! 33 dot balls and Karunaratne goes for a lofted shot and doesn't get to the pitch of the Nabi delivery, and holes out to long-on fielder. He departs for a well made 30. Lahiru Thirimanne is the new man in at no. 3. SL: 95/1 in 14 overs

3:52 pm: Afghanistan is pulling things back a bit with spin and Naib's medium pace. 27 balls since Sri Lanka's last boundary. SL: 86/0 in 12 overs

3:43 pm: Nabi and Mujeeb arrest Sri Lanka's momentum in the last two overs conceding just eight. Sri Lanka will be happy with the start after its shoddy show the bat against New Zealand in the first game. SL: 79/0 in 10 overs

3:37 pm: Nabi brings some respite with just three runs but looks like Perera is keen to make up for it. He steps down the track to Mujeeb and carves him to the leg side boundary before cutting him square to the point boundary. SL: 71/0 in 8 overs

Off-spinner Mohammed Nabi is into the attack now.

3:29 pm: A good over is ruined by a full delivery on the leg stump which Karunaratne puts it away with ease to the mid-wicket fence. SL: 59/0 in 6 overs

The Sri Lankan openers have negated the overcast conditions mostly due to the poor bowling from the Afghan new ball bowlers. Naib now turns to spin in the form of Mujeeb ur Rehman.

3:26 pm: There is a bit of drizzle in Cardiff at the moment but that hasn't stopped the boundaries for Sri Lanka. Perera slaps Zadran over mid-wicket and the bowler sticks one into the pitch and the ball flies over the head of the batsman and the 'keeper Shahzad for another five wides. Fifty up for Sri Lanka inside five overs with Karunaratne tucking a delivery to the fine leg boundary. SL: 52/0 in 5 overs

3:20 pm: Hassan is under the pump here! He bowls five wides before Perera slashes him over covers for a boundary. Ian Smith on the air says 'There is a hint of Sanath Jayasuriya in that shot from Perera' and we couldn't help but agree with his dominant bottom hand stroke-making. Karunaratne ends the over with another boundary to the mid-wicket boundary. 15 of his first over, 16 of his second. 37/0 in 4 overs

3:15 pm: Zadran helps pull the run-rate back a bit by holding one end on Karunaratne. SL: 21/0 in 3 overs

Hassan with a wayward start today considering he bowled two maiden overs to David Warner in the last game.

3:11pm: Perera comes out blazing against Hamid Hassan, pulling him for a boundary and slashing one between point and cover to run three runs. Hamid, then, goes around the wicket and pitches one up. Perera welcomes that with a smashing drive down to the mid-off boundary. Karunaratne prods on towards third man for another two to end the over. 15 runs off the over. SL: 19/0 in 2 overs

3:07 pm: Zadran struck Karunaratne with an in-swinger with the first ball but the southpaw gets behind the line and gets bat on ball for the rest of the over. Zadran errs with his line of the fifth delivery and Karunaratne tucks it away fine for a boundary to get Sri Lanka underway. SL: 4/0 in 1 overs

Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera open for Sri Lanka. Dawlat Zadran with the new ball.

===============================

We are through with the national anthems of the respective countries. It's game time in Cardiff. Both sides searching for their first win. Who will open their account?

=============================

TOSS UPDATE: Afghanistan has won the toss and elected to bowl.

Gulbadin Naib: ""We want to bowl first. The conditions are good for the bowlers. It's a good toss to win. We struggled in the middle, we put a good total, but that wasn't good enough against a good team like Australia. Sri Lanka is a champion side. No changes.""

Dimuth Karunaratne: ""In the last game also we batted first. The batsmen have an idea how to bat here. It's (captaincy) not easy, it's a good challenge. They give me support. Jeevan Mendis is not playing. Pradeep is playing.""

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Lahiru Thirimanne, Dimuth Karunaratne(c), Kusal Perera(w), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga

Afghanistan (Playing XI): Mohammad Shahzad(w), Hazratullah Zazai, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib(c), Najibullah Zadran, Rashid Khan, Dawlat Zadran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Hamid Hassan

One change for Sri Lanka: Jeevan Mendis out Nuwan Pradeep is in

Overcast conditions in Cardiff with chances of rain later in the day. In other words, win toss, bowl first kind of day.

===================

Afghanistan captain Gulbadin Naib has stressed on the need to bat sensibly against Sri Lanka and believes the team has the potential to score 300.

Afghanistan and Sri Lanka will both be hoping to bounce back after heavy opening defeats when they meet in the Cricket World Cup on Tuesday.

Here's today's Match Preview:

The two nations were soundly beaten in their opening fixtures at this year’s tournament, both failing to bat out 50 overs before watching their opponents knock off below-par scores with ease.

Sri Lanka's innings lasted just 29.2 overs against New Zealand in Cardiff on Saturday as it posted a paltry 136 in testing conditions with only three batsmen making it to double figures.

World Cup 2019: Full coverage

The Kiwis knocked off the runs without losing a wicket, meaning Sri Lanka is yet to register a win in the Welsh capital in five games.

It is back at the same venue to take on an Afghanistan side who managed to do slightly better with the bat at nearby Bristol at the weekend, though a total of 207 all out was never enough to trouble reigning champions Australia.

The only previous World Cup meeting between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka came four years ago, with the latter victorious by four wickets in Dunedin.

However, Dimuth Karunaratne's side have lost nine of its last 10 ODI games in 2019, also suffered a 91-run defeat in its most recent meeting with its next opponents, at the Asia Cup last September.

Read: It's all about the speed!

Thisara Perera claimed five wickets in a losing cause on that occasion but the all-rounder will be looked to contribute with the bat in England, too.

His strike rate of 112.4 runs per 100 deliveries is impressive; of the 225 players to score over 2,000 ODI runs only three - Glenn Maxwell, Jos Buttler and Shahid Afridi - have done so at a faster rate.

Perera made 27 at the weekend while Sri Lanka struggled against the Black Caps' battery of seamers, Afghanistan will rely more heavily on its spinners to do the damage.

Rashid Khan is the key bowler for Afghanistan, having claimed 99 one-day wickets since the start of 2017, more than any other slow bowler.

Interestingly, none of the six sides who have opted to bat first in an ODI at Cardiff after winning the toss have prevailed. Considering the early start in English conditions, the captains may want to factor in the ground's history when deciding what to do at the toss.

55,55,Drought Sri Lanka,SL defy controversial call to stun Proteas - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/south-africa-sri-lanka-highlights-match-report-temba-bavuma-run-out-hashim-amla-no-review/2019-02-14,"Bavuma's shocking luck as SL shine

The start of South Africa's first Test against Sri Lanka was hit by confusion and controversy before a run had even been scored as the tourists took the honours on the opening day of the series.

Sri Lanka finished the day in Durban on 1-49 after their inexperienced bowling attack stunned the Proteas, bowling the hosts out for just 235.

The early controversy was sparked by the refusal of a Sri Lankan player review, which prevented the tourists from taking their second early wicket.

Hashim Amla was given not out by umpire Aleem Dar following an appeal for leg before wicket, two balls after left-arm opening bowler Vishwa Fernando had Dean Elgar caught behind in just the second over.

Sri Lanka celebrate an early wicket // Getty

New Sri Lankan captain Dimuth Karunaratne conferred with Fernando and wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella and eventually signalled that he wanted a review.

But he was told he had taken too long and the decision was not sent to television umpire Ian Gould. But an analysis by SuperSport television showed the total time between Dar turning down the appeal and Karunaratne asking for a review was 12 seconds, three seconds inside the allowable 15 seconds to ask for a review.

Replays showed the ball had pitched in line and would have hit the stumps, which would have resulted in the original decision being overturned if a review had been allowed.

The lapse was not costly as Amla made only three before he was caught at second slip off Suranga Lakmal for three in the sixth over.

And the Sri Lankans shook off the incident, seamer Fernando bagging four wickets for the day as the Proteas were bowled out in a spicy Kingsmead pitch.

Karunaratne (28no) and the attacking Oshada Fernando (17no) will resume on the second morning, hoping to lay the platform for a sizeable first-innings lead.

Sri Lanka opener Lahiru Thirimanne was their only wicket to fall, batting for close to half an hour before he was caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock for a duck off seamer Dale Steyn.

South Africa's innings was rescued to a degree by a fighting 80 from de Kock before he was the last man out, having at least taken his side past the 200 mark.

""We were a bit unaware of the new guys. I think they caught us off guard,"" said de Kock.

""We had good game plans against Suranga Lakmal, but the two new guys were unseen before. They bowled really well, they didn't miss their lengths often and they made us work hard for what we got.""

After winning the toss and electing to bowl, Sri Lanka had South Africa three wickets down with 17 runs on the board before Faf du Plessis (35) and Temba Bavuma (47) put on 72 for the fourth wicket to calm home nerves.

But the tourists continued to chip away at the wickets column despite a positive run-rate from the hosts.

Fernando (4-62) was impressive with the new ball as he had both openers Elgar (0) and Aiden Markram (11) back in the changing rooms early.

Bavuma showed good application before he was out in unfortunate circumstances, a straight drive from De Kock deflecting off the boot of bowler Fernando and onto the stumps with the batsman out of his crease.

Keshav Maharaj (29) put on 47 with De Kock but was caught by Dickwella off Fernando just before tea, with South Africa adding a potentially crucial 57 before being bowled out.","Thu, 14 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2019/02/14SriLanka.ashx?w=1600,"['controversial', 'proteas', 'fernando', 'stun', 'lanka', 'sri', 'caught', 'sl', 'south', 'defy', 'second', 'wickets', 'tourists', 'wicket', 'kock']",

Andhra Pradesh is witnessing unrelenting heat, depleting ground water, fall in reservoir levels as the delayed and sluggish monsoon has left the fields parched and farmers worried.

With no sign of arrival of the southwest monsoon any time soon and maximum temperatures still hovering over 43 degrees Celsius at many places, the state is reeling under the longest and harshest summer in recent times.

The rainfall deficit for the current month is at 64.4 per cent. The deficit in the coastal region comprising nine districts and known for its fertile land is 57 per cent and it is even higher in four districts of Rayalaseema, notorious for recurring droughts.

The drought-like situation last week drove a farmer in Prakasam district of coastal Andhra to commit suicide. Addanki Venkateshwara Raju, 67, killed himself as all the 15 bores he dug on his 4.67 acre land had failed. He had a debt burden of over Rs 2.50 lakh. The situation has also created fodder shortage. Farmers in districts like Nellore and Prakasam are struggling to get fodder for their livestock.

The unusual long dry spell has also led to water scarcity. People in towns like Vizianagaram, Ongole, Giddaluru and Kadapa are getting piped drinking water once in four to five days. The tankers deployed by authorities too are proving insufficient to meet the demand. As many as 20 towns are getting water once in two or three days. Officials have said if there are no rains by month end the situation may worsen.

There is a shortfall of 453 million liters of drinking water in urban areas every day. In 110 urban areas, there are 12.50 lakh tap connections. Authorities are currently supplying 1,378 million liters of water per day against the requirement of 1,831 million liters. Last year's drought has also contributed to the water supply situation this year. As many as 38 reservoirs had dried up completely in April.

The present water storage in major reservoirs was 171.11 TMC as of June 15 against 193.43 TMC same day last year.

Underground water table has also depleted by an average 2.80 metres. In Rayalaseema, it has depleted by 7.26 metres. Borewells dug up to even 150 feet have dried up.

Advertisement Southwest monsoon normally arrives in the state in the first week of June but this time there is a delay. The monsoon arrived on Kerala coast on June 8 and was expected to enter Andhra Pradesh on June 13. The weatherman said that unless cyclone Vayu in the Arabian Sea weakens completely, the southwest monsoon is likely to remain sluggish. With no pre-monsoon or monsoon rains, the state is still reeling under heatwave conditions.

Vepada in Vizianagaram on Saturday recorded the highest temperature of 46.8 degrees Celsius. Tangutur in Prakasam district was the hottest on Sunday with a maximum temperature of 45.8 degrees Celsius.

According to Real Times Governance Society (RTGS) of Andhra Pradesh, temperature above 43 degrees was recorded in 42 places on Sunday. The maximum temperature in many places is five to six degrees above the normal.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that heatwave conditions will prevail in the state over the next few days. It has also issued a warning of severe heatwave conditions at isolated places.

With no respite in sight, the government has extended half-day schools till June 22. The education department has asked school managements to strictly adhere to the half-day timings from 8 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.

As a result of continuing heat, the electricity consumption has increased. It was 194.21 million units in the entire state on June 14 against 168.14 million units the same day last year.

Farmers growing maize, tur and cotton were advised to delay the sowing of the crops till second week of June. With no rains even in the second and third week of June, the sowing operations have gotten further delayed. Paddy and chilli farmers in south coastal Andhra were worried. Last year too they suffered losses due to lack of timely rains.

Of the 13 districts only Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari are canal-irrigated. The rest of the state depends on rain-fed agriculture. The conditions have badly hit the tenant farmers, whose numbers in the state are estimated to be 16 lakh. Many complained about the delay in getting bank loans.

Last year, 347 blocks were declared drought-affected in nine of 13 districts. The state received 32 per cent deficient rainfall between June 2018 and April 2019, affecting kharif and rabi crops.","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/in-andhra%20%281%29.jpg,"['million', 'state', 'droughtlike', 'andhra', 'situation', 'week', 'monsoon', 'grips', 'water', 'temperature', 'districts', 'degrees', 'rains', 'pradesh']",

Sri Lanka seamers Kasun Rajitha and Vishwa Fernando took three wickets each to bowl out South Africa for 222 on the first day of the second and final Test before the hosts themselves struck back late in the day with the ball.

The tourists were 3-60 at the close, still trailing by 162 runs on a wicket that is providing assistance for the fast bowlers, as well as some turn for the spinners.

Opener Lahiru Thirimanne (25no) and nightwatchman Rajitha (0no) will resume on day two, seeking to take Sri Lanka into the lead as they aim to become the first team from Asia to win a test series in South Africa.

Duanne Olivier (2-25) bowled Oshada Fernando (0) and had Kusal Mendis (16) caught to make early inroads into the Sri Lanka batting, while Kagiso Rabada grabbed the wicket of captain Dimuth Karunaratne (17) as the hosts fought back with the ball.

Having won the toss and elected to bat, it was a disappointing batting display from South Africa again. Their innings was dominated by a brisk 86 from Quinton de Kock and 60 from opener Aiden Markram.

""It was tough up front, the Sri Lanka bowlers didn't give us much to work with,"" Markram said.

""But 222 is less than what we wanted and less than how the pitch played, so we only have ourselves to blame as batsmen. Hopefully we can make the second innings count.""

South Africa were in early trouble at 3-15 as Fernando (3-62) removed Dean Elgar (6) and Hashim Amla (0) in consecutive deliveries.

Temba Bavuma (0) was run out for a second time in three innings as South Africa wobbled, before Markram and captain Faf du Plessis (25) took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled the last ball before lunch.

Markram and debutant allrounder Wiaan Mulder (9) were both trapped lbw by Rajitha (3-67), who then also grabbed the scalp of Keshav Maharaj (0), caught by wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.

De Kock scored freely as he put on 59 for the eighth wicket with Rabada (22), before being bowled by spinner Dhananjaya de Silva (2-15) and South Africa's innings folded soon after that.

The Sri Lankan government on May 18, 2009 killed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran in the coastal village of in Mullaittivu, bringing to an end the bloody armed conflict fought mainly in the north and east of the island nation.

At least 100,000 people were killed in the over three-decade-long conflict. Thousands of people, including security personnel, are still reported to be missing after the war.

Hundreds of people gathered in parts of Northern Sri Lanka to remember the victims of the war, the Colombo Gazette reported.

The government will commemorate the war heroes during the Victory Day celebrations on Sunday, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.

It asked the public to light a ""Lamp of Peace"" in the memory of those who laid down their lives for the country.

""The commemoration of the completion of a decade of peace since eradicating terrorism that plagued Sri Lanka for three long decades by the valiant War Heroes, falls on 2019.05.19,"" it said in the statement.

""To coincide with the ""Dasavarshikabhisheka"" commemoration, it is requested from the general public to light a 'Lamp of Peace' at all places of worship, state and private sector organizations, homes, police stations and tri-forces establishments island-wide on 2019.05.19 at 1900hrs,"" it said.

However, human rights organisations blamed the government of failing to provide justice to the victims even after a decade after the war, the Colombo Gazette reported.

The Amnesty International called on the government to end impunity and put accountability for crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses at the heart of its transitional justice process.

It is worrying to see the recurrence of hostility and violence against ethnic and religious minorities in Sri Lanka. While the government has committed itself to a process of reconciliation, the wounds of the past will only heal if there is justice, truth and reparation, Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International, said.

The Human Rights Watch said that the end of the war provided the country with an opportunity not only to rebuild shattered lives and society, but also to restore respect for rights and the rule of law.

Yet successive Sri Lankan administrations have frittered away this opportunity, failing to investigate atrocities by both sides, hold those responsible for the worst crimes accountable, or provide truth and reparations to the victims, Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said.

The government gained victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) which had been fighting for a separate state for nearly three decades.

SAMBURU COUNTY, Kenya

As temperatures rise in parched northern Kenya, local aid worker Evans Onyiego is fighting to build peace among pastoralist communities jostling over dwindling resources.

Weeks of scant rainfall have put Samburu county on drought alert, along with at least 19 more of the country’s 47 counties. In the arid north, pasture and water sources are drying up, forcing semi-nomadic herders to travel greater distances in search of water – and driving up the risk of conflict.

“They’re competing for water. They’re competing for pasture,” says Onyiego, who heads Caritas Maralal, the Catholic church’s local social and humanitarian action arm in Samburu.

The New Humanitarian’s video series, “Faces on the front lines of local aid”, explores the work of local aid responders like Onyiego. The latest video, “The Peacebuilder”, looks at how Onyiego tries to build social cohesion among northern Kenya’s pastoralist communities in an age of climate change, which has made droughts more unpredictable and more intense.

“Local organisations are part of these communities. And whether there is a disaster or not, we still remain.”

Competition over resources has turned increasingly deadly in recent years, infused by the proliferation of automatic weapons.

“Conflicts are very tricky,” Onyiego says. “You need to be very sensitive and make sure whatever intervention you are bringing in is not worsening the situation.”

As drought impacts escalate this year, international aid groups are planning nutrition and cash aid programmes in Samburu county. Onyiego, who was born and raised here, says locals are best placed to navigate often-complicated local power structures and dynamics, though they’re frequently overlooked in the wider aid sector.

“The international organisations come in to respond to crises with a specific mandate,” he says. “If it is a disease outbreak, then they respond to that and they end there. They don’t do anything else. But the local organisations are part of these communities. And whether there is a disaster or not, we still remain.”

Onyiego’s day-to-day work focuses on giving competing communities opportunities to interact and form relationships. He encourages rival groups to meet and negotiate how to co-exist and share resources.

It’s a message shared by Jackson Odungo Kiok, a farmer and Samburu leader whose son was killed in a cattle raid. “I used to fight people,” he says. Today, he sits on a peace committee, working to reduce conflict with his former rivals.","Mon, 06 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://assets.irinnews.org/s3fs-public/styles/responsive_large/public/tnh-peacebuilder-thumbnail.jpg?YzNIlArnnfI0fUNSybQG_V9AZazZvU1x,"['series', 'defusing', 'approach', 'county', 'droughthit', 'water', 'conflict', 'peacebuilder', 'northern', 'video', 'organisations', 'aid', 'onyiego', 'kenya', 'communities', 'local', 'samburu']", 
60,60,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought drives mungbean production to 20-year low - Grain Central,https://www.graincentral.com/cropping/pulses/drought-drives-mungbean-production-to-20-year-low/,"MUNGBEAN production in eastern Australia has taken a hit from the drought with the planting area down about 50 per cent and harvest tonnages the lowest in two decades.

Australian Mungbean Association president Mark Schmidt said at the start of the year the association estimated about 50,000 hectares of mungbeans were planted.

But of that, only 40,000ha have been or will be harvested with at least 10,000ha wiped out by drought.

“The area planted is about 50 to 100 per cent smaller than normal. Normally we would expect about 100,000ha to be planted. Our biggest year was about 150,000ha,” he said.

“New South Wales didn’t get much planted at all and there were very limited plantings in Central Queensland.

“Of the 40,000ha harvested, we are expecting a yield of between 0.3 to 0.5 tonnes/ha. That would equate to an estimate of about 20,000 tonnes at this stage for the total mungbean crop. 20,000t is the lowest we have seen in 20 years.”

Mr Schmidt said this year’s crops were very small, but at least the modern-day varieties which had pods towards the top of the plant allowed the crops to be harvested.

“If we went back to the older varieties of 10 years ago, nothing would have survived. But the current varieties have proven to be so tough with the pods on top that people have been able to harvest them,” he said.

“It has been a tribute to the professionalism of the mungbean growers to be able to grow on stored moisture and harvest a crop that has basically had no in-crop rain.”

Mr Schmidt said prices at the start of the season were around $1100/t, but growers with high quality beans were now achieving up to $1500/t.

“Anyone who has really good quality mungbeans are getting up around $1500/t, but the range is $1100 to $1500/t,” he said.

Mr Schmidt said it was now too late for further mungbean plantings, except for some out-of-season production in the Burdekin region of far north Queensland where planting will start at the beginning of April.

He said recent late rain in some growing areas would benefit later planted crops which were flowering.

“Even some of the crops that were ready to harvest have reflowered and it will increase the yield. So, we might end up with more than the 20,000t,” he said.

The Australian Mungbean Association will hold its annual field walk at the Hermitage Research Facility, Warwick, Qld, from 7.30-12.00 on Thursday, April 4, 2019. RSVP [email protected]

66,66,Drought Sri Lanka,Government aims to tackle drought - The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/government-aims-tackle-drought,"Government aims to tackle drought

The Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts on Monday said that 100 per cent of people in urban areas will have reliable access to clean water by 2025 as the government takes action to tackle drought and other effects of climate change.

The World Health Organization has predicted that between 2030 and 2050 climate change will kill 250,000 people a year, with 38,000 deaths from extreme heat. Food shortages are expected to kill 95,000 children.

A 2015 UN Risk Report showed that Cambodia is the world’s ninth most vulnerable country for disaster, with the economy, agriculture, health and education sectors likely to be affected.

Ministry secretary of state Um Sotha said government policy aimed for 100 per cent of people living in urban areas to have reliable access to clean water, with 90 per cent part of the piped water system and the remaining 10 per cent to receive it from other sources.

Sotha was speaking at a workshop on Monday hosted by the ministry and attended by civil society organisations and around 200 sub-national government officials and representatives of clean water supply operations from across the country.

He said the ministry has expressed concerns over future droughts and has ordered its municipal and provincial officials to study the matter.

“We are worried about this problem and have instructed our provincial and municipal departments to work with their counterparts at the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology to study it.""

“We regard the study of how the supply of water will be affected during dry seasons with no rain and how many cubic metres can be supplied as an urgent task.""

“Private clean water suppliers get their water from existing sources, but if a natural disaster was to occur, it is possible they will not be able to do this.""

“Therefore, the state needs to intervene because water sources depend on geography – some areas have it but some do not. This is the challenge,” Sotha said.

He said that while some areas were facing water shortages, private suppliers nationwide were yet to fill the need.

Ieng Vongrithy, representative of Prek Thmey Water Supply in Kandal province’s Koh Thom district, told The Post that while his operation has not faced water shortages as it is located on the Mekong River, it does face technical issues.

“I do not worry because I can supply the people with enough clean water, both in rainy and dry seasons. But I want to ask for technical and financial support because we run a small operation and usually face such issues,” he said.

Chheang Sokha, a representative of Kampong Trach Clean Water Supply in Kampot province’s Kampong Trach district, told The Post on Monday that though his operation was yet to experience water shortages, he was worried about the situation as the weather was predicted to become hotter in the future.

“[Droughts have occurred] several times and caused difficulties for people when my operation does not have enough water for them.""

“At the moment, the ministry informs us beforehand and we are prepared. When my area lacks water, we try to find it from another source as we have the main system to control the flow of water,” he said.

Ministry of Water Resources spokesmen Chan Yutha, Yin Savuth and Mao Hak could not be reached for comment on Monday.

In January, the Ministry of Water Resources forecasts that this year’s dry season will be hotter than normal, especially during April and May, with temperatures hitting 40-42 degree Celsius as the weather is affected by the El Nino cycle, which last occurred in 2016.

Ministry of Rural Development spokesman Chan Darong told The Post on Monday that the ministry has set goals for 100 per cent of people living in remote areas to have a reliable supply of clean water by 2025. The ministry is prepared for drought in remote areas this year, he said.

“The ministry’s measures are to bore deep wells to ensure enough water for the whole year when we are faced with drought.""

“However, we do not dare to think our measures will be 100 per cent effective because we do not know how serious the drought will be,” Darong said.","Tue, 12 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/topic-6-drought-at-toumnub-dach-village-obichaon-commune-ochrau-district-in-banteay-meanchey-province-on-2016-by-hong-menea-1.jpg,"['shortages', 'reliable', 'ministry', 'supply', 'clean', 'operation', 'water', 'cent', 'drought', 'aims', 'tackle', 'areas']",

CHAIWAT SUBPRASOM/REUTERS/THE STRAITS TIMES

Drought a ‘grave concern’

Local communities in rural areas across the Kingdom have expressed grave concerns over the severe lack of water for their daily consumption amid a prolonged drought that has caused streams, creeks, lakes and ponds to gradually dry up.

Due to high demand for water to increase their crop yields, farmers around the Trapaing Thma reservoir in Banteay Meanchey province have pumped water from the reservoir into their farms and in turn gradually drained the huge reservoir.

The issue has also caused concerns among researchers and conservationists who fear a lack of water and feeding grounds for rare wildlife and bird species and an adverse impact on biodiversity in the area.

San Sav Leang, a 56-year-old resident from Samrong commune in Oddar Meanchey province’s Samrong town, told The Post that most people in the commune do not have enough water to use as all lakes in the area have already dried up.

“In my commune, a number of lakes and streams have already dried out. Today, the authority distributed clean water for our daily use, but it is still not enough because there are many people in the area,” he said.

In the province’s Anlong Veng commune, more than 600 families representing the O’Romchek communities have sought intervention by calling on the water resource authority to build a dam in their community as the water body in their area had run dry.

Seth Sambor, a representative of Romchek II village, appealed for a speedy intervention.

“We need a dam to preserve water for use in the dry season that could cover over 1,000ha of paddy fields. This year, we don’t have enough water for rice fields during the dry season. I hope there will be a water solution for my community next year,” he said.

Provincial Water Resources and Meteorology Department director Nen Kuon told The Post on Tuesday: “We’ve studied and prepared a dam project in the area to address their concerns, but it would not be as fast as they want,” he said.

Since the beginning of this month, some villages in eight provinces including Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Thom, Koh Kong, Preah Vihear, Oddar Meanchey, Stung Treng and Prey Veng have faced water shortage, said Keo Vy, the National Committee for Disaster Management spokesman.

“Over 17,000ha of paddy fields have been damaged while some villages and communes in the provinces are running short of clean water for daily consumption,” he said.

Ly Sarum, a representative of the Prambei Mom forestry community at Prambei Mom commune in Kampong Speu province’s Thpong district, said nearly 100 bantengs on his 97ha of community forest land are in dire need of water and feed.

“The people in our communities want to dig two big ponds to supply water for themselves and wildlife in the area, but we don’t have enough money to do it,” he said.

Ken Sereyrotha, the country director of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), told The Post on Tuesday that irrigation projects including ponds, streams and lakes should be built in urban areas.

“If we add new ponds or restore irrigation systems such as streams and lakes in natural forests that serve as wildlife sanctuaries, forestry crimes will increase as poachers are omnipresent while the number of environmental rangers is limited,” he said.","Wed, 27 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/6-story-1_11.jpg,"['concern', 'provinces', 'water', 'meanchey', 'concerns', 'drought', 'ponds', 'grave', 'commune', 'streams', 'wildlife', 'lakes', 'area']",

Kabir Hashim and AHM Haleem were sworn-in as ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena.

The development came a day after a meeting of the Muslim ministers to reconsider their positions ended inconclusively.

Both Hashim and Haleem are from the United National Party (UNP) of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

It was not clear if other ministers from the main Muslim party, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, would return to the fold.

Along with the nine ministers, two provincial governors from the minority community also resigned on June 3 to allow the Lankan government to investigate allegations against some of them on links to an Islamist extremist group blamed for the deadly terror attacks that claimed 258 lives, including 11 Indians, and injured nearly 500.

They had also protested what they term the government's inability to ensure the safety of their community which constitute nine per cent of the island's 21 million population.

The Muslim-owned properties and businesses were attacked by mobs and the Muslim ministers claimed that the minority community was facing arbitrary arrests on certain occasions.

A Muslim Cabinet minister and two provincial governors were accused of having sponsored the National Thowheeth Jamaath (NTJ) blamed for the attacks.

Meanwhile, a parliamentary probe was told that the Muslim clerics in the eastern Kathankudi area foresaw the Islam radicalism and had forewarned the political leadership as far back as 2017.

Moulavi Sahlan told the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) that Sufi Islamic leaders in Kathankudi had informed the President's office, Prime Minister's Office and Attorney General's Department and the police chief about ""the growing radicalism"".

He said that Zahran Hashim, the leader of the NTJ -- the banned outfit blamed for the attacks on three Colombo hotels and three churches -- had asked them not to commemorate Christmas in 2016.

The former chief of the Kathankudi Police Ariyabandu Wedagedara said that he had not received any complaints on Zahran's extremism. Yet there had been sectarian clashes in the area.

Sirisena wanted the halt to proceedings of the PSC appointed by Assembly Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to probe the events leading to the attacks.

He had threatened not to reconvene the Cabinet until the government abandoned the select committee process.

Sirisena claimed that the committee proceedings were aimed at putting the blame of the attacks on him being the Defence Minister for the intelligence failure.

There are 19 Muslims lawmakers in the 225-member Parliament and nine of them held Cabinet, state and deputy ministerial positions.

India had shared intelligence inputs with Sri Lanka about possible attacks weeks before the bombings.

Nine suicide bombers carried out a series of devastating blasts that tore through St Anthony's Church in Colombo, St Sebastian's Church in the western coastal town of Negombo and another church in the eastern town of Batticaloa, and three high-end hotels frequented by tourists in the country's deadliest violence since the devastating civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) ended in 2009.

The Islamic State claimed the attacks, but the government blamed local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaath for the attacks.

Officials said that the nearly 20,000ha of paddy fields in Battambang’s Sangke district that faced drought have been rescued, with parts of the province receiving some rain recently.

Chhim Vichara, the director of the provincial agricultural department, said on Tuesday that although some 18,000ha of paddy fields in Sangke district had dried up last week, they had not died.

The Sangke district paddy fields were rescued in time, and while other districts also lacked water, his department had not announced a drought alert, Vichara said.

“This happened last week but only affected paddy fields in Sangke district. Our team is getting water into the fields and it rained over the past few days, so there is no problem,” he said.

Long Phalkun, the director of the Battambang provincial Department of Water Resources and Meteorology, said none of the rice paddies had died from drought after water was released into them.

“We released water from the main canals into the paddy fields one after another. The situation is okay now,” Phalkun said.

Provincial governor Nguon Ratanak said on Tuesday that paddy in the Sangke district fields had withered slightly, but there had been no reports of adverse effects after authorities released water into them and it had rained.

“There have been showers. There is not a lot of water in the fields but the paddy has not died. In short, paddy fields have dried up but there is no drought. Rice has withered but not died,” Ratanak said.

A farmer, 60-year-old Oeun Suy from Moung Russey district’s Kakoh commune in Battambang province, told the local media Apsara News Network (ANN) that his family farmed 5ha of paddy fields. These normally produced good yields as it had rained enough in previous years.

However, he said he and other farmers were experiencing drought this year, and that his commune had seen only sporadic rain for months. If this continued, he said, thousands of hectares of paddy fields were at risk.

“If the drought continues until early July, it is clear that rice plants will die because now the only irrigation canal is without water,” Suy told ANN.","Wed, 26 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/Topic-9.-Thousands-ha-of-rice-facing-destruction-from-drought-in-Battambang-by-Supplied.jpg,"['rescued', 'water', 'died', 'drought', 'fields', 'released', 'rice', 'district', 'sangke', 'battambang', 'paddy']", 
71,71,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lankan Accused of Leading Attacks Preached Slaughter. Many Dismissed Him. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/world/asia/sri-lanka-attacks-mastermind.html,"Whether Mr. Zaharan found the Islamic State or the Islamic State found him, they seemed inextricably drawn to each other. In other places, like Indonesia and the Philippines, the Islamic State has been adept at taking Islamic radicals with local grievances and enlisting them in the global slipstream of terror.

By 2017, Mr. Zaharan and his followers were targeting a Sufi sect in Kattankudy, accusing its members of being infidels, even though Sufis are fellow Muslims who practice a mystical form of the faith. After the Sufis in Kattankudy handed out packets of rice to the poor, an action that Mr. Zaharan regarded as trying to buy hungry converts, he grabbed a sword and charged the crowd.

The police said they tried to arrest Mr. Zaharan and one of his brothers, but they escaped.

About 10 of his followers were detained, however, including his father and other relatives. Surprisingly for a small group from a distant part of Sri Lanka, the detained members of National Thowheeth Jama’ath managed to get a high-profile lawyer from Colombo to represent them.

H.M. Ameer, a member of the Sufi community, said that he and other Sufis had repeatedly contacted the police to warn about Mr. Zaharan’s extremism. They sent a thick file to Colombo. But there was little result, Mr. Ameer said. His assessment echoed complaints from recent days that Sri Lankan authorities failed to act on repeated warnings from overseas intelligence agencies about Mr. Zaharan planning a catastrophic attack.

On Thursday, Sufis in Kattankudy received a warning from the Sri Lankan criminal investigation department that their holy places might be targeted on Friday by militants associated with Mr. Zaharan who are still on the run.

Looking out on soldiers guarding the Badhriyyah Jumah Mosque where he and other Sufis worship, Mr. Ameer shook his head.

“We warned them that this man was vehemently spreading Wahhabism and that he was calling for jihad,” he said. “It was out in the open, clear as day. Nothing was done.”","Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/world/25srilanka-ringleader1/25srilanka-ringleader1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=70c7cb2f75fb2fbf888d834abe1519536143311bb9df5b2a1205f17e64b464d7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['slaughter', 'places', 'islamic', 'state', 'lankan', 'dismissed', 'ameer', 'sufis', 'attacks', 'sri', 'sufi', 'mr', 'accused', 'zaharan', 'leading', 'preached', 'kattankudy']", 
72,72,Drought Sri Lanka,Himalayas’ rapid glacier melt threatens drought - The Irish Times,https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/himalayas-rapid-glacier-melt-threatens-drought-1.3932436,"The glaciers of the Himalayas are melting at an accelerating rate, according to a study that underscores the impact of climate change on an area that is a critical source of water supply for India and China.

The glaciers have been losing the equivalent of 50cm (20 inches) of ice vertically each year since 2000, melting twice as fast as they were during the 1975-2000 period, according to a forthcoming study in Science Advances that surveys 40 years of satellite data.

The impact of Himalayan glacial melting is significant because the region provides water to about 800 million people across Asia, who depend on seasonal run-off when the ice melts in the spring.

Melting glaciers along the mountain range have meant there has been more water run-off than normal during spring in recent years. However, this trend is expected to reverse in future as the glaciers shrink – potentially leading to drought.

The research comes as global carbon dioxide emissions hit a record high last year, and as the Earth’s average temperature has warmed about one degree compared with pre-industrial times.

“The reason we focused on this section of high mountain Asia is because Himalayan glaciers are so important for water resources,” said Joshua Maurer, lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.

“The correlation we observe between rising air temperature and the acceleration of glacial melt over the last four decades highlights how vulnerable these glaciers are to climate change and to atmospheric warming,” he added.

Concerns over the impact of warmer temperatures on the world’s ice stores have been rising as the effects become more visible. Earlier this month, unusually warm weather in Greenland led to record melting levels. In the Bering Sea ice levels also reached record winter lows earlier this year.

The glaciers currently contain about 600 billion tons of ice but have lost about a quarter of their mass over the four decades surveyed, according to Mr Maurer.

A growing body of research has documented how melting glaciers will impact the long-term water supplies on which hundreds of millions of people across Asia depend.

A different study, published last month in Nature, found that the level of meltwater production from Himalayan glaciers is about 1.6 times greater than the rate that would keep the glaciers in “balance”.

During times of drought glaciers become the largest suppliers of water to Asia’s major river basin, that study found. It calculated that each year the glaciers release enough water to meet the basic needs of about 220 million people.

Several factors contribute to glacial melting in the Himalayas, including soot that settles on top of glaciers, as well as changing precipitation factors.

Biggest factor

However, the new study in Science Advances suggests that temperature is the single biggest factor that drives the rate of melting.

“The ice loss that we see across the region is quite similar, so that tells us that there is a climate driver that causes these glaciers to melt similarly,” said Mr Maurer.

The study uses satellite images from 1975-2016, including spy satellite images that were recently declassified, to analyse the mass of Himalayan glaciers across a 2,000km stretch that covers India, China, Nepal and Bhutan.

Since 2000, the rate of loss across all the glaciers has been the equivalent of about 50cm of ice on average annually, with much greater ice loss occurring at lower elevations. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019","Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.3932434&origw=1440,"['melt', 'study', 'threatens', 'impact', 'glacier', 'times', 'water', 'rapid', 'rate', 'temperature', 'drought', 'ice', 'glaciers', 'melting', 'himalayan', 'himalayas']",

The District Administration is makingevery effort to address the drinking water problem prevailing in the entire district, said Collector K.S. Kandasamy, who addressed a meeting with farmers.

The district is being declared as drought-hit , and water supply augmentation works are going on at ₹32.81 crore, he said. Of this, ₹31.09 crore is being spent for village panchayats, ₹1.21 crore for municipal areas and ₹51 lakh is allocated for town panchayat areas.

In villages, the per capita water supply is being maintained to 40 litres and the villages where acute water shortage has been spelt out, officers have asked to provide water through water tankers, he said.

Private water purifying units are being monitored and anyone misusing drinking water would face action from the special officers appointed for this purpose. Residents facing water supply problems can contact control room numbers 04175-233303 or 04175-233141, said an official from the Collectorate.

It was estimated by officials that sugarcane crops grown on 400 hectares hadwithered due to shortage of water and plantain crops on 207 hectares were damaged. The district administration has sought ₹36 crore from the State exchequer to pay to the farmers, an official said.

That review is likely to prohibit exports of live cattle as a default position.

Exemptions would be granted if applicants could prove that conditions for the animals were good both on board their transit ship and at the country of their destination.

Sales of other stock besides cattle are not affected at this stage but could be brought in later.

Trade in live animals is declining anyway.

PGG Wrightson, a company that previously dealt in live cattle, is however shrugging off any risk of serious losses from a government crackdown.

The government review started after hundreds of New Zealand and Australian cattle died after they arrived in Sri Lanka.

The shipments were organised by an Australian company.

Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said several options were being considered but a conditional ban on live cattle export was one that he favoured.

His comments followed a progress report presented to Cabinet this week.

""The continued export of cattle may be a risk to New Zealand's brand,"" Mr O'Connor said.

""The time has come to rethink this area and consider whether it's something that fits within our values as a country.

""When animals leave New Zealand we set conditions that are considered world-class by veterinarians.

""There have been incidents over the last few years that highlight the fact that once animals leave New Zealand we have very limited ability to ensure their wellbeing when they reach their destination.""

These comments follow a series of controversies about live exports from Australia.

Here in New Zealand, the value of the business has been on the decline.

2016 : 40,506 cattle exported, valued at $84.3m

: 40,506 cattle exported, valued at $84.3m 2017 : 27,306 cattle; $63.7m

: 27,306 cattle; $63.7m 2018: 17,319 cattle; $30.1m

In response to the announcement, Federated Farmers said it supported having a review of the trade, but conditions for animals on ships were better than was sometimes portrayed.

It cited one case where live sheep were sent to help Mexico recover from a drought, that benefited both countries.

PGG Wrightson said it used to do live shipments but had not done any for a while because the market for these shipments had dropped.

The minister said the policy would apply to cattle at this stage, but that might not be the end of it.

""The vast majority of the value of [shipped] animals is horses that go around the world.

""We [also] have exports of day-old chicks, as well as goats and others.

""Cattle are where we have had difficulty in ensuring the welfare of animals when they reach their destination, but there may be other incidents where we need to have a closer look at other animals species.""","Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/77718/eight_col_76574689_l.jpg?1554327405,"['face', 'exports', 'zealand', 'shipping', 'shipments', 'live', 'sri', 'lanka', 'cattle', 'review', 'valued', 'conditions', 'crackdown', 'animals', 'deaths', 'wrightson']", 
77,77,Drought Sri Lanka,'Chilling reality': Afghanistan suffers worst floods in seven years - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/06/chilling-reality-afghanistan-suffers-worst-floods-in-seven-years,"Afghanistan has been hit with the worst flooding in seven years, with 20 dead, thousands of homes swept away and many families, already displaced by drought, forced to leave their homes for the second time.

The latest climate shock, which affected eight provinces including Kandahar, came as the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan criticised the European Commission for its “wholly insufficient” response to hunger and suffering in a country already in the grip of what analysts describe as the world’s deadliest conflict.

Toby Lanzer said he was “shocked and surprised” at the low level of engagement from donors to the crisis in Afghanistan, where more than 13 million people are severely food insecure and a further 3.6 million are “one step away from famine”. The levels of hunger, he said, were unprecedented, after an 11-month drought which has ravaged the north and west of the country. He said the suffering on the ground was “as bad as I’ve ever seen”.

“It is a combination of high levels of violence, a devastating drought, bitter cold and abject poverty. It is a very chilling reality.”

Lanzer, the UN’s deputy special representative in Afghanistan, said the UN had set a “modest” target of $612m (£465m) to appeal to donors. It is only 3% funded so far, “which at the end of February is shocking”, he said.

Afghanistan has suffered the worst drought in recent years, resulting in the humanitarian crisis that has displaced 260,000, more people last year than the war between Afghan forces and the Taliban. Flash floods are common after a drought, because it kills bushes and other vegetation that trap water as well as drying out land, further limiting water absorption during heavy rains.

Khalil ur Rehman, 54, a farmer from southern Kandahar province, told the Guardian: “We are again on the move, but this time due to flooding. Last year our entire family had left the village because of drought which had severely affected agriculture and now rains have destroyed our livestock.”

Kandahar province received 75mm of rainfall last year, much less than the required level of at least 400 a year.

Abdul Hanan Moneeb, the province’s deputy governor, said an estimated 2,000 homes had been damaged by the floods.

“The current flooding is the worst in at least seven years,” said Moneeb. “It has destroyed the nomadic herders’ camps and caused loss of their livestock.”

Heavy snowfall across Afghanistan has cut off many areas and raised fears of further floods in the spring.

Ahmad Tamim Azimi, of Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said Kandahar, Herat and Farah were the worst affected areas.

“Since February, at least 95 people have been killed across Afghanistan and 10 people are missing from Kandahar,” Azimi said. “We have requested the INGOs provide relief to the people across the country.”

The European Commission is providing an initial donation of €25m to meet humanitarian need in Afghanistan, but said it may give more depending on future requirements.

“It is somewhat surprising, as people who are in deep distress move,” said Lanzer. “First they move inside the country, and then they move to Europe. This is one of the points I made in Brussels.”

Afghans make up the largest group of asylum seekers travelling to Europe, after Syrians, according to the latest Eurostat data.

The main donors to the UN’s humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan last year were the US, with $183m, the UK, with $82m, and the European Commission, with $48m.

Lanzer said the UK had been generous last year and he was confident of its continuing support, expecting an announcement soon.

An EU official said the commission was a “leading global donor” for Afghanistan and had announced €474m in 2018 to support state building and public reforms, as well as for migration and displacement challenges.","Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5420b93f8a6384338cbf14ec79ccf388d3cf7e/0_128_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f65190666eecba1e3da030f3f5259e6f,"['homes', 'european', 'worst', 'flooding', 'commission', 'kandahar', 'suffers', 'uns', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'reality', 'floods', 'humanitarian', 'chilling', 'seven']",

diplomatic enclave

ISLAMABAD - Sri Lankan national day was celebrated at a local hotel to mark the country’s 71st anniversary of the Independence in Islamabad.

The event was hosted by the high commissioner of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Srilanka Noordeen Mohamed Shaheid.

Sri Lankan national day, has been celebrated annually on 4th February to commemorate independence from British rule in 1948. Since then Sri Lanka is heading toward progress, development and is on the path of rapid economic growth.

A great number of people including ambassadors, diplomats, politicians, government official ,businessmen and civilians have attended the event.

Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan participated as the Chief Guest while Former Secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs Jalil Abbas Jailani and Brig (R) Mohammad Bashir wali were the guests of honour.

The Ambassador of Turkmenistan and Dean of Diplomatic Corps Atadjan Movlamov, High Commissioner of Bangladesh Tarik Ahsan, The ambassador of Nepal , Sewa Lamsal, the ambassador of Afghanistan Shukrullah Atif Mashal , ambassador of Maldives Ahmed Saleem, Economic affair Director General, Ministry of Sri Lanka Saroja Sirisena, Rabel Sadozai, Honorary Consul designate in Peshawar Nazimjaved Khan, Honorary consul designate in Lahore RamatullahJ aved, Vice-president CGSS Major General (R) Hafiz Masroor Ahmed were also sitting on the stage.

The military personnel of Pakistan were also present on the occasion which depicts that Sri lanka gives value and respect to Pakistani capable and disciplined armed forces. The chief guest Mehboob sultan lit the lamp and started the event. National anthems of Pakistan and Sri Lanka were played and a cake was also cut by the notables.

The number of participants was great therefore, the hall and the corridor became insufficient to cater the guests which were invited at the reception .The high commissioner of sri lanka and his spouse were receiving the guests in a very gentle manner along with the military attaché and their spouses .

Cultural dances made the event more fascinating and mesmerising. The guests were amazed by the Performance of the Troupe who especially came all the way from Sri Lanka to perform on this auspicious occasion. The performances successfully portrayed Sri Lanka’s culture, traditions and lifestyle.

Sri Lankan classical dance is famous all around the world. There are three main styles of Sri Lanka dance which differ in their styles of body-movements, in the costumes worn by the performers and in the shape and size of the drums used to provide the rhythmic sound.

The Kandyan is the dance of the hill country. It is also known as Uda Rata Natum. The low country dances (Ruhunu ) of the southern plains is known as Pahatha Rata Natum , the third is Sabaragamuwa Natum. The main distinguishing feature between Kandyan and Saharagamu and Ruhunu is that Ruhunu dancers wear masks.

Raban dance is a very popular folk dance in Sri Lanka which is performed by using a specific drum known as “Raban. Performers of Wadigapatuna Dance from the Southern part of Sri Lanka highlighted the ritual known as ‘Suniam Maduwa’, seeking protection from the evil effects of adverse planetary positions. Other performances included MagulBera with Puja dance, Mask dance combination, Peacock dance (MayuraNatuma) and Kala and Pathuru folk dance.

Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan delivered a thought provoking speech in his speech extended sincerest wishes and warm felicitations to the Government and people of Sri Lanka on behalf of the Government of Pakistan. He said that Pakistan not only deeply appreciates but also values its brotherly relations with Sri Lanka that have been nurtured over decades and are characterised by the elements of cordiality, mutual support and common interests.

He further said that relationship with Sri Lanka has stood the test of time. Pakistan has always supported the Sri Lanka in testing times, be it drought or its war against terrorism, and Sri Lanka has also reciprocated the goodwill. He also recalled, Sri Lankan cricket team visit to Pakistan which led to the revival of Cricket on our home grounds. He said our people to people contacts materialised in the form of the love of cricket, educational scholarships, cultural exchanges and tourism.

He said that Pakistan hold Vesak Festival every year and hands over Holy relics from Taxila museum to Sri Lanka for exposition in Sri Lanka during the Vessk Festival. He invited the Sri Lankan people, majority having Buddhism as religious affiliation, to explore Pakistan – the home to Buddhist civilisation.

In educational sector, he said that Pakistan encourages Sri Lankan students to study in Pakistan and offered to develop a “Knowledge Corridor” for Sri Lankan students. Under corridor Pakistan would be offering 1,000 scholarships to students from Sri Lanka over a period of 5 years.

He further informed that the 5th round of Foreign Secretary-level bilateral political consultations was held in October 2017 and The 6th Round of bilateral political consultations is due and we look forward to holding it at an early date this year.

He said, we would also like to elevate trade and investment ties with Sri Lanka to an Optimum potential under the framework of bilateral Free Trade Agreement.

He admired that the resilience of the people of Sri Lankan in the face of challenges presented by nature as well as posed by other circumstances. We have always stood by our Sri Lankan friends and will“do so in the time to come, he added.

The relationship between Pakistan and Sri lanka is a based on mutual friendship and cooperation at the honour of need. Pakistan army has played a very vital role in making and maintaining this relationship. It is also worth mentioning that Sri Lanka was the first country in the world which had the free trade agreement with Pakistan.

The appointment of Noordeen Mohamed Shaheid as The High Commissioner to Pakistan is a new development in the Pakistan and Sri lankan ties as Noordeen Mohammed Shaheid is the first ever Muslim high commissioner who is being appointed to Pakistan by the Sri lankan Government .He is a modest man and the way he organised his first reception in Islamabad it shows his potential and abilities to further strengthen the relations. He is keen to involve the top business leaders to encourage the existing bilateral relations and is willing to make a difference in his tenure.

He made a short speech in which he said that Sri lanka and Pakistan are two brother in south Asia region and our relations are always very good and cordial. He said Sri Lanka held Pakistan in high esteem for its support in eliminating terrorism and strengthening other areas of cooperation. he also admired the services of former Foreign Secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani and zameer Akramfor timely providing assistance and supporting the resolution of Sri Lanka in United Nation Human rights Council.

A short video clip to elaborate the beauty and the significance of the worthy Island of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Srilanka were also played.

Near town, the narrow lane leading to the evangelical Zion Church, where one of the bombers blew himself up, just as his fellow jihadists did at two Catholic churches in Colombo and Negombo, is cordoned off.

Sri Lankans are yet to fully comprehend the dreadful Easter blasts that shook the country less than a fortnight ago, killing over 250 people across churches and hotels in and around the capital Colombo, and in this eastern city some 300 km away. They are grappling with possible reasons and necessary responses with urgency, evident in the many statements and solidarity messages emerging from different religious and civil society groups.

But the people of Batticaloa have an additional burden.

While Sri Lanka’s Muslims, who make up nearly 10% of the population, are scattered across the island, their highest concentration is in the Eastern Province, comprising Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara districts.

Apart from losing 28 of its residents, including 14 children who were at Sunday school on April 21, Batticaloa is also where Zahran Hashim, the alleged mastermind of the Easter attacks, hailed from. Perhaps for that reason, the district has remained in the spotlight, more often figuring in tales about a radical Islamist-turned-suicide bomber and much less in those about victims of his ghastly act.

Stories of pastor Kumaran who lost his 11-year-old son, the parents of young siblings Sharon and Sarah, and the family of Ramesh Raju, who tried intercepting the suicide bomber and died, faded within days.

Even as different narratives of the distressing episode compete for credibility, Muslims and Christians suddenly find themselves cast on either side of the atrocity as “perpetrators” and “victims”, despite many knowing that those who perished were not all Christians and despite much of the Muslim community vehemently condemning the attacks carried out by a small radical group as “barbaric”. More perplexing is the nature of the attack itself — of Muslims targeting Christians, fellow minorities, with whom they have no known animosity. In fact, in Sri Lanka’s post-war years, Muslims and, in fewer instances, Christians have faced violent attacks from hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist forces.

While scores of affected families struggle to cope with the shock and those stubborn Easter morning memories that won’t leave, the people of Batticaloa appear to be bracing for other likely repercussions, not fully known, but potentially dangerous. Their scenic coastal town with lush paddy lands around, and a calming lagoon running through, unexpectedly turned into a site of horror on Easter day.

“The Christians are shattered,” says Fr. Rajan Rohan, attached to the St. John’s church in Batticaloa, which is run by the American Ceylon Mission. Hailing from the nearby Valaichchenai town, he returned to Batticaloa last September, after completing assignments in the northern Jaffna city during the final years of the war, and later in Nuwara Eliya, in the Central Province. “When I came back here, I was shocked to see how much this place had changed.”

As a child, Fr. Rohan recalls being thrilled around Ramzan. “We loved that kanji (porridge) our neighbours made with beef stock. It was a delicacy that we eagerly awaited every year,” he says. Muslim families sharing treats with children in the neighbourhood was not uncommon, and words like “co-existence” had no use in an effortlessly multireligious society.

But in 2018, things were different in Fr. Rohan’s home town. “There was a lot of Islamophobia among our Tamil people. In a country that has paid a heavy price because of Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarianism, it was startling to see Tamils so preoccupied with Muslims,” he recalls. “They would say things like ‘we can never trust Muslims’ easily in conversation.”

Kattankudy, which is among the most densely populated areas in the island.

Sri Lanka’s Muslims are mostly Tamil-speaking, but identify as a separate ethnic group, distinct from Tamils, most of whom are Hindus and the rest Christians. The three-decade-long civil war not only saw raging hostility between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils, who bore the brunt of the carnage, but also witnessed Tamil-Muslim relations sour.

Despite being bound by language, they grew apart, with the Tamil militants seeing the Muslims as aligned to and aiding the state security forces that they were fighting. The 1990 mosque massacres in Kattankudy and nearby Eravur, in which the LTTE mowed down nearly 150 Muslims at prayer, and the LTTE’s mass expulsion of Muslims from the north later that year, have left a long shadow of bitterness and resentment.

On his return, Fr. Rohan, who leads an interfaith initiative, found it hard to bring Tamils and Muslims together. “But we were trying. And just when we had begun working on those lines, this [bombings] has happened,” he says, pointing to the “daunting” task ahead.

Strained ties

It is not just Tamil-Muslim ties that witnessed a change in the past decades. The Muslim community has seen substantial changes within, according to A.L.M. Sabeel, a member of the local Urban Council and a former secretary of the Kattankudy Mosques Federation.

Starkly different from the rest of Batticaloa, Kattankudy town stands out. Short date palm trees line the median cutting through this town for some 50 metres, with shops on either side selling garments, gadgets and other essentials. Several mosques and cultural centres can be seen along the main road, while thousands of families live in crammed houses along the streets off the main road. The township is among the most densely populated areas in the island.

“Women of my mother’s generation used to wear a saree, wrapping their heads with the pallu. But in the last 15-20 years, we see more women switching to the abaya [full gown]. The face veil is an even more recent thing,” notes Sabeel, 45, who was raised here. Among men, the full-length white robes and long beards are recent imports. “My father was clean-shaven. But many men of my generation, including myself, sport a beard,” he says, attributing the relatively newer trends to more labour migration to West Asian countries, Arab funding for local institutions and consequent interactions, and social media exposure. “I don’t think some of these ideas suit us, especially these clothes in such hot weather.”

However, changes in attire, he points out, coincided with “a more significant shift”. “We are a minority in this country and have historically embraced a Sri Lankan identity. But in recent times, many Muslims appear keen on asserting their religious identity, often in the name of culture.” The community, in his view, also turned more insular during this time.

Meanwhile, some within the community question this new, relatively more rigid idea of “Islamic culture”. Culture is about convenience, argues a 40-year-old mother of three. “I wear the abaya when I go out somewhere but prefer a salwar kameez with a headscarf when I visit my doctor. Culture is what you want to make of it. Some people might criticise you over your choices but isn’t that the case in every community?”

Accommodating different shades of opinion on the practice of Islam, Islamic culture and assertion, Sri Lankan Muslims have largely remained together as a community, with trade being a key binding factor. Although Muslims of the east were engaged in agriculture, fisheries and livelihoods such as weaving in the past, they became a predominantly trading community over the years.

“It is true that Muslims mobilise well and maintain good networks within the community. And that irritates many Tamils,” Sabeel notes.

A troubled youth

Thangavel Roshan, 28, took the Easter weekend off and travelled from Colombo, where he works at a construction site. “We usually work all seven days to accumulate our days off to travel home,” he says, seated outside his home in Navatkudah in Batticaloa. A few metres into this locality, concrete roads give way to rickety mud roads.

His right leg is bandaged and kept raised on a plastic stool. Roshan, along with his family, was at Zion Church on Easter Sunday when he saw the bomb explode right in front of his eyes. “I was lucky, I escaped with this injury,” he says. His parents and siblings too did, as they were further away. Doctors have advised Roshan three months’ rest before he can get back to work. “If there were enough jobs here, I wouldn’t be working so far away. A big chunk of my salary goes for the commute [Colombo is an eight-hour bus ride away]. I haven’t saved a rupee so far,” he says.

His older brother Thangavel Nelson works at a highway project in Kurunegala in the North Western Province. “They say post-war development and all that; I think that happened only in the north. The east hasn’t got anything... no factories, no development, no jobs. We have to struggle outside for such little money,” he sulks, blaming Tamil politicians “who don’t care.”

“But look at Muslims,” he says, voicing what appears to be a popular grievance among many Tamils. “They get government jobs, they prosper in business. Unlike us, they are very secure.”

Much of the antagonism is also linked to the ongoing struggles around resources in the district, according to Sitralega Maunaguru, retired professor at the Eastern University in Batticaloa.

“There are a lot of simmering tensions between the communities over allocation of land in many areas, and in sharing water. People of different communities accuse each other’s local politicians of manipulating and favouring their people,” she says, adding that conversations on these subjects often quickly escalate to anti-Muslim speech. “The recent bombings are bound to fan those tensions.”

Muslim politicians and their patronage networks are common talking points among Tamils. As partners in Sri Lanka’s ruling coalition, Muslim leaders hold key ministerial portfolios, while the main Tamil party is in opposition. Tamil leaders, in turn, are seen as lacking political power or the will to make a difference.

With clashing interests of the political class and the leaders’ vote bank manoeuvres shaping their realities, people, especially the youth, appear to be entangled in a web of insecurities — political, economic and social.

“Their politicians take good care of them. Muslim people can get away with anything,” says Nelson matter-of-factly.

Old prejudice, new fear

This view, which is shared by many others, is precisely what makes Fr. Rohan rather nervous. Inter-community relations, which are also ethnic relations in this context, are fragile and need to be handled with great care, he observes. “We have to sensitise our [Tamil] community, including children. Even in jest, a Tamil child should not tell a Muslim friend anything like, ‘we can’t trust you guys, you’ll drop a bomb’.”

Clearly, Fr. Rohan’s immediate concern was about preventing any backlash against the Muslims. “While we comfort the affected families, it is important to try and prevent adverse reactions. We don’t want others to use our name and attack the Muslims for what a small, isolated group did. That will lead to more hate and clashes in our society.”

His apprehension is rooted in two main reasons. One, the delicate social relations that prevail in the multi-ethnic districts of the Eastern Province, where Muslims are the single largest group, constituting 38% of the population. The province is also home to some 6 lakh Tamils (Hindus and Christians), and 3.5 lakh Sinhalese (Buddhists and Christians), making it one of Sri Lanka’s most diverse regions. Two, the spate of anti-Muslim violence in varying intensities, and led by hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist groups in the last seven years, has made Muslims more vulnerable.

Further, he emphasises that Tamil society cannot afford another cycle of violence and distress. “If our youth resort to militancy again, some of us will turn targets very soon. We saw that happen with the LTTE, where the organisation we nurtured turned against us when we voiced disagreement or dissent.”

The government too has a role in preventing any retaliation, he notes. “They were quick to ban the radical Islamist organisations behind the attacks as ‘terrorist’ outfits. They ought to show the same promptness when it comes to radical Sinhala-Buddhist organisations notorious for inciting violence.”

In the current Sri Lankan context, his fears of a backlash are well-founded — where post-war reconciliation has dragged, a political solution to the Tamil question remains out of sight, and youth across ethnicities are disgruntled amid growing joblessness. Especially so in the wake of Sri Lankan authorities naming the little-known local radical Islamist group, the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ), and its allies as perpetrators of the Easter attacks, which the Islamic State has also claimed.

Whether it is the NTJ’s links abroad, or the rationale for their targets (churches and hotels) or the extent of radicalisation within the Muslim community, questions outnumber answers at this point. But those feeling uneasy about the likely impact of the attacks say there is no time to waste.

The peril of radicalisation

With the government claiming that Hashim was among the nine suicide bombers who carried out the coordinated bombings, some may believe the problem is over, but it is hardly so, according to M.B.M. Firthous, a Kattankudy-based preacher, who also heads a local school. “The conciliatory statements that different religious leaders made after the attacks talk about peace and co-existence, but those are things that have to be said. The problem, unfortunately, runs deeper,” he says. The sooner it is acknowledged, the greater the chances of addressing it, he notes.

After every incident of an anti-Muslim attack in recent years, “some forces” within the Muslim community tried to radicalise youth through classes and videos, urging them to retaliate. But the community had no appetite for it and rejected it outright, according to different mosque leaders in the province.

“A few youth were perhaps ideologically drawn to a more rigid interpretation and practice of Islam, at times due to social media influences. Others, who were deeply affected by the anti-Muslim attacks, found the radical path speaking to their outrage. But they were very, very few and didn’t have any support from the community,” says Sabeel.

But radicalisation is not about numbers, Firthous cautions. “If the idea has been sown in even one person’s mind, we have to be very worried,” he says, pointing to an “urgent need” for introspection within the Muslim community. “We cannot afford to isolate ourselves. There is a lot to be done by all communities.” He also blames the many peace-building efforts that followed the civil war: “They were run by NGOs and well-funded by donors, but they merely scratched the surface without any meaningful effort or reflection on the part of communities.”

And today, the outrage over the disparities and injustices accumulated over years of war and peace is manifesting in new, grievous ways. About a week after the victims of the blast were laid to rest in Batticaloa, and amid several interfaith meetings and messages of assurance, a group of young men went around parts of Batticaloa on motorbikes, distributing flyers asking Tamils to boycott Muslim-owned shops and to quit working there. “We, the youth, must be aware and prevent terrorists who, in the garb of traders, enter our towns,” says the provocative leaflet attributed to ‘Tamil youth, Eastern Province’.

According to a resident who received it on Wednesday night, a trishaw (three-wheeler) followed the motorbikes, with someone inside speaking through a loudspeaker. They were “clearly stoking hatred”, says the resident, who asked not to be named. “We don’t know who got the youth to distribute the flyers. It could be anyone seeking political mileage from this tragic moment. But sadly, they might get it. Even at the cost of more violence and bloodshed, perhaps.”","Sat, 04 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/wfrn2h/article27028307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEADLANKAN-MUSLIMS,"['line', 'tamil', 'muslim', 'youth', 'postwar', 'christians', 'lanka', 'sri', 'muslims', 'batticaloa', 'fault', 'community', 'different', 'tamils']",

An intense drought related to this year’s El Niño phenomenon has precipitously lowered the level of Panama’s Gatun Lake, forcing the country’s Canal Authority to impose draft limits this week on ships moving through the waterway’s recently expanded locks.

The restrictions on how deep the vessels can reach below the surface means large ships, primarily from the United States and China, must pass through with less cargo, which translates into lower revenue for the voyages. The driest period in memory for the canal basin is also hitting small indigenous villages that depend on tourism along the tributaries of the inter-oceanic passage.

The economic hit to canal operators stands to be minor an estimated $15 million this year, compared with the $2.5 billion in revenue generated in 2018. But the drought and the resulting restrictions highlight the difficulties Panama faces in satisfying increased demand for fresh water to feed the canal while irrigating fields and keeping the taps flowing in the capital as climate change threatens more extreme weather events.

“This year I do not think there will be problems with drinking water... due to the resources we have,” Steve Paton, who heads the long-term climate monitoring programme at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, said, referring to an accumulation of rainfall from the last rainy season.

“As for the future, it is difficult to forecast,” Mr. Paton continued. “But we are observing in the canal area that climatic events are becoming increasingly extreme. ...The biggest droughts and the eight or nine largest storms have occurred in the last 20 years, in the same way that 2014 to 2016 were the driest years in the canal’s history.”

El Niño is a recurring phenomenon in which warm ocean temperatures in the Pacific lead to drier than usual conditions in some areas and wetter in others.

Carlos Vargas, vice-president of environment and water for the Canal Authority, said recently that Gatun one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, with an area of 436 sq. km was 4.6 feet (1.4 metre) below normal levels for this time of year. It has dropped more than a half foot (0.2 metre) since early April. A smaller lake that also supplies the waterway, Alajuela, was 7.2 feet (2.2 metre) below usual.

“These low levels in the Panama Canal are the product of four or five months of almost zero precipitation,” Mr. Vargas said. “It really has been the driest dry season we’ve had in the history of the canal. The flow of rivers to the lake is down 60%.”

That forced the Canal Authority to notify customers in early April that the maximum freshwater draft of 44 feet (13.41 metre) for Neopanamax vessels would be a foot less beginning at the end of the month. It marks the fourth reduction in drafts imposed during the current dry season, which runs from January through April. When water levels are optimal, maximum draft for those ships is about 50 feet (15.2 metre).

The limits affect only the Cocoli and Agua Clara Locks, a multibillion-dollar project inaugurated in 2016 to accommodate the larger Neopanamax ships. On average, 7 1/2 vessels move through those locks daily day, though there have been days with as many as 12 crossings.

The canal charges shipping companies based on a vessel’s capacity and also a percentage of the cargo it carries, so lighter ships mean less profit for everyone.

The Canal Authority has had to deal with extreme weather patterns in the past. A severe dry season also associated with El Niño in 2015-2016 affected the crossing of cargo in the old locks and cost $40 million in revenue.

The canal and most Panamanians rely on rains over a watershed of more than 3,000 sq. km covered with forests, rivers and lakes that generates 95% of the water consumed by Panama City and Colon, whose metro areas combined are home to nearly half the country’s population of just over 4 million.

Panama has one of the highest levels of annual rainfall among tropical countries. Last year marked one of the highest amounts of rainfall on record for the basin, which experts say has helped cushion the ravages of the current drought.

“Gatun and Alajuela lakes have been below optimum levels, but on the other hand it could have been much worse,” Mr. Paton said.

The canal is promoting short-term drought measures such as suspending generation of hydroelectric power at Gatun as well as water recycling via tubs in the new locks that cut water use by 60%.

“This has helped us alleviate the effect for the moment,” Mr. Vargas said. “In the medium term, we will continue with reforestation programs in the basin” that have already resulted in more than 17,000 acres (7,000 hectares) of plantings.

Mr. Paton forecast that the canal has enough water to last at least 18 years, although if extreme climate patterns persist, water could reach precariously low levels within 15 years.

The Canal Authority says it needs more water reserves to cushion the impact of extreme events. Canal administrator Jorge Luis Quijano has said that before considering another set of locks, an additional source on the scale of Gatun or Alajuela would be necessary. The lakes fill when it rains heavily, but there is no place to store that surplus during the dry season.

During a recent boat tour of Gatun, numerous tree trunks flooded more than a century ago when the lake was created were dried out and exposed to the sun.

Water supply for citizens so far has not been affected by the drought, but small indigenous communities scattered along the Gatun’s tributaries have been hit.

Telvinia Tascūn, an artisan in San Antonio Wounaan on the Gatun river, said tourists typically visit every day to buy handicrafts, but lately the outboard motorboats are having trouble navigating the depleted channels and the logs and mud at the docks.

Relief for them and canal operators could come by late May or mid-June, when torrential rains from the wet season fill the lakes.

“This is the strongest drought we can recall,” Mr. Tascūn said. “For me it’s sad. This never happened to us.”","Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/ke4x2i/article26990702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXPANAMACANALDROUGHT,"['gatun', 'levels', 'ships', 'extreme', 'fears', 'water', 'niño', 'el', 'drought', 'climate', 'canal', 'panama', 'mr', 'locks', 'lake', 'highlights', 'linked']", 
82,82,Drought Sri Lanka,Cook confident England can end World Cup drought - Sportstar,https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/alastair-cook-2019-england-world-cup-predictions-team-india-cirat-kohli/article26314600.ece,"Former England skipper Alastair Cook believes England can end decades of World Cup disappointment with a triumph on home soil this year.

England has never won the men's World Cup, but with 100 days to go until the start of the latest edition, a team captained by Eoin Morgan is top of the 50-over world rankings.

Cook, who retired from international cricket last year as the country's highest Test run-scorer and most-capped player, said there are several reasons why Morgan's men could go one better than the England teams that lost in the 1979, 1987 and 1992 finals.

“They're a very settled side, they've got 15 players pretty much nailed on for that squad,” Cook said at a World Cup event in London's Trafalgar Square on Tuesday.

READ: Sri Lanka needs to carry momentum into the World Cup, says Dilshan

“Everyone knows their role, they're very comfortable in their role, they've got a lot of strength in depth, they seem to have a lot of options covered and they're an exciting team to watch.

“They are a brilliant one-day side.”

Cook never played in a World Cup, with the left-handed opening batsman dramatically dropped from the squad that then failed to beat a fellow Test nation while suffering a group-stage exit at the 2015 edition in Australia and New Zealand.

But Cook said a change of attitude lay behind England's rise up the one-day rankings since that dismal display.

“Probably over the years we've really concentrated on Test cricket as a nation. Over the last three or four years we've really given the one-day cricket its due,” he said.

'Sky's the limit'

It was a point emphasised by former England spinner Graeme Swann, who said: “I just think England are picking the right team these days.

“They're picking one-day specialists and the sky's the limit.

“When they bat, people like Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, they think that (scoring) 400 is feasible rather than an impossible dream. I think England has finally picked a very aggressive team as well, with Eoin Morgan, who's a brilliant captain.

“They've got a team that is putting them in firm contention to win this World Cup,” insisted Swann, who added “I never thought we (England) would win it deep down when I was there.”

Swann was a member of the only England men's side to have won a major global trophy - the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean - and sees parallels between that team and Morgan's men.

“The only world trophy I thought we had a genuine chance of winning was the World Twenty20 in the West Indies that we did, because we were ahead of the curve there.

“We picked a team of specialists, people like Craig Kieswetter, Michael Lumb - and I think that's what England have finally started doing in the one-day game as well.”

'Never write off India'

But Swann warned that England would face several tough opponents in its quest for World Cup glory.

“You can never write off India, they are an exceptional one-day team, Virat Kohli is a brilliant captain, brilliant player.”

As for champions Australia, England's oldest rivals and five-times World Cup-winners, Swann said: “The Aussies are like Germany in the football - you can never write them off at a World Cup.”

Swann though said he was particularly looking forward to watching Pakistan, who won the 2017 Champions Trophy one-day tournament in Britain.

“They are so mercurial, you never know what you are going to get. When they are on fire, they are absolutely explosive and when they're not, they're awful.”","Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://sportstar.thehindu.com/incoming/article26314844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_590/gettyimages-1130671406-594x594jpg,"['swann', 'write', 'world', 'end', 'oneday', 'theyre', 'cup', 'drought', 'confident', 'england', 'team', 'think', 'cook', 'brilliant']", 
83,83,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka supplies US aircraft carrier as counterbalance to Beijing - Taiwan News,https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3626878,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Despite China's mounting clout due to the mountains of debt it has piled on Sri Lanka, the tiny island nation stood up to Beijing by supplying a U.S. aircraft carrier last week.

As part of what is being described as a ""temporary cargo transfer initiative"" that began on Jan. 24, Sri Lanka provided supplies to the USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). The gesture appears to be an attempt to balance Colombo's ties with Beijing, as it moves full steam ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with Sri Lanka being the key linchpin in a network based on massive debt.

On Jan. 23, the U.S. 7th Fleet published an article in which it described a cargo plane's mission to obtain supplies from Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo:

""A C-2A Greyhound carrier onboard delivery aircraft from Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 30 (VRC-30) operated from Bandaranaike International Airport near Colombo. The C-2A received a variety of supplies transferred earlier in the week from a U.S. Navy C-40A Clipper logistics aircraft and then flown back to John C. Stennis.""

The supplies included spare parts, tools, personal mail, paper goods, and other items. Lt. Cmdr. Brett Learner described the exchange as the second time the Sri Lankan government had provided supplies for the ship and emphasized the strategic significance of the gesture: ""The opportunity to conduct a temporary cargo transfer in Colombo for a second time provides a resource in a strategic location in the Indian Ocean that we can leverage while in the area.”

The article indicated that, rather than merely kowtowing to Beijing's one-sided BRI, it is seeking to position itself as a strategic hub in the Indo-Pacific for many nations. The article cited U.S. Ambassador Alaina B. Teplitz as saying, ""Sri Lanka’s leaders have outlined their vision for the country’s regional engagement that reflects its location at the nexus of the Indo-Pacific and seizes the opportunities that this unique position presents.""

Teplitz also expressed the interest of the U.S. in working with Sri Lanka in providing more services and goods for U.S. military and commercial ships traversing the region as it seeks to counter Beijing's BRI. ""We are happy to support this vision through a range of mutually beneficial initiatives, such as contracting Sri Lankan services and goods to support U.S. military and commercial vessels that often transit the Indo-Pacific’s busy sea lanes,"" said Teplitz.

After Sri Lanka racked up more than US$8 billion in dept to state-controlled Chinese companies, the country formally handed over the port of Hambantota to China for 99 years in 2017, alleviating only US$1.1 billion of the debt owed to Beijing. In January of this year, a Chinese state-owned company completed a US$1.4 billion land reclamation project near the country's largest shipping hub, the Port of Colombo, in a move likely designed to secure a choke hold on the port.","Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://tnimage.s3.hicloud.net.tw/photos/shares/5c4e7c6410e19.jpg,"['near', 'port', 'supplies', 'counterbalance', 'lanka', 'sri', 'goods', 'described', 'colombo', 'beijing', 'carrier', 'support', 'strategic', 'aircraft']",

In some major cities, railway stations have set up toilets only for the use of foreign tourists.

Extraction in rivers and beaches has increased pollution and flooding, lowered groundwater levels, hurt marine life, and exacerbated the occurrence and severity of landslides and drought, UN says.

Sand mining is eroding the world's river deltas and coastlines, damaging the environment and hurting livelihoods from Cambodia to Colombia, as government regulation fails to keep pace with rising demand, the United Nations warned on Tuesday.

Global demand for sand and gravel, used extensively in construction, is about 50 billion tonnes or an average of 18 kg (40 lb) per person per day, according to a report published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).

Extraction in rivers and beaches has increased pollution and flooding, lowered groundwater levels, hurt marine life, and exacerbated the occurrence and severity of landslides and drought, it said.

""We are spending our sand 'budget' faster than we can produce it responsibly,"" Joyce Msuya, UNEP's acting executive director, said in a statement.

""For one of the most traded commodities on the planet, it is one of the least regulated activities, and there is very low general awareness about extraction impacts.""

Growing populations, increasing urbanisation, land reclamation projects, and rapid infrastructure development in countries such as China and India have increased demand for sand three-fold over the last two decades, the UNEP said.

The biggest losers

Meanwhile, damming of rivers and excessive extraction have reduced the sediment carried by rivers to coastal areas, leading to reduced deposits in river deltas and faster beach erosion.

""Communities in the Asian deltas are the biggest losers, with the combined effect of sand mining, hydropower dams and groundwater extraction causing large areas of land to sink and shrink,"" said Marc Goichot at the Worldwide Fund for Nature.

""But as long as demand for sand remains high and no alternative sourcing is available, enforcement is close to impossible, as the economy is based on sand,"" said Goichot, a water expert who contributed to the UNEP report.

Current legal frameworks are not sufficient, and ""sand mafias"" comprising builders, businessmen and dealers in countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, India, Kenya and Sierra Leone regularly flout existing laws, said the UNEP report.

The science to support responsible consumption and extraction is lagging, it said, adding that new technologies and materials that can substitute or limit the use of traditional concrete are growing in use, but still limited.

In India, a 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation revealed that workers were drowning while illegally mining sand in some parts of the country.

While awareness of the impacts of sand mining has grown, and more laws are in place, greater efforts are needed to map supply and demand for effective regulation, said Sumaira Abdulali of environmental advocacy group Awaaz Foundation.

""Communities are losing their land and their homes because of sand mining, but they are split over the issue because some people make a living from it, while others say it is ruining their lives,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""Sand is too plain, too ubiquitous to get the sort of attention that illegally mined diamonds have. But it deserves just as much attention, because its impact is so tremendous.""

Hundreds of thousands of fish have died in the third mass kill on a stretch of a major Australian river in recent weeks that local officials blame on drought but critics say at least partly stems from water mismanagement.

The latest deaths began Sunday night in the Darling River near the township of Menindee in western New South Wales state.

That's the same area where hundreds of thousands of fish were found floating dead in early January and shortly before Christmas.

The suspected cause is hot weather leading to an algal bloom that has starved the water of oxygen.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian blamed an extended drought.

But Menindee Regional Tourist Association president Rob Gregory says officials let farmers take too much water for irrigation.

Droughts in Pailin, Banteay Meanchey

Some areas in Pailin and Banteay Meanchey provinces are facing water shortages due to prolonged drought, though no major impacts have been reported, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology.

Chan Yutha said some areas in Oddar Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Thom, Prey Veng, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap and Koh Kong provinces are also facing water shortages.

“The effects are not serious. In downtown areas such as Battambang province’s Moung Russey and Kors Kralor districts, we have transferred enough water for consumption to the affected areas. We can say it is completely safe. There is no problem anymore. We can transport water to intervene [in time],” he said.

Yutha said there were minor water shortages in Siem Reap province, while in Banteay Meanchey province, villagers still had enough water for consumption.

“What makes the ministry worry is the current state of the Ang Trapaing Thma reservoir in Banteay Meanchey province, because villagers have pumped almost all the water from the reservoir into their rice fields. Because of this, the water will run out quickly, so we need to extend the reservoir by over 6km. We have so far dug more than 4km and can [soon] finish digging. After that, water can flow into the reservoir quickly and it will no longer lack water,” he said.

To tackle drought, the government has issued an urgent notice calling on farmers not to grow crops in dry season this year to avoid damage to their yields. However, Yutha said people in some areas were failing to heed the appeal.

“We’re concerned. We are no longer allowing the growing of crops, otherwise there will be bigger impacts,” he said.

Yutha said the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology and local authorities have prepared machinery, water pumps and vehicles for distributing water to villagers in case of emergency, while also building more wells in areas vulnerable to drought.

“We have prepared between 50 and 60 water trucks. So far only seven to eight trucks have been used. We will increase the number of trucks if necessary,” he said.

Koh Kong provincial governor Mithona Phouthorng told The Post on Sunday that water shortages in the province occurred only in the provincial town, Khemarak Phoumin. She said the issue was not serious as the province has its own water source and authorities had intervened and distributed water.

“The province is ready to solve the issue of water shortages. We have tried to contact villagers in areas that face water shortages and told relevant authorities to be ready in finding water sources for distribution to villagers.""

“In our provincial town, we have two water sources with [reserved water of around 80,000 cubic metres] – one at the Ta Porn waterfall and another one on Road 48. For remote areas, we’ve asked local authorities to take responsibility in distributing water to people,” she said.

Battambang provincial governor Nguon Ratanak said on Sunday that his province had successfully resolved the issue of water shortages. For areas that lacked water, he said the Ministry of Agriculture and provincial authorities had cooperated to dig canals and pump water to fill canals for water storage and consumption.

“We have pumped water into the canals in districts that lack water. We were prepared after the ministry warned of water shortages more than a month ago. If the drought continues or if there are any changes, we will act accordingly.”","Mon, 25 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/a_dried_out_field_in_suphanburi_provinces_bang_pla_ma_district_in_thailand_on_july_2_2015._some_areas_in_pailin_and_banteay_meanchey_provinces_are_facing_water_shortages._nicolas_asfouriafp.jpg,"['shortages', 'provinces', 'ministry', 'banteay', 'province', 'droughts', 'pailin', 'water', 'meanchey', 'provincial', 'authorities', 'areas']", 
89,89,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought has brought Karnataka’s Bhovi well-diggers back to centrestage - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/society/drought-has-brought-karnatakas-bhovi-well-diggers-back-to-centrestage/article26406902.ece,"Until piped Cauvery water came to Bengaluru in 1972, open wells were the main source of drinking water

After 15 years, Shankar finds himself peering down a 60-ft well shaft at the dhobi ghat in Bengaluru’s Malleswaram neighbourhood. Here, a lakh or so clothes are washed every day.

The well is believed to be over 100 years old and its walls are overrun with shrubs. The water is covered with a thick green layer of the aquatic fern, azolla. Shankar and nine men of his team, all belonging to the Bhovi or Mannu Vaddar community of traditional well-diggers, will spend the entire day desilting, cleaning and reviving the giant well. “Because of the drought, the dhobi ghat has been buying water from private tankers and drawing from borewells that are fast running dry. So, the washermen’s association approached us to revive the well,” says Shankar.

He and his colleagues, Shankar recalls, had made the trip to the dhobi ghat from his village in the city’s outskirts to clean the same well 15 years ago. “We used to clean the well during the day and sleep next to it at night.”

Going down

As we watch, the well-diggers start cutting the shrubs at the mouth of the well. They then open the iron mesh that covers it and three men — Munikrishna, Srinivas and Pedanna — carefully descend into the depths with the help of thick ropes. What follows is an awe-inspiring drill of coordination, camaraderie and skill. First, the water must be pumped out. Then, bucket after bucket is lowered into the well and silt, muck and broken branches are pulled out. Then the azolla is cleared with a cane basket that acts as a sieve.

The water must now be made potable by adding alum, lime and potassium permanganate. “I learnt how to revive wells from my parents and grandparents. I was 15,” says Ramakrishna, one of the nine-member team.

Until piped Cauvery water came to the city in 1972, open wells were the main source of drinking water. Borewells came in the early 1980s, and the culture of open wells all but vanished, says S. Vishwanath, advisor, Biome Environmental Trust, which conducts research on water and sanitation.

Harvesting rainwater

Today, 40% of Bengaluru is dependent on groundwater. As per the regulations of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike and the water supply and sewerage board, all new and old buildings of a given size must harvest rainwater or face penalties. So, recharge wells, that collect rainwater and pump it into the ground, are becoming popular.

For instance, Indian Institute of Management Bangalore has over 60 recharge wells. And it is the Bhovi community that is helping dig, clean and maintain all these wells across Bengaluru.

As Karnataka faces its second consecutive year of drought — the government has declared 156 of the 176 talukas or 88% of the State drought hit — the well-diggers have been brought back to the centrestage of water management.

Bhovipalya village on the outskirts of Bengaluru is where Shankar and his colleagues live. In fact, every one of the 110 families in this village is from the Bhovi community. Here I meet Laxmi Amma, Shankar’s mother. As a little girl, she tells me, she often accompanied her parents when they went to dig wells. “Traditionally, both men and women used to dig wells, but women don’t do it any more,” she says.

The history of the Bhovi or Vaddar community is not clear. Some claim Vaddars came from Odisha while others say their ancestors came from Andhra Pradesh, as their primary language is Telugu. The tradition of well-digging exists in Maharastra and Gujarat too.

Vaddars are broadly divided into three groups: Mannu Vaddars work with soil; Kallu or Dagad Vaddars work with stone; while Ooru Vaddars grow ragi.

Bhovis belong to the Scheduled Castes and often face social ostracism. Pavitra, the daughter of a well-digger in Bhovipalya, is studying B.Com in a Bengaluru college. But she says: “If my friends get to know my parents are well-diggers they will stop talking to me. In any case, no one eats lunch with me,” she says, holding back tears.

It is only education that will bring dignity to the community, believes Ramaswami, Ramakrishna’s father, who has dug more wells than he can count. “I am illiterate and remember how my parents had to beg and struggle to feed me. I educated my son, who is doing better than me. My grandchildren study in an English medium school and have a brighter future.”

Meanwhile, the well at Malleswaram’s dhobi ghat is pristine now, and the city’s clothes can be washed clean once more.

In Pavagada taluk, which is reeling under severe drought, a monk has become a saviour for hundreds of peacocks, peahens, langurs, monkeys, and wild boars.

Hanumana Betta is a rocky hill 20 km from Pavagada, the perennially drought-hit taluk of Tumakuru district, and it is home to around 1,000 peacocks, 350 langurs, and various other animals.

Japananda Swami, of the Sri Ramakrishna Sevashram in Pavagada, came to know that some peacocks were dying owing to the lack of water. He went to the hill and found the carcasses of a few peacocks, and a wild boar.

Japananda Swami said that he was pained by the deaths and added that many langurs and peacocks from the hill migrated to other areas. “Some of them would frequently come to agricultural fields and destroy the crops. This had become a huge problem for the farmers of K. Rampura, which lies at the bottom of Hanumana Betta,” he said.

Moved by the plight of the animals, the monk decided to provide water and foodgrains to the animals on Hanumana Betta.

With the help of the Infosys Foundation, he has been able to supply water through tankers and pipes to the waterbodies atop the hill. Foodgrains are also provided to the animals every alternate day with the help of the villagers of K. Rampura.

Village children also help the monk and his men fill saucer bowls, constructed by the Forest Department, and stone ponds, which were cleaned and rebuilt, on top of the hill. The monk has also purchased a diesel motor to pump water from a borewell to the ponds, nearly 100ft high, on the hill.

A class 3 student of K. Rampura, Rahul, said: “I like to go to the hill, along with friends, to feed the peacocks. We will also collect the peacock feathers fallen on the ground and keep them in our books”.

K. Akkalappa, farmer, said that nearly 20 villagers carry 30 kg of soaked bengal gram, 15 kg of jowar, and 10 kg of peas to feed the birds.

He said: “I do it punctually as it helps me save my crops from birds which used to come and destroy them due to lack of food and water on the hill”.

The monk said that he would continue to provide water and foodgrains to the birds and the animals until the taluk gets rains.

He added that those animals, which had migrated to the villages and towns, have returned back to the hill.","Mon, 13 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r4ma0c/article27110589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGMONK2,"['saviour', 'peacocks', 'tumakuru', 'pavagada', 'langurs', 'droughthit', 'water', 'taluk', 'kg', 'turns', 'animals', 'hill', 'monk', 'swami']",

The drought raging in Aurangabad has made the waters recede at Nath Sagar reservoir, and Avadhoot's village Pimpalwadi can be seen again. Now in his 50s, Avadhoot stands on the spot where his house once stood. A broken stone structure brings back memories of the flood — it is one of the few features that has survived the deluge.

The receding waters have uncovered a century-old Narasimha temple, a Hanuman temple, the Pirbaba dargah, a math, the Aurangabad-Paithan road, and a bridge. Shivaji Khillare has often sailed on the river and fished in the reservoir's waters, and he was amazed at the magnificent structures that the riverbed yielded.

He says he has heard stories from his 90-year-old father Rambhau about how Savkheda village submerged when the dam was built.

DURHAM, England (AP) — A World Cup semifinal spot seems a long way off for a Sri Lanka lineup that lost its captain on the first ball of Friday's group game against South Africa and was dismissed for 203.

There was potential for a sting in the tail of the innings. A swarm of insects, reportedly bees, halted the game for some minutes in the 48th over. All the players and both umpires went to ground, face down, to avoid any problems before play continued and the last two wickets were lost quickly.

The South Africans were out of semifinal contention after winning just one of its first seven games, but got on top quickly when skipper Faf du Plessis won the toss and sent the Sri Lankans in to bat.

Sri Lanka was coming off an upset win over England that changed the momentum of the tournament, exposing the hosts to the possibility of missing out on the playoffs.

Needing another win to move past Bangladesh and Pakistan and equal on eight points with fourth-place England, Sri Lanka will have to rely on another big bowling performance to defend a small total.

The Sri Lankans successfully defended a total of 232-9 in a 20-run win over England at Leeds a week ago, with veteran paceman Lasith Malinga taking four wickets.

On the up side for Malinga and his teammates, the bowlers dominated for South Africa in the first game of the tournament at Durham's county ground, with no batsman scoring more than 30.

Paceman Kagiso Rabada removed Dimuth Karunaratne with a well-directed short ball that the Sri Lanka skipper could only fend away to opposing captain du Plessis at second slip. That made Karunaratne just the second batsman dismissed on the first ball of a match in the 2019 World Cup, less than a week after New Zealand opener Martin Guptill's golden duck against West Indies.

Sri Lanka recovered through a 67-run partnership between second-wicket pair Avishka Fernando and Kusal Perera, who both scored 30, before recalled all-rounder Dwaine Pretorius dismissed them in the 10th and 12th overs.

Chris Morris picked up the key wicket of Angelo Mathews, who scored an unbeaten 85 against England, when the all-rounder dragged an attempted pull shot back onto his stumps and was out for 11.

The 30-year-old Pretorius, playing his first game since conceding 42 in seven overs and scoring just one run in South Africa's opening loss to England at the Oval, then dismissed Kusal Mendis (23) to return 3-25 from 10 overs — the most economical bowling figures so far at the tournament.

JP Duminy, another player returning to South Africa's XI, took a wicket with his first ball — Dhananjaya de Silva bowled after playing all around the ball on an attempted reverse sweep.

Rabada (2-36) and Morris (3-46) finished off the tailenders as Sri Lanka was bowled out in 49.3 overs.

Forum aims to address drought, flood effects

Cambodia-Thailand Mekong River Commission opened its second meeting in Phnom Penh on Thursday. The meeting aims to address the effects of the droughts and flooding the region is increasingly facing.

Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology secretary of state and chairman of the meeting, Ponh Sachak, said periods of flood and drought had been irregular over the past few years and the participation of all relevant parties were needed to effectively tackle the problem.

He highlighted Pailin province as one border area that had been particularly affected by flooding over recent years.

“Cambodia is located at a lower altitude than Thailand’s Chonburi province. Therefore, when it rains heavily on the border area, Pailin province’s Sala Krao district will be flooded.""

“Information sharing between the border authorities of both countries is very important to help each other prevent the natural disaster of flooding in time,” he said.

Suchart Sirijungsakul, the head of the Thai National Mekong Committee Secretariat and the meeting’s co-chair, said tackling the issue required cooperation and comprehensive and constructive comments from relevant parties in order to establish mechanisms for effective flood and drought management.

He said the meeting served as a platform for the joint study of the challenges of flood and drought management along the border in order to create a joint blueprint for implementing an action plan.

“We want to have a joint blueprint for implementing flood and drought management along the border areas,” he said.

During the meeting, experts from JBA Consulting said that increased floods and drought along the border, such as in Thailand’s Aranyaprathet district in Sa Kaeo province and Cambodia’s neighbouring Poipet town in Banteay Meanchey province, demanded work on reservoirs and irrigation systems in order to maintain the water supply during periods of drought.

Lay Sothy, the deputy director of the Banteay Meanchey provincial water resources department, told The Post that drought is seriously impacting rice cultivation in his province, with around 20,000ha of dry season rice plantations due to face a shortage of water.

“Experts are currently working with involved departments to save rice plantations and are instructing farmers to stop growing rice next month because water resources will be limited,” he said.","Fri, 01 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/mr.-suchart-sirijungl-mr.-ponh-sachakr-4.jpg,"['effects', 'mekong', 'meeting', 'province', 'flood', 'water', 'forum', 'drought', 'address', 'resources', 'aims', 'border', 'order', 'rice']", 
97,97,Drought Sri Lanka,Linking disaster risk management into economic policy planning in Sri Lanka - ft.lk,https://www.ft.lk/opinion/Linking-disaster-risk-management-into-economic-policy-planning-in-Sri-Lanka/14-674610,"By Kanchana Wickramasinghe



As several districts in Sri Lanka continue to recover from the prolonged drought last year, recurring floods and landslides hamper economic activities in the country. Sri Lanka was ranked as the second most affected country by the impacts of weather-related losses in 2017, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2019.



Worryingly, the country’s situation has worsened since 2016. This highlights Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to climate impacts and the need for effective policies. The good news is that the 2019 Budget proposes several measures to improve Sri Lanka’s disaster resilience, as shown in the diagram.



When it comes to natural disasters, it is the agriculture sector that is hit the hardest. The total damages and losses in the sector, due to floods and landslides in 2016, were estimated to be nearly Rs. 3.6 billion, according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA). The estimated cost for the loss of paddy alone was Rs. 553 million.

The Districts of Jaffna, Anuradhapura, and Mullaitivu – where communities heavily rely on farming – were the most affected. Meanwhile, a survey carried out in the Anuradhapura District revealed that climate-related disasters and rainfall uncertainties are prominent among a number of risks/uncertainties faced by farmers. As a result, 2019 Budget proposals provide a more secure supply of water for agriculture through multi-purpose development projects, canal construction projects and rehabilitation of tanks.





Management of disasters: Challenges and caps



Frequent natural disasters call for an efficient mechanism for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Sri Lanka. There have been notable improvements in disaster risk management over the years; considerable progress has been made to shift focus from post-disaster measures to improve preparedness to face disasters.



However, Sri Lanka’s recent experiences with natural disasters indicate that several areas of DRR are lagging behind, specifically, the ‘preparedness’ component which has not received due attention; disaster relief mechanisms, including disaster compensation, showed notable inefficiencies, as noted during the floods in 2017.



There were significant targeting issues in providing relief to people affected by natural disasters in 2016 and 2017, as revealed by the Sri Lanka Rapid Post Disaster Needs Assessment Floods and Landslides – May 2017. The distribution of relief goods, such as food, water, and medicine, was not inclusive, as key socio-economic information about affected groups were missing.

The issue was more severely felt when providing relief items to highly vulnerable groups such as infants, women, and the elderly. Also, the remote areas, with limited access due to poor road conditions and lack of transport facilities, were largely neglected following disasters.



There were delays and even cancellations of relief distribution, as the exact locations of the displaced people could not be identified, according to the Sri Lanka Rapid Post Disaster Needs Assessment Floods and Landslides – May 2017. Such issues point to the importance of establishing relief centres, to ensure that relief goods reach those who need it the most.



In addition, gaps were observed in Sri Lanka’s early warning system. Disaster forecasts are particularly important to the agriculture sector, as livelihoods are directly affected by weather patterns. Despite existing communication systems for early warning dissemination, there are issues in providing localised warnings to vulnerable communities. The absence of a proper mechanism at ground level is an issue. Disaster experiences in the last few years show that vulnerable communities were not adequately prepared to take heed of these early warnings.



The lack of disaster information is a key barrier in conducting assessments for effective policy formulation, guiding DRR activities, and achieving disaster resilience in Sri Lanka. Information can be in the form of loss and damage assessments, research findings, hazard and vulnerability assessments, disaster forecasts, early warnings, and weather data. Data on losses and damages are particularly important to understand the economic impacts of disasters.



The Desinventar database, managed by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) is the only available source for disaggregated data. However, it does not encompass all the vital information needed to formulate DRR tools and garner disaster-related investments. As the draft National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP 2018-2030) highlights, there are notable gaps in terms of research-based information on natural disasters.



While early warnings and disaster relief mechanisms are vital in reducing the impacts of disasters, mitigation and preparedness remain the key strategies for reducing the impacts of disasters. This is especially relevant to floods and landslides as they have a higher economic cost, when compared with droughts.



The draft NDMP 2018-2030 points out that the investments on structural measures, intended to provide physical protection from disasters, are low in Sri Lanka. Certain initiatives are in place in mitigation aspects. The Climate Resilient Improvement Project has a component which supports the implementation of such investments to ensure short-term integrity of flood control and irrigation infrastructure.





Strengthening DRM



Improving the local capacity to deal with disasters is vital for enhancing the effectiveness of early warning and disaster relief mechanisms. Such improvements can minimise the disaster related social costs, such as mortalities and injuries. Further, issues in the relief system should be eliminated to meet immediate basic needs of the disaster victims. This requires the formulation of a proper relief system, with clear criteria for relief distribution.



Effective DRM should be supported by timely and comprehensive climate information. The existing gaps can be eliminated to a great extent by developing a repository with online facilities to compile and share data among key users. The sharing of research-based information helps to integrate such information to decision making.

At the policy level, the need of the hour is to mainstream disaster resilience efforts when formulating and implementing development projects. Suitable policy and planning guidelines are crucial in this regard.



The National Physical Planning Policy and the Plan 2050 (draft), takes disaster risks into account and can serve as the basis for development projects at the national level. Disaster related aspects can be introduced at the initial stages of planning and obtaining approvals for projects.



The Initial Environment Examination (IEE) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) should be revised to include elements of disaster resilience. Proper integration of DRM aspects into planning will also enhance investment decisions on disaster resilience.
