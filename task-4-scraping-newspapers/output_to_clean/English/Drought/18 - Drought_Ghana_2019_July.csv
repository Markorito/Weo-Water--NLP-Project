Agricultural production in many parts of Africa is affected by natural climate variability and is likely to be significantly compromised by climate change through the higher incidence of drought, erratic rainfall and damaging high temperatures. The current system for responding to natural disasters is often not timely or equitable enough, with much of the cost being borne by farmers. When international assistance is available it is often too late.

The African Risk Capacity (ARC) is a continental sovereign risk pool and early response mechanism designed to execute pre‐approved contingency. ARC’s mission is to help African Union Member States to protect the food security of their vulnerable populations. As an insurance risk pool, ARC’s objective is to capitalize on the natural diversification of weather risk across Africa, allowing countries to manage their risk as a group in a financially efficient manner in order to respond to probable but uncertain risks.

In order to participate in ARC, countries must undertake several processes, including:","Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1332578-66325_accesstoarcprogramme.png?itok=XjW19jOt,"['order', 'africa', 'countries', 'access', 'arc', 'risk', 'african', 'pool', 'capacity', 'programme', 'focus', 'climate', 'arcs', 'natural', 'ghana']",

Most Ghanaians are of the view that the country should divorce itself from the international body.

A look at sentiments expressed in statements by former presidents and finance ministers under whose tenure the country exited one sponsored programme or another illustrate this well. They ranged from:

The decision to be independent of IMF budgetary support is a watershed in the history of the country’s economic development.

to

We won’t go to IMF again; Ghana will no longer be troubled by conditionalities of IMF.

These quotes encapsulate how Ghanaians feel about the relationship. But is the relationship that bad? An informed assessment requires some context: how Ghana relates to all Bretton Woods institutions. A historical assessment of this will better contextualise the nature of Ghana’s relationship with the IMF.

The early years

Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence in 1957. It was undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the region. The country had significant natural resources as well as a highly educated population.

Ghana’s relationship with the IMF is a cycle of meeting targets under its programs before falling back on bad habits.

The relationship between Ghana and the IMF and World Bank dates back to the late 1960s. Following the overthrow of Kwame Nkrumah’s government in 1966, the country suffered nearly two decades of political instability and economic decline. A prolonged drought worsened the situation, as did widespread bush fires. This resulted in an unparalleled famine. Adding to the burden on government was the need to resettle one million citizens from Nigeria. The next decade saw the global oil crisis as well as a persistent downward trend in the terms of trade. By the 1980s inflation was at a triple digit level. Undoubtedly, by 1983, Ghana’s economy was in tatters. It desperately needed support to reverse the downward spiral. As a result, Ghana embarked on a major programme of economic reform. It did this through an IMF and World Bank sponsored structural adjustment programme and economic recovery programme.

Over the years these have become a major reference points in terms of the relationship between Ghana and the Bretton Woods institutions.

The scale of reforms under these arrangements were enormous.

Structural adjustment

The structural adjustment facilities were used to steer Ghana toward becoming a market friendly nation where incentives were created by the free market. In the process, the country embarked on a large-scale overhaul of institutions, encouraged competition by privatising state own enterprises, built institutional capacity and attained macroeconomic stability.

Undeniably Ghana chalked up some initial successes under the programme. It was in fact referred to as the programme’s ideal student due to significant improvements in its macroeconomic indicators.

But after nearly two decades of adjustment, in 2001, the country fell on hard times. It was classified as a highly indebted poor country – a World Bank and IMF initiative aimed at reducing the external debt burden of very poor countries.

At the time, all Ghana’s earlier successes had been eroded. The economy was suffering from rapid exchange rate depreciation, high inflation and very low external reserves. The severe crisis was partly due to high debt service requirements that affected the budget and affected the balance of payments.

In 2001, the newly elected government opted for debt relief under the highly indebted countries initiative. This decision was met with a lot of public backlash. People’s view was that Ghana had fallen from being the beacon of hope for Africa to being heavily indebted and poor.

People started to ask lots of questions about the implications of the effects of 16 years of IMF and World Bank adjustment programmes, and their ramifications on Ghana’s development. To many, the country had been tied to the apron strings of the Bretton Woods institutions and had to wean itself off as soon as possible.

Again, by mid-2013, the government’s efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation were undermined by policy slippages, external shocks and rising interest cost. This continued until mid-2014. But then the country’s net international reserves position had weakened further. And the exchange rate had depreciated sharply, fuelling inflationary pressures.

These macroeconomic mishaps occurred against the background of the issuance of Eurobond and a short-term loan contracted by the Cocoa Board in the same year. Yet public debt continued to rise at an unsustainable pace.

Ghana then entered another IMF-backed stabilisation program, its 16th since independence, after missing targets in 2013 and 2014. On 3 April 2015, the IMF approved a three-year Extended Credit Facility arrangement with Ghana. This was aimed at the restoration of debt sustainability and macroeconomic stability to foster a return to high growth and job creation while protecting social spending. The programme was extended for an additional year, ending on 2 April 2019.

Undoubtedly, the programme resulted in significant macroeconomic gains with rising growth, single digit inflation, fiscal consolidation and banking sector clean-up. Nevertheless, challenges remain.

Ghana performs again

In its World Economic Outlook the IMF is forecasting that Ghana will be the fastest growing economy in the world this year with a projected growth rate of 8.8%. As with previous IMF/World Bank sponsored programmes, Ghana is once again out-performing itself.

As usual, the government is very optimistic about the prospects of the country following its exit from the programme. The obvious question being asked is: what is different this time?

The programme appears different in a number of ways.

First, it was based on a combination (domestic and foreign) of sources of finance. Second, conditionalities attached to it were informed by homegrown policies. This was unlike previous programmes where conditionalities were based on the Washington consensus.

Lastly, Ghana has also made important changes. It passed a new law – the first of its kind in the country – to govern government spending. The Act seeks to ensure fiscal responsibility, macroeconomic stability, and debt sustainability. A key provision gives parliament the power to censure the Finance Minister if spending exceeds defined limits.

What next?

Given the chronology of Ghana’s relationship with the IMF – and the cycle of achieving targets under its programmes before falling back on bad habits – most believe it’s just a matter of time before the country goes back to the IMF asking for help. The likelihood of this happening is increased by the fact that the country goes to the polls in 2020. This means there is bound to be a tendency for government to overspend.

Whatever happens next, it’s important to note that the structure of the economy has not changed. It is still highly susceptible to external shocks, particularly commodity prices. To the extent that these external shocks are unavoidable, the IMF and World Bank will remain critical partners in the country’s development process.

2,2,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Glimmers of Hope for People in Ghana with Mental Illness - Direct Relief,https://www.directrelief.org/2019/07/glimmers-of-hope-for-people-in-ghana-with-mental-illness/,"Approximately 4.6 million people live in northern Ghana. None of them are psychiatrists.

The West African nation, in total, faces a mental health treatment gap of 98%, according to the World Health Organization, meaning only 2% of people are receiving the care they need. As of 2017, Ghana had 18 psychiatrists serving an estimated population exceeding 28 million.

“[Mental health care] has, traditionally, been a very neglected area,” said Dr. Sammy Ohene, head of the psychiatric department at the University of Ghana.

Like most countries, Ghana has specific stigmas associated with mental illness, but has also had to cope with an extreme scarcity of psychiatrists, something Dr. Ohene tried to remedy by starting a residency program.

Overcoming Stigma

But even with more trained psychiatrists in the country over the past few years, lingering, culturally-based problems exist.

“With mental illness, the stigma is virtually everywhere, but manifests differently in various social contexts,” said Peter Badimak Yaro, executive director of BasicNeeds Ghana, a leading in-country, mental health-focused NGO.

“Ghana is one place where people try to avoid people with mental illness,” Yaro said.

This has led to a curtailing of basic human rights for those who suffer from mental illness, according to Yaro, which manifests itself in reduced opportunities for employment, movement, and free expression.

“Families do everything to keep away relatives with mental health problems. They try to conceal or hide people,” he said.

Reducing Harmful Interventions

Further complicating matters in Ghana, beyond the lack of access to care and alienation, are deeply-held beliefs about the nature of mental health.

“Most people in Ghana believe that psychiatric disorders have a spiritual basis. Therefore, when people have a mental illness, they’re very likely to be taken to a spiritual healer, church, or some other traditional healer,” said Ohene.

These methods of treatment have led to human rights abuses, as documented in news reporting during recent years, as patients who are prone to aggression are physically restrained for extended periods of time, and in uncomfortable positions.

“Most of them don’t have any particular skills in controlling aggression, so if a disturbed patent is brought there, they’re forced to physically restrain them. That is a huge problem,” said Ohene.

Restraining patients is common in healthcare facilities in northern Ghana. A survey of 10 health facilities across northern Ghana showed that almost 1,000 patients spent more than 20 percent of the time spent in the facilities were in restraints. That study, used to determine health needs in the region, was written by Direct Relief and conducted by Breast Care International, with funding from Johnson & Johnson.

Ohene said it is often only after traditional or spiritual treatments have failed, that patients and their families will visit a hospital or clinical setting—which can come it its own attendant problems, though ones which are consistent across cultures. Namely, if an illness recurs, many patients and their families will think the hospital staff doesn’t really know what they’re talking about. Patients and families are looking for a cure.

“It’s difficult for people to accept this is a condition they have to live with forever,“ Ohene said. “The concept of managing a disease process over the long term is not something people find very attractive.”

Finding Solutions

To address some of the most pressing problems in Ghana, Ohene and Yaro have been working to increase access to care, find alternative solutions, train people to work, and advocate for more government support, as well as updated policies.

BasicNeeds provides support for medical trips to the north of the country for Ohene and his colleagues and also provides Risperdal, an anti-psychotic medication, to local clinics, where community health nurses are charged with taking the lead on treating patients with mental health symptoms.

“The medicines, donated by Johnson & Johnson and sent through Direct Relief, are filling a gap for hundreds of patients,” Yaro said. “They are now able to get through their daily activities.”

Yaro added that the donated drugs, representing a wholesale value of $9 million, have helped about 50 community health units to continue to function.

Almost 12,000 patients in the northern Ghana regions have been given access to medication through the program.

Even as the medication has provided treatment, when it is available, and Ohene is optimistic about the impact of the doctors he’s been able to train, problems still exist with near-term, sustainable options, which Yaro and Ohene have been advocating for in Accra.

“It’s slow, but things are looking up. The law (Mental Health Act, 2012) makes for a mental health fund, but none has been established. They’re working on it,” said Ohene. The doctor said that the lack of a fund has led to confusion and delays regarding implementation of another aspect of the same law, which stipulates that mental healthcare is to be provided free of charge.

Because no fund has been established, the national insurance scheme does not cover mental health care treatments, Ohene said.

And while traditional healers are still pervasive, Ohene said the country’s mental health authority is working to educate people about mental illness and modern treatment options and has also mandated that every regional hospital must have a mental health care unit.

As such challenges persist, both Yaro and Ohene maintain hope sourced from the strength of their mission: supporting patients as they manage their mental health.

“They should find fulfillment and live a life of dignity that everybody should have as a human being,” Yaro said.","Fri, 26 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/www.directrelief.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1396966_234820770038209_419641941_o-1-e1564165672338.jpg?w=1200&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C675px&ssl=1,"['illness', 'yaro', 'mental', 'patients', 'problems', 'hope', 'ohene', 'glimmers', 'health', 'treatment', 'care', 'ghana']",

The 27-year-old speaks on the Black Stars' disappointment and ambitions regarding the continental showpiece

Ghana midfielder Afriyie Acquah believes all is not lost in the nation's hopes of ending their long Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) title drought following the disappointment of the recent tournament in Egypt.

The Black Stars' hopes of winning a first title in 37 years ended in failure by a Round of 16 defeat to Tunisia on penalties.

“We did our best and wanted to win the Cup but we all know in football you either win, lose or draw,"" Empoli ace Acquah told Zylofon TV.

""We did our best but we were unfortunate so we will just give thanks to God.

""It’s not too late; we are young, so Ghanaians should give us another two years to win the tournament.”

Some people believe Ghana's controversial captaincy change just before the tournament may have disrupted their focus and ambitions in Egypt.

“We were cool with the captaincy change because the coach announced it to us so we all gave him our support,"" Acquah explained.

""Even at club sides they change captains, so you the player, you should take it as normal and leave the talking to the public. Captaincy is just an armband.

“The change did not cause anything in camp. People who are not close to us [the players] assumed that we were fighting but it is not true.

""We were united in camp. We are a team and a family so there were no factions.""

Ghana will be hoping to make amends at the next championship in Cameroon in 2021.

In what they called a ""historic"" move, the two West African neighbours on June 12 vowed to suspend the sale of their 2020/2021 production to buyers unwilling to meet a minimum price of $2,600 per tonne, a move that shook the cocoa market.

The two African nations -- which together account for 60% of the world's production -- are campaigning to end a situation where cocoa producers make only $6 billion in a global chocolate market worth around $100-billion.

""The two countries decided to lift the suspension of sales of the 2020/2021 crop from today July 16,"" the chief of Ivory Coast's coffee and cocoa council, Yves Kone-Brahima, and Joseph Boahen Aidoo, chief executive of the Ghana Cocoa Board, said in a joint statement Tuesday.

At a meeting in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Adidjan on July 3, the two countries introduced a so-called Living Income Differential of $400 per tonne.

The differential would kick in for export contracts for the 2020/2021 crop if market prices fell below $2,600 a tonne.

A World Bank report released last week said Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, earns just a fraction of the crop's potential value, and that 55%of cocoa producers live on about 757 CFA francs ($1,3 / 1,15 euros) a day, which is below the poverty line.

Cocoa accounts for 40% of the nation's exports but the country only earns about 8% of total profits in the cocoa-chocolate sector.

Digitisation could change the game for agriculture in Africa. That’s a key message in a report recently released by an international institution that enhances smallholder farming in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.

The Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) focuses on poverty reduction through modernising smallholder farming by fostering innovation and knowledge sharing.

Digitisation refers to everything from delivering farming advice via text messaging to interactive voice response. It also includes smart phone applications that link farmers to multimedia advisory content, farm inputs, and buyers. And it covers the use of drones and satellite systems to inform farmer activities, such as crops and times to plant; and types and amounts of inputs to use.

Other global organisations have echoed this message. These range from NGOs like Solidaridad Network – a civil society organisation that accelerates sustainable and inclusive development – to the World Bank. These organisations believe that digital technologies can create employment for young people in the agricultural sector, promote economic activity, and enhance food security.

For the past two decades, digitisation has steadily transformed African farming. In Ghana, for instance, online platforms such as Esoko, Farmerline, and Trotro Tractor have provided farmers with accessible services. These have included voice messages and SMS extension advice. This helps farmers obtain information about how to access markets and extension services.

Elsewhere on the continent, international organisations help provide precision advice to farmers. An example is the CTA’s ‘Transforming Africa’s agriculture: Eyes in the sky, smart techs on the ground"" project that supports the use of drones for agriculture.

The continent’s digital agriculture industry is growing. The number of farmers subscribed to digital services has grown by between 40% and 45% per year in the last three years.

Annual revenues from digitally supported farming are estimated at about $140 million. Services are provided by a small but growing number of providers — some of which are estimated to generate €90 of revenue per farmer annually, partly through service charges. This trend looks set to continue.

But the success of digitisation in agriculture shouldn’t just be evaluated by its economic value. Its benefits must be enjoyed by smallholder farmers and rural populations. Smallholder farmers, most of whom have access to less than two acres of land, produce more than 80% of the food in sub-Saharan Africa.

African smallholder farmers will ultimately determine the continent’s digital farming story. Only through collaborations with them, and among sectors, will the digital transformation become a success in Africa.

Challenges of smallholder farming

Smallholder farmers face daunting political, economic, social, cultural, and institutional barriers. They have limited access to information, markets, capital, land tenure, and even basic inputs like fertilisers and seeds.

Government policies, and the influx of foreign land grabbers in many African countries, only worsen the situation. Ethiopia, Ghana, and South Sudan are among the hot beds for foreign land deals.

Added to these are environmental issues like soil erosion and a changing climate. In recent years, droughts, rising temperatures, and El-Niño events left nearly thirteen million people from Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia needing humanitarian assistance.

This makes traditional farming hard for smallholders across the continent, and can undermine their capacity to fully benefit from the digital revolution.

Also, connectivity tends to be limited in rural areas. And, even if farmers can connect, they may not have enough money to access the services.

These concerns limit the production and profits of farmers and undermine rural development. This is where digitisation comes in. It has potential to increase access to information and resources to provide solutions.

Elsewhere, digital technologies are already showing promise for rural farmers. The Chinese government partners with private actors like Alibaba to digitise agriculture. From web-portals to Mobile Internet Based Services, rural farmers benefit from access extension advice and capital. This leads to increased productivity and incomes.

Inclusion in digitisation

There have been positive strides in ensuring smallholders become involved in digital agriculture. An estimated 33 million people – about 13% of all sub-Saharan African smallholders and pastoralists – are already registered for services such as weather updates and market linkages.

Ethiopia’s “80-28” hotline - a farmer advisory service - has about 4 million users, the highest on the continent. Beyond being a free service, its success is partly due to the delivery of services in local languages. Aligning services to local circumstances encourages farmers to subscribe willingly.

Kenya leads the way in digitisation in Africa. Collaborations between agriculture and telecommunication has been instrumental in their success so far.

What’s missing

These examples show what is necessary to help smallholders become connected to digital services.

One additional strategy is to blur the boundaries between different sectors. Digitisation is not just an agricultural issue, or a technological one. It involves many parts of the economy. Hence, digitisation must be situated within a broader development and poverty reduction agenda. For instance, education is critical to farmers’ ability to use and benefit from digital technologies.

It is also crucial to place smallholders front and centre when designing policies and specific digital products meant to help them. In this way, digital transformation will reflect the users’ needs.

The project advocates that partners at the national and district levels urgently address a lack of schools in communities where there were none.

Available data indicate that Ghana’s school enrollment rate stood at 84 percent by 2013.

“The project will enroll boys and girls in the beneficiary regions through the Complementary Basic Education, and transition 70 percent of the graduates to formal primary schools,” Tesfamariam said at the One Day West African Corporate Social Responsibility Conference.

He said the program ultimately aims at ensuring universal school enrollment in the West African country where education accounts for about 23 percent of annual state expenditure.","Sat, 13 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://africa.cgtn.com/wp-content/photo-gallery/2019/07/gettyimages-920805076-594x594.jpg,"['west', '90000', 'enrollment', 'children', 'school', 'support', 'project', 'schools', 'country', 'gets', 'send', 'ghana', 'program', 'tesfamariam']",

The former Black Stars skipper has been proposed as a possible replacement for the current national team coach

Ex-Ghana international Joe Addo has backed former Asante Kotoko head coach and current technical director Charles 'CK' Akonnor for the Black Stars' coaching job.

The future of coach James Appiah remains in doubt following the Stars' disappointing showing at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt.

On their 22nd appearance at the continental gathering, Ghana failed to progress past the Round of 16, for the first time since 2006.

“If he [Akonnor] becomes the Black Stars coach he will be great,"" Addo was reported to have said in The Finder.

""He is my friend and I will always push for it. For now, we have to wait until a decision is taken on Appiah or if he decides not to continue anymore.

""Having said that I think C.K has done very well on the local scene. He has played for the national team and captained a foreign team as well.

""He has all the experience but we have a coach now so anything I say will not be appropriate but if there is a change then yes Akonnor will be perfect.”

Akonnor's future at Kotoko remains bleak following his re-assignment from head coach to technical director.

Reports say the former Ghana international is unhappy by the decision of the Porcupines' management and could be headed for the exit.

The former Dreams FC and Ashanti Gold boss led Kotoko to win the Ghana Special Competition in June after guiding the team to the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup last season.

The hashtag #dropthatcoach trended for hours after their exit to Tunisia on penalties.

‘It’s never true I was attacked by anybody. People are cooking stories but it’s not true,” Appiah told GHANASoccernet.com

Appiah returned for a second spell in charge of the West African nation, having led the team to the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil.

His previous stint as Black Stars coach came to an end after Ghana failed to advance from the group stages at Brazil 2014.

The Black Stars quest to end their 37-year title drought was quashed following a 5-4 penalty loss against the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in the Round of 16 stage at the ongoing AFCON in Egypt.

In the wake of the defeat, Mubarak Wakaso, who was arguably Ghana’s best player at the tournament, was videoed sobbing as he received his his Man of the Match accolade.

However, Boye says it was not only the Deportivo Alaves midfielder who was deeply touched by the defeat.

The FC Metz guardsman revealed that every member of the team shed tears after realizing how they have disappointed the nation.

""Everybody was crying. Everybody cried like we are all disappointed but we have to raise our heads and make Ghanaians happy next time,” Boye said as quoted by Saddick Adams.

Ghana were seeking to end their 37-year wait for continental success, having won their last title in 1982.

Kwesi Appiah's side came close to ending their drought at the last six tournaments, having reached the semi-finals, and even going as far as the final in 2010 and 2015.

It is however unclear if Appiah will remain in the dugout for the next AFCON which will be hosted by Cameroon in 2021, as there are several calls from football advocates to axe him from the post following the team’s failure to clinch this year’s trophy.

The title drought is now 37 years and counting for Ghana, which was eliminated 5-4 in the shootout in Ismailia when striker Caleb Ekuban was the only player to miss.

Goalkeeper Farouk Ben Mustapha was the hero for Tunisia in the last-16 match. He was brought on especially for the shootout and made a match-winning save from Ekuban.

That left Ferjani Sassi to step up and score with the last spot-kick and send Tunisia into a quarterfinal against surprise package Madagascar.

Tunisia was on its way to winning in regulation time after Taha Khenissi scored in the 73rd minute. Ghana snatched a dramatic equalizer two minutes into injury time when Rami Bedoui headed the ball into his own net straight after coming on as a substitute to make it 1-1.

There were no goals in extra time.

Ghana's failure means the star-studded West Africans still haven't won the African Cup since their fourth title in 1982. Ghana has lost three finals since then, including on penalties in 2015.

Tunisia was the last team to seal its spot in the quarters in Egypt.

The quarterfinal lineup is: Senegal vs. Benin, Nigeria vs. South Africa, Ivory Coast vs. Algeria and Tunisia vs. Madagascar.

Earlier, Wilfried Zaha's late goal put Ivory Coast into the last eight with a 1-0 victory over Mali in Suez.

Zaha's winner in the 76th minute saved Ivory Coast, which had been the second-best team for most of the game.

But Zaha took his chance when Mali's players didn't. He ran onto a long pass launched from the back and tucked his shot away after Mali's defence failed to deal with the danger.

Mali had twice as many shots on goal as the Ivorians, dominated the first half and also finished the game strongest. The Malians just couldn't break through.

Ivory Coast was the 2015 champion and is seeking a third title.

The quarterfinals start on Wednesday.

The Black Stars' position on the global table has not been helped by their Round of 16 elimination at the continental showpiece

Ghana are unmoved in the latest edition of the Fifa World Rankings, released for the month of July on Thursday.

The Black Stars still hold 50th position on the table. However, their total accumulated points have increased from 1423 to 1429.

Placed 55th in July last year, Ghana now find themselves between Norway (50) and Jamaica (52).

The Black Stars' status on the table is largely down to their performance at the recent Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) in Egypt where they exited the tournament in the Round of 16.

They won just one of four games played, a 2-0 triumph against Guinea-Bissau in the last group game, and drew three other matches.

James Appiah's outfit opened their tournament with a 2-2 draw with Benin, settled for a 0-0 deadlock with Cameroon and played out a 1-1 draw with Tunisia after extra-time in the Round of 16. The last game was ultimately decided by a penalty shootout which the Black Stars lost 5-4.

It was only the first time since 2006 Ghana failed to make the quarter-finals.

On the continental ranking, Ghana have fallen by one place to seventh, only ahead of Cameroon (53), Congo DR (56) and Cote d'Ivoire (57) in the top 10.

Senegal (20), Tunisia (29), Nigeria (33), African champions Algeria (40), Morocco (41) and Egypt (49) are the top six nations.

Significantly, Afcon bronze medalists Nigeria and Algeria have moved up by 12 and 28 places respectively on the world rankings, which is still led by Belgium.

Brazil have moved up by one place to second, with France, England, Uruguay, Portugal, Croatia, Colombia, Spain and Argentina following in that order to complete the top 10.

Ghana striker Raphael Dwamena has left Spanish La Liga club Levante for second-tier side Real Zaragoza in search for regular playing time.

The 23-year-old transfers from Estadio Ciudad de Valencia on a season-long loan deal, having made only 15 appearances and started three games in all competitions for the club since joining from Swiss fold FC Zurich last summer.

Zurich, Spanish second division side Real Oviedo, and German outfit Hannover 96 were all reportedly expressed interest in signing him for the 2019-20 season.

""The 23-year-old Ghanaian striker arrived at the Orriols club last summer from FC Zurich and during the last campaign he participated in 15 official commitments and scored a goal.""

Dwamena's limited playing time was a result of fitness issues and a loss of form.

His lack of game time caused him a place in Ghana's squad for the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt after a good showing at the start of the qualifiers for the competition.

The striker has also played for Austrian clubs Austria Lustenau and Liefering.

From the emergence of new cities and countries, to new industries and technologies, Africa is a continent that is alive with rapid change – but not all change is welcome.

Scientists estimate that over the past 100 years, temperatures across Africa have increased by an average of 0.5 – 2 degrees. It may not sound significant, but the impacts are life-changing. From changing weather patterns that reduce crop yields in Malawi, to natural disasters which threaten lives in Southern Africa, or the 2018 crisis that saw Cape Town facing ‘Day Zero’ without water, the fall-out of changing climate is evident across this continent.

We know that climate change hits the most vulnerable first and hardest. Worldwide 100 million people are already at risk of being pushed into poverty by climate change by 2030 – particularly across Sub Saharan Africa – and 720 million by 2050. 65% of the African population is likely to be impacted by the consequences of climate change – despite the fact that African nations are responsible for just 2-3% of global emissions.

Communities around the world are waking up to the scale of this climate disaster – in recent months the UK has passed a landmark piece of legislation, becoming the first major economy to write into law a commitment to end its contribution to global warming by 2050.

It is right that the UK makes big changes domestically, but given the global scale of the challenge it is also right that we work together with our global partners.

The UK’s former International Development Secretary Rory Stewart was recently in Kenya, where he has seen first-hand how the UK is working with the Kenyan government, institutions and civil society to tackle both the causes and consequences of changing climates across East Africa – and announced the UK’s single largest direct aid investment in climate and environment across Africa, with £250 million of transformative funding.

And in Kenya he saw some brilliant success stories, including the largest on-shore wind farm in sub-Saharan Africa, which – with support from UK businesses and UK aid – is providing approximately 17% of the country’s installed power capacity.

Almost three-quarters of Kenya’s electricity comes from renewable sources – it is home to hydro, wind and solar energy production, making the most of the country’s fantastic natural resources.

This is exciting for two reasons. Firstly, because it showcases how the continent can embrace innovative, low-carbon and efficient technologies, leapfrogging over dirty energy sources. What’s more, it demonstrates the potential for clean economic growth and job creation in this cutting-edge sector – at the same time, helping protect the environment for the majority of Kenyans who rely on agriculture and predictable rainfall for their livelihoods.

There’s more that can be done. At the G20 earlier this month the former British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that all UK aid investments will consider the risks and opportunities posed by climate change. This makes the UK the first major economy to combine a legally-binding aid spending target with a commitment to align support for developing countries with the Paris Agreement.

The world is currently on course to warm by more than 3 degrees by the end of the century. This need to advocate for urgent international climate action is why the UK has bid to host COP26 in partnership with Italy in 2020.

We cannot allow increasing temperatures and extreme weather to continue having a profound and devastating impact on the lives and livelihoods of communities across Africa.

The 29-year-old joined the Toffees on a three-year deal from Manchester City, where he won the Premier League title twice under Pep Guardiola.

But Everton are without a piece of silverware since the 1995 FA Cup, a drought their fans are acutely aware of, and Delph says correcting that is top of his list of priorities.

""I've been fortunate enough to be in a squad full of winning mentality,"" Delph said in his first press conference since joining. ""I'm not going to change coming here. The main goal is to be successful and win something.

""I'm aware the club hasn't won something in a long time. That's top of my list to hopefully try and push the lads and them to push me and win something.

Image: Delph hadn't started for City since he was sent off at Leicester in December

""[The winning mentality] probably comes easier to me because I'm one of the older players. You don't have to be the best player in the team to influence people, to drive and to set standards high with good habits.

""The winning mentality is massive. Everyone needs to be on it and have that mentality in training. There's no egos here. A great work ethic and the staff are fantastic.""

Despite being a big part of Guardiola's successful City side throughout 2017 and 2018, Delph has not started in the Premier League since he was sent off in a defeat at Leicester last December.

City went on to win the title, and though Delph admits his last six months with the club were frustrating, he insists he stayed professional throughout.

""Really frustrating, from a very young age all you want to do is play. I had a great spell the season before, where I was playing pretty much every game. Obviously I got sent off and didn't feature. It's been frustrating.

""But I'm very professional, I got my distances up and did everything I could to get back in the team. I made myself available, and the team were in a very good place, but unfortunately I didn't feature.""","Tue, 23 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://e0.365dm.com/19/07/1600x900/skysports-fabian-delph-everton_4726227.jpg?20190723143125,"['city', 'exit', 'everton', 'won', 'winning', 'im', 'title', 'fabian', 'sent', 'mentality', 'delph', 'team', 'trophy', 'manchester', 'aim', 'win']", 
31,31,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Joseph Paintsil confirms Aidoo's exit from Genk as he joins Celta Vigo - Ghanasoccernet.com,https://ghanasoccernet.com/joseph-paintsil-confirms-aidoos-exit-from-genk-as-he-joins-celta-vigo,"Ghana and Genk midfielder Joseph Paintsil has confirmed the transfer of fellow team mate Jospeh Aidoo to Spanish side Celta Vigo in a post on Instagram.

Joseph Painstil and Joseph Aidoo were instrumental for the Belgium side as they clinched the 2018-19 Juplier Pro league.

Ghanasoccernet.com can confirm Joseph Aidoo is on his way out of the club with a deal agreed between his club and La Liga side Celta Vigo.

Genk agreed to release their powerful centre-back on Thursday after the club's representative travelled to Spain to seal the deal for the club who helped them clinch the title.

The amount involved in the transfer is regarded as one of the most profitable for Genk for the defender who joined their club under two seasons ago from the Swedish league for a fraction of the amount.

Aidoo, who is currently with the Ghana national team in Egypt, also agreed for the move to be sealed as his representatives also travelled for the meeting to seal his part of the deal.

The defender was sent details of the Celta Vigo via his e-mail before he agreed to all the terms after hours of negotiations.

Aidoo will travel to Spain at the end of Ghana's campaign at Africa's flagship football competition to seal the deal before he is unveiled to the fans of the club.

Celta Vigo will cough out a whopping $10 million to sign Black Stars defender Joseph Aidoo who helped Genk to win the Belgian league title last season.

Vigo who battled relegation for the most part of the 2018/2019 season is looking to boost their squad for the upcoming season and have identified the defender as a good addition to their current squad.

Aidoo’s campaign in the Belgium top-flight last season impressed Celta Vigo but his impressive showing with the Ghana national team in Egypt heightened their desire to sign him before other clubs swoop for his signature.","Fri, 05 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.ghanasoccernet.com/2019/07/A1936B66-55F1-47A4-8A81-F2C4A3089432.jpeg,"['vigo', 'exit', 'aidoos', 'defender', 'aidoo', 'season', 'agreed', 'genk', 'joins', 'confirms', 'club', 'paintsil', 'joseph', 'team', 'seal', 'celta']",

A number of farmers in the region who were hopeful of cashing on the bumper harvest of this year’s crop season are now counting their losses. Prices for the fruit have gone down in recent times in the area. A large size of the fruit used to sell at GH¢10, now goes for as low as GH¢2 at the farm gate. Even at that price, some of the farmers are unable to attract buyers, leaving the fruits to rot on the farms.

A visit to the area by reporters last week revealed heaps of the watermelon meant to attract buyers along the Nalerigu/Bunkpurugu road but which rotting, while other farmers gave out the fruits to commuters for free.

A farmer at Buguya in the West Mamprusi municipality who cultivated about five acres of watermelon but could not get buyers, said: “…I have not been able to recoup the money I invested, and even though I had a bumper harvest, there are no buyers”

Another farmer at Sakogu in the East Mamprusi municipality claimed that all his investment including money for ploughing and purchasing of chemicals, had gone to waste.

Reacting to the development, the East Mamprusi Municipal Director of Agriculture, Zakaria Hamidu expressed worry over the situation and said large quantities of watermelon went waste each season as a result of the lack of a ready market and storage facilities in the area: “During one of our meetings with stakeholders, we looked at crops that can feed a factory and watermelons came up, but the meeting realized that watermelon is seasonal and if you establish a factory, it means that the factory will have to close down in the off-season.”

36,36,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Oceanic and radiative forcing of medieval megadroughts in the American Southwest - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0087,"Multidecadal “megadroughts” were a notable feature of the climate of the American Southwest over the Common era, yet we still lack a comprehensive theory for what caused these megadroughts and why they curiously only occurred before about 1600 CE. Here, we use the Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product, in conjunction with radiative forcing estimates, to demonstrate that megadroughts in the American Southwest were driven by unusually frequent and cold central tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) excursions in conjunction with anomalously warm Atlantic SSTs and a locally positive radiative forcing. This assessment of past megadroughts provides the first comprehensive theory for the causes of megadroughts and their clustering particularly during the Medieval era. This work also provides the first paleoclimatic support for the prediction that the risk of American Southwest megadroughts will markedly increase with global warming.

The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system and its modulation of storm track variability have been the primary driver of seasonal droughts in much of North America over the Instrumental era ( 6 ). Therefore, the most prominent Southwest megadrought hypotheses invoke ENSO as the probable cause but in different fashions: Either ENSO was radiatively forced into a persistent La Niña–like mean state [through the dynamical thermostat mechanism ( 7 – 9 )] or internal climate variability simply produced multidecadal periods of increased La Niña events ( 10 – 15 ). Recent work nevertheless provides little evidence for a persistent La Niña–like mean state during the Medieval period ( 16 – 21 ), and although stochastic ENSO variability can explain isolated megadroughts, their clustering before 1600 CE is extremely difficult to explain with the ENSO variability that is characteristic of the Instrumental era ( 13 , 19 , 22 ). Additionally, a warm North Atlantic may suppress summer precipitation in the Great Plains and the Southwest [e.g., ( 23 – 26 )], but the support for this mechanism causing or increasing the likelihood of megadroughts is relatively tentative ( 19 ).

Megadroughts ( 1 , 2 ) are multidecadal periods of intense aridity that existed over much of the American West from the 9th to 16th centuries [see ( 3 ) for a review]. The southwestern region of the United States (hereinafter referred to as the Southwest) represents one of the main foci of megadrought activity, the occurrence of which profoundly affected organized societies of the time as well as the landscape and vegetation across the area ( 3 ). The absence of any megadroughts after the 16th century in the Southwest raises critical questions surrounding their causes, their predominant clustering during the Medieval period, and whether there is a substantial risk of these droughts returning in the near future as a consequence of either natural or anthropogenic causes ( 4 , 5 ).

RESULTS

Here, we use a newly available reconstruction product in tandem with a global forcing estimate to directly test the association between Southwest megadroughts and the larger oceanic and radiative forcing conditions. The Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA) is a physically and internally consistent reconstruction product that provides gridded hydroclimate and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) globally over the Common era in addition to hydroclimatically relevant dynamical indices. PHYDA is a probabilistic estimate of the time-varying state of the climate over the past 2000 years based on a fusion of both a global climate model and a global collection of proxy time series [see Materials and Methods and (27) for more information about the construction of PHYDA]. Using the probabilistic, ensemble reconstructions of the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) from PHYDA, we identify 14 decadal-scale droughts, called megadroughts herein, in the Southwest during the period 800–1925 (see Materials and Methods); all highly probable megadroughts occur before the year 1600 [>99% ensemble agreement (fig. S1A) and in agreement with (3)]. Therefore, we generally split our analyses into pre- and post-1600 periods.

We find that megadroughts are associated with unusually cold values of the NINO3.4 index, with megadrought periods shifted to colder temperatures (Fig. 1D) especially for the lower percentiles of the NINO3.4 probability density functions (Fig. 1G), although there is no discernible shift in the mean state of NINO3.4. The North Atlantic was consistently warmer during megadroughts (Fig. 1, E and H), indicative of a large-scale state shift during the period 800–1600 relative to a reference period of 1601–1925 (Fig. 1, E and H, and fig. S2); this state shift is consistent with the well-known global cooling trend over the preindustrial Common era (28). These SST results in Fig. 1 are insensitive to the choice of drought definition [(29) versus (10)] and the choice of annual or seasonal climate indices [annual versus JJA (June, July, and August) Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index and monthly versus DJF (December, January, and February) versus annual NINO3.4 index]. Such a lack of seasonal dependence is likely because the AMO index from 800 to 1600 is elevated across all seasons and the extremes in the NINO3.4 index are dominated by the DJF months, the peak season of ENSO. We also find that the forced climate response (derived from an energy balance model and historical forcing estimates; see Materials and Methods) consists of fluctuations of warmer global mean temperatures during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period (Fig. 1, F and I); these warmer temperatures are a result of periods of quiescent volcanoes and elevated solar forcing, filtered by the long-term memory of the deep ocean (fig. S3B).

NINO3.4 and AMO PDFs are for the full reconstruction ensemble from PHYDA, while the forcing PDF is for the full ensemble forcing estimate (see Materials and Methods). (G to I) Change in percentiles of the PDFs shown in (D) to (F) relative to the corresponding 1601–1925 reference PDF. Percentile changes show which parts of the megadrought and nondrought distributions change relative to the reference distribution.

To assess the relative importance of these climate drivers in explaining hydroclimate in the Southwest, we performed a decadal-scale linear regression analysis over the period 800–1925 using detrended indices (see Materials and Methods). On a decadal time scale, the NINO3.4 index explains the most variance of Southwest PDSI (up to 30%), while the AMO and radiative forcing each explain, on average, less than half the variance explained by the NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2A). When multiple predictors are included, there is a small improvement in explained variance, but the dominant factor is the decadal NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2A). Note that our analysis here focuses on large-scale climate phenomena that act on the annual to multiyear time scales. Other shorter-scale climate phenomena, such as stochastic synoptic variability, likely contribute to drought and megadrought in the Southwest (6), but from the perspective of the paleoclimate record, the time history of these phenomena is very likely unrecoverable. Such phenomena likely account for the unexplained variance in these regressions.

(A) The bootstrap distributions of adjusted r2 for the decadal linear regression of the predictand North American Southwest PDSI (NASW PDSI) and the predictors of NINO3.4 (or N), AMO (or A), and total forcing (Forc or F) (see Materials and Methods). For this and the other panels in this figure, the central box mark indicates the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, while the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (outliers not shown for clarity). (B) Bootstrap distributions of adjusted r2 for the decadal linear regression with the predictands of NINO3.4, AMO, and NASW averaged 2-m temperature (T2m) and the predictor of total forcing (see Materials and Methods). (C) Bootstrap regression β 1 parameter distributions for the same regressions as shown in (B) (see Materials and Methods). Here and in (D), the numbers at the top indicate the whole percentage of data points below and above zero (below:above). (D) Bootstrap distributions of β 1 regression parameter values for a logistic regression binned over megadroughts (see Materials and Methods); here, the predictand is the binary variable of either being in a megadrought or not, while the predictors are the NINO3.4, AMO, and forcing indices. The suffix “All” indicates regressions with all data points, and the suffix “NLV” (or no large volcanoes) indicates regressions with outlier volcanic eruption bins removed for all variables (see Materials and Methods). (E) Percentage of bootstrap regressions for which a particular logistic regression model has a minimum information criterion, suggesting that it is the best of the tested models (see Materials and Methods). “AIC” is the Akaike information criterion corrected for the sample size, and “BIC” is the Bayesian information criterion. The regression models all use the megadrought predictand with different combinations of the predictors NINO3.4, AMO, and total forcing (see Materials and Methods).

We also tested the influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index in the decadal regression framework as a measure of the potential influence of a dynamical thermostat mechanism (7); within this framework, we find no influence of radiative forcing on the NINO3.4 index (Fig. 2B). In contrast, however, we do find that a small, similar amount of variance in both the AMO and local Southwest temperature can be explained by radiative forcing (Fig. 2B). For the Southwest, we interpret the locally forced response as a straightforward mechanism: A global-scale positive radiative forcing leads to an increase in local temperatures, which, in turn, lead to an increase in aridity. In the temperature units of the global forcing estimate, the median local temperature response is 0.12°C; on a decadal time scale, this would represent a decrease in Southwest PDSI of about 0.17 (using the linear relationship between decadal, detrended temperature, and PDSI over the Southwest from 800 to 1925; Fig. 2C). This forced PDSI response is only a fraction of the PDSI excursions seen in PHYDA megadroughts of approximately −1 PDSI (fig. S1D); yet, a forced PDSI value of 0.17 is about half the value required for a proposed mean state shift in Southwest PDSI seen in the North American Drought Atlas during the Medieval megadrought period (22).

After exploring the drivers of decadal hydroclimate in the American Southwest generally, we now turn to the causes of megadroughts specifically. For this, we use a logistic regression framework, given that we are treating megadroughts as binary events. We find that megadroughts are most robustly associated with cold NINO3.4 conditions and warm AMO conditions, with the influence of NINO3.4 being again more than twice as important (Fig. 2D; here, the predictors have been standardized, thus allowing for a direct comparison of regression parameter values). The role of a positive radiative forcing is less certain: Approximately three-fifths of the bootstrap regression parameter estimates are positive when four outlier large volcanic eruption data points are removed (β 1 distribution for “Forc-NLV” in Fig. 2D; see Materials and Methods). Large volcanic eruptions (negative forcing) appear to have no consistent temporal relationship to megadroughts, with, for example, volcanic eruptions bookending a megadrought in the mid-1200s or occurring in the middle of a megadrought in the late 1400s (Fig. 1C). However, 9 of 14 megadroughts are associated with a positive shift in radiative forcing (Fig. 1, F and I), caused in the energy balance model by elevated solar forcing and volcanic quiescence (fig. S3B). Additionally, a positive radiative forcing on drought is supported by the linear regression analysis in Fig. 2C. To test whether the positive forcing response in the regression model could be consistent with a null variable, we reran the logistic regressions including a Gaussian random predictor; we found that the β 1 distribution for Forc-NLV in Fig. 2D was statistically distinct from that of the random predictor (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with n = 999 and α = 0.01). Given all this evidence and the simplicity of a positive forcing mechanism, we argue that a positive radiative forcing influence on megadroughts is more likely than a negative radiative forcing or no forcing influence at all.

Considering the joint influence of NINO3.4, AMO, and radiative forcing in causing megadroughts, we find that the logistic regression model that has the highest probability of being the most explanatory is the one that includes all three of these climate drivers (Fig. 2E); this is indicated by two different information criteria, both of which include a penalty for adding predictors. These logistic regression results are also consistent with the SST and forcing excursions shown in Fig. 1, D to I. We therefore argue that Southwest megadroughts were primarily driven by anomalously frequent and cold, unforced La Niña conditions, with contributions from a partially forced warm Atlantic and a forced local temperature increase.

The analysis shown in Figs. 1 and 2 assumes from the outset that the specific NINO3.4 and AMO indices are suitable for uncovering the mechanisms of megadroughts. While the choices of these indices are not without warrant based on past work, we nevertheless seek to confirm our results without assuming the form of the variables driving megadroughts. Climate pattern frequency analysis using self-organizing maps (SOMs) (30) (see Materials and Methods) reveals spatial SST patterns that are consistent with the Pacific and Atlantic forcing conditions shown previously. The SOM analysis specifically demonstrates a robust increased incidence of cold central and eastern Pacific SSTs during megadroughts relative to the 1601–1925 reference period, with the responses for the stronger nodes 1 and 2 being the most distinct compared to the reference range [Fig. 3, A and B (nodes 1, 2, and 4), and figs. S4, A and B (node 2), and S5, A and B (nodes 1 to 3)]; these specific patterns are concomitant with dry conditions across the western United States, with the strongest SST patterns generally having the most consistently dry PDSI values. Note that these SOM patterns are emergent properties of the underlying dataset, are not imposed a priori, and have no explicit dependence or knowledge of Southwest megadrought conditions. The greatest pattern increases are associated with cold Pacific SSTs co-occurring with areas of warm Atlantic SSTs, although there is some sensitivity to the precise pattern of warm Atlantic SSTs (cf. Fig. 3A, node 2, and fig. S5A, nodes 2 and 3). We note, however, that because of required data preprocessing and detrending (see Materials and Methods), the warming shift in the Atlantic associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly is partially removed in this SOM analysis. During megadroughts, there was also a robust reduction of some warm Pacific SST patterns (Fig. 3, A and B, nodes 5 and 8), which are concomitant with wetting across the western United States. These results, of an increased frequency in cold Pacific SSTs coupled with warming in the Atlantic and dry conditions in the Southwest, are robust to the choice of the number of SOM nodes (figs. S4 and S5) and drought definition [(29) versus (10)]. These results are also consistent with a basic compositing analysis across the megadroughts (fig. S6). The SOM analysis also confirms that the dominant climate driver of megadroughts is unusual periods of La Niña conditions.","Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/7/eaax0087/F1.large.jpg,"['methods', 'forcing', 'medieval', 'southwest', 'materials', 'radiative', 'regression', 'american', 'nino34', 'megadroughts', 'amo', 'fig', 'oceanic']", 
37,37,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Govt to control drought relief funds - Namibian,https://www.namibian.com.na/191108/archive-read/Govt-to-control-drought-relief-funds,"by Sakeus Iikela

STRICT control measures have been put in place to ensure that all funds being donated towards the government's drought relief programme are accounted for, says the executive director in the Office of the Prime Minister, I-Ben Nashandi.

Nashandi said the government's bank account, into which donated funds are deposited, will be strictly monitored.



The account was also subject to procurement rules and treasury regulations, and it will be audited, he added.



Nashandi was responding to questions from The Namibian on how the government will ensure that funds donated for the drought relief programme do not end up in the pockets of individuals.



“There are sufficient measures to safeguard the funds therein,” he stated.



The government started rolling out the drought relief programme at the beginning of June, following the declaration of drought as a national emergency by president Hage Geingob in May this year.



From May, the government also started receiving donations in cash and kind from foreign governments, international organisations, local corporate entities as well as individuals for the drought relief programme.



At the moment, the government has received a total of N$99 million in donations.



The Namibian earlier this year reported that the government had announced that it will provide N$570 million to help distressed farmers and communities.



However, Nashandi this week said N$570 million was the total budget for the approved drought interventions, and not the available funds.



He said the government at the time of the declaration had less than N$200 million “in the fund”, which is why it requested donations from the public.



Apart from the donations, Nashandi said the finance ministry has so far allocated an additional N$150 million towards the programme to address the high number of beneficiaries registered, compared to the initial estimate.



He added that due to cost escalations and the increasing number of beneficiaries, the drought relief programme might require a higher budget than the initial estimate of N$570 million.



“This means even with the donations and the additional allocation from treasury, there still remains a deficit on the budget for the drought. Therefore, the need for the public's support towards the drought relief programme remains,” he continued.



The comprehensive drought intervention plan includes food assistance to communities affected by drought, and the provision of water tankers.



Under the programme, identified beneficiaries will receive a food basket made up of 20 kilogramme maize meal, 750 millilitres of cooking oil, and tinned fish?).



To qualify for the food basket, a household must not earn an income of more than N$2 600 per month, and must not be a beneficiary of food relief from any other source during the same period.



To benefit from livestock fodder support, farmers must have less than 26 large stock units (cattle) and less than 130 small stock units (goats and/or sheep). Identified farmers will receive free fodder and licks.



Nashandi said the government so far has spent N$54 million for drought relief interventions. Of this amount, N$30 million was spent on water provision in the regions.



Furthermore, N$8,8 million was spent on food provision, and N$4,7 million on logistics. The government also spent N$9,8 million on livestock support.

38,38,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Cocoa Famers' Cooperative Launched in Kumasi - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907240524.html,"Kumasi — A national farmer cooperative in the cocoa sector has been launched in Kumasi by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) with support from the Ministry of Agriculture to influence farmers' perception about cocoa farming and encourage them to approach it as a business.

Among other aims behind the formation of the national cooperative is to facilitate the registration of farmer associations into sustainable societies that would work on behalf of their members for their mutual benefit.

Currently, a total of 1,342 cooperatives have been identified by the Cocoa Health and Extension Division, out of which 512 are cooperatives fully registered with the Department of Cooperatives.

A total number of 146,764 farmers comprising 101,796 cooperative members and 45,068 farmers belong to associations which are yet to be registered as cooperatives.

Addressing farmers and other dignitaries at the launch, the Chief Executive of COCOBOD, Mr Joseph Boahen Aidoo, enumerated COCOBOD's plans for the farmers and the cocoa sector, including plans to distribute motorised slashers for weeding through the cooperatives to the farmers and other productivity enhancement programmes.

He said COCOBOD would promote the establishment of individual service providers who would provide pruning, slashing and other essential farming services to farmers to make farming much easier.

According to Mr Aidoo, COCOBOD had plans to improve on the economic fortunes of farmers as they sought increment in producing prices at the world market.

He advised individual farmers to do well to join cooperatives and other unions so as to benefit from all government initiatives.

The Deputy Minister of Agriculture in charge of perennial crops, Mr George Boahen Oduro, indicated that the government was very committed to improving the lives of farmers, especially cocoa farmers.

According to him, cocoa farmers were being cherished by the government as a result of their contribution to the economy over the years, and so it was important for the government to work hard to improve on their economic conditions.

The National Chief Farmer and the President of Ghana Cocoa, Coffee and Shea nut Farmers, Alhaji Alhassan Bukari, who spoke on behalf of the unions noted that the group was for the collective good of all members and called on all farmers to be part.

He advised members to desist from partisan politics which had the potential of breaking the cooperatives and urged executives to follow the laid down rules that governed the association.","Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['kumasi', 'national', 'mr', 'farmers', 'cooperative', 'farming', 'members', 'launched', 'cocoa', 'cocobod', 'plans', 'ghana', 'famers', 'cooperatives']", 
39,39,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Greater Accra Region Leads HIV Infection - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907180515.html,"The Greater Accra Region recorded the highest number of new HIV infections last year with about 4,593 people contracting the disease.

Currently, the region leads with the most number of persons living with HIV (77,132) across the country and though out of the figure, about 28,000 people were using anti-retroviral (ART), close to 3,000 people died in the region of the disease in 2018.

The 2018 HIV/AIDS National Estimates and Projections released by the Ghana AIDs Commission (GAC) in Accra yesterday, showed that 2.06 per cent of the adult population in the region were at risk of the virus.

The report, which pegged national estimated number of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in the country at 334,714, with 19,931 new infections, cited the Ashanti Region as the second with the highest HIV prevalence (75,675).

Of the top 20 districts in the country with highest HIV prevalence, the Lower Manya Krobo in the Eastern Region topped with 5.56 per cent, followed by Tano South (5.35 per cent) in the Ahafo Region, with Atiwa West in the Eastern Region recording the lowest prevalence rate (3.05 per cent).

Acting Director General of GAC, Mr Kyeremeh Atuahene, throwing more light on the situation, said adult HIV prevalence in the country stood at 1.69 per cent with estimated AIDS deaths across all ages at 14,181.

Nonetheless, based on the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target by 2020, he said of the total number of PLHIVs in the country, about 185,000 people had been diagnosed, 113,000 put on ART and 75,000 had attained viral suppression.

""This is where we are and we need to do more to achieve the targets. We may not reach it by 2020 but we have put in place measures to achieve it shortly after the deadline,"" he stated.

Of particular concern to Mr Atuahene was the increasing number of orphaned children due to HIV/ AIDS, which had reached 226,463, indicating the commission's resolve to offer support to such orphans.

""The commission recognises the need to support such children, particularly those who have been abandoned by families after their parents died of HIV but we are constrained by funds.

""However, we have decided to establish the National AIDS Fund and it's in the process of operationalisation, once it is done, such children will be highly considered.""

Dr Stephen Ayisi Addo, Programme Manager for the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), said new data gathered showed increase of new infections in urban centres where key populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men etc) were responsible for the spread of the infection were mostly located.

""HIV in Ghana is now urbanised,"" he said, citing the tendency to indulge in high-risk sexual interaction, monetisation of sex, migration, especially by the youth to major centres and unwillingness to undergo HIV test as accounting for the rise in new infections.

Dr Ayisi Addo, however, mentioned interventions including intensifying public campaigns on the disease, particularly on the popular ABC - Abstinence, Be Faithful and Condom Use, school engagements, adherence to treatment to suppress the virus among others to achieve the global agenda.

""We want to make it clear that there is no cure yet for HIV and people infected will have to adhere to treatment which is free instead of resorting to other medications which is costly and pose higher risk to patients.

""We also need to stop the stigma and discrimination against infected people to enable them live to their full potential,"" he advised.

Data Quality Assurance Manager of the GAC, Mr Isaiah Doe Kwao, on his part, was not happy the country could not boast of a much decentralised data collection system on HIV/AIDs to inform decision making.

This is the third time Prof. Oquaye has taken the seat as the acting President since assuming office as the Speaker of the Seventh Parliament of the Fourth Republic of Ghana.

Prof. Oquaye's assumption of the presidential throne, Tuesday night, was occasioned by the absence of the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and his Vice, Dr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia, from the jurisdiction.

His swearing-in was in accordance with Article 60 (11) of the 1992 Republican Constitution which provides for the Speaker of Parliament to act in the absence of the President and his Vice.

Out of the number, 66,348, representing 85.1 per cent of the total postings have been deployed to the public sector while the private sector received 11,614 personnel representing 14.9 per cent of the total figure.

Consequently, a total of 6,000 were deployed to support the Agricultural sector including the Planting for Food and Job (PFJ) Policy.

At a press briefing to announce the postings in Accra yesterday, the Executive Director of the National Service Scheme (NSS), Mr Mustapha Ussif said 2,000 personnel were also posted to support NSS's newly introduced poultry entrepreneurship programme which focused on all the value chain in poultry production.

Postings registrations, he said, would commence at all regional centres across the country from Monday, July 22 to Friday, August 20.

He mentioned that the period was provided to ensure service personnel had sufficient time to go through the registration processes before formally beginning their service on September 2.

According to Mr Ussif, all service personnel were required to provide their student's identification cards (ID) and any valid national ID card to avoid impersonation or ""attempts by unscrupulous persons to compromise the process"".

The Executive Director, however, noted that the personnel were required to book an appointment on the scheme's website before reporting to the premises of the designated registration centres to register, adding that personnel who showed up at the registration centres without appointment letters would be turned away.

He revealed that the trend in the regional distribution with regard to requests, choice of regions and deployments had not seen much change as compared to previous years.

""The Greater Accra, Northern and Ashanti regions received very high posting requests while the two upper regions, Upper East and Upper West recorded low requests but we are working to shore up the numbers in these two regions with late registrations and postings in due course,"" he added.

Mr Ussif advised the service personnel to stay away from people who might approach them to offer assistance to change their postings, saying such persons should be reported to any officer of the scheme or the law enforcement agencies for the necessary action to be taken against them.

Started in 1973, the National Service programme is a compulsory one-year service required of all citizens of Ghana who are 18 years and above, at the time of deployment to, among other objectives, encourage the spirit of national service among all segments of Ghanaian society.

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 11 2019 (IPS) - The United Nations has warned of drought, disease and war preventing farmers from producing enough food for millions of people across Africa and other regions, leading to the need for major aid operations.

A report called the Crop Prospects and Food Situation by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that shortages of grain and other foodstuffs have left people in 41 countries — 31 of them in Africa — in need of handouts. Related IPS Articles Food From Thought

Looking to the Land in the Climate Change Race

Desertification ‘More Dangerous and More Insidious than Wars’

“Ongoing conflicts and dry weather conditions remain the primary causes of high levels of severe food insecurity, hampering food availability and access for millions of people,” U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters on Tuesday.

Southern Africa has experienced both dry spells and rainfall damage from Cyclone Idai, which made landfall in Mozambique on Mar. 14. The storm caused “agricultural production shortfalls” and big “increases in cereal import needs,” added Haq.

Farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia have seen harvests decline this year. Some three million people faced shortages at the start of 2019, but food price spikes there will likely push that number upwards in the coming months, researchers say.

In eastern Africa, crop yields have dropped in Somalia, Kenya and Sudan due to “severe dryness”, added Haq.

According to the FAO, life for rural herders in Kassala State, in eastern Sudan, has been upended by a drought that has forced them to move livestock away from traditional grazing routes in pursuit of greener pastures.

“Life would be so hard if our livestock died. We wouldn’t have food or milk for the children,” Khalda Mohammed Ibrahim, a farmer near Aroma, in Kassala State, told FAO. “When it is dry, I am afraid the animals will starve — and then we will too.”

Droughts are getting worse, says the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). By 2025, some 1.8 billion people will experience serious water shortages, and two thirds of the world will be “water-stressed”.

In Asia, low yields of wheat and barley outputs are raising concerns in North Korea, where dry spells, heatwaves and flooding have led to what has been called the worst harvests the hermit dictatorship has seen in a decade, the report said.

More than 10 million North Koreans — or 40 percent of the country’s population — are short of food or require aid handouts, the U.N.’s Rome-based agency for agriculture said in its 42-page study.

FAO researchers also addressed the spread of a deadly pig disease in China that has disrupted the world’s biggest pork market and is one of the major risks to a well-supplied global agricultural sector.

China is grappling with African swine fever, which has spread across much of the country this past year. There is no cure or vaccine for the disease, often fatal for pigs although harmless for humans.

By the middle of June, more than 1.1 million pigs had died or been culled. The bug has also been reported in Vietnam, Cambodia, Mongolia, North Korea and Laos, affecting millions of pigs and threatening farmers’ livelihoods.

The FAO forecast a five percent fall in Chinese pork output this year, while imports were predicted to rise to almost two million tonnes from an average 1.6 million tonnes per year from 2016 to 2018.

Conflict is another worry, the FAO said. While Syria and Yemen have seen “generally conducive weather conditions for crops”, fighting between government forces, rebels and other groups in both countries has ravaged agriculture.

Violence in Yemen has triggered what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 3.3 million people displaced and 24.1 million — more than two-thirds of the population — in need of aid.

Last month, the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) announced a “partial suspension” of aid affecting 850,000 people in Yemen’s capital Sanaa, saying the Houthi rebels that run the city were diverting food from the needy.

Likewise, in Africa, simmering conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan have caused a “dire food security situation”. In South Sudan, seven million people do not have enough food.","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2019/07/6907093395_aab38426ee_z.jpg,"['drought', 'africa', 'war', 'food', 'million', 'shortages', 'disease', 'uns', 'dry', 'seen', 'hit', 'global', 'sudan', 'fao', 'agriculture']",

President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has launched a Community Mining Programme (CMP) at Wassa Akropong, in the Western Region.

The Community Mining Programme is aimed at formalizing mining in selected communities across the country.

With at least one community mine expected to be set up in each of the mining districts in the country, the community mines are expected to provide job openings for over 4,500 miners that were trained by the government at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT), Tarkwa.

At the ceremony to launch the pilot programme on Wednesday, President Akufo-Addo said the Community Mining Programme would ensure that ""mining will be done the right way, within the tenets of the law, and will not destroy our natural resources.""

He said, ""Today, we are launching a type of mining that will benefit all of us. I am here to plead with the young men who are participating in the community mining to do their best to adhere to all the laws and do a good job so that money will return to Wassa Amenfi. The money will come.""

He assured that the programme would be replicated in other towns in Ghana by September this year, and would be closely monitored to ensure that the standards that have been set for the CMP are adhered to.

The Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Illegal Mining, Prof. Kwabena Frimpong Boateng said the Minerals Commission had acquired several zones in each of the mining districts for this purpose, with some traditional authorities also providing land for the CMP.

He said some large-scale mining companies have shed off areas to be used for the CMP, and, between now and September, concessions for the various CMP would be mapped out by the IMCIM Mapping Team and uploaded onto the GalamStop software.

Prof. Frimpong Boateng stressed that canoes fitted with outboard motors have been procured for the Riverine Team to monitor the water bodies.

""With the rolling out of the CMP, there should be no excuse whatsoever for miners to be mining illegally in the water bodies,"" he added.","Fri, 26 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['wassa', 'cmp', 'mining', 'president', 'community', 'water', 'money', 'mines', 'launches', 'team', 'programme', 'ghana', 'set']",

The Vice President of the Republic, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia made the announcement on Saturday, 6th July, when he joined the people of Elmina to celebrate the 2019 Edina Bakatue festival to mark the beginning of a fishing season.

Celebrated under the theme, ""Buy made in Ghana goods; use goods made in Ghana and promote jobs for the youth"", Dr. Bawumia lauded the paramount chief of Elmina, Nana Kodwo Conduah VI, and the chiefs and people of Elmina, saying that the theme for this year's celebration was timely because it is line with President Akufo-Addo's vision of building a Ghana Beyond Aid, where we harness internal resources for the development of our country.

Addressing the durbar, Vice President Bawumia said the government's inclusive development agenda is designed to improve the quality of life of all Ghanaians regardless of geographical, religious or ethnic affiliations.

Currently at Elmina, sod has been cut for work to start on the Elmina Heritage Bay project. The first phase of this project is currently ongoing with enhanced durbar grounds and a reverential garden under construction.

Touching on the fish landing sites Dr. Bawunia stated that ""as part of the broader government agenda to provide fish landing sites along the coastal communities, funding for ten such fish landing sites has been secured and works shall begin soon. The ten sites where the landing sites and related facilities will be constructed include: Teshie in the Greater Accra Region, Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Elmina, Winneba, Mumford, Senya-Bereku, Fetteh-Gomoah and Moree in the Central Region and Keta in the Volta Region.""

""Measures to protect the coastline from the erosive effects of the sea has led to government constructing sea defense walls along the coast"".

""The Navy and Marine Police are also being assisted to beef up patrols to ensure that perpetrators of illegal fishing are dealt with, Vice President Bawumia indicated"", he added.

Dr. Bawumia urged Edinaman to take advantage of the numerous social interventions introduced by the Akufo-Addo government.

""I urge the people of Elmina to take advantage of the interventions provided under the Planting for Food and Jobs, Rearing for Food and jobs and Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) programmes:

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 25 2019 (IPS) - Humanitarian groups and the United Nations are warning of another drought in the Horn of Africa, threatening a repeat of the deadly dry spell and famine that claimed lives in Somalia and its neighbours eight years ago.

The British charity Oxfam said Thursday that more than 15 million people across drought-stricken parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia now needed handouts and warned of a hefty death toll unless donors stumped up cash fast. Related IPS Articles Drought, Disease and War Hit Global Agriculture, Says U.N.

Desertification ‘More Dangerous and More Insidious than Wars’

“We cannot wait until images of malnourished people and dead animals fill our television screens. We need to act now to avert disaster,” said Lydia Zigomo, Oxfam’s regional director for the Horn of Africa.

According to an Oxfam report, donors were quick to dig into the pockets for a drought in 2017, helping to stave off a famine that could have been as deadly as the 2011 dry spell that left more than 260,000 dead, and many more hungry and sick.

But while the humanitarian response was well-funded back in 2017, donor governments have not raised enough cash yet this time around, added Zigomo, a human rights lawyer from Zimbabwe.

“We learned from the collective failures of the 2011 famine that we must respond swiftly and decisively to save lives. But the international commitment to ensure that it never happens again is turning to complacency,” said Zigomo.

“Once again, it is the poorest and most vulnerable who are bearing the brunt.”

Halima Adan, Deputy Director of Save Somali Women and Children, said in the Oxfam report that the slowness of the response to the drought “mean[s] women’s burdens and vulnerability are increasing. In often hostile environments, local actors are best placed to reach those most in need, where emphasis must be on reaching women and children”.

The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR has also sounded the alarm. Somalia’s recent April-June and October-December rainy seasons were drier than expected, worsening an arid spell that was already hitting farmers and herders across the turbulent country.

Some 5.4 million Somalis were expected to be facing food shortages by September, and 2.2 million of them would need “immediate emergency assistance” UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch warned last month.

Donors had only handed over one fifth of the 711 million dollars that was requested in an appeal in May, added Baloch.

“The latest drought comes just as the country was starting to recover from a drought in 2016 to 2017 that led to the displacement inside Somalia of over a million people,” Baloch told reporters in Geneva.

“Many remain in a protracted state of displacement.”

Last month, the European Union launched a 3.2 million euro scheme to manage water sources and agriculture and lessen the impact of drought, in cooperation with officials in Somalia’s capital, Mogadishu, and the northern breakaway region of Somaliland.

“Water and land are critical resources for the Somali economy and people’s livelihoods but are also extremely vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change,” said EU diplomat Hjordis D’Agostino Ogendo.

“While access to water needs to increase, needed infrastructures are to be designed and managed in a sustainable way.”

Somalia has seen little but drought, famine and conflict since dictator Siad Barre was toppled in 1991. The country’s weak, U.N.-backed government struggles to assert control over poor, rural areas under the Islamist militant group al Shabaab.

Droughts are getting worse globally, according to the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). By 2025, some 1.8 billion people will experience serious water shortages, and two thirds of the world will be “water-stressed”.

Though droughts are complex and develop slowly, they cause more deaths than cyclones, earthquakes and other types of natural disaster, the UNCCD warns. By 2045, droughts will have forced as many as 135 million people from their homes.

“With climate change amplifying the frequency and intensity of sudden disasters … and contributing to more gradual environmental phenomena, such as drought and rising sea levels, it is expected to drive even more displacement in the future,” added Baloch.

But U.N. experts say there is hope. By managing water sources, forests, livestock and farming, soil erosion can be reduced and degraded land can be revived, a process that could also help tackle climate change.","Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2019/07/6162436517_d4091b6697_z-1.jpg,"['drought', 'africa', 'million', 'oxfam', 'famines', 'horn', 'water', 'spell', 'need', 'famine', 'past', 'expected', 'threatens', 'somalia', 'rerun']",

- This comes after his bench role at the AFCON 2019 going on in Egypt

- The 33-year-old striker has played in seven Nations Cup tournaments for Ghana

Ghana's all time top scorer Asamoah Gyan is set to retire from international football following the Black Stars elimination from the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

The Black Stars could not end Ghana’s 37-year AFCON drought following their round of 16 defeat to Tunisia and lost 5-4 on penalties after the game ended 1-1 on Monday, July 8.

""I could call this tournament, my last having represented Ghana at this level for seven times,"" Gyan told GNA Sports

""Though I have not yet taken a concrete decision yet, I am still considering it, because we have young ones in the team that need to be given the chance to blossom in the national colours,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Ghana Football Association's ex-president, Nyaho Tamakloe believes head coach Kwesi Appiah's decision to bench Asamoah Gyan contributed to Black Stars' abrupt exit.

Gyan had earlier kicked up a storm after announcing his retirement before AFCON.

The former Sunderland player was livid after Appiah stripped him of captaincy and handed the armband to Andre Ayew, after seven years of Gyan being skipper.

However, calm was restored after Ghana President Akufo-Addo intervened and convinced the 33-year-old to rescind his decision.

Gyan played the role of general captain of the team off the pitch, owing to his vast experience and his unmatched achievements for Black Stars.

He did not get much of a chance to shine for Ghana in Egypt and spent most of his time bench warming.

The four time Africa champions will have to wait a little longer to end their AFCON title drought and may have to do it without their all time top scorer.

From 13,355 cases recorded in 2014, it reduced to 13,014 in 2015, plummeted to 12,404 in 2016, declined further to 11,474 in 2017 and to 11,386 last year, per the Ghana Health Service (GHS) Antenatal Care (ANC) records.

Albeit the rate is still high, the gains being made helped the region drop from its long held apex position on the teenage pregnancy 'league table' to second place in the Ghana Maternal Health Survey ,2017.

Mrs Thywill Kpe, the Regional Director of the Department of Gender disclosed this in a presentation in Cape Coast on Monday during a field tour by a delegation from UNICEF, UNFPA and their partners to the region.

The three-day tour of the region, which started on Monday, is to assess the progress of a joint programme dubbed, 'Empowering Adolescent Girls through Improved Access to Comprehensive Sexual Education (CSE) and Rights-Based Quality Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH) Services in Ghana' funded by Canada Global Affairs.

Began last year and running in 36 districts in eight regions, the three-year programme, is expected to improve access of adolescent girls, in and out of school, to gender-sensitive CSEs and SRH and help reduce adolescent pregnancy

The gains, according to Mrs Kpe were as a result of diverse factors including increased public education by the department, GHS, and other stakeholders in the region including programmes and interventions being implemented by UNICEF, UNFPA and other development partners.

Delving into the district breakdown of last year's figures, she said Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa had the highest cases of 18.23 per cent among the 22 districts, followed by Assin South with 17.99 and Agona East with 17.08, Awutu Senya recorded the least of 7.84 trailed by regional capital, Cape Coast with 8.12 per cent.

Mrs Kpe said in 2017, the GHS as part of efforts to get data on persons responsible for pregnancies introduced a data gathering initiative called, 'Who makes the adolescent pregnant' which revealed age, profession and marital status.

She said that year, 1,859 electricians were responsible for teenage pregnancy in the region, followed by small scale farmers (1,733); drivers (1,476); fishermen (696); masons (638); traders (493); unemployed (491); students( 319); with others including motor riders, small scale miners and tailors.

Mrs Kpe also touched on domestic violence, revealing that reported cases shot up from 2,666 in 2016 to 3,409 in 2017 and increased minimally to 3419 with non-maintenance and assault cases leading the charts over the three years.

On challenges being faced, Mrs Kpe mentioned inadequate logistics for programmes monitoring, non-availability of Police Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit (DOVVSU) offices in some districts, charges for endorsing medical forms for rape and defilement victims.

She said the region could reduce teenage pregnancies further if collaboration amongst stakeholders was enhanced.","Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['teenage', 'region', 'cases', 'including', 'pregnancy', 'kpe', 'health', 'central', 'ghs', 'adolescent', 'ghana', 'decline']", 
53,53,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Zambia: Crises Looming in Zambia's Drought-Affected Areas - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907180267.html,"Lusaka — Major health, protection and education crises are unfolding in the southern and western parts of Zambia that are bearing the brunt of a prolonged drought battering the country.

The country of some 17 million people is grappling with protracted drought as a consequence of significant rainfall deficit in the November-March season.

Effects are noticeable in the Southern and Western provinces where agricultural production has declined.

Consequently, households are sharply depleting food stocks and are increasingly dependent on market purchases, driving up the prices of staple foods such as the staple maize.

Some 260 000 people, representing 22 percent of the total population are in need of food assistance in the west, while 246 000 people require food assistance in the south of Zambia.

They constitute a significant portion of the total 1,172 million people estimated in need of similar assistance around the entire Southern African nation.

This represents a negative change of fortunes in a country that has in recent years been an exporter of grain to neighbouring countries enduring successive droughts.

An assessment by the National Vulnerability Assessment Committees of Southern African Development Community (SADC) Member States, indicates Zambia has the most significant increase in food insecurity compared to last year, with a 144 percent increase.

In Choma, the capital city of Southern Province, the price for white maize have more than doubled to ZK3 (or US$0,24)/ kilogramme.

Kalomo, Gwembe Siavonga and Sinazongwe are among other areas worst impacted by the drought.

It is more than ZK1,25/kg higher than the five-year average, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a provider of information and analysis on food insecurity.

With a decline in food and water availability is noticeable, humanitarian organisations fear the situation degenerating into multiple crises around education, gender and health.

The World Health Organisation (WHO), people who are facing severe food insecurity, malnutrition, and poor access to clean water and sanitation are at particular risk of diarrhoeal and communicable diseases.

High malnutrition rates, persisting outbreaks of tuberculosis, cholera, and malaria are also seen limiting people's resilience to reduced food intake, linked with negative coping mechanisms.

It is feared the schooling of children might be at risk, as the youngsters' attendance could decline due to decreased household resources paying for school fees and school material, hunger and children looking for alternative livelihood strategies to help their families.

Forced absences from school, related to seasonal migrations to ensure access to water, have especially been observed in Sinazongwe district, one of the worst drought-affected districts in Southern Province of Zambia.

The Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) noted due to a lack of water sources, people were obliged to look for resources further from their houses thus increasing protection concerns for women and children who might be exposed to sex and gender-based violence.

Women have reported travelling in groups in search of water, so as to minimise risks.

""Traveling on one's own is dangerous. You never know who might be lurking in the bushes to take advantage of women and children walking long distances to fetch water and firewood,"" said Luwi Makasa, woman in Siavonga.

Last month, the Zambia Conference of Catholic Bishops called on the government to declare a hunger crisis in drought-affected areas in the southern and western regions.

However, Vice President, Inonge Wina, told legislators that the country had adequate grain.

""The Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit is already distributing relief food in affected districts,"" she said.","Thu, 18 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['droughtaffected', 'food', 'areas', 'water', 'children', 'zambia', 'significant', 'zambias', 'looming', 'school', 'western', 'need', 'southern', 'country', 'crises']",

Source: ghananewsagency.org

The government of Ghana is determined to retool and reposition the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), to become the best meteorological institution in the sub-region.



""The government has demonstrated this commitment by procuring a number of equipment such as automatic weather stations, calibration equipment, vehicles and a number of others”.



Mr Vincent Sowah Odotei, Deputy Minister of Communications, said this in Accra on Wednesday, at the opening of a National Consultative Workshop for the establishment of a National Framework for Climate Services in Ghana.



He said Ghana, is a Co-Chair of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Advocacy Group, was particularly keen on empowering the GMet, to take the needed climate action, in pursuance of the attainment of SDG 13.



""It is important for Ghana to tailor our climate services to the needs of end-users, and climate information should respond to the specific needs of users through the relevant forecast, based on advisory services and decision-making tools,"" said the Deputy Minister.



Mr. Odotei noted that the implementation of Ghana's National Framework for Climate Services required strong partnerships and collaboration with international organisations and user groups such as sectorial experts, government agencies, the private sector and the academia.



He said the government would support GMet, which was the lead agency in the implementation, to ensure that climate services were efficiently provided for the improvement of climate information products, predictions and outlook.



The Deputy Minister said the government through the Ministry of Communication would ensure that the framework was implemented to the letter.



He said flagship programmes being implemented by the government, such as the Planting for Food and Jobs, One village one Dam and One District One Factory were all climate reliant, which made the establishment of the national framework timely.



""The Ministry through GMet, would promote and strengthen public education campaigns to all end-users, on how climate plays a key role in their activities and informs their activities,"" Mr. Sowah said.



Dr. Michael Tanu, the Director-General of the Ghana Meteorological Agency, who chaired the programme, said climate change and the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, flash floods, landslides and rising temperatures in the midst of massive urbanization, ""threatens our very survival.""



He said National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, therefore, needed to develop early warning systems, to help mitigate the impact of these disasters as a matter of urgency.



Dr. Tanu added, ""though some work on this has been done in various agencies and institutions in the country, there is the need for collaboration and coordination for resilience.""



The three-day workshop is being hosted by GMet, under the auspices of the Ministry of Communication.","Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/src/Odotei_Sowah1.jpg,"['meteorological', 'national', 'agency', 'framework', 'services', 'ministry', 'climate', 'deputy', 'retool', 'ghana', 'gmet']", 
55,55,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Mid-Year Budget Review - Ghanaians Want More Improvement in Their Lives - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907220631.html,"There is some anxiety among ordinary Ghanaians as to the measures the government is expected to introduce in the mid-year budget review to continue the path of stabilisation of the economy and place it on the path of strong, diversified and resilient growth.

Generating the needed resources through taxation and other fiscal policy measures are key to building a resilient economy, much in line with the government policy Ghana Beyond Aid sustainable development agenda.

Boosting revenue mobilisation by strengthening tax administration, plugging revenue loopholes and leakages, and combating tax evasion, building reasonable levels of foreign reserves, maintaining a solid balance of payment position and maintaining overall stability of the Ghana cedi against currencies of major trading partners are key priorities of the government.

It is our expectation that the measures that the government plans to introduce must help to consolidate the relatively economic gains achieved in order to create more wealth and prosperity for the benefit of all.

The Trade Union Congress (TUC), Ghana, as the mouthpiece of Ghanaian workers, at the end of its General Council Meeting on June 28, among other concerns, expressed the need to effectively translate the gains in the macroeconomic management into real and visible improvements in the living conditions of Ghanaians.

""Indicators presented by the Ghana Statistical Service and the Economic Management Team suggest that the economy is growing and there is some relative macroeconomic stability. The figures show that inflation and fiscal deficit have been declining consistently; there is trade surplus, and the value of the Ghana Cedi has stabilised in terms of the major international currencies,"" the TUC has noted.

The TUC, however, pointed out ""We have pointed out time and again in our previous statements, the apparent good sets of macroeconomic statistics are not adequately and visibly reflecting in the lives of the majority of Ghanaians... .the cost of living remain high, while the economy is growing, real wages are declining. No economy can grow on sustainability basis if real purchasing power keeps declining.""

""The people of Ghana are expecting that the improvement in the macroeconomic management, as shown by the macroeconomic indicators, should reflect visibly in their pockets and in their lives,"" the TUC added.

The Ghanaian Times cannot agree more with the sentiments expressed by the TUC, and also humbly summit that the economy must be resilient enough to meet the aspiration of the ordinary Ghanaian.

There is growing inequalities in the country, evidently confirming that economic gains are only concentrated in few hands, at the expense of the majority.

We are aware of pro-poor policies and other social protection interventions, but how sustainable are these measures?

Under the Sustainable Development Goals, agenda 2030, for which Ghana is a chief advocate, we are expected to work hard towards achieving economic growth that will help translate into economic well-being and welfare of Ghanaians and to reduce inequality as much as possible.

It is refreshing that the Sustainable Development Goals Voluntary National Report showed that macroeconomic indicators including budget deficits, inflation and interest rates were declining, poverty has declined from 24 per cent to 23 per cent in 2017, and that trade balance recorded surpluses in 2017 and 2018, resulting in improved balance of payment terms.

The efforts of the economic management team is laudable, and Ghanaians still expect them to do more to grow the economy and ensure economic benefits truly reflect in the lives of majority of Ghanaians so that no one is left behind.","Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['review', 'lives', 'macroeconomic', 'ghanaians', 'budget', 'economy', 'midyear', 'sustainable', 'development', 'management', 'economic', 'trade', 'ghana', 'tuc', 'improvement']",

Indonesia, one of the early adopters of the HCP, is among the many countries around the world using social safety nets to help an estimated 10 million of its poorest and most vulnerable. The country’s two main social assistance programs—the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) and Bantuan Pangan Non-Tunai (BPNT)—are part of the Government’s commitment to accelerate investments in human capital through programs such as the Strategy to Accelerate Stunting Reduction (STRANAS).

PKH provides conditional cash transfers and resources to encourage positive behaviors: Eligible families receive a payment to help cover necessities such as food, conditional on sending their children to school and bringing them for regular health check-ups. This has led to an 11-percentage point decline in stunting, which is crucial because children who are too short for their age due to undernutrition suffer from lifelong health and learning deficits. The program has also increased primary school enrollment by an estimated two percentage points, with a nine-percentage point increase in secondary school. World Bank funding provides $200 million in support for the $1.8 billion per year program.

Egypt is also using social protection programs to help its most vulnerable. The Takaful and Karama program (“solidarity and dignity”) was launched in 2015 with $400 million in World Bank funding and as in Indonesia, income support to families is conditional on keeping children in school and ensuring access to health care. But Egypt’s program also extends assistance to the elderly, providing poor citizens over age 65 with an unconditional small monthly pension. To date, Takaful and Karama has benefitted more than 9 million people, or about 10 percent of Egypt’s population.





Expanding social protection in Africa to build human capital

The World Bank Group is rapidly expanding its social protection investments, and as part of the newly unveiled Human Capital Plan for Africa, it is setting ambitious targets, such as increasing safety nets and job training, by 2023. And while the number of social safety net programs across the region has expanded rapidly, most of Africa’s poor and vulnerable people still lack coverage. In fact, a new report on Realizing the Full Potential of Social Safety Nets in Africa found that just 10 percent of all Africans are covered—and poverty rates are higher than coverage rates in most areas. The HCI also finds that, on average, Sub-Saharan Africa realizes only 40 percent of its human capital potential – the lowest score among all regions—and 25 of the bottom 30 countries in the Index are in Sub-Saharan-Africa.

Currently, the Bank’s portfolio for social protection in Africa, is more than $7.8 billion across more than 50 projects, constituting 12 percent of Africa’s support from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund of the poorest.

PROTECT: Protecting human capital by building resilience

Known as “adaptive social protection,” these programs help protect a country’s human capital investments by building resilience, so that vulnerable people don’t fall deeper into poverty during difficult times. As a result, social protection measures often lie at the nexus of humanitarian and development response, as safety nets have become a primary means for governments to provide quick and direct support to the affected populations

As a result, they allow households to keep children in school and ensure adequate shelter and nutrition—such as when the Bangura family home burned down in their costal village in Sierra Leone.

In 2016, Southern Africa experienced the worst drought in more than 30 decades, with 32 million people experiencing food insecurity. This also resulted in increased levels of malnutrition, and difficulties in accessing water—all of which led to higher drop-out rates, and increased rates of communicable diseases, brought about by urban migration.

In response to this humanitarian crisis, the governments of Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique made critical efforts to expand their safety net programs to help ensure coverage of the affected populations, with the support of the World Bank. In the case of both Malawi and Lesotho, both countries decided to expand pilot safety net programs to national scale. In March this year, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth affected millions of people in Southern Africa and claimed more than 1,000 lives. To help with the recovery, World Bank Group President David Malpass announced $700 million in assistance for the three most-affected countries – Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe— covering more than 105,000 households affected by the emergencies.

And in Ethiopia, the Productive Safety Nets Program(PSNP)—one of the largest cash transfer programs in the world— is providing regular cash or food to beneficiaries in exchange for land restoration work, irrigation, and agroforestry. During the 2016 drought in the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia’s PSNP, along with Humanitarian Food Assistance (HFA) was expanded to temporarily cover 18.5 million people – 20 percent of the population – to avoid a famine and protect them from falling into poverty. Every year, the PSNP protects 8 million core program beneficiaries plus up to 2 million transitory food insecure people (about 10 million in total) through its scalable instrument.

EMPLOY: Social protection helps people become productive and realize their human capital

The jobs agenda is at the forefront of the HCP. Every month, two million new young people join the work force—a challenge compounded by the fact that 200 million people are unemployed and looking for work. Of those working, 65 percent are stuck in low productivity jobs.

The World Bank is stepping up its support to address country demand for generating more and better jobs, and to date has more than 580 active job-related projects, with investments totaling $75 billion.

These investments are helping low-income countries with large youth populations tackle significant challenges so that young people have the tools to lift themselves and their communities out of poverty. In Liberia, for example, more than 60 percent of the population is under the age of 24 and most people earn their income on a day-to-day basis as either day laborers or by trading at local markets. In 2017, the World Bank launched Liberia’s Youth Opportunities Project to provide young people with business training and income support, while also connecting them to mentors in the community. To date, some 2,000 women aged 18-27 have already opened or expanded more than 500 businesses, accumulating savings to invest in their future—and in doing so, contributing to their country’s stability and prosperity.

“Before I received the training, I was doing nothing. Today I can earn money. I can do everything for myself,” said Sonnie Barrie of the United Girls Business Group, which received funding from the project.","Mon, 29 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/1440x600/2019/jul/SPJleader.jpg,"['africa', 'safety', 'human', 'bank', 'million', 'programs', 'using', 'protection', 'employ', 'build', 'invest', 'support', 'protect', 'world', 'social', 'changing']",

Meeting in Paris, they signed a



The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They were joined by leaders from higher education institutions in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.*



They adopted



This article is part of a series on Transformative Leadership published by University World News in partnership with Mastercard Foundation. University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content. This article is part of a series onpublished byin partnership withis solely responsible for the editorial content.

The six principles, which have actions embedded, include:

• Pursue joint action through the U7+, including meeting each year in the context of the G7 process, “so that our actions can weigh in the discussions and contribute to making positive change a reality”.





• Recognise universities’ distinctive responsibility to train and nurture responsible and active citizens who will contribute to society, from the local to the global level.





• Recognise that “our universities have a major role to play in addressing the environmental issues and challenges to sustainability such as climate change, biodiversity and energy transition. This should include leading by example on our own campuses.”





• Recognise that universities have a distinctive and leading role to play regarding equality and inclusiveness in the world, and in combating polarisation in society.





• To engage with stakeholders and solve complex issues of global relevance universities must promote interdisciplinary research and learning, in particular bridging in research and teaching between social sciences, humanities, the life sciences and STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).





• Recognise that the U7+ “has the power to serve as a lab to consolidate best practices that can be shared both within our network and more broadly with universities and similar institutions worldwide for inspiration”.

The five global challenges the U7+ will focus on are: universities’ key role in a global world; climate change and cleaner energy; inequality and polarised societies; technological transformations; and community engagement and impact.



Patronage of President Macron



Under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron, the newly formed U7+ is an initiative of



They recognised that the themes of the forthcoming G7 summit were relevant to their university role and raison d’être.



“Universities have always been and remain global actors, and we act upon issues that relate to the G7 agenda,” said Vanessa Scherrer, vice-president for international affairs at Sciences Po, one of the founding institutions and current chair of U7+.



“G7 started opening to civil society a few years ago – there are now engagement groups for women, for youth, academies of science, business, work and so on.



“In that context, the U7+ is an alliance of world universities taking action in the area of the G7, and in a special way: rather than making recommendations to the heads of state of the G7, we will present our commitments to action, as a way of trying to make a change and lead by example. This is the DNA of U7+.”



With the G7 opening to civil society, new ideas and countries beyond the G7, and the fact that there were no engagement groups or ministerial meetings related to higher education and research, “the idea [for an alliance of universities] was discussed between the French founding universities and we realised it would be important for the world,” said Scherrer.



Rapid formation



The university alliance was created “in a very short time”, she said. “The first meeting of the French steering committee was in April, and we decided collectively on which international colleagues to invite – five universities from each of the G7 countries.”



The G7 universities then proposed institutions in other countries* to join their alliance. “The response was high from the outset, so we quickly realised our intuition was right,” said Scherrer.



The organisers had only a few weeks to negotiate and set up the complex international arrangements to establish the alliance in time for G7 preparatory meetings in June, before the first U7+ summit in July.



With the G7’s open approach to other countries under the French presidency, what was originally simply the ‘U7’ Alliance of world universities added ‘Plus’ to its title to become U7+, in recognition that universities from outside the group have joined.



U7+ leaders must now present their commitments to their faculty, students and staff, who have “a decisive role to play in these actions”, said Scherrer.



Interdisciplinarity stressed



She stressed the importance of interdisciplinarity in U7+ institutions, “especially topics related to new technology and its impact. It is important that STEM students are trained in the social sciences.”



For the future, after France hands on the G7 presidency to the United States at the end of 2019, Scherrer says: “At that point, we can say that the 47 presidents have committed U7+ to meet next year in the context of the G7 summit, whatever happens. We will remain a very flexible organisation, but universities from France, the US and UK, successive chairs of the G7, will work together.



“We are committed to meeting once a year, probably in a G7 country. We shall hold a mid-term meeting, and keep contact among us to monitor actions, and stay in touch with sherpas [the representatives of heads of state or government who prepare for the summits] to prepare for the next G7 summit.”



Monitoring is a high priority, and the ‘champion’ institutions will work together to harmonise the action.



“For example, on climate change,” said Scherrer, “all the champions have agreed to make systems comparable, with harmonised indicators, measurements, deadlines, deals and platforms.”



U7+ could take on different commitments in future, she said. The present ones “arose as key fields in which we are already global actors, and connected to the agenda of the G7 in France this year, but we agreed it could change next year, like the G7 which has a new focus each year”.



* Institutions that attended the U7+ summit are listed at the end of the Declaration.



At the first summit of the U7+ Alliance, an international alliance of leading universities from the Group of Seven (G7) countries and beyond, presidents of 47 institutions from 18 countries, representing more than two million students worldwide, adopted six principles to tackle five major global challenges.Meeting in Paris, they signed a Declaration committing to take concrete action related to themes of the G7 summit that will take place in Biarritz at the end of August under the 2019 French presidency.The U7+ summit on 9 and 10 July was attended by university presidents from the G7 advanced economy countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They were joined by leaders from higher education institutions in Argentina, Australia, Ghana, India, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea.*They adopted six principles to which a total of 245 individual actions are connected, in line with the G7 summit agenda. Universities will undertake specific actions within their own institutions, and several ‘champion’ institutions will oversee planning, coordination and monitoring of the participating working groups.The six principles, which have actions embedded, include:The five global challenges the U7+ will focus on are: universities’ key role in a global world; climate change and cleaner energy; inequality and polarised societies; technological transformations; and community engagement and impact.Under the patronage of French President Emmanuel Macron, the newly formed U7+ is an initiative of 13 French higher education institutions They recognised that the themes of the forthcoming G7 summit were relevant to their university role and“Universities have always been and remain global actors, and we act upon issues that relate to the G7 agenda,” said Vanessa Scherrer, vice-president for international affairs at Sciences Po, one of the founding institutions and current chair of U7+.“G7 started opening to civil society a few years ago – there are now engagement groups for women, for youth, academies of science, business, work and so on.“In that context, the U7+ is an alliance of world universities taking action in the area of the G7, and in a special way: rather than making recommendations to the heads of state of the G7, we will present our commitments to action, as a way of trying to make a change and lead by example. This is the DNA of U7+.”With the G7 opening to civil society, new ideas and countries beyond the G7, and the fact that there were no engagement groups or ministerial meetings related to higher education and research, “the idea [for an alliance of universities] was discussed between the French founding universities and we realised it would be important for the world,” said Scherrer.The university alliance was created “in a very short time”, she said. “The first meeting of the French steering committee was in April, and we decided collectively on which international colleagues to invite – five universities from each of the G7 countries.”The G7 universities then proposed institutions in other countries* to join their alliance. “The response was high from the outset, so we quickly realised our intuition was right,” said Scherrer.The organisers had only a few weeks to negotiate and set up the complex international arrangements to establish the alliance in time for G7 preparatory meetings in June, before the first U7+ summit in July.With the G7’s open approach to other countries under the French presidency, what was originally simply the ‘U7’ Alliance of world universities added ‘Plus’ to its title to become U7+, in recognition that universities from outside the group have joined.U7+ leaders must now present their commitments to their faculty, students and staff, who have “a decisive role to play in these actions”, said Scherrer.She stressed the importance of interdisciplinarity in U7+ institutions, “especially topics related to new technology and its impact. It is important that STEM students are trained in the social sciences.”For the future, after France hands on the G7 presidency to the United States at the end of 2019, Scherrer says: “At that point, we can say that the 47 presidents have committed U7+ to meet next year in the context of the G7 summit, whatever happens.

The fate of Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah is set to be decided by Monday after failing to end the country’s trophy drought at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.



The Ghana FA Normalisation Committee is expected to submit its reports to the Sport Ministry today on the team’s disappointing campaign in Egypt.



The Black Stars exited the continental showpiece at the round of 16 stage at the hands of Tunisia.



The last 16 elimination is the country’s worst performance in the tournament since 2006.



In January this year, President of the committee Dr Kofi Amoah dropped hint that Appiah’s head would be on the chopping board if the Black Stars miss out on the trophy.



“Per the contract, if Kwesi Appiah doesn’t win the AFCON 2019 he is gone. This is stated in his contract,” Amoah was quoted as saying.



Coach Appiah still has a running contract which will expire in December.



This follows the recent extension of his contract by the NC prior to the AFCON.","Fri, 26 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/src/Kwasi_Appiah----.jpg,"['kwasi', 'fate', 'decide', 'appiahs', 'contract', 'appiah', 'countrys', 'kwesi', 'ghana', 'black', 'committee', 'amoah', 'afcon', 'stars', 'coach']",

Jesus was the first-half hero in the Maracana, setting up Everton's opener on 15 minutes before restoring Brazil's lead on the stroke of half-time after Paolo Guerrero drew Peru level from the penalty spot.

But the Manchester City striker soon turned to the villain of the piece as his clumsy second bookable offence handed Peru the initiative with 20 minutes to play.

Five years on from their World Cup semi-final humiliation on home soil another upset looked on the cards, but substitute Richarlison's late penalty sealed an ninth Copa America for Brazil - their first since 2007 - which banished the demons of that 7-1 defeat to Germany in the process.

Tite's men took the lead on the quarter-hour when Jesus created space for himself down the right before crossing for striker Everton to volley home.

Brazil assumed control as Peru's efforts to respond yielded little and Philippe Coutinho fired just wide after latching on to a Roberto Firmino cross.

Peru were back in it a minute before the break when, after defender Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled inside the box as he slid into a challenge, Guerrero sent Alisson the wrong way from the spot.

However, Brazil restored their lead in stoppage time when Jesus swept home Firmino's cross to bring an end to an eventful first half.

Coutinho and Firmino both went close as the hosts attempted to kill the game off immediately after the restart, but Jesus' evening took a turn for the worse with 20 minutes remaining when he was sent off for a second bookable offence following a challenge on Carlos Zambrano.

Peru sensed an opportunity but two masterful substitutions from Tite - bringing on Richarlison and Eder Militao - ensured Brazil maintained a level of control.

61,61,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Corruption Getting Worse in Africa - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907120429.html,"More than half of all citizens surveyed in 35 countries across the African Continent think that corruption is getting worse in their respective countries, while less than quarter perceived that the fight against corruption is getting better, according to the Global Corruption Barometer in collaboration with Afro barometer.

The Report, which was released Thursday, July 11, 2019 shows that more than one in four people who accessed public services such as healthcare and education, paid bribe in the previous year.

That, according to the report is equivalent to 130 million people across the region as per the sampling of 47, 000 citizens in 35 countries.

The report also highlighted that corruption disproportionately affects the most vulnerable, with the poorest paying bribes twice as often as the richest, while young people pay more bribe than those over 55 years.

The survey found among other things that corruption is on the rise and many governments are failing to do enough, whereas concerns about the integrity of public officials remain high. It further found that Bribery demands are regular occurrence for many.

Addressing the media at the launch of the Report in Accra, Mrs Mary Awelana Addah, Programmes Manager of the Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII),a Local Chapter of Transparency International explained that in Ghana, the focus area of the survey included the bribery rates, changes in the level of corruption, participation of ordinary people in the fight against corruption, corruption by institutions and whether government is doing good or bad job of fighting corruption.

Regarding Citizens perception by Institutions, Mr Addah said 59 percent of the respondent perceive the Ghana Police Service to be the most corrupt institution followed by judges and magistrates 38 percent and Government Officials were third with 35 percent.

Parliament and members of Parliament were cited as the fourth most corrupt institution in Ghana according to 32 percent of the people surveyed.

She told the media that getting citizens to report persons to the appropriate authorities has been very difficult in spite of the passage of laws that guarantee protection and rewards proactive reporting.

She indicated that 60 percent of citizens surveyed said government was doing a good job with the fight against corruption while 30 percent thought government is not doing well.

""It is worthy of mention that 60 percent of respondents believe ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption,"" she added.

The GII per the revelations in the Report recommended that the state must intensify its efforts in the fight against corruption by adequately resourcing the key anti-corruption institutions to discharge their mandate. It also recommended that the Office of the Special Prosecutor should fast track investigations and prosecutions of many corruption cases pending and also make the public aware per section 3(3) of the Act establishing the Office of the Special Prosecutor as the level of confidence in the Office is gradually waning.

It added that the state should wean itself of the growing phenomenon of attacks on media personalities to allow the media to effectively hold policy accountable and provide the sources for and platform for civil society to hold their duty bearers accountable.","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn07.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00451930:ad17fc2bd6eb657196c4bc4a701cf951:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['africa', 'public', 'institutions', 'citizens', 'media', 'fight', 'report', 'office', 'getting', 'corruption', 'ghana', 'worse']",

According to the President of the Institute, Maame Ama Edumadze Acquah, the exercise would be effective as they look forward to the passage of a bill to regulate their profession.

She was interacting with the Ghanaian Times during the Institute's 50th anniversary celebration in Kumasi on Friday.

She said the passage of the Survey Council Act in Parliament would regulate the activities of surveyors in the country, lamenting that some unscrupulous people who had no certification were engaging in deceitful conduct.

The president noted that the passage of the law would align them with international standards, and called on surveyors to acquire leadership skills to help influence decision making for institutional change.

It was time, she said, surveyors took strategic decisions for the development of the country and citizenry, so that the number of people who would be living in urban areas would not suffer.

She said, ""This process will bring about structural development, possibly in the urban centres, so when surveyors equip themselves early to adjust to the change, which will definitely happen; it will be timely for all.""

Maame Ama Edumadze observed that when measures were put in place on time to save the lands, roads, transport and other land administration processes in the country, the poor, vulnerable and rich would be saved accordingly.

On the anniversary, the president explained that it was the key objective of the institution like surveyors to position the profession by articulating the professionals' role as effective leaders to promote and implement infrastructure to the best of standards.

The anniversary which was on the theme: 'Surveying Practice in Ghana, Celebrating the Past, Redefining the Future', brought together land professionals to discuss and increase participants' influence of becoming more familiar with the process of leading change.

For his part, the Chairman of the Institute, Kofi Cobbold, stressed the need for surveyors to embrace technology as a potential instrument in their profession.

He said the introduction of the digital information system had created an opportunity for the surveyors to use technology for planning and effective management of resources.

Mr Cobbold said technology was pervasive in all aspects of life, with land surveying also stepping up the pace of technology use.

He added that, land surveying had been an important factor in human civilisation since ancient history, as many kinds of surveying equipment had been used in the past to help land surveyors measure various parameters of land areas.","Tue, 23 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['institute', 'technology', 'president', 'rid', 'process', 'surveying', 'quacks', 'effective', 'surveyors', 'passage', 'ghana', 'land']",

As Coaches, Trainers, Players Call for Dissolution of Executive - AllAfrica.com",https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160533.html,"A section of baseball coaches, trainers and players have called for the immediate dissolution of the executive of the Ghana Baseball and Softball Federation (GBSF).

Referred to as Concerned Baseball Coaches and Trainers in Ghana and Concerned Players, the group made the appeal to the Director General of the National Sports Authority (NSA), Professor Peter Twumasi, in two separate petitions, insisting that the mandate of the current executive had expired.

The group stated that efforts to get the executive led by Mr. Albert Frimpong to organize fresh elections have fell on deaf ears and has in a way stalled the development and promotion of the sport as members of the two groups stay away from activities organized by the executive.

The petition, signed by over 25 coaches, trainers and players, said members have lost interest and trust in the present executive owing to the lack of initiatives and competition.

According to the group, the executive, since its election into office in May 2010, have failed to organise any congress or general meeting to afford stakeholders the opportunity to brainstorm on the way forward for the association.

The petition added that ""They have equally failed to organize any competition, be it league or any programme at junior or high school level.""

The petition which was also copied to the Minister of Youth and Sports, Isaac Kwame Asiamah, and sighted by the Times Sports chronicled a plethora of issues including the failure of the executive to source for sponsorship for the development of the twin game (baseball and softball).

""The neglect of the sport by the executives for the past nine years has culminated in a significant number of teams both at the senior and junior levels folding up, thereby reducing drastically activities on the baseball and softball front.""

It said instead of rallying members of the federation for the common good, its actions have scattered members some of whom feel intimidated in expressing their concerns about happenings in the GBSF.

As a result, the group indicated that activities of the national team have become that of individuals as the executive have shown no interest in the national team.

It also stated that Ghana has lost her enviable third ranked baseball nation in the country as a result of the absence of leagues and competition for the past nine years.

Econet says the network challenges were caused by a fault that started when generators at its operations centre failed to kick in after a Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) power outage.

But a power cut to Econet’s servers is no mere outage. It is effectively a major disruption to an already troubled economy teetering on the edge as it means 70% of Zimbabweans had no phones, internet and crucially EcoCash mobile money services. More than 14 million subscribers were caught off guard. People were stuck in banking halls, fuel queues, supermarkets and commuters to various places were stranded.

And in what seems like a never-ending cycle of misery for ordinary Zimbabweans in the last year, it is likely there will be more power cuts and ultimately more economic disruption due to the country’s currency troubles and—now, climate change.

Zesa has recently introduced an 18-hour load shedding schedule in most parts of the country because Zimbabwe relies on hydroelectric power from Lake Kariba along the border with Zambia where ongoing drought means water levels have dropped so low it’s forcing reduced electricity production.

In addition, Zesa owes over $50 million to Eskom in South Africa where it also get some of its electricity and the Zimbabwean government has repeatedly stated it doesn’t have enough foreign currency to settle the debt.

As for mobile operators they now have a significant expense as they have to use generators to power their stations but even that challenge is exacerbated because the country is in the middle of a fuel scarcity crisis which is causing prices of diesel to spike.

There are now real fears mobile operators will introduce a system where users in some parts of the country will not be able to access certain services on their networks as it has become too expensive to power up network towers using generators.

Zimbabwe’s economy has been deteriorating since president Emmerson Mnangagwa took over from his mentor Robert Mugabe in November 2017 through a military coup. The finance minister Mthuli Ncube last month scrapped a multi-currency regime and introduced a local currency which has not helped the situation by adding more uncertainty.

While some of the services had been restored eight hours later in the evening, subscribers were still reported to be having difficulties with Ecocash.

Economists see this as a huge blow to the economy as large chunks of the country’s economy runs through runs through electronic systems and mobile money dominated by EcoCash with 95% market share. It’s estimated around 5 million transactions a day more more than $200 million.

The ceremony, according to President Akufo-Addo, was in fulfilment of one of the campaign promises he made to the chiefs and people of Axim in 2016.

The President who was on his second day tour of the Western Region said he promised the chiefs and people of the Axim area during his campaign period that if he was voted as the president, he would make sure the landing beach was built for the fisher folks to have a good place to bring their catch on land.

The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Mrs Elizabeth Afoley Quaye, thanked the chiefs and people for their collaboration for a successful close season, saying the start of the project showed that the government was very much concerned about the fishing industry and the coastal areas.

She indicated that the project would bring about job creation and increase the food and nutritional values of the people of the area and the country at large.

According to her, infrastructural development was key to the development of the fishing industry, and advised the people to put an end to the use of wrong fishing gears and light to bring sanity to the industry.

The Omanhene of Axim, Awulae Attibrukusu III, noted that the project had been on the drawing board for years, adding that the ground breaking showed that President Akufo-Addo came to fulfil his campaign promise.

He bemoaned the state of the Effia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, which never befitted the region, and pleaded with the president to build a new regional hospital for the Western Region.

President Akufo-Addo used the occasion to register his displeasure at the attack on the Omanhene of the Lower Dixcove Traditional Area, Nana Kwasi Agyemeng IX, by some unknown assailants, stressing it was most unfortunate, and asked the security agencies to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to book.

In a related development, the Chief of Sekyere Hemang, Nana Kwedukyerefuor II, thanked the president for the implementation of his government's Free Senior High School policy.

The policy, which was implemented in September 2017, had seen some 270,000 more students enrolled into senior high schools across the country in two academic years, with all students in senior high schools, from September 2019, set to be covered by the policy.

Nana Kwedukyerefuor II, told the gathering that, ""You (President Akufo-Addo) have impressed many people with your hard work, when there was dumsor, we could sleep in darkness for three days, but ever since you came into power, dumsor is no longer a problem because of your great leadership and the measures you have put in place.""

Businesses remained closed till after 12noon as directed by the assembly.

At the Tema station, the hawkers had finished sweeping as at 7:00a.m. while the men among them including the various drivers unions helped the Assembly staff dredge the chocked drains.

The Municipal Environmental Officer of the Assembly, Mr Victor Acquaye, told the Ghanaian Times that the infant Municipality was always the first point of call for any visitor in Accra, hence the motivation to keep it tidy.

According to him the president's vision to make Accra the neatest capital city in Africa would be a mirage if residents did not help in cleaning the mess they caused.

Mr Acquaye explained that keeping a healthy environment was a shared responsibility that was why all business activities were halted so that everyone could partake in the exercise.

""The slightest flood would seriously derail the economic gains by the government and the assembly which is less than a year old,"" he said.

He stated that the assembly were responsible for supplying tools of the exercise with the residents made to understand that it was their duty to help clean up their communities and the idea paid off.

Mr Acquaye said letters would be sent to every area and those who refused to participate in the exercise would be fined and if they failed to pay the fine, they would be dragged to courts.

Both the men’s and women’s marathons, it has been suggested, were moved from the end of the Games to the start to coincide with national holidays when the normally gridlocked roads of the capital might prove quieter and more manageable.

The result was an immediate boost for organisers, with Gladys Tejeda and Cristhian Pacheco’s victories in the two distance races giving the host nation gold medals.

The triumphs for Peru appear to have given the Games early momentum among the local population.

Another benefit was that Tejeda’s victory was a good story in itself, given that she saw her Toronto 2015 gold taken away over a positive drug test.

Whether you take the controversial view or the local Peruvian angle that Tejeda had gained revenge for being stripped of the title four years ago for an allegedly inadvertent case, it is clearly a positive for Lima 2019 that people are talking, writing and reading about the Pan American Games.

Pacheco certainly played his part by completing the marathon double, leading to front page spreads of the Peruvian runners standing next to the country’s President Martín Vizcarra on the podium, hoisting their nation’s flag.

The distance runner then gave further promotion to the Games today, when he suggested the event could have a lasting effect. Pacheco insisted success at a home Games would show that Peruvian athletes could compete for and win Olympic medals.

Following his comments and the subsequent standing ovation from local journalists, I was surprised to discover that Peru, remarkably, have only won four Olympic medals. Shooter Edwin Vásquez, who died in 1993, remains their only Olympic champion, his triumph coming at London 1948.

The other medals were a women's volleyball silver at Seoul 1988, along with shooting silvers at Los Angeles 1984 and Barcelona 1992.

I wonder whether Lima 2019 could help to end this drought.

You suspect the home Games could lead to a greater number of Peruvian athletes locking up Tokyo 2020 qualification places due to the benefit of competing in front of a home crowd.

After all, the early indicators are that the host nation will vastly surpass the three gold, three silver and six bronze they earned four years ago in Toronto, given the Peruvian team matched the achievement on the first day here.

Panam Sports Coordination Commission head Keith Joseph earlier this week did what sporting officials do regularly, as he suggested the Games would deliver a great future for young people.

“Our projects are meaningful, impactful and sustainable,” he said. “What we have here is a milestone that will impact the lives of Peruvians, impact the lives of the people of Lima and impact the youth of the Americas.”

The President of Lima 2019, Carlos Neuhaus, went a little further.

""Lima 2019 has consolidated a new generation of Peruvians with new facilities,” he said. “Let's take this opportunity to make sport the centre of our lives. Peru has as its new standard ambitious projects made according to our needs.

“We did it together, the success belongs to everyone, together we are achieving the most spectacular event in our history. We win together, united.""

This is a topic that is contentious and used regularly by opponents to multi-sport events.

Events like the London 2012 Olympic Games have promised to inspire millions to get off the couch and become more active. But they have repeatedly been found to have had limited or no impact on participation levels.

Personally, I am unconvinced that the Peruvian population will suddenly take up sports like rugby sevens having had the opportunity to watch them at the Games.

I suspect the sports that were popular prior to the Games, such as football, will remain that way in two weeks’ time when the event draws to a close.

But if we focus entirely on a high-performance perspective, it seems possible that the Games could help Peru.

Neuhaus pointed out at the Panam Sports General Assembly that the Games had led to legislation being introduced to boost the provision of sport in schools in Peru.

While it might not necessarily lead to medal success in Japan’s capital city next year, you wonder whether it could lead to greater talent-spotting with potential stars of the future being found.

If we are to believe the hype from Lima 2019 and Panam Sports, the new venues are the best in the region.

Why then shouldn’t the facilities built for the Pan American Games here ultimately help to deliver long-term medal success for Peru at both Pan American and Olympic Games level?

This will undoubtedly be the long-term task for Peruvian sporting bodies, who will hope to utilise the facilities to bring back Olympic medals to Lima.

It will be interesting to see over the next couple of weeks whether Peru’s staging of the Pan American Games has led to new talent emerging with the potential of securing podium finishes at Tokyo 2020.","Sun, 28 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/image/1/o/MichaelPavittitg.png,"['drought', 'olympic', 'michael', 'pan', 'success', '2019', 'help', 'end', 'medal', 'lima', 'peruvian', 'peru', 'games', 'pavitt', 'impact', 'perus', 'gold']",

Seeks Reinstatement As V.c - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907240528.html,"There was pandemonium yesterday at the Winneba Campus of the University of Education, Winneba (UEW), when Professor Mawutor Avoke, former Vice-Chancellor, stormed the campus seeking reinstatement as Vice-Chancellor (V.C).

According to him, his decision followed his clearance by the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) after he was indicted for abusing his office.

""EOCO after a thorough probe concluded in black and white that we did not abuse our office or were involved in any procurement breaches. We are back to take over our respective offices and right place in the school,"" Prof Avoke said.

Speaking at a press conference, which was monitored by Ghanaian Times in the council chamber of the university in the company of the five dismissed staff, Prof. Avoke said he was prepared to work with all stakeholders of the university to bring about peace when he assumes the position of Vice-Chancellor again.

""I have already made moves towards building peace in the school that has been marred in controversy for the past two years. I urge all on the opposite side to consider the greater needs of the university and accept my peace-building efforts,"" he stated.

Although the Police initially resisted the idea of the press conference on the campus, Prof. Avoke and the other dismissed staff had access to the university and insisted that he would take over the running of the university from today.

This comes just hours after Kinsgley Amoakwah, Chairman, Senior Staff Association of the university, filed an application at the High Court demanding Prof. Avoke's reinstatement as Vice-Chancellor.

He also want the court to issue an order restraining Professor Anthony Afful-Broni from holding himself as the Vice-Chancellor or performing any such functions in that capacity of the UEW.

He also wants an order preventing Prof. Afful-Broni from ""continuously interfering with the administration of Prof. Mawutor Avoke,"" whom he claims was the legitimate Vice-Chancellor of the university.

The suit further was ""an order restraining Prof. Afful-Broni, his assigns, agents, or any person claiming through him from walking or driving within the precincts of the Main Administration Block of UEW, where Prof. Avoke's office is located.""

Prof. Avoke was ordered to step aside in 2017 by the Winneba High Court until a case brought against him and the University's Governing Council was determined.

He was dismissed by the Governing Council, chaired by Prof. Nicholas Abakah and replaced him with Prof. Afful-Broni.","Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['seeks', 'winneba', 'tension', 'storms', 'avoke', 'reinstatement', 'dismissed', 'uew', 'affulbroni', 'staff', 'order', 'vc', 'prof', 'office', 'university', 'ghana', 'mounts', 'vicechancellor', 'campus']",

He maintained that ""if care is not taken, the canker of propaganda as being used by opposition political parties, can tear this country apart and cause mayhem, hence causing division among the citizenry.

""Despite differences in political ideologies, politicians and party commentators must strive to elevate discussions and issues to reflect situations on the ground rather than always resorting to unverifiable lies in order to convince sympathisers,"" Mr Quaye stressed.

Sharing his experience on the recent kidnapping incidence of the two Canadians, he lamented that the occurrence affected his business and indicated that ""during that period, I was supposed to come to Ghana from the U.S, with 25 young American citizens who wanted to explore the business environment in Ghana.

""It was rather unfortunate that some politicians mainly from the opposition painted the country in bad light on the internet and most of these students, refused to embark on the trip upon reading those articles, only six students, who were bold enough traveled here,"" he noted.

Another incident he mentioned, was the latest allegation that President Nana Akufo-Addo's daughter, Ms Gyankroma Akufo-Addo, was contracted to airlift the Black Stars Supporters Union to Egypt for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations and, as a result, bagged US$2.4 million.

Later, a statement from the Youth and Sports Ministry, signed by the sector minister, Isaac Asiamah, denied the claim that Ms Akufo-Addo was in charge of feeding and sheltering the 120 supporters, each of whose travel expenses for the whole AFCON season amounted to US$20,000.

Mr Quaye insisted that ""the claim has resulted in damages and dented the image of the first family as publications have gone wide on various social media platforms on the incident which was not true.

""Going forward, I believe we must learn to do things right, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) party communicators must be quick to respond to such an allegation and make sure it doesn't attract global or national attention.

""Ghana doesn't need propaganda at this stage of our national development and cohesion, what is needed is ideas and contributions that will elevate the national discourse and progress,"" Mr Quaye pointed out.","Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['disturbing', 'national', 'quaye', 'politicians', 'parties', 'youth', 'propaganda', 'activist', 'supporters', 'rise', 'political', 'party', 'ghana', 'students']",

The others are Thomas Quayson, 30, carpenter, Paul Stephens, 37, electrician, Christopher Bonney, 62, farmer, and Justice Cromwell, also a farmer.

The arrest followed violent attacks on Nana Kwasi Agyemang IX, Omanhene of Lower Dixcove, and his people, last Sunday at Lower Dixcove Palace, in the Ahanta West District of the Western Region.

Public Relations Officer of the Western Regional Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Olivia Adiku, who confirmed the development to Ghanaian Times yesterday, said caution statements of the five suspects were taken after which the police granted them bail.

The Regional Police Command, which has taken over the case, said, the police has commenced investigations.

The Ghanaian Times reported yesterday that unknown assailants wielding machetes, invaded the palace, destroyed properties and kidnapped Nana Agyemang IX and four of his men.

DSP Adiku said the group also allegedly set barrels of fuel and several boats at the beach on fire, and detonated dynamite as they continued their destructions.

He said a police team from Agona Nkwanta, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Valentine Akposu, with reinforcement from Sekondi, under Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Kofi Darko, rushed to Dixcove and rescued Nana Kwasi Agyemang IX, and the four kidnapped persons from the palace of Nana Hima Dekyi XIV, half naked with cutlass wounds over their bodies.

DSP Adiku stated that the kidnapped were locked up in a room on the second floor of Nana Hima Dekyi's Palace, but they were rescued by the police and taken to the Efia Nkwanta Regional Hospital, where they are receiving treatment.

At about 11:30pm on Sunday, DSP Adiku said the police received information that Nana Hima Dekyi XIV, made an announcement for his people to gather at his palace.

According to her, the Upper Dixcove's Paramount chief allegedly mobilised well-built men (thugs) who wielded machetes and clubs to launch the attack.

DSP Adiku indicated that windscreens and glasses of two vehicles, belonging to the Omanhene of Lower Dixcove had been damaged, and eight boats set ablaze.","Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['taken', 'lower', 'dixcove', 'attack', 'hima', 'nana', 'palace', 'dekyi', 'granted', 'bail', 'adiku', 'regional', 'ghana', 'xiv', 'superintendent']", 
72,72,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Menzgold Customers Besiege CID Headquarters ... to Present Petition - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907180522.html,"Some aggrieved customers of Menzgold, yesterday besieged the headquarters of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), in Accra, to present a petition to the police.

The customers, who were clad in red bands, were, however, prevented from entering the premises by the police, but the leaders were called in to meet the senior police personnel.

A reliable police source at the CID that confirmed these to the Ghanaian Times in Accra yesterday, indicated that the leadership was asked to go by the proceedings of the public order acts in presenting petition to the police.

The police source said by the act they were to write to the police and specify what they exactly wanted and give them five days before the petition could be accepted.

The Ghanaian Times reported on July 12, 2019, that the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Menzgold, Nana Appiah Mensah, (also known as NAM 1), was arrested shortly after arrival in the country yesterday.

NAM I had since been put before court and remanded into police custody and may be charged with abetment to defraud and abetment to carrying banking business with licence.

He was arrested by the CID, when he arrived in the country by an Emirate Airline, at the Kotoka International Airport.

Nana Mensah's arrest follows an International Police (INTERPOL) red alert for his arrest to assist in investigation in the alleged fraud case.

A reliable source at the CID confirmed these to the Ghanaian Times in Accra, yesterday, stating that he was arrested and detained at the CID headquarters, Accra, for interrogation on alleged charge of defrauding by false pretence, following complaints by customers of Menzgold.

NAM1 has spent more than six months in police custody in Dubai, following his arrest there, in December, last year, over a botched gold business deal with a Dubai based company.

He is said to have landed in Dubai hoping to retrieve some $39 million owed Menzgold by the Dubai-based company, Horizon Royal Diamonds DMCC, for the supply of gold.

His arrest in Dubai, which was initially unknown to the CID of the Ghana Police Service police, triggered an INTERPOL process in 194 member countries, declaring NAM 1 a wanted man.

When the CID later confirmed his arrest, a government delegation was dispatched to Dubai, to facilitate the extradition of the CEO, but this failed as the case for which he was arrested in Dubai had not ended.

The Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) secured a court order to freeze all landed properties and vehicles belonging to NAM 1, including Menzgold Ghana Limited and Menzgold Office Complex, Zylofon Art Complex.","Thu, 18 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['accra', 'yesterday', 'petition', 'customers', 'source', 'dubai', 'arrest', 'besiege', 'arrested', 'menzgold', 'times', 'present', 'headquarters', 'ghana', 'cid']", 
73,73,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Ghana: Community Mining Programme Must Halt 'Galamsey' Activities - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907290364.html,"THE PRESIDENT, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo, on Wednesday, launched the Community Mining Programme (CMP), at Wassa Akropong, in the Western Region.

According to the aim of the programme, mining in communities will now be formalised across the country.

Under the programme, at least one community mine is expected to be set up in each of the mining districts in the country.

The community mines are expected to provide employment to more than 4,500 miners who have been trained by the government at the University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) at Tarkwa.

According to the President, the programme will ensure that ""mining will be done the right way, within the tenets of the law, and will not destroy our natural resources.

""Today, we are launching a type of mining that will benefit all of us. I am here to plead with the young men who are participating in the community mining to do their best to adhere to all the laws and do a good job, so that money will return to Wassa Amenfi,"" he said.

President Akufo-Addo assured that the programme would be replicated in other towns in Ghana by September this year, and would be closely monitored to ensure that the standards that have been set for the CMP were adhered to.

The Ghanaian Times commends government for the establishment of community mines, which is part of efforts to stop galamsey in the country.

Indeed, it is an important step taken by the government, not only to regulate small scale mining and offer secure jobs for small scale miners, but also to prevent destruction of the environment.

As a matter of fact, many Ghanaians have been worried over the impact of galamsey on the environment, particularly on water bodies, farms and the forest and have advocated for a complete ban on illegal mining activities.

It is, therefore, welcoming news that the community mining programme would be replicated in other towns across the country.

Although the government has assured that the programme would be monitored, we call for stringent supervision and policing of the activities of the miners who would be engaging in the CMP.

We say so because of the difficulties we face as a nation, in the fight against galamsey.

The country is yet to stop illegal mining in spite of all the efforts that have been made through the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on illegal Mining.

We hope that the community mining concept would eventually become the attraction for the illegal miners and drive them away from galamsey.

We urge the youth to embrace the new programme and support the government strategy to stop illegal mining, so that we can all save the environment.","Sat, 27 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['wassa', 'miners', 'mining', 'community', 'mines', 'halt', 'illegal', 'small', 'activities', 'galamsey', 'programme', 'towns', 'ghana', 'stop']", 
74,74,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Antibiotics Are Flooding Earth's Rivers - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/antibiotics-are-flooding-earths-rivers,"In a photograph, steam rises from a pile of garbage that sits by a river. The river is the Odaw, in Ghana, near the country’s capital city of Accra, and in the photo the Odaw’s water is black.

“They refer to it as a dead river.” “They refer to it as a dead river,” said Alistair Boxall, who is an environmental chemist at the University of York in the United Kingdom.

The person who took the photo is ecologist Robert Marchant, also of the University of York. Marchant was at the river to take a sample of the water as part of a global campaign, led by Boxall, to study concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the world’s rivers. Boxall, along with his colleague John Wilkinson, coordinated an international team that sampled rivers like the Odaw.

“We wanted to try and get a better understanding of what the levels of pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics, were around the globe,” Boxall said.

Boxall and Wilkinson sent their collaborators a box that contained sample vials, syringes, filters, and freezer packs. The collaborators sampled 711 river locations in 72 countries and then sent their samples back to Wilkinson and Boxall for analysis.

What Wilkinson and Boxall found is that 470 of those sites contained antibiotics, which come from sources including human excrement and drug manufacturing activity. Many of these antibiotics occur at concentrations above what the Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Industry Alliance—a group of private sector companies that aims to address the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria—says is safe. Here “safe” refers to those levels above which the alliance says bacteria can start to develop antibiotic resistance. According to Boxall, those levels can range anywhere from 20 to 32,000 nanograms per liter of water, depending on the antibiotic.

Doctors use antibiotics to treat a raft of bacteria-caused ailments, from tuberculosis to staph infections. Some bacteria can become antibiotic resistant when exposed to the drugs, which can make treatment next to impossible for doctors. In the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 23,000 people die each year from antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

At Ghana’s Odaw River, concentrations of antibiotics like metronidazole, used to treat things like skin and mouth infections, exceeded safe levels by a factor of 68. The Odaw, though, is not the worst-off river. More than 110 of the 711 sampled sites have concentrations that exceed safe levels by factors of up to 300. Rivers in Bangladesh, where concentrations hover around 40,000 nanograms per liter, are among the worst of that group.

“People are using these rivers to clean in, clean their clothes in. They’re sourcing their water from those sites,” said Boxall, who presented results from the campaign earlier this month at the Canadian Chemistry Conference and Exhibition in Quebec City. This means that people who use the rivers stand a greater chance of exposing themselves to the resistant bacteria.

The campaign helps address the threat that such bacteria pose by revealing what the prevalence of pharmaceuticals is in rivers around the world—something that should help prioritize which drugs merit the most attention when it comes to cleanup efforts.

Acquiring such data, however, would not have been possible without the global, standardized campaign conducted by Boxall and Wilkinson, according to environmental engineer Viviane Yargeau of McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in the study. “You know that you’re comparing apples and apples,” she said.

It is obvious that, the fight against climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

It is in this regard, for two days, on 7and 8 July, 150 youth leaders from across Sub-saharan Africa and Niger itself gathered during the African Union Summit in Niamey and pledged to take all necessary measures to fight against the negative impact of climate change initially in the Sahel and ultimately across Africa.

Organized by the African Renaissance and Diaspora Network (ARDN) jointly with the Ministry of Environment of Niger, with the technical and financial support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Fund for Populations Activities (UNFPA), the Universal Peace Federation International (UPF), the event pulled together youth leaders who are members of the Youth Leaders Network of the United Nations for the SDGs (ROJALNU-ODD).

The Young African Leaders Summit on Climate Change is a platform for dialogue on thematic issues at the center of the global climate debate, bringing together promising young Africans on climate change issues.

It also created opportunities for the preparation and financing of a project on the implementation of the initiative “A Greener Africa, Youth and Climate Change» with a focus on regreening the Sahel, youth employment, the fight against ecological migration, the increased role of local authorities and the private sector.

The Niamey meeting was officially opened by the Minister of the Environment, Urban Sanitation and Sustainable Development Almoustapha Garba.

Apart from the 150-youth mentioned above, participants included members of the ARDN Board of Directors, the Ambassador of the United States Mr. Eric Whitaker, representatives of UNDP and other UN Agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector and the academic world.

According to Mr. Garba, responding to the challenges of climate change requires strong involvement of African youth, international and regional cooperation.

” Indeed, the most visible manifestations of the adverse effects of climate change and variability on our biophysical and social environment are, among others, droughts, the degradation of our natural resources, the accentuation of the phenomenon of migration, terrorism.

Judging the effects of these changes therefore requires a full commitment of countries to finance adaptation measures to reduce pollutant emissions, “Garba said.

Responding to the expectations of the participants, Dr Djibril Diallo, President and CEO of ARDN, welcomed the strong presence of young people, the involvement of the Ministry of the Environment and other collaborators for the success of the Niamey meeting.

In this perspective, he also met each representative of ROJALNU to better accompany them once in their respective countries.

“One of our priority actions at ARDN is to engage the leadership and enthusiasm of the youth as entry point towards popularizing the Sustainable Development Goals in Africa and its diaspora.

The 33rd Summit of Heads of State of the African Union provided an excellent opportunity to spread our message to give the opportunity to the young people who are the future of Africa, “said Dr Djibril.

ROJALNU Secretary General Alioune Gueye thanked the Minister of the Environment, ARDN and the organizing committee for allowing the young people to participate in the event.

During the work, the young people exchanged and shared good practices around three themes highlighting the role of young people, women, mayors and local communities, private initiative in the fight against climate change.

“We are very happy to participate in this meeting and to be able to exchange with our fathers to take together concrete actions in the fight against climate change in Africa.

As members of the human family, we pledge to take due account of the actions we take on a daily basis to minimize, prevent and combat climate change and its negative effects, Alioune Gueye added.

The Niamey Youth Leadership gathering ended with the adoption of the Niamey Declaration which contains deliverables that the youth can work upon on their return to their countries

Ahead of the “fiercely contested elections”, he said that he conveyed to all presidential candidates, regional and international partners, “the need to uphold the high electoral standards in the region”.

Beyond relatively smooth electoral processes, he continued, “the past six months also saw the opening of political dialogues between the ruling government and the opposition in Burkina Faso and Benin, while in Ghana, political stakeholders started a dialogue on vigilante groups”.

Moreover, just this month in Liberia, “the government respected the people s right to peaceful protests and agreed to begin a dialogue on strengthening the economy”, he affirmed.

However, Mr. Chambas pointed out that pre-electoral and post-electoral periods “continue to be characterized by tensions, antagonistic contests and disputes, including around non-consensual constitutional amendments”.

“Addressing such potential sources of conflict remains a major priority ahead of the upcoming cycle of high-stake presidential elections in West Africa scheduled for next year in Burkina Faso, Cote d Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Niger and Togo”, he explained, noting that tensions around electoral periods “derail the necessary attention to the pressing need to address questions of development and inequality”.

Challenges pervade

Several countries in the region continue to struggle with human rights challenges. Mr. Chambas expressed particular concern over what he termed “the instrumentalization of the judiciary for political objectives” as well as a “predominant sentiment of impunity for violent crimes”, which undermines the rule of law.

The former Black Cats chief has lifted the lid on the Ghana superstar’s Stadium of Light exit

Former Sunderland chief Niall Quinn has lifted the lid on Asamoah Gyan’s exit from the Stadium of Light back in 2011, shedding new light on an intriguing chapter in the striker’s career.

The Ghana international was just over a year into a four-year contract with the then-Premier League club when he was approached to move to Al-Ain of the United Arab Emirates.

The forward moved to the Middle East—initially on loan—and has never since played in a major European league.

“Whatever players say, I’ll tell you what the agents say and I’ll tell you what goes on behind the scenes,” Quinn told Roker Report.

“With Asamoah, he came to us - via his agent - who said ‘I have had a huge offer in the Middle East and I must go' to which we told him 'look, we can’t do that.’

“We waited a six-month period to see if he would come back into line, we gave him a new contract too - although it did pale in comparison to what was on the table from Al-Ain and also he was being pressured by them to make the move.

“We were hoping he’d go there for three months and hate it and want to come back,"" added former Sunderland striker Quinn, who spend six years involved in the running of the club.

Despite an encouraging start to life at Sunderland, scoring 11 goals in his first 36 Premier League outings, Gyan never looked back, and subsequently enjoyed success at Al-Ain.

He won three UAE Pro League titles, the President’s Cup in 2014, and the Arabian Gulf Super Cup in 2012.

“He didn’t [hate it],” Quinn continued. “The fact of the matter is they were probably offering him five times the amount he was on with us, and we were told there was no tax on it, so in theory he was on ten times the amount he was on here.

“If we were right up the top of the league, fighting for a Champions League spot then you have more ability to keep hold of players the way top four clubs do, but we were Sunderland trying really hard to keep everything working.

“If we were to give one of those players the money they were wanting - well, I wasn’t going to sanction that because it puts the club in a terrible position.

“We weren’t taking in any more income, we had hit the level of what we could spend considering [Former club owner] Ellis Short gave us a lot of money, another level would have blown the club into another level.

“It was the financial facts of life we have to abide by. Asamoah went, Jordan [Henderson] went - those deals alone brought us in £50 million to £60 million.”

After four seasons with Al-Ain, Gyan moved to the Chinese Super League with Shanghai SIPG, returning briefly to the Gulf with Al Ahli Dubai, before switching to current club Kayserispor in 2017.

To date, he’s struggled to make an impact in the Super Lig, and also struggled at the Africa Cup of Nations, where he was included in the Black Stars’ squad despite originally retiring from international football ahead of the tournament after having the captaincy removed from him.

The Barcelona forward was dismissed towards the end of the first half of Saturday's third-place play-off in Sao Paulo against Chile following a confrontation with midfielder Gary Medel, who was also shown a red card.

Messi appeared to have been hard done by, with Medel appearing to push his head towards the Argentina playmaker as they squared up, chest to chest.

Image: Messi was dismissed towards the end of the first half

The Argentina captain suggested he had been singled out following his comments over the ""crazy"" officiating in the wake of their 2-0 semi-final defeat by hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte.

""We don't need to be part of the corruption that we've suffered at this tournament,"" Messi said, as quoted by Spanish media outlet AS.

""Medel is always right at the limit. With a yellow that would have been the end of it for both of us, but well, maybe what I said recently had an impact.

""What's important is that the team finished well in the tournament. Maybe this was ordered and I ended up suffering because of what I said.""

When asked about his thoughts on Sunday's final, Messi said: ""Hopefully the referees and the VAR won't influence things and they let Peru compete, but I think that's unlikely.""

Head coach Lionel Scaloni was also left perplexed by some of the decisions.

""Either the criteria is bad, or they don't agree. It seems to me that they are not yet clear about the VAR system,"" he said at a press conference.

On the red card for his captain, Scaloni said: ""I still don't understand what Messi did to be dismissed.""

CONMEBOL level ""disrespect"" claim in response

The South American football confederation, Conmebol, said questioning the integrity of the Copa America is ""unacceptable"" and that a ""fundamental pillar of fair play is to accept the results with loyalty and respect"".

Although it does not mention Messi by name, the statement said: ""The same goes for refereeing decisions, which are human and will always be improvable.

""It is unacceptable that as a result of incidents typical in competitions, involving 12 teams, all on equal terms, unfounded accusations have been launched that lack the truth and question the integrity of the Copa America.

""These accusations represent a lack of respect for the competition, all the participating players and the hundreds of professionals of CONMEBOL, an institution that since 2016 has been working tirelessly to make transparent, professionalise and develop South American football.""

In 2018, UNICEF reached nearly half the world’s children with vaccines; provided 13.3 million bed nets and nearly 50,000 tonnes of ready-to-use food

COPENHAGEN / NEW YORK, 24 July 2019 - In 2018, UNICEF procured US$3.486 billion worth of goods and services to help children in 150 countries live better lives.

Vaccines, clothes, medicines, education kits and school books are some of the goods and services that helped children fight disease, learn, and grow -- especially in countries affected by emergencies and conflicts.

In 2018, UNICEF helped children by:

Procuring 2.36 billion doses of vaccines to fight a variety of diseases including measles, diphtheria, tetanus and HPV, and reach nearly half the world’s children

Providing children access to safe water with 1.26 billion water purification tablets and chlorination/flocculation sachets

Protecting children from mosquito-borne diseases using 13.3 million bed nets

Treating children suffering from malnutrition with 47,760 tonnes of ready-to-use therapeutic food

Helping children get back in the classroom with 4.5 million schoolbags and 84,000 education kits

“Every child is unique and so are their needs,” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division in Copenhagen. “Procuring supplies for children is not as simple as buying products off the shelf. It requires close collaboration with diverse partners to ensure children in different countries and areas get what they need to live, improve their lives, and be safe and healthy.”

As situations in countries become more complex, especially during emergencies, the ability to adapt and do things differently can help to maximize impact for children and their families.

In East Asia and Pacific, the September 2018 earthquake and tsunami off Sulawesi island affected more than 375,000 children in and around Palu city. UNICEF supported the Government-led response by using small aircraft to bring supplies as close as possible to those in need. The Government then delivered them to the affected area. A strong in-country supply chain and Government pre-positioning quickly reduced the need for UNICEF support.

Together with a global network of stakeholders, UNICEF is developing new products and approaches to meet the needs of the hardest-to-reach. This isn’t limited to product innovation alone, but also includes working with partners, especially businesses, to influence markets and make products for children more accessible, affordable, safe and sustainable.

For example:

To help children recover from malnutrition, UNICEF procured a record 65 per cent of ready-to-use therapeutic food from manufacturers located in or close to countries with the greatest need. This not only supported local economies but also made transportation more efficient and reduced the carbon footprint.

In the Syrian Arab Republic, despite the conflict, UNICEF is working with local businesses that continue to operate to provide hygiene and education kits, as well as warm clothes – helping UNICEF deliver supplies to children quickly.

In Nigeria, UNICEF convened a landmark Regional Sanitation Industry Consultation to encourage cross-border collaboration with Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire and identify ways to improve the availability of affordable toilets and sanitation services for families.

“The support of governments, businesses, donors and our partners on the ground has been invaluable in allowing us to reach millions of children as quickly as possible”, added Kadilli. “Yet the needs remain immense. Sustainable, long-term funding must continue to be a priority for us to meet the needs of children in increasingly complex situations.”

From now until the end of the current year, the drought will impact on more than 4,7 million people.

This is according to the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee's recently-concluded Rural Livelihood Assessment.

The World Food Programme (WFP) urgently requires US$173 million (R2,4 billion) to address the food shortage crisis.

Zimbabwe's food deficits are blamed on poor rainfall and flooding caused by Cyclone Idai in March.

WFP stated the 5,5 million people to be in need of food aid represented 59 percent of rural households.

""Given the scale and scope of the food insecurity in Zimbabwe, WFP is planning to scale up to assist over 2 million people by the peak of the lean season during early next year,"" said WFP spokesperson, Herve Verhoosel.

Until then, the organisation would continue providing food assistance to the most vulnerable populations, while also assisting communities build resilience to climate change and future shock impacts.

Formerly an exporter of grain, Zimbabwe has suffered successive droughts and food deficits over the past two decades.

This has coincided with controversial land reforms by the administration of now-deposed president, Robert Mugabe.

The reforms were the aftermath of largely-violent takeover of white-owned commercial farms in the wake of government's differences with former colonial master, Britain.

89,89,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,"Ethiopia: As Drought Stokes Urban Hunger, Ethiopia Dishes Up Free School Meals - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/201907090024.html,"Students eat their lunch at Menilik II Primary School 2, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on June 5, 2019.

Addis Ababa — Endale Terefe remembers a time when he used to go to school so hungry he had trouble staying awake during lessons.

The 14-year-old student in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, was living with his aunt after his parents died.

""My aunt has no money to buy food,"" he said. ""So I was obliged to come to school with no lunch box and felt sleepy in class.""

Then, three years ago, he and other students in the city started getting two free school meals a day through local charities.

""I am now attending the class attentively,"" Terefe said with a smile.

As drought in parts of Ethiopia makes food less available and more expensive nationwide, millions of students, including in cities, are going to school hungry - if they go at all.

But while the federal government provides rural schools with free food in times of drought, the task of feeding students in the capital has typically been left to charities.

That changed in January when the Addis Ababa government launched its own ""school feeding programme"" for tens of thousands of children, aiming to combat rising urban hunger as climate change is predicted to intensify dry spells.

Lower crop yields on farms across Ethiopia have resulted in declining food supplies to cities, said Esubalew Abate, assistant professor of food and nutrition security at Addis Ababa University.

The consequences include soaring food prices and double-digit inflation, which put a massive financial strain on city dwellers already struggling with a lack of housing and high poverty rates, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The impact of drought in rural areas of Ethiopia has been evident in Addis Ababa over the last four years, Abate said.

""Whenever there is drought, it is very clear that the food price increases (in the city),"" he added.

EL NINO EFFECT

Belaynesh Ferede, 45, a mother of two who lives in Addis Ababa, said the prices of many staples had jumped dramatically in just the last four years.

For example, the price of a kilogramme of teff - Ethiopia's staple grain - rose from 20 birr to 30 birr ($0.70 to $1), while a kilo of potatoes doubled from 10 birr to 20 birr.

""Living has become expensive in the city,"" she said.

And for many children in Addis Ababa, where 80% of people live in slums, according to the charity Habitat for Humanity, those high food prices mean going to school on an empty stomach.

The indirect effect of climate extremes on education became clear in 2015-2016, when El Nino - a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - hit an already drought-stressed Ethiopia, tipping it into the worst drought in 50 years.

Relief agencies reported that students were falling asleep or feeling sick in class, attendance rates fell and dropout rates spiked, as children were either too hungry to go to school or had to stay home to help their families look for food.

To keep children in class in the wake of El Nino, the Ethiopian government launched a $50-million emergency programme in drought-hit rural areas, which gave about 6 million students free school meals over three years.

The U.N. World Food Programme observed that the programme stabilised school attendance rates, with fewer dropping out.

""Even students who had dropped out a long time ago returned to school,"" it said in a report.

The Addis Ababa government hoped to see the same positive results among the city's school children with this year's feeding initiative.

It has allocated 169 million birr for free meals in all the city's primary schools, covering more than 50,000 children.

""Education for all is a global motto and access to education is a matter of right, so the city government has a responsibility to feed students,"" said Meti Tamrat, the programme's coordinator at the Addis Ababa Education Bureau.

The city programme complements school-meal projects run by local charities that continue to provide meals for about 80,000 students.

But not all needy students have yet been covered, Tamrat noted, adding it was still too early to measure the impact of the city government's initiative.

Research by the Ye Enat Weg Charitable Association, which has provided free school meals since 2014, showed that by 2018, the dropout rate in Addis Ababa's schools had fallen by 75% and students' academic scores had improved by 14% since 2006.

'HUGE LESSON'

As Addis Ababa works to stop rural droughts hurting education in the city, the federal government is looking to launch another feeding programme that will support children all over the country.

According to the ministry of education's emergency school meal plan for 2019, more than 1 million children in drought-affected areas are still coming to school hungry.

Meanwhile, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network has warned that the majority of households in five regions of Ethiopia face a crisis-level food shortage through September 2019 due to a combination of drought and conflict.

Instead of offering free school meals only in emergency situations, the federal government wants to implement an ongoing programme in all primary schools, said Bereket Takele, advisor for the programme at the Ministry of Education.

Mitigating the impact of drought on the education sector has now become a priority for Ethiopia, he added.

""The government has learned a huge lesson about how drought can affect students,"" Takele said. ""There is a saying: 'Challenge is an opportunity'.""

It has emerged that some Black Stars players allegedly busily engaged themselves in sexual bouts before every match during their short stay in the ongoing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.



Some of the players reportedly lodged their girlfriends in the same hotel they camped in, sneaking to have sex, a practice some believe accounted for their poor performance at the tournament.



The Black Stars were on Monday kicked out of the tournament by their Tunisian counterpart at the at round of sixteen stage.



This was after Ghana was beaten 5-4 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.



Ghanaians are livid that the Black Stars could not end the 37 trophy drought after the team admitting that they were given all they needed for a successful tournament.



Kasapa FM’s Sports Journalist Micahel Tuffour aka Ariel Otega who’s covering the tournament in Egypt reported that indiscipline on the part of the players contributed to the team’s abysmal performance.



He wondered why some of these players could not control their sexual urge for just this brief period the tournament was underway.



“Some of us came to work in Egypt and didn’t sleep on the job, we have all the exclusives about Black Stars players. Some of these players whom the state spent huge monies on, after being camped on the third floor of the hotel they resided in, brought their girlfriends in and lodged them on the fourth floor in the same hotel. They go up to the fourth floor and engage in bouts of sex before every match. Some of these girls came from Dubai. Just two months these players who had been given $36,000 as qualfication bonus each were so money conscious and couldn’t control their libidos and had so much sex affecting their performance in the process.

“In the AFCON 2013, the same thing happened when some Black Stars players brought their girlfriends to camp and it was resolved that, that will not happen again, but here we are with that same behaviour being repeated in Egypt. We have a lot to say when we return to Ghana, we’ve told the players that they’ve hugely disappointed Ghanaians because a lot of money was invested in them,” He added.

91,91,Drought_Ghana_2019_July,Lesotho: Drought Breeds Multi-Faceted Crises for Border Communities - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201907160104.html,"The recent El-Nino induced drought has spawned a multi-faceted crisis for Basotho communities in the border areas with South Africa who are often forced to illegally graze their livestock in the neighbouring country.

The practice of seeking pastures in South Africa has opened up the border communities to a whole range of conflicts with their neighbours who have retaliated by either stealing or impounding the livestock and demanding hefty fines of as much as M2500 for the release of each cow.

In addition, some of the impoverished families have forced their young girls into early marriages of convenience in the neighbouring country due to the financial inducements associated with the practice which has been defined by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPA) as a human rights violation.

This came out during a recent media field trip to Mohale's Hoek which was organised by the UNFPA and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF). The field trip was part of a media training programme on mainstreaming issues of child protection, gender based violence and migration as well as humanitarian emergencies into broader media coverage.

Lesotho is among several countries in the region that experienced poor harvest due to the El-Nino induced drought. UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane said that it is estimated that at least 500 000 Basotho (a quarter of the population) are food insecure and would need assistance.

Some of the socio-economic challenges stemming from the drought include increasing crime, high rates of school dropouts, early child marriages and teenage pregnancies.

Speaking at the field trip, Mohale's Hoek Police Officer Commanding Sephapho's Border Gate, Sub Inspector Francis Pita said due to the declining pastures and the poor harvests of the 2018/19 agricultural season, livestock farmers who opted to graze their animals in neighbouring South Africa had become victims of stock theft and the impounding of their animals.

Sub Inspector Pita said Basotho nationals took advantage of the porous borders to illegally graze their livestock in South Africa. He said this had created a vicious circle where local and South African farmers stole each other's livestock.

""On this (Lesotho) side there is no veld solely because of the drought and the fact that farmers this side do not practice rotational grazing so they end up stealing or grazing their livestock in the fields of SA farmers,"" Sub Inspector Pita said.

""Some Basotho steal the livestock in South Africa and others even steal animal feed to come and feed their own livestock.""

He said such practices caused problems for local farmers whose livestock were impounded as they were forced to pay fines in the region of M2500 for the release of each cow.

""That is a lot of money and because most families do not have it, they forfeit their animals leading to even more poverty. The story does not end there as some Basotho retaliate by going back to steal from the South Africans and this sometimes leads to bloodshed and death.

""The South Africans also cross over to steal livestock. Sometime in March this year in Ha-Moeketsi, 17 cows were stolen from one family and two weeks later the victim died probably due to depression since most people rely on their livestock to feed their families.""

Sub Inspector Pita said due to the frequent droughts, ""so many children have become school dropouts who cross into South Africa and enter into marriages of convenience which backfires as they are burdened with children they cannot care for"".

UNFPA Communications officer Violet Maraisane subsequently told the Lesotho Times that this was much more than just a farmers' conflict as it also created more humanitarian challenges.

Ms Maraisane said they had conducted a drought assessment which showed that at least 500 000 Basotho were food insecure and would need assistance.

""It is on the basis of this that the UN in Lesotho undertook early action to deliver urgent lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to severely food insecure households and to address the impacts of drought and erratic rainfall affecting the population in Mohale's Hoek, Maseru, Mafeteng, Quthing and Qacha's Nek districts.

""UN agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), UNICEF, UNFPA, World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) jointly with national partners, mobilised funds from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to address priority humanitarian needs in nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, food security and health,"" Ms Maraisane said

She said the UN is providing lifesaving multi-sectoral emergency assistance to communities through the CERF-funded project titled, ""Provision of life saving protection, gender based violence and psychosocial support to drought affected populations"".

""IOM and UNICEF focus on informing the community on protection risks around migration and child protection.

""Child marriages are a human rights violation. Despite laws against it, the practice remains widespread. Globally, one in every five girls is married before reaching the age of 18.

""Child marriages threatens girls' lives and health and it limits their future prospects. Girls pressed into child marriages often become pregnant while still adolescents, increasing the risk of complications in pregnancy or childbirth. These complications are the leading cause of death among older adolescent girls,"" Ms Maraisane said.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security's Director General for Veterinary Services, Relebohile Mahloane, said although the government worked hard to assist Basotho it was not possible to come to the aid of those who engaged in illegal activities like grazing their livestock in neighbouring South Africa.

Dr Mahloane said local farmers had dismally failed to preserve their own grazing ranges through their failure to implement sustainable grazing practices and this had caused them to be vulnerable to their South African counterparts who impounded their livestock.

""What they (local farmers) are doing (grazing their livestock in South Africa) is illegal and SA farmers leave them to do such acts so they can take advantage of them,"" Dr Mahloane said.","Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00511974:6e43e7fe6d788852c084c700ed9491d7:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['drought', 'africa', 'marriages', 'food', 'livestock', 'farmers', 'breeds', 'lesotho', 'multifaceted', 'grazing', 'basotho', 'border', 'south', 'maraisane', 'communities', 'crises']",

With the application of ICT, we are able to store data and have quick access to information for decision making.

We have witnessed an appreciable level of installation of ICT infrastructure in the country, and its application has hastened the pace of national development.

That notwithstanding, there is more room for improvement in our ICT application in public service delivery.

The Ghanaian Times is particularly concerned about poor quality of ICT service that is militating against the two major registration exercises: The National Identification exercise for the issuance of the Ghana Card and the limited voters' registration that has just ended.

We understand a number of people have not been able to register in the limited voters' registration, due to challenges of the system, which has to do with the poor internet connectivity.

As a result, there are calls for the extension of the registration for the benefit of qualified electorates who could not still get their names captured in the voters' register, due to no fault of theirs, but because of the challenges with the system.

There are similar complaints of people spending so much time, and in some instance almost a whole day, queuing to register and obtain the Ghana Card.

We hear people go to the registration centres at dawn to queue, and that is creating inconvenience, as people have to go and eke out a living.

Indeed, this is affecting productivity in the public sector, as people have to take time off their schedules to go and register for the card.

Already, the Ghanaian worker is noted for low productivity, a bone of contention in the tripartite committee deliberations for improved condition of service for the worker.

We still remember the famous saying in the public sector ""Ghanaian worker is pretending to be working and the government is pretending to be paying.""

The recent United Nations human development index report suggest that though the Ghanaian worker productivity level pegged around 44 per cent, is one of the best in the sub-region, it is still low for a middle-level income country.

Ghanaians spend a lot of time in gridlock, resulting in man-hour lost in productivity. We spend much time queuing for ""Trotros"" at lorry stations during rush hours.

Again, we waste time in banking halls to cash our moneys. We queue to buy tickets to enter the stadium to watch matches. We queue to consult the limited doctors at the health facilities. We queue to register on to the National Health Insurance Scheme.

It will not be an over exaggeration to say that life in Ghana is all about queuing and time wasting.

The ICT has been invented to facilitate our lives, but it appears it comes with its own challenges of internet connectivity.

We commend Ghanaians for their positive responds to the national registration exercises and we plead with them to exercise restraint at the various registration centres.

The Ghanaian Times urges stakeholders in the ICT industry to endeavour to find lasting solution to the challenges facing the application of ICT in the country, for enhanced service delivery.

We also urge the Electoral Commission to consider the various appeals for the extension of the limited registration for qualified Ghanaians to get registered.","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['poor', 'quality', 'national', 'limited', 'registration', 'ghanaian', 'service', 'queue', 'services', 'productivity', 'address', 'lets', 'register', 'application', 'ict', 'ghana']",

A regional food security assessment indicates that southern Africa has a cereal deficit of more than 5.4 million tonnes this year following a subdued 2018/19 farming season.

This is according to a Synthesis Report on the State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa approved by the SADC Regional Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis (RVAA) Programme Steering Committee that met on 05 July in Windhoek.

Based on the 11 SADC member states that provided cereal balance sheets for the 2018/19 harvest year, the region produced about 37.5 million tonnes of cereals compared to 42.9 million tonnes in 2017/18.

The countries that provided cereal balance sheets for the 2018/19 season are Angola, Botswana, the DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The report revealed that cereal production in South Africa, which usually accounts for the largest proportion of regional output, decreased by 19% from 18.7 million tonnes during the 2017/18 season to 15.1 million tonnes this year.

Zambia, which has during the past few years significantly contributed to regional cereal output, suffered a 14.7% decline in production from 2.6 million tonnes in 2017/18 to 2.2 million tonnes in 2018/19.

The largest drop in output is in Botswana where cereal production is estimated to have declined by 92% during the 2018/19 season, while Namibia and Lesotho experienced 53% and 50% decreases, respectively.

The least affected countries are Angola and Tanzania, which recorded decreases of only 1% and 4% respectively.

Maize accounts for 80% cereal production in southern Africa. Other important cereals are wheat, sorghum, millets and rice.

According to the regional food security assessment report, the decline in cereal production indicates that ""an estimated 41.2 million people in 13 SADC Member States are food-insecure this year.""

The 13 countries are Angola, Botswana, DRC, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The remaining three SADC Member States - Mauritius, Comoros and Seychelles - did not provide figures on their food security and vulnerability assessments, meaning that the number of food-insecure people in the region could be much higher.

""When comparing the 11 Member States that provided data last year and this year, food insecurity increased by 28%,"" according to the report. It also noted that food insecurity this year is even higher than the devastating drought of 2016/17.

""Namibia is responding to the drought by distributing food relief and agricultural inputs, as well as the provision of water to the affected population,"" Namibian Deputy Director for Policy, Disaster Risk Management Directorate, Anastasia Amunyela, said at the SADC RVAA meeting.

Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are importing grain to supplement their reduced yields.

The plight of the three countries was worsened by the impact of Cyclone Idai that hit the region in March.

Other contributing factors that worsened the low harvest in most SADC member states include the Fall Army worm infestation.

In the medium to long term, the Synthesis Report on the State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa urges SADC member states to move to crop and dietary diversity through the growing and consumption of diversified diets, including indigenous foods.

Furthermore, the region should improve its transport network so that agricultural produce can move smoothly from one place to another. It is also critical to invest in storage facilities to allow farmers to store their harvest for use in poor seasons.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, post-harvest crop losses in SADC is estimated to be as high as 40%.

Since its establishment, the SADC RVAA Programme has made significant strides in providing timely and credible information that has influenced policies, and its products are now a vital reference point for decision makers in addressing food and nutrition security issues.

PEMBA, Zambia, Jul 26 2019 (IPS) - Jennifer Handondo, a small scale farmer of Choma district in southern Zambia, plants food crops such as maize mostly for her family’s needs. Because of uncharacteristically high temperatures and low rainfall during the rainy season in March, the divorced mother who single-handedly supports her three children, has not been able to harvest as much as she usually does. So she has diversified into selling seedlings of neem, Moringa and other medicinal trees.

“For me, trees represent money and a livelihood, but not in the wrong way through charcoal production but through these seedlings,” she told IPS. As a value add, she recently diversified into selling leaf powders such as Moringa Oleifera—a scientifically proven food and medicinal tree.

While she earns on average about 78 dollars from selling seedlings and powders each month, she said she earns as much as 5,400 dollars a month when she has large orders of the Moringa powder. She receives orders for the powder from large local institutions and explained that she usually has to collaborate with other farmers to fulfil these orders.

“My livelihood is based on trees,” she said.

Zambia’s rising deforestation threat

Zambia has a forest coverage of 49.9 million hectares, representing 66 percent of the total land area in this southern African nation and boasting at least 220 different tree species. However, with a deforestation rate of between 250,000 and 300,000 hectares per annum, this rich biodiversity is at risk of being wiped away.

A recent environment outlook report by the Zambia Environmental Management Agency (ZEMA) showed that the country’s high levels of deforestation are not slowing down. The report points to various causes for this, among them illegal indiscriminate cutting of trees and the reckless collection of wood for fuel, charcoal burning, the harvesting of timber, clearing of large tracks of land for agriculture through slash and burn methods, urbanisation and new human settlements.

In addition, the country’s renewable energy connectivity figures are not impressive. It is estimated that only about 25 percent of the population of 17 million is connected to renewable energy sources.

Handondo’s story is different though. A grade nine dropout, she has returned to school and graduated in General Agriculture from the Zambia College of Agriculture. She is passionate and active in forest conservation, participating in tree-planting campaigns and awareness programmes since 2016.

So for her the link to selling seedlings and products from trees as a source of income was an easy one.

She is also a change agent and champion for the World Vision Zambia supported farmer-managed forest regeneration (FMNR) project, which is being implemented in southern Zambia. FMNR is the active regeneration and management of trees and shrubs from felled stumps, sprouting root systems or seeds with the goal of restoring degraded farmland and soil fertility, and increasing the value and/or quantity of woody vegetation on farmland.

“The main objective of FMNR is to empower the community with knowledge to reduce deforestation which has been very rampant in this country,” Shadrick Phiri, World Vision Zambia Agriculture and Natural Resource Specialist, told IPS.

According to Phiri, the technique is highly appropriate for rural communities and land that has been degraded to a point where the loss of perennial vegetation cover, biodiversity and soil fertility on farmland is diminishing livelihoods and quality of life.

“FMNR can take place either as an on-farm activity practiced by individual farmers, or in forest areas protected and managed by the community,” Phiri said, adding that the practice is also relevant to the regeneration of grazing lands.

“We have chosen to use a cheap but robust system of regenerating our forests naturally. We currently have 600 farmers under the four area development programmes in Southern Province currently practising FMNR. The figure currently stands at 2,600 households nationally across the 25 area programmes where World Vision is currently working.”

The FMNR project is one of several initiatives in Zambia targeting the restoration of degraded land. Other projects include:

the Community Based Natural Resources Management in Zambia with the World Wildlife Fund for Nature serving as secretariat;

the Zambia Community Forests Programme implemented by Bio Carbon Partners;

the Promoting Climate-Resilient, Community-Based Regeneration of Indigenous Forests in Zambia’s Central Province project by ZEMA;

and the Zambia Integrated Forest Landscape Project supported by the World Bank.

Another intervention working to improve local livelihoods of farmers by revitalising degraded lands, is Plant A Million (PAM). Launched last year, PAM is a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification-supported project under the Africa-led 3S initiative. It aims to plant at least two billion trees by 2021.

Emanuel Chibesakunda of Munich Advisors Group, a business and investment consultancy firm that developed the concept and is implementing the initiative, told IPS that since the launch an important milestone for rural farmers has been the partnerships with like-minded stakeholders.

Musika Development Enterprise, a non-profit company with a mandate to stimulate and support private investment in the Zambian agricultural market with a specific focus on the lower end of these markets, has been one of these partners.

“Musika provided both technical and financial support to PAM to set up a commercial nursery in order to strengthen rural livelihoods through domestication of indigenous fruit and non-fruit trees in Zambia. This proposed intervention will enhance Musika’s efforts in testing the ‘trees on farms’ concept as a business for the smallholder economy that has the potential to generate socio-economic return on investment and enhance environmental sustainability,” Reuben Banda, Musika’s managing director, told IPS.

The nursery sells readily-available seedlings at an affordable price.

Community centred approaches

At the Global Landscapes Forum held last month in Germany, leaders, experts and indigenous communities deliberated and adopted a rights approach to sustainable landscapes management and conservation.

The forum showcased evidence from around the globe that when the authority of local communities over their forests and lands, as well as their rights, are legally recognised, deforestation rates are often reduced.

In recognition that it is this generation who can and must recover the damaged land, governments, civil society and traditional leadership, are using community-centred approaches to achieve land degradation neutrality.

A unique feature of FMNR in Zambia is the targeting of traditional leadership as an entry point.

“As custodians of vast traditional land where most of deforestation activities take place, we believe their involvement is very important in reversing the damage,” said Phiri.

He explained that the community approach has been successfully implemented in Niger and Ethiopia, with millions of hectares of forests under regeneration, while Malawi is equally making steady progress.

At a recently-held community meeting in Zambia, traditional leaders resolved to form Community Forest Committees to enforce FMNR and all related forest management activities in their chiefdoms.

But to achieve this, they requested that the government consider strengthening their authority by giving them powers of enforcement with regards to laws that govern local offences and penalties.

“As traditional leaders, we are of the view that section 19 of the Village Act on offences and penalties be strengthened to give more power to traditional leaders to sternly deal with offenders in our local jurisdiction,” said Tyson Hamamba, a representative of Chief Choongo from Southern Province.

Hamamba said this was the only way to deter rampant charcoal making and deliberate bush fires among other destructive practices leading to alarming forest and land degradation.

According to current laws, chiefs cannot issue a penal sanction against offenders. Their only role is to facilitate arrest of offenders by state police and/or other legally authorised law enforcement agencies.

For Handondo, FMNR is important for the future of the country’s forests. She credits it as being key to the lush growth of her seedling business.

“As a small scale farmer, and a seedling grower for that matter, I have found this practice cheap and easy to undertake. I have noted that we have a lot of stagnant bushes that are not growing because they are overcrowded but when we prune through the practice of FMNR, we have seen that these shrubs quickly grow into trees forming the much needed forest cover because nutrient competition is reduced.”

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila made the plea on Thursday during the president's town hall meeting in Swakopmund to assess the drought assistance and relief programme in the region.

Although she did not say how much the president and vice-president contributed, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said that Namibians do not need to contribute the 2 percent in monetary value but can contribute anything or any amount that suits their pockets.

""You requested that your leaders set an example. Hence, I would like to confirm that Cabinet is leading the way. Just as the president and the vice president, I am also in the process of doing the same, Kuugongelwa-Amadhila told residents on Thursday.

She added that government only managed to raise about N$300 million of the N$570 million that was budgeted for the drought relief programme.

""Our business partners and international friends so far donated about N$90 million to assist with the drought relief programme. Farmers in the Omaheke region also told government that although they do not have water, they have plenty of grass, which they can donate as well. That is the kind of compassion we need to have as Namibians. Government is not necessarily looking for money. It can be food items, grass (animal fodder) or any kind of donation,"" explained the Prime Minister.

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila added that government understands why the two percent contribution did not sit well with many Namibians; especially those who felt the contribution will put a dent in their meagre salaries that are already challenged in these hard economic times.

She also told residents that several civil and ordinary working Namibians have already made contributions, which government is thankful for.

""That is the solidarity. Please consider supporting this very noble initiative to help others in need. Anyone willing to donate can make arrangements to contribute in instalments or once-off. So please, let us be considerate and assist government to make a change and help our drought-stricken families and farmers,"" the Prime Minister further appealed.","Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn05.allafrica.com/download/pic/main/main/csiid/00511974:6e43e7fe6d788852c084c700ed9491d7:arc614x376:w1200.jpg,"['drought', 'president', 'namibians', 'million', 'relief', 'told', 'contribution', 'need', 'kuugongelwaamadhila', 'vp', 'namibia', 'prime', 'donate']",

BRACE yourselves. Seems like the winter cold has settled in and, according to the weather forecast, is set to stay well into next week. At least.
