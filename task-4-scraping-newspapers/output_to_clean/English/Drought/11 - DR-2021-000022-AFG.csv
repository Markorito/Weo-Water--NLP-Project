Ample snow and rain during winter partly replenished soil moisture and raised hopes for a better wheat crop, which is a food source for rural families who turn their harvested grain into bread. Last year, however, drought displaced hundreds of thousands of people and also forced farmers who stayed in their homes to sell livestock and tools to survive, making recovery a multi-year challenge.

Jabbar, 44, a farmer in Balkh province in northern Afghanistan, sold sheep, cows and one camel at discounted prices to buy food for his family of 12. Recent floods washed away some of his land that had been planted with peas and wheat.

“I have a big family so it’s my responsibility to feed them. If it rains or not, it is harmful to us,” he said, referring to the double damage inflicted by drought and flood.

“I hope I can get good results this year.”

Floods in March complicated the recovery. Heavy rains killed at least 63 people and destroyed or damaged more than 12,000 homes, affecting 119,600 people, according to the United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Some 243,000 people remain displaced from last year’s drought in the western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor, according to OCHA. Many have moved to urban areas where they live in tents on public and private lands, creating tensions with landowners.

“If the harvest is OK, that will help communities come out of a terribly bleak period. If it’s not OK, we’ll need a massive injection of food quickly,” said Toby Lanzer, the U.N.’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan.

The winter wheat harvested in June and July will need to help feed displaced people and some 10.6 million people who are struggling to find enough food where they live, Lanzer said.

Farming accounts for one-third of the country’s economy, although only 12 percent of its land is arable.

The wheat crop’s outlook remains uncertain, said Agriculture Minister Nasir Ahmad Durrani, in an interview on March 20. If the temperature warms too rapidly, melting snow could create floods that wipe out ripe crops, he said.

It is also unclear how much wheat farmers were able to plant last autumn, said Rajendra Aryal, the representative in Afghanistan for the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Many farmers used wheat seed to make bread to survive, rather than save it for planting, Aryal said.

“The people were already poor,” he said. “It will be very difficult if the harvest fails, so I don’t even want to think that way.”

The floods also damaged critical farm infrastructure, such as irrigation canals, reservoirs and wells. The Afghan government is working to repair damaged infrastructure, especially in the provinces of Kandahar and Farah, Durrani said.

Afghanistan produced 3.6 million tonnes of wheat last year, down 25 percent from the five-year average, according to the FAO.

The country dipped into its grain reserve last year for 190,000 tonnes of wheat, leaving just 50,000 tonnes left, Durrani said.

The expected shortfall between supply and demand this year will be made up through wheat imports from countries including Pakistan and Kazakhstan, he said.

Abdul Majid Khan, who coordinates aid related to food security and agriculture for the U.N., said a plan is in place to assist families who return home as the drought abates. It includes food assistance, cash for work and farm supplies, but the plan still requires approval from international donors.

“My biggest concern is delays in funding,” he said. “We can lose the trust of the people.”

A significant number of families should be able to return, as long as it is safe, said Zlatan Milisic, country director for the World Food Programme.

“There are no more resilient people on Earth,” U.N. Representative Lanzer said about Afghans. “But goodness me, it is being tested.”","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190328&t=2&i=1370927485&r=LYNXNPEF2R09W&w=800,"['displaced', 'food', 'lanzer', 'representative', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'tonnes', 'wheat', 'critical', 'farmers', 'confronts', 'harvest']", 
1,1,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"500,000 children affected by drought in Afghanistan – UNICEF - UNICEF",https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/500000-children-affected-drought-afghanistan-unicef,"KABUL, 23 April 2018 – The extremely dry winter has affected 22 provinces across Afghanistan and now threatens to negatively impact the lives of one million people, with an additional two million who could feel its effects over the coming months.

Food insecurity and reduced access to safe water are beginning to take their toll in the 10 worst affected provinces, where 20 to 30 percent of water sources are reportedly dry. The impact on children could be devastating, as these areas have pre-existing high rates of malnutrition. Without adequate nutritious food and safe water for drinking, as well as for hygiene and sanitation, children’s health will only worsen.

“The priority is to prevent the situation from deteriorating, by responding to the needs of children and families in the worst affected areas,” said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan. “Children across the country already face numerous challenges and now they have to cope with this latest threat to their lives,” Khodr added.

The impact of the drought couldn’t come at a worse time, as cases of severe acute malnutrition – seasonal malnutrition – rise on average by about 25 percent each year in the coming summer months. Some 1.6 million children and 443,000 pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition across Afghanistan.

“Preventing malnutrition is already a priority in Afghanistan,” said Khodr. “We need to make sure that children and families get the access to nutritious food, safe water and health services that they need. The impact of malnutrition can last a lifetime, which is why it’s critical that we identify and treat at risk children now,” Khodr added.

A drought emergency task force has been set up by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to coordinate and align the response across all sectors, including education, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, food security and agriculture.

UNICEF and partners in the nutrition cluster estimate that emergency nutrition assistance is needed for 92,000 children and 8,500 pregnant and lactating women. UNICEF estimates also show that between July and December 2018, some 121,000 acutely malnourished children under five and 33,000 pregnant and lactating women could need life-saving nutrition services.

The UNICEF led water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) cluster has indicated that some 875,000 people could need assistance in the next three to six months. UNICEF and partners are scaling up their operations to respond to the emergency nutrition and WASH needs.

An estimated 100 families from the Bala Murghab district of Badghis have been forced to move to Herat to find alternative work due to failed crops, and to access safe drinking water. The situation is further complicated, as a result of escalating conflict that often occurs at this time of year, leading to increased displacement and reduced access for humanitarian workers.

Among the affected provinces, Bagdhish, Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Helmand, Kandahar, Jawzjan, Nangarhar, Nimroz, Nuristan, Takhar, and Uruzgan are of critical priority for nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene assistance.



Thirteen provinces, out of a country total of 34 provinces, received less than 30 percent of their average annual precipitation in the period October 2017 to end February 2018.



UNICEF Afghanistan is calling for an additional US$10 million to respond to the needs of children and their families. This includes to:



• Provide safe water for 200,000 people and hygiene assistance, including chemicals for water treatment and hygiene kits.

• Reach 65,000 children with essential lifesaving nutrition assistance through:



- procuring and pre-positioning essential nutrition supplies

- scaling up emergency nutrition services through fixed and mobile nutrition teams that can provide broader health services at the same time.

- strengthening community screening and referrals of malnourished children to provide treatment as quickly as possible.

- scaling up the Vitamin A supplementation programme for children in drought affected provinces.



UNICEF also calls on all parties to the conflict to provide safe access for families seeking essential health services and for humanitarian workers to reach children and families in need of lifesaving support.","Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.unicef.org/themes/custom/unicef_base/UNICEF_ForEveryChild_White_Vertical_RGB_ENG.jpg,"['malnutrition', 'water', 'affected', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'safe', '500000', 'hygiene', 'provinces', 'families', 'nutrition', 'need', 'unicef', 'children']",

With last year’s wheat production already reported to be 57 per cent below the five-year average, the 2018 harvest is forecast to be even lower: down from 4.2 million metric tons to 3.5 million metric tons. (OCHA, 25 Apr 2018)

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could impact agricultural production. (FEWS NET, 4 May 2018)

In the past week, another 120,000 people have arrived in Qala-e-Naw City, Badghis, due to the drought. In Kandahar, assessment teams verified the arrival of 2,800 drought-displaced people from Badghis and Ghor and 1,400 in the district centre of Maiwand, Kandahar. The total displacement due to the drought has reached a total of 275,000 people, exceeding the number of people displaced by conflict in 2018 by 52,000 people. In Qala-e-Naw, partners are ramping up assistance across all sectors and are deploying additional staff, though the gaps remain significant. Further, WFP plans to further scale up food assistance in areas of origin to allow families to return to their villages, reaching up to 100 per cent of the population in the most affected districts. In Hilmand Province, IRC started a new project to assist 2,100 drought affected people. (OCHA 9 Sep 2018)

Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Hilmand, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Kubduz, Takhar, Herat, Ghor and Farah are among the worst affected provinces...The government launched a USD 100 million appeal in mid-April through MAIL for immediate livestock protection for an initial two months of assistance for fodder/feed support and an overall demand of USD 550 million for a 10 months fodder / feed support throughout the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. (IFRC, 16 May 2018)

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought. Humanitarian partners are ramping up their response across the country...trying to reach 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men struck by the drought. Partners urgently need $115 million; the majority of this amount will provide food support to help families through the lean season and to provide them with drinking water for six months. (OCHA, 25 May 2018)

The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has been revised to to include response to the drought and now calls for $547 million. The additional funding will allow humanitarian partners to incorporate assistance to 1.4 million people mostly affected by the drought..

Food security outcomes in the agropastoral areas are worse than is typical during the spring and summer months. Livestock productivity and body conditions are below normal levels in many areas due to very poor rangeland conditions, leading to low income from livestock sales and limited household availability of livestock products. Most rangeland areas have received well below average rainfall amounts, except for localized parts of western, southwestern, and southeastern provinces. (FEWS NET, 31 May 2018)

Although several significant precipitation events during late spring helped alleviate dryness across the country, late rainfall was not sufficient to mitigate seasonal dryness in many parts of the country, which is most severe in the northwest but also significant across much of the north, northeast, southwest and central provinces. Field reports confirm that area planted for rainfed wheat is less than that of last year due to dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing, while a significant proportion of planted rainfed areas may have reduced yields due to dryness. (FEWS NET, 6 Jun 2018).

The intense drought between April and September is expected to further aggravate the already poor malnutrition status within the 20 affected provinces, and the impact may extend to December. As a result, an increase in acute malnutrition caseload between July and December 2018 is expected. In addition, the severity of acute malnutrition among children under five may get worse, resulting in cases that are more complicated. As of 19 July, it is reasonable to assume that the increase in magnitude and severity of acute malnutrition and disease will stretch the capacity of health facilities to provide treatment, and that in the medium to long-term, children will face heightened vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. (WHO, 19 Jul 2018).

In Hirat City, Hirat, humanitarian teams identified more than 51,000 people who have recently migrated to the city from drought-affected areas in neighbouring Badghis and Ghor provinces. The families are living in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities in makeshift shelters. In Qala-e-Naw, Bagdhis, teams identified nearly 7,000 people who have moved from rural areas to the provincial capital due to the drought. Cash distributions have started for these displaced families. The Government has distributed wheat grain to 15,000 families in four districts of Badghis, and WFP is preparing to distribute 1,250 metric tons of food in two districts of the same province. (OCHA, 23 Jul 2018)

Poor households in the northern areas will be the most affected by the drought due to reduced household wheat stocks and income from on-farm labor where food consumption deficits will continue through the next harvest (Spring 2019). Poor households in central areas of the country dependent on remittances from migrant workers in Iran are expected to see a decrease in remittances and further weakening of the Iranian rial (IRR) against the U.S. Dollar (USD) and Afghani (AFN) to drive low incomes. (FEWS NET, 31 Jul 2018)

As of 6 August, approximately 4,000 people arrived in Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, during the past week, reportedly displaced by drought from Muqur district. In Kunduz Province, more than 10,000 people have reportedly been displaced between different districts due to the drought. (OCHA, 6 Aug 2018)

As of 12 August, some 1,400 families reportedly arrived in the centre of Abkamari district, Badghis, from villages affected by the drought in the district. In Farah City, Farah, assessment teams identified nearly 600 people displaced by the drought from within the province. Further, around 280 displaced people were identified as having been displaced from their villages in Shahrak district, Ghor, due to the drought. In Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, authorities designated a new site for 1,700 families who arrived recently in the city due to the drought. (OCHA, 12 Aug 2018)

The drought continues to force people from their rural homes to the urban centres in Badghis, Ghor and Hirat provinces where their number surpassed 100,000 since May, according to humanitarian partners. The situation of drought-induced IDPs in Hirat city, Hirat remains dire. In the past week, six children reportedly died in the informal sites due to sickness, in a fire accident and at birth. WASH, health and protection services on the sites are picking up, but there are large gaps notably of emergency shelter. DRC-DDG and UNICEF have started protection monitoring on sites housing some 35,000 people. (OCHA, 19 Aug 2018)

An estimated 275,000 people have been displaced as a result of the drought in Afghanistan. Newly displaced people arriving in Hirat during the last week have been reported, but not confirmed. In response to the drought, WFP started food distributions for 47,000 people in rural areas of Ghor Province. (OCHA, 17 Sep 2018)

In the first half of September, an estimated 120,000 people have been displaced from rural areas of Badghis to Qala-e-Naw as a result of drought. As of 20 September, an estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region. A further 28,000 people displaced by the drought have returned to their homes in Muqur district of Badghis, in the last two weeks, upon assurances of food distributions in their home villages. Existing response capacity at more than a dozen sites in Qala-e-Naw and its surroundings is limited: around 42,000 people have insufficient access to safe drinking water and over 130,000 people have no access to sanitation facilities with people living in makeshift shelters. (OCHA, 24 Sep 2018)

Due to drought, high levels of food assistance needs will persist through the start of the lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter in. (FEWS NET, 30 Sep 2018)

On 16 October, [UN] Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund...and [CERF] have allocated $34.6 million in emergency aid to support 2.2 million people affected by a severe drought. With these funds, 7 national NGOs, 15 international NGOs and 4 UN agencies will distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock. (OCHA, 16 Oct 2018)

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, are expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter (IFRC, 1 Nov 2018).

According to the latest IPC report, Badghis is among the three provinces with IPC Phase 4 (emergency), whereas, Ghor, Hirat and Farah provinces are classified as IPC phase 3 (crisis). The most affected provinces with large-scale displacement are Badghis and Hirat provinces which accounts 74% of the total IDPs (OCHA, 19 Nov 2018).

In October-November, WFP reached nearly 1.6 million drought-affected people with food assistance in all 20 affected provinces, providing more than 27,000 mt of food and transferring over US$1.45 million cash assistance to the affected people. Meanwhile, prepositioning of food and nutrition supplies continues in remote areas in nine provinces, to cover the needs of 499,000 people (3,400 metric tons prepositioned in the last week of November). (OCHA, 9 Dec 2018)

During 17 - 23 December, as part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 104,500 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces with 720 (mt) of food and US$180,000 in cash transfers to cover food needs. In the first three weeks of December, WFP and partners assisted nearly 450,000 drought-affected people with some 3,750 (mt) of food and US$540,000 in cash transfers. (OCHA, 23 Dec 2018)

As part of the ongoing full-scale drought response, WFP and its partners reached 162,000 drought-affected people both in rural and urban areas of eight provinces during 8 - 14 January 2019. This included food for more than 40,000 people in informal settlements in and around Qalae-Naw in Badghis, who were displaced due to the drought. In total, WFP and partners distributed more than 4,400 metric tons (mt) of food in Badakhshan, Badghis, Ghor, Helmand, Herat, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul and Takhar provinces. (OCHA, 14 Jan 2019)

Afghan Red Crescent Society..conducted an emergency needs assessment in nine drought affected provinces in December 2018 and January 2019. The emergency needs assessment report indicated that the priority needs of the affected population, who are staying in rural areas and IDP camps, are food, water, health care and livelihood support. Almost 60 to 70 per cent of the water points are now dry. Most of the affected communities in province of the country have very low latrine coverage. The water treatment is equally low, at less than 10 per cent. (IFRC, 17 Mar 2019)

As of 31 March, humanitarian partners have reached 4.4 million people affected by drought with support, 91 per cent of those targeted for assistance. Of those reached, 438,600 people are in areas of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 23 Apr 2019)

Food security outcomes across the country are most likely to continue to gradually improve as the main harvest begins in late May/early June. As a result, Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are also most likely in areas still recovering from the drought with continued conflict preventing access to agricultural activities. (FEWS Net, 31 May 2019)

As of 30 April, humanitarian partners have reached 4.8 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 405,000 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 29 May 2019)

According to WFP, the drought support is scaling down starting in April, which will transition to seasonal support at the end of June. (WFP, 31 May 2019).

As of 31 May, humanitarian partners have reached 4.9 million people affected by drought. Of those reached, 450,600 people are in places of displacement, while the remainder are in drought-affected rural areas. (OCHA, 23 Jun 2019)

Food security outcomes are anticipated to generally improve across the country from June to September 2019, due to the above average wheat harvest, favorable livestock prices, and high demand for agriculture labor during the harvest. Most poor households across the country are likely to face Minimal (IPC Phase 1) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2). Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are likely to continue in displaced households, undocumented returnees and areas of Badghis province which was significantly affected by last year’s drought and conflict. (FEWS Net, 29 Jun 2019)

As of 8 July 2019, the impact of drought has heavily influenced population movement within Afghanistan and caused the displacement of 287,000 people primarily from the north-western and western regions. The sudden influx of over a quarter million people into the outskirts of Herat has led to the emergence of 19 vast and sprawling informal settlements. The food security and livelihoods situation has significantly deteriorated over the past months, driven mostly by the severe drought in 2018. An estimated 13.5 million people are severely food insecure and require emergency assistance. Twenty provinces of Afghanistan are food insecure and identified as having acute humanitarian food needs, health and WASH issues and their livelihoods. (IFRC, 9 July 2019)

Stressed (IPC Phase 2) and Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes are expected to be widespread as a result of the harvest and many households access own foods. However, areas of Badghis where many households are still recovering from the drought, undocumented returnees, and displaced households are expected to continue to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). As winter starts in October/November across much of the country, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are most likely to emerge as many households are expected to rely on markets with below average incomes. (FEWS Net, 31 Jul 2019)

In reviewing the situation, [FAO] stated that the deteriorating food security and livelihood situation has continued into in the latter half of 2019, driven mostly by the worst drought in a decade last year. The severe drought has affected more than two-thirds of the country and destroyed the agriculture sector. Despite reports of good harvests for 2019, FAO predicted that it will not be enough to alleviate food insecurities in the region. (FAO, 16 Sep 2019)

Between August and October 2019, it is estimated that 10.23 million people (33% of the total population) are in severe acute food insecurity and require urgent humanitarian action. These include around 7.79 million people in a crisis situation (IPC Phase 3) and 2.43 million people in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Around 10.37 million people are also in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2) and require livelihood support. During the projection analysis period, from November 2019 to March 2020, around 11.30 million people (37% of the total population) are estimated to be likely to experience severe acute food insecurity, out of which an estimated 8.6 million people likely be in an emergency situation (IPC Phase 4). Furthermore around 9.45 million people will be in a stressed situation (IPC Phase 2). (IPC, 30 Sep 2019)

Conflict and insecurity continue to disrupt livelihoods across most of the country with over 380,000 people displaced since the start of 2019. Additionally, over 440,000 people have returned from Iran and Pakistan to date in 2019. Most of the returned and internally displaced populations are expected to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) as these households have limited ability to access labor markets. Moreover, poor households impacted by weak labor markets, and below average remittances in higher elevated areas of the country remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). The rest of the country is in Stressed (IPC Phase 2) as many households continue to consume own foods, although have below average incomes. (FEWS Net, 26 Nov 2019)

Reports state that humanitarian food assistance will be necessary through the upcoming winter to mitigate food consumption gaps and prevent malnutrition in Afghanistan, especially as up to 85 percent of the country’s food comes from irrigated farming. It is predicted that, due to the effects of the drought, the number of people experiencing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity will rise to 14.3 million people between the period of November 2019 and March 2020. This is an increase by 113 percent over the same period a year previous, as per Flowminder 2020 population projections. (OCHA, 20 Dec 2019).

Many millions of people are still reeling from the crippling effects of the 2018-19 drought and struggling to recover. The cumulative impacts of decades of war, combined with recurrent natural disasters and chronic poverty, have resulted in crippling debt and depleted people’s capacity to cope with repeated shocks. Over 14 million people are projected to experience crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity, in the first quarter of 2020. Malnutrition is soaring, with over 3 million children and women acutely malnourished, requiring specialised nutrition supplies and medicines. (OCHA, 7 Jan 2020)

According to the IOM, almost 11,000 undocumented Afghans returned from Iran and Pakistan, and 700 people have been newly displaced by conflict in January 2020. These populations are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity as they have lost their typical livelihood activities and have limited ability to enter the labor markets. Many poor households across the country are facing food consumption gaps as households have depleted their food stocks and face difficulty accessing income to purchase food. Many of these households are in the Central Highlands and Northeastern parts of the country with these areas facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes are present in areas where households have access to remittances or labor opportunities although at below average levels. As winter progresses, more households are expected to rely on markets for food with below average purchasing power. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected to emerge across parts of the country.

Kamp-e-Sakhi, Afghanistan – On a bright day in April, in the aftermath of flash floods, rays of sun fall onto the cracked clay soil in Kamp-e-Sakhi in some parts and, in others, illuminate large puddles that dot the raw land.

In the northern Afghan district, on the outskirts of Mazar-e Sharif city, antiflood bags still lie on the wet ground although they helped little when the water spread days earlier, destroying modest homes.

Somagul, a 60-year-old former farmer who left her home in Baghlan last year because of severe drought and pressure from the Taliban, did not expect the flood.

On March 29, the sound of water hitting her door awakened her in the middle of the night.

“We escaped in the dark with my children and grandchildren. There was no light, but we managed to find our way out, we got wet and dirty. All our things stayed in the house,” Somagul told Al Jazeera. “We went higher up to the street which was not flooded and we stayed there for the whole night. In the morning when the flood was gone, we came back.”

Although the flood soon reversed, Somagul and her family, including her sister, four children and 16 grandchildren, lost most of their few valuable possessions.

Electronic devices were among their most expensive belongings that were destroyed; it will take a long time to replace them.

Since the family moved to Mazar-e Sharif, only her son-in-law has managed to find work at the local coal market and they have no land to grow crops.

This was the second time in Somagul’s life that water-related disasters came to define her family’s fate.

Afghanistan, where the worst drought in a decade has displaced an estimated 260,000 people, has been struggling with the acute consequences of climate change, water mismanagement and 40 years of war that took its toll on the country’s weak water infrastructure.

Droughts and floods have become the norm, destroying the lives of Afghans across the country.

An upstream country, Afghanistan is not naturally water stressed. Eighty percent of its resources come from surface water that flows from snowfields and glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountains.

Over the course of Spring and Summer, the mountain snows melt and fuel Afghanistan’s five river basins.

From there, the water enters the canals and spreads across the country.

Most of Afghanistan’s irrigation depends on these resources. As the Afghan proverb goes, “may Kabul be without gold rather than snow.”

But ever since the Soviet invasion, the country’s infrastructure has been falling into ruin.

First, the bombings and years of fighting destroyed much of its canals. Then the Taliban administration did little to repair the damage, let alone build new infrastructure.

Following the US invasion, the Afghan government with the support of the international community has put water management high on its agenda, investing efforts to rehabilitate the canals.

But the infrastructure is inadequate for the needs of the country’s growing population.

Most of Afghanistan’s partners have been reluctant to support large projects, such as dams, which require substantial funds.

India, though, has sponsored the Afghan-India Friendship Dam on the Hari river and is planning the construction of Shahtoot Dam on the Kabul River.

Dams are crucial to store the water needed for irrigation and prevent flash floods, which have become frequent due to climate change.

In a country where agriculture contributes between 20 and 40 percent of the GDP, depending on the year, and employs about 60 percent of the workforce, the lack of investment has had disastrous consequences.

“Because of climate change, our winters have been getting hotter year by year and we’ve had much more rain in springs instead of snow in winters, which recently resulted in floods in many provinces especially in the north and west of Afghanistan,” Abdul Basir Azimi, water expert and the former deputy minister of energy and water told Al Jazeera.

“Twenty Afghan provinces experienced about a 60 percent decrease in snowfall during the last winter season in 2017, and before that.

“Severe drought throughout the country and excessively warm weather have affected the rural and urban populations, the agricultural economy and recently led to a tremendous increase in the number of IDPs.”

Drought has also affected the levels of groundwater that Afghan cities have been relying on for drinking.

Kabul is home to almost five million people and the capital’s population, according to estimates, will double in the next 10 years. The city has been particularly vulnerable to water shortages.

“Last year, we experienced severe drought in the country including in the Kabul River basin. The groundwater level dropped by more than 10 metres,” Tayib Bromand, water resources and climate change adaptation specialist at the ministry of water and energy, told Al Jazeera.

“In Afghanistan’s major cities there was not enough water for domestic supply. Particularly, the most elevated parts of Kabul do not receive sufficient water for drinking.”

Unable to access drinking water through the official distribution networks, Afghanistan’s population has been relying on unofficial wells with poor-quality water. Others have been using paid water delivery services provided by private companies.

Afghanistan has had to deal with many decades of war, and, as we've seen the world over, environmental issues sometimes exacerbate political tensions. Jenna Jadin, FAO scientist

While Afghanistan has now entered peace talks with the Taliban, internal displacement caused by the water crisis might further stir conflict.

In some areas, farmers have no choice but to join armed groups in order to feed their families.

At the local level, conflicts over water also erupt between upstream and downstream areas, as well as individual farmers.

Jenna Jadin, a scientist with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Afghanistan, told Al Jazeera: “We’re trying to make sure that water is incorporated into everything we are doing: for example, in projects where we’re teaching people to diversify their livelihoods and diets through planting new crops, we are also making sure to teach better water usage for those crops.

“We are also implementing projects that restore forests and rangelands, which will reduce surface water losses and soil erosion.”

But Afghanistan’s water scarcity has the potential to cause conflict on a regional level, too.

Due to insufficient infrastructure and decades of conflict, 70 percent of the country’s surface water ends up flowing into neighbouring states, all of which, apart from Tajikistan, are water stressed.

The drought has impacted farmers’ lives as the water crisis limits access to drinking water [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]

“Afghanistan’s situation has created an opportunity for the neighbouring countries to unfairly and unreasonably develop their agriculture lands at a very rapid pace downstream and also illegitimately transfer the water from the bordering lands to their central provinces,” Azimi said.

“The neighbouring countries have been irrigating hundreds of hectares of agricultural lands with water flowing from Afghanistan’s rivers, but on the other side, the neighbouring countries have built too many dams and not allowed any water [to flow] into Afghanistan.”

Afghanistan, therefore, has a pressing need for new dams to manage its scarce water reserves.

But more water staying in the country means less water for its neighbours. And while there are existing international agreements dealing with water scarcity between the five Central Asian states, for example, Afghanistan has not been part of them.

The only water agreement Afghanistan has signed was a 1973 treaty with Iran regulating the inflow of water to the country. But even that has not prevented conflict between the neighbours.

Afghanistan’s population relies on unofficial wells with poor-quality water [Agnieszka Pikulicka-Wilczewska/Al Jazeera]

The Afghan government has long accused Iran of supporting the Taliban in order to disrupt the construction of a dam on the Helmand River, which could potentially affect the delivery of water to the country.

Similarly, Pakistan, one of the most water-stressed countries in the region, opposes the construction of the Shahtoot Dam on the Kabul River sponsored by its archenemy India.

The construction of the dam could reduce the flow of water into Pakistan.

The potential of regional conflict is high and investing in water management is crucial for Afghanistan’s security.

While most of the country’s international partners are reluctant to make such costly, long-term investments that bring little profit, the government is increasingly seeing water as a security issue.

If “hydro-diplomacy” continues to be put high on the state’s agenda, not everything is lost.

“Afghanistan has had to deal with many decades of war, and, as we’ve seen the world over, environmental issues sometimes exacerbate political tensions,” Jadin said. “If we can help the people restore their environment it may very well have a positive cascading effect on other aspects of life.”","Sun, 05 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/92081ec2010845cba1e3d449a8843c6b_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['rifts', 'war', 'afghanistans', 'water', 'dam', 'crisis', 'drought', 'kabul', 'diplomatic', 'afghanistan', 'river', 'pikulickawilczewskaal', 'country', 'agnieszka', 'deepen']",

Lying on a bundle of fabric, Maryam’s legs jut out, thin and pale. When they arrived at hospital two weeks ago, she could hardly breathe. Her body was swollen with malnutrition, her lips and fingers were blue.

There are 24 children being treated at Mofleh paediatric hospital’s malnutrition ward, on the outskirts of Herat city, western Afghanistan. Mothers and aunts lean next to hospital beds, some rocking tiny babies back and forth.

The worst drought in a decade, prolonged conflict and poverty have pushed families across Afghanistan to the brink. About 13.5 million people are severely food insecure – 6 million more than in 2017. This means they are surviving, for the time being, on less than one meal a day.

“That’s the highest number of any country in the world except Yemen,” says Toby Lanzer, the UN’s deputy special representative in Afghanistan. An estimated 3.6 million people are one step from famine. Flash flooding in many areas has compounded the misery families are facing.

As US and Afghan Taliban peace talks continue, and the prospect of US troops withdrawing looms, the UN’s appeal to donors – which set a target of $612m (£465m) for this year – is only 11% funded.

Without donor support, Afghanistan would face “a humanitarian tragedy beyond what one could describe”, warns Adele Khodr, Afghanistan’s Unicef representative; the country, she says, could fall apart: “It will become a chaotic situation that can generate insecurity not only for here but maybe elsewhere.”

Outside Mofleh hospital, tents stretch into the distance. It’s one of several areas where families who fled the drought have sought shelter. Some sleep in white tents handed out by the UN, others have propped up flimsy pieces of cloth on sticks.

Critics say the response to the drought was slow and failed to support people to stay in their home areas. Alarm bells were first rung by several agencies on the ground, including World Vision, in autumn 2017, but it wasn’t until April 2018 that the government declared a drought. About 260,000 people were forced to leave their homes across northern and western Afghanistan.

New arrivals, whose presence in Herat is politically sensitive, are scattered across several sites, making it harder for agencies to provide services. Access to drought-affected areas, where millions more remain, is hampered by insecurity and lack of funding.

Rahima Lakzai and her family left their village in the Muqur district of Badghis province four months ago. Almost all their animals had wasted away. There was no money for transport; for eight days, they travelled with two donkeys across the rugged terrain that leads to Herat.

Sitting in a small mobile health clinic, run by World Vision, Lakzai, 22, cradles her youngest daughter. Rakima, 11 months, is wrapped in a red cardigan, a matching scarf tied under her chin. A measurement of her arm circumference – just 11.2cm – indicates she has developed severe acute malnutrition. Rahima is given peanut paste to feed to her daughter, and asked to come back in a week’s time.

She says through an interpreter that the family still haven’t been given a proper tent to sleep in and can barely afford food for their two children. Her husband will do any daily labour he can, she says, but there’s little work going.

Torpikae, 35, from Badghis province, lost all 50 of her sheep and three cows in the drought before she fled with her family. “Only a few people remain,” she says. She has received cash handouts, but debt to neighbours means she is not able to keep everything she receives. “Half we give to those [neighbours] we borrowed from,” she says. Like Rahima’s family, Torpikae’s husband goes out to look for work in the city. “Mostly he is jobless,” she says.

Herat is one of Afghanistan’s most prosperous and safe cities, but competition for daily labour, which pays up to $5 a day, is tough. Food is abundant in markets, but numerous families – both locals and people who have fled the drought – can’t afford it.

Shafiqa is from Herat province’s Shindand district, an area that has been racked by violence. Maryam’s mother died two days after giving birth, leaving her in Shafiqa’s care. The family has no stable source of income because Shafiqa’s husband is not well enough to work. Before bringing Maryam to hospital, she depended on neighbours for handouts, she says: “I went from house to house to ask for milk.”

The effects of malnutrition for children aged two and under are irreversible, says Dr Shakib Popal, of World Vision Afghanistan, which supports the hospital’s malnutrition ward. “The brain of the child will be affected and all the consequences will remain for a lifetime,” he says.

Babies often need to stay in the ward for 45 days, adds Popal, but mothers struggle to say away from their families for so long.

“I am begging them to discharge me,” says the woman whose baby is next to Shafiqa. Her three-month-old still has swollen legs, but she has eight other children at home.

Families who have been displaced face the greatest barriers to healthcare: on top of discrimination against new arrivals, many are often too preoccupied with finding shelter and food to go for checkups.

It was six weeks before Torpikae was given a proper tent. In other areas of Herat, and across eight other provinces including Farah and Kandahar, flash flooding has swept away the shelters used by displaced families. “Some 15,000 families, many of them already affected by the drought, were hit by flash floods, and WFP and partners are responding to cover their immediate food and other needs,” says Zlatan Milisic, country director of the UN World Food Programme in Afghanistan.

Lanzer says that acknowledging and responding to slow onset natural disasters such as droughts typically takes time. Whether or not the response was slow is difficult to judge, and irrelevant, he says. “It’s a bit like counting the number of dead people after an earthquake. It doesn’t matter. We deal with the survivors.

“For the past nine months we’ve been doing everything we can with woefully limited resources to do as much as possible,” he says, adding that 5.4 million people were reached with food aid last year. While conditions for displaced families are dire, there are millions more who remain in drought-affected areas.

The effects of the drought are expected to wane. But land degradation – driven by decades of conflict, overuse of natural resources, and climate change – means the full benefits of recent rains aren’t felt. Instead, the risk of flash floods is heightened.

“When forests and rangelands are degraded, topsoil erodes. Any loss of plants and the soil they hold in place means that when rains come, the land doesn’t benefit as much as it should,” says Rajendra Aryal, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s representative in Afghanistan, which is working with the ministry of agriculture, irrigation and livestock to restore forests and rangelands.

Over the past decade and a half, droughts have become more frequent and more serious. It’s likely this trend will continue, creating food crises, prompting large numbers of people to flee their homes, and increasing the risk that water conflict will exacerbate existing ethnic tensions.

Many of those who have fled to Herat do not want to return home. “Even if this year is a good year [for rains] we do not have resources there,” says Rahima.

Shafiqa will stay in the hospital for another two weeks, before she goes back to her children in Shindand. “I have heard from others that the government is going to make peace with the Taliban,” she says. “I hope peace comes to my district.”

Shafiqa says her children are used to the fighting. “We have a shelter underground we go to … once, we were in it for a whole night. When they hear the firing sound, they just come and stick to me.”","Mon, 25 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26284f9ae5aa84968b64b507575a558751ca191f/0_184_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=088894bf17cac560c2704f1723fb1153,"['malnutrition', 'apart', 'food', 'hospital', 'family', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'despair', 'fall', 'country', 'families', 'world', 'children', 'herat']",

Reports from the U.N. and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow following crop failures in some areas and livestock dying for the want of anything to eat.

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.

In a regular update, the U.N. humanitarian office reported that 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in Qala-e-Naw city in Badghis province in the week to Sept. 9.

A second U.N. report, with data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month. It estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.

In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.

The U.N. cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International that 99 percent of people in Badghis said their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.

“The assessment also indicates that most farmers lost last season’s harvest and nearly all of them lack seeds for new planting season,” the U.N. report said, noting reports that about 40 per cent of livestock has been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder.

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a U.S. funded food security monitoring service, said in a report on Aug. 31 that the number of Afghans in a food “crisis” was atypically high.

“Crisis” is step three on a five step scale, where four is “emergency” and five is “catastrophe” and possible famine.

In Badghis and Faryab provinces, emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in January, FEWS NET said.

“Normally during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labor opportunities, and continued conflict more households face Crisis outcomes than normal,” it said.","Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'food', 'step', 'badghis', 'drought', 'million', 'worse', 'seeds', 'conflict', 'report', 'aid', 'outcomes']",

The planned response reflects the current situation and information currently available. It is likely to be adjusted based on further developments and ongoing detailed assessments. Further information will be available in the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) in the coming days.

The operational strategy

Background

Afghanistan is highly prone to intense and recurring natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, snow avalanches, landslides and droughts due to its geographical location and years of environmental degradation.

Climate change also poses a threat to Afghanistan’s natural resources, of which most Afghans depend on for their livelihoods. Afghanistan faces significant impacts of climate change and disasters which impact growth prospects.

It has a continental climate, which combined with its location at the western end of the Himalayas, renders it susceptible to extremes of temperature and rainfall.

It is also important to note that after decades of conflict, the current intensification of fighting and growing insecurity further hampers access to humanitarian aid and essential services. In the current unstable and volatile context, the civilian population is paying the highest toll to the protracted conflict which is significantly impacting their lives and livelihoods.

Needs assessment and selection of people to be reached

Drought

Since April 2018, Afghanistan is experiencing an increase in the frequency and severity of drought due to a rise in temperature and decrease in the amount of rainfall during monsoon season. Most areas in Afghanistan have experienced between four to six consecutive seasons of far below average rainfall over the last three years. With below average precipitation and above average temperatures since October 2017, the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), UN agencies and ARCS started monitoring the drought. Over 2018, the situation was closely followed with support from the local metrological department and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET). By the middle of 2018, the protracted drought condition resulted in significant reduction in snow depths, river flows, water level in dams, water tables, and soil moistures. These conditions have already negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter 2017–2018 and spring/summer 2018 agricultural season in Afghanistan.

According to Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, as of September 2018, 9.8 million people (43.6 per cent of the rural population) were estimated to be in Food Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phase 3 and Phase 4). An estimated 2.6 million are classified in IPC Phase 4 nationwide; these people require urgent action to reduce their food deficits and to protect their livelihoods. The current Phase 3 and 4 estimates correspond to a 17.4 per cent increase (from 26.2 to 43.6 per cent) compared to the previous analysis for the same time period last year (2017). Projections suggest that from November 2018 to February 2019, the total population in IPC Phase 3 and IPC Phase 4 is expected to increase to 10.6 million (47.1 per cent of the rural population).

The last available report from UN OCHA on 13 September 2018 indicated that the drought affected internally displaced people (IDPs) are estimated at around 266,000. Of these, 84,000 people have settled in Herat city and 182,000 within Badghis province of which 18,579 families (94,945 people) are now settled in Qala-e-Naw City (capital of Badghis province). IDPs are residing in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities, or in makeshift shelters within the main cities. This makes it more difficult to reach them in a higher number of catchment areas.

The humanitarian response in 2018 was hampered by underfunding and insecurity. Following revisions to the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, a total of almost 3.5 million food insecure people in 20 provinces of Afghanistan were identified as having acute humanitarian food needs, health and WASH issues and their livelihoods by ANDMA and UN agencies. Over 112,000 Afghans were displaced from their homes in Badghis, Herat and Ghor provinces, the worst affected provinces, to places where they could seek help in the city areas of Herat and Qala-e-Now. The response to the drought in areas of origin had been slow, which contributed to a displacement crisis in the Western region, where the shelter response has been inadequate to date, with people continuing to live in scattered sites in dire makeshift housing.

ARCS conducted an emergency needs assessment in nine1 drought affected provinces in December 2018 and January 2019 within the DREF-supported drought operation while providing simultaneous food assistance to an initial 14,000 drought affected people (approximately 2,000 families) in Herat and Badghis provinces through food assistance. Besides, ARCS also provided emergency shelters, health services and household items to around 11,558 people in Herat and Badghis. ARCS deployed one Mobile Health Team (MHT) to provide medical treatment to IDPs in an IDP settlement in east of Herat since Aug 2018, together with some dignity kits to drought affected IDPs in Herat and Badghis provinces.

The emergency needs assessment report indicated that the priority needs of the affected population, who are staying in rural areas and IDP camps, are food, water, health care and livelihood support. During the assessment, it was found that almost 60 to 70 per cent of the water points, respectively, are now dry. Poor hygiene practices, including consumption of unsafe water, low latrine coverage and poor health seeking behaviour have been cited as some of the underlying factors for the high levels of malnutrition in the country. In addition, most of the affected communities in province of the country have very low latrine coverage. The water treatment is equally low, at less than 10 per cent and hand washing practices are also poor.

Floods

El Nino, declared in early February this year, brought above-normal snowfall/ rainfall2 to Afghanistan, and this was also reflected in the seasonal forecast for March-May 2019. With poor soil absorption and limited vegetation in many mountainous areas due to the drought, the current rainfall in recent weeks and projections indicate the likelihood of increased and worsening spring floods to come3 . On a positive note, FEWSNET indicates that the above normal precipitation will be beneficial for cropping.

The OCHA and government Command and Control Centre for Flood Emergency report notes that nine provinces have been affected by heavy rains and flooding to date, including Herat and Kandahar provinces. The flood damaged the infrastructure including equipment and amenities which led to the disruption of the routine functioning of these facilities in the affected areas. Several of the public buildings which were damaged during the disaster, have also lost connectivity and are inaccessible due to damages to roads and bridges.

ARCS conducted a rapid need assessment on 1 March which showed mass destructions of house and shelters, loss of lives, public facilities, mosques and displacements of people from their homes and IDPs camps due to the floods. It is anticipated that more rains shall fall in the coming months with little resources on ground to respond the needs of people in different provinces. The resilience of people in most of the provinces is already weak because of earlier protracted drought. There is a huge need in emergency shelter on the ground. Besides, there is continuous population movement from the rural villages to safer places with available humanitarian assistance and better basic services.

Most of the provinces already affected by the protracted conflict and recently drought, people are living in poor shelter without enough basic service. This has continuous and added negative effects on already fragile systems and communities that were displaced due to drought since 2017. Presently, there are many IDP settlements in Herat, Badghis, Kandahar and Farha that were by those affected due to drought. These settlements are growing with added people arriving due to the onset of floods.

In view of the humanitarian needs, this Emergency Appeal responds to communities affected by the drought and floods, with interventions planned to cover almost 13 months (from March 2019 to March 2020). This appeal includes interventions to address the food crises, threat of disease outbreaks, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs, livelihoods disruption and ongoing internal displacement driven by the floods, drought and conflict.

The operations team will continue to monitor the situation to adjust the operation and respond adequately to this, with a link and transition to existing and additional longer-term programming where applicable.

The operational strategy of this Emergency Appeal is the outcome of continuous assessments and data analysis, as well as consultation between the IFRC, ARCS and Movement partners on how to respond to this complex emergency in an integrated manner. Coordination with ICRC and partners began in early 2018 with the advent of ARCS drought response. Consultation for access to operation areas was obtained from ICRC within the Strengthening Movement Cooperation and Coordination (SMCC) plan. The Emergency Appeal aims at assisting around 650,000 people (approximately 92,500 families) who are at risk of food insecurity and livelihood disruption, deteriorating health and hygiene conditions, and limited access to safe drinking water due to factors such as current floods, drought, conflict and economic instability. Overall, this operation seeks to assist the following beneficiary targets within each sector and provinces:

ARCS and IFRC aim to incorporate longer-term resilience-oriented approaches in programming to address some of the underlying factors causing vulnerability. Community-driven sustainable solutions will be used to increase the resilience of crisis-affected people to cope with cyclical food insecurity. The proposed response activities in this Appeal will also reinforce ARCS disaster response capacity and expertise in areas such as emergency shelter and household items assistance, health care provision, WASH and cash-based intervention (CBI), and strengthen its country-wide network of volunteers. These objectives will be closely linked to those of the national long-term (development) operational plan for Afghanistan, ensuring a concerted approach to capacity-building and allowing for an effective exit strategy when this Emergency Appeal is expected to come to an end (March 2020).

Target population

The operation defines the target of worst affected population by floods and drought in Nangahar, Farha, Kunhar,

Helmand, Herat, Kandahar, Jowzjan, Nimroz and Badghis provinces.

The targeting criteria for household level assistance to floods and drought-affected communities will be defined based on further assessment and in consultation with local ARCS branches and leaders of community-based organisations. ARCS will invest in strong community-based targeting mechanisms to avoid potential selection biases and to meet the Movement’s global standards on community engagement and accountability (CEA). More specifically the targeting will focus on: (i) Emergency Shelter/household items (ii) Acute Water Diarrhoea (AWD) high-risk communities; (iii) floods and drought affected internally-displaced populations (IDPs) and those who lost their livelihoods which affected the household income; and (iv) communities with basic health related issues.

Coordination and partnerships

The IFRC’s Afghan country office is supporting ARCS in implementing health programmes including Community Based Health and First Aid (CBHFA) in northern, north-eastern, central northern, central southern and western regions. Similarly, WASH activities are also being carried out in five provinces; Parwan, Nangarhar, Balkh, Samangan and Baghlan. ARCS partners with Canadian Red Cross together with IFRC in supporting health in emergencies, mobile health teams (MHTs) in 11 provinces including youth health and routine immunisation in Paktika, Kunduz, Kandahar, Kunar, Nooristan, Nangarhar and Laghman.

The ICRC, in its role of lead agency, is present in Afghanistan since 1986 and engages in dialogue with all parties to the conflict having a direct or indirect influence on the humanitarian situation in the country. The key operating areas in responding to the Afghanistan protracted conflict include promote and respect of IHL, health services, in particular for the wounded and sick, ensure physical rehabilitation and social reintegration, monitor the treatment of detainees across the country and maintaining contact with their families, as well as their health and water sanitation conditions. ICRC provides support to the civilian population in improving livelihood and water and sanitation, health, Restoring Family Links (RFL) and tracing activities. The ICRC supports ARCS, as its primary partner in its development and operations with focus on “Safer Access” approach that promotes safer access to persons affected by conflict and other situations of violence, whilst minimising risks for staff and volunteers.

The Norwegian Red Cross has in-country presence supporting ARCS with health interventions, WASH and CBHFA activities in the provinces. The Danish Red Cross extends their support to ARCS in psychosocial support (PSS) together with the ICRC, volunteer management and youth mobilization activities in Afghanistan.

The Government of Afghanistan through its Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) coordinates all interventions by NGO and UN agencies with support from UNOCHA. ARCS is participating regularly in Command and Control Centre for Flood Emergency under the Minister of State for Disaster Management in Kabul. They are sharing and collecting updates with ANMDA and other authorities. ARCS also participate in all coordination meetings in clusters, technical working groups health, WASH, CBI and etc. including in governmentled or other humanitarian organizations meetings. Other agencies implementing humanitarian activities related to the floods and drought response includes UN Agencies: WFP, UNDP, UNOCHA, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, IOM and other INGOs implementing water and sanitation activities while Save the Children, OXFAM, ACF, ACTED, Norwegian and Danish Refugee Councils are providing emergency shelter and household items, and nutritional support project through health centres and immediate food assistance for floods and cash based initiatives are already taken for drought affected people through their cash programmes. ARCS and IFRC held meetings with mobile money service providers to develop an overview of the capacity of the mobile operators. The meetings highlighted the widespread use of mobile money platforms by the communities in Afghanistan for food purchases etc. The mobile money platform is widespread with sufficient network coverage in targeted areas under the operation. Mobile operators indicated that they are able to support the operation through registration of beneficiaries who are not on the mobile money platform and will orient on how the systems work.

Advocacy and humanitarian diplomacy

The relationship between this disaster and the pre-existing conflict situation in Afghanistan has further weakened the resilience of individuals and communities. Humanitarian advocacy with Afghan authorities and international organisations needs to address the criticality of this crisis situation for communities because of series of selfsustaining disasters (flash floods worsened by droughts). Humanitarian diplomacy with Afghan authorities and other actors will be undertaken in consultation with ARCS and the ICRC. This aims to mobilize public and governmental support and resources for humanitarian operations and programmes, and to facilitate effective partnerships for responding to the needs of vulnerable people. ARCS regional branches are collaborating with local authorities and humanitarian actors in floods and drought affected provinces. Information and situation updates are being shared regularly with ARCS National Headquarters. The IFRC Afghan country office will be strengthened with a team member to support these efforts for advocacy, negotiation, communication, formal agreements, and other measures with many players, including governments, international organisations, UN agencies and the public and private sectors","Sun, 17 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1259688-MDREF005ea.png?itok=cbF27UO8,"['health', 'food', 'water', 'affected', 'drought', 'appeal', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'mdraf005', 'flash', 'provinces', 'arcs', 'humanitarian', 'n', 'emergency']",

Description of the disaster

Afghanistan’s climate can be characterized by hot and dry summers and cold winters. Most of the annual precipitation takes place in the northern region in the form of snow. Afghanistan is highly prone to intense and recurring natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, snow avalanches, landslides and droughts due to its geographical location and years of environmental degradation. Climate change is also posing a threat to the country’s people and ecosystems. Climate change predictions such as changing temperature and precipitation pattern might lead to extreme weather event such as drought and flash floods. Changing weather is also affecting the productivity of agriculture, of which most Afghans depend on for their livelihoods, causing food security problem. Over the past decade and a half, droughts have become more frequent and more serious. It is likely this trend will continue, creating food crises, prompting large numbers of people to flee their homes, and increasing the risk that water conflict will exacerbate existing ethnic tensions. The worst drought in a decade, prolonged conflict and poverty have pushed families across Afghanistan to the brink. About 13.5 million people are severely food insecure, 6 million more than in 2017 and they are surviving, for the time being, on less than one meal a day1 . Displaced families living in temporary and poorly insulated shelters are facing the risk of harsh weather but also the high risk of flash flooding, especially those residing on dry-river beds.

Afghanistan is experiencing a major livelihood crisis primarily caused by the severe drought, which limits food production and depletes farmers and livestock keepers of assets and livelihoods. However, the years of civil conflict and instability as well as the severely degraded condition of much of the land have compounded the impacts of the drought, leading to the food security crisis situation. The flood season in Afghanistan primarily runs between March and June due to snow melt and rain. Several factors have combined to increase the severity of potential flooding in 2019, with serious early floods already occurring in March. Following two years of severe drought, the influence of global weather patterns has seen above average precipitation across much of the country in 2019. Given the increased likelihood of above average temperatures, as well as above average rainfall and snow at higher elevations, the risk of flooding is elevated through until the end of the rainy season (April-June) in the western, northern, and central areas of Afghanistan.

Humanitarian needs in flood-affected communities are compounded by the loss of resilience from drought and conflict. With many flood-risk areas already affected by the severe drought in 2017/18 and ongoing conflict, there are serious concerns about increasing food insecurity, malnutrition and the spread of communicable diseases, including acute watery diarrhoea/cholera. Many families are affected by several different types of incidents, with resulting increases in protection concerns and a reduced ability to absorb shocks. Flood response activities will continue to face access constraints in many areas due to ongoing conflict and related displacement, as well as damage to transport infrastructure in remote areas from flooding.

According to Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, as of September 2018, 9.8 million people (44 per cent of the rural population) were estimated to be in Food Crisis and Emergency (IPC Phase 3 and Phase 4). An estimated 2.6 million are classified in IPC Phase 4 nationwide; these people require urgent action to reduce their food deficits and to protect their livelihoods. The current Phase 3 and 4 estimates correspond to a 17 per cent increase (from 26 to 44 per cent) compared to the previous analysis for the same time period last year (2017). FEWS NET January 2019 projections suggested that from November 2018 to February 2019, the total population in IPC Phase 3 and IPC Phase 4 increased to 10.6 million (47 per cent of the rural population). The results of the IPC analysis show that Afghanistan is experiencing a major food and livelihood crisis. This crisis has been primarily caused by the severe drought, which limits food production and depletes farmers and livestock keepers of assets and livelihoods; however, the years of civil conflict and instability as well as the severely degraded condition of much of the land have compounded the impacts of the drought, leading to the food security crisis situation we are witnessing today. Afghanistan is currently facing one of the world’s largest and most complex humanitarian crisis, with alarming increase of food insecurity and loss of livelihoods, as a result of the combined effect of widespread conflict and insecurity, recurrent natural disasters and ensuing mass displacements.

Conflict and insecurity remain widespread, although the number of events is lower compared to the same period in 2018. Although the conflict events have spread in geographic extent, particularly in the north, northeast, west, and south region of the country. This leaves many households frequently adjusting to the changing local conditions that alter daily life including market access, labour opportunities and availability, access to grazing lands, and ability to participated in the ongoing agriculture season. Many IDPs affected by conflict, as well as undocumented returnees are most likely to have a below-average household harvest. The food security and livelihoods situation has significantly deteriorated over the past months, driven mostly by the severe drought in 2018. An estimated 13.5 million people are severely food insecure and require emergency assistance.2 The humanitarian response during the first half of the year has been hampered by underfunding and insecurity. Following revisions to the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, 20 provinces of Afghanistan are food insecure and identified as having acute humanitarian food needs, health and WASH issues and their livelihoods.","Sat, 31 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1355488-MDRAF005eu2.png?itok=bAm0HUb-,"['food', 'update', 'ipc', 'crisis', 'epoa', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'mdraf005', 'flash', 'appeal', 'conflict', 'livelihoods', 'phase', 'million', '2019', 'n', 'emergency']",

Afghans are facing water shortages due to the persistent drought that has ravaged the country this year.

In many places, including the capital Kabul, local residents have to carry containers to fill at water points several times a day.

”Water used to be available 24 hours every day, but now it is only available three to four hours. More than 500 families gather here to get water during these few hours,” said Sayed Ali, a local resident.

In the past year, the amount of precipitation dropped by more than 50 percent compared with that of average levels in most parts of Afghanistan. Sixteen out of 34 provinces are suffering from drought.

This year is even worse. La Nina has had a devastating effect on the planting season, with a rain, snow and sleet deficit of 70 percent prevailing across most of the country.

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought.

According to the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, about two million Afghans have been affected by the drought. Years of conflict have damaged the country’s infrastructure, making the situation even worse.

”Afghanistan lacks infrastructure. The construction of water projects including dams has been slow. So when water flows past Afghanistan, there is no way to store it and just let it flow right into neighbouring countries,” said Aslam Sayas, the deputy director of Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority.

Local media say the drought has caused a fall in crop production in the western and northern parts of Afghanistan, and people in these areas are on the edge of famine.

10,10,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"In parched Afghanistan, drought sharpens water dispute with Iran - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-iran-water-idUSKBN1K702H,"KABUL (Reuters) - Rafiqullah Dawoodzai says his fields were too dry to sow crops this year, the first time he has skipped a growing season in more than 40 years. The 60 acres he farms lie along the banks of Afghanistan’s Helmand River, but the country lacks the infrastructure to use its waters for large-scale irrigation.

Severe drought across much of Afghanistan is spurring plans to build new dams to help farmers such as Dawoodzai. It is also aggravating tensions with Iran over supplies from the Helmand - a decades-old dispute that has fed accusations that Tehran is helping the Taliban insurgency.

“We can see the Helmand River water, we can even go touch it, but we can’t bring it’s water to our farmlands,” said Dawoodzai, who grows wheat and lentils in the southern province of Helmand. “It is frustrating for every farmer to see large amounts of Helmand River water flowing into Iran.”

Afghan officials say their country, which has one of the lowest levels of water storage capacity in the world, needs the extra dams to feed its agriculture sector, the mainstay of the $20 billion economy, which has been brutally hit by drought.

With drought prevailing across the region and protests against water shortages rocking Iran, Afghanistan’s announcement in April that it would press ahead with plans for new dams and reservoirs prompted objections from the Tehran government, which fears its supplies will be cut.

The row underscores the growing strategic importance of water across the world. Water disputes have become common in South and Central Asia and elsewhere.

Earlier this year, the Taliban threatened to overrun Afghanistan’s western province of Farah, on the border with Iran, drawing angry warnings from local politicians that Tehran was using the insurgents to fight a proxy war over water.

“Iran is supporting the Taliban to disrupt developmental projects in Afghanistan, including water dams,” said Gul Nabi Ahmadzai, the former Afghan border police chief.

“They benefit from keeping Afghanistan unstable and want to control our resources,” he said.

Iranian diplomats in Kabul declined to comment. Tehran has repeatedly denied helping the Taliban.

“The dialogue between the two governments for resolving water issues is being pursued through diplomatic channels and linking this issue with Afghanistan’s internal issues has no logical, accurate or rational basis,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said in May, after the Farah attacks, according to a report from the Iranian Students’ News Agency.

ERRATIC SUPPLIES

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has seen a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture said.

“We have to protect the national interest,” said Fahimullah Ziaee, who until June served as the country’s junior minister for irrigation and natural resources, and who participated in talks with Iran earlier this year. “We cannot be dictated to by any country on how to protect our natural resources.”

Tehran had already voiced concern that the huge Indian-financed Salma Dam in western Herat province, inaugurated in 2016, would see its water supplies reduced.

Recent meetings with Afghan officials over plans for additional dams have re-ignited the issue, according to two senior Iranian officials, one based in Tehran and the second in Kabul.

Plans to improve Afghanistan’s water storage capacity have been on the drawing board for decades but now the government is actively seeking aid from international donors to build two dams and increase the height of existing dams.

At the center of the dispute is the Helmand river, which runs through much of Afghanistan from its source in the mountains north of Kabul, feeding the Sistan wetlands in the border regions of the two countries.

Water from the Helmand River is in principle shared under a 1973 treaty, which assigned Iran 820 million cubic meters of water a year. But with Afghanistan at war for the past 40 years the supply has been erratic.

“It is not like we are forcing Afghanistan to give us water,” said a senior official in Tehran working in the irrigation department. “They have to honor the water sharing agreement and seek our consent to prevent environmental damage caused by their dams.”

Donors such as India, which has expressed interest in investing on two dams in central Afghanistan, must consult Iran before supporting large dam building projects, which critics say cause severe environmental damage both down and upstream, the official said.

A senior Indian diplomat in Kabul said it planned to construct dams in Afghanistan, but would not intervene in a bilateral water dispute between Tehran and Kabul.

“Afghanistan’s government wants us to help them build dams, we will go ahead with the plans. We don’t see the need to secure Iran’s permission for such projects,” said the Indian official.

Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan declined to comment on the water dispute.

Afghan officials say a lack of dams on their side of the border has made it impossible to control the run-off into Iran, which they say has received well above its allotted share of water.

Irrigation ministry officials in Kabul said that last year Iran received more than 3 billion cubic meters, at a time when the effects of drought, which now afflicts 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, were already starting to be felt.

However reaching agreement is made more difficult by the fact that the Dehravud gauging station on the Kajaki dam, the point agreed in the 1973 treaty for measuring the annual flow, is currently under Taliban control and no official has been able to visit since 2015.

“We want to resolve a dispute with Iran but there are some security issues, our country is under tremendous stress and Iran must understand,” said Naseer Ahmad Durrani, deputy minister for agriculture, irrigation and livestock.","Mon, 16 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['afghanistans', 'water', 'dams', 'tehran', 'parched', 'drought', 'iran', 'dispute', 'afghanistan', 'helmand', 'river', 'kabul', 'officials', 'sharpens']",

After his wheat crop failed and wells dried up, Ghulam Abbas sold his animals and joined thousands of other farmers migrating to cities as Afghanistan's worst drought in living memory ravages the war-torn country.

A huge shortfall in snow and rain across much of the country over the normally wet colder months decimated the winter harvest, threatening the already precarious livelihoods of millions of farmers and sparking warnings of severe food shortages.

Like hundreds of farming families in Charkint village in the normally fertile northern province of Balkh, Abbas, 45, has moved with 11 family members to the provincial capital Mazar-i-Sharif to find work.

""I don't remember a drought as severe as this year's,"" Abbas, who has been a farmer for more than three decades, told AFP.

""We never had to leave our village or sell our animals because of a drought in the past.""

As dry conditions and high temperatures persist, there are growing concerns about the spring and summer crops that will be harvested later this year.

Afghanistan's 2018 wheat harvest is already expected to be the lowest since at least 2011, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, set up by USAID in 1985.

Faced with an estimated shortfall of 2.5 million tonnes of wheat this year, more than two million people could become ""severely food insecure"" and would be in ""desperate need"" of humanitarian assistance in the next six months, the United Nations has warned.

Tens of thousands of sheep and goats have died and many farmers have eaten the seeds for the next planting season, as rivers and wells dry up and pastures turn to dust.

""If the authorities and the international community don't step up to this challenge now, Afghanistan could face a calamity as we head into the next winter,"" UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan Toby Lanzer told AFP recently.

But thousands of farmers like Abbas have already given up hope, abandoning their land and moving their families to towns and cities to survive.

The UN estimates more than 70,000 people have been displaced to urban areas due to the drought.

""Three years ago it rained and snowed well in our village,"" Abbas said.

""The crops yielded well and I made more than 300,000 afs (afghanis, or nearly $4,300). But this year, even though I sold my sheep and goats, I made less than 100,000 afs (about $1,400).""

Not enough help

The lack of precipitation in Balkh has left most of its farming and grazing land parched, Zabiullah Zoobin, provincial director of crops and cultivation management, told AFP recently.

More than 450,000 farmers and nomadic herders in the province have slaughtered their cattle, goats and sheep, or sold them for a pittance, he added.

""All villagers are wondering what to do with their livestock and how to keep them alive because that is all they have in life,"" Haji Sorab, a sheep and goat herder in Dawlat Abad district, told AFP.

The drought adds to Afghanistan's woes as its security forces struggle to beat back Taliban and Islamic State militants, and civilian casualties remain at record levels.

Agriculture is the backbone of the Afghan economy. Nearly 15 million people are employed in the sector in the 20 provinces worst affected by the drought, according to the UN.

With already high unemployment made worse by record numbers of Afghans returning from Iran and many more internally displaced by the conflict, their chances of finding other work are grim.

Prices of sheep and goats have plunged as farmers rush to sell their animals before they become even weaker, agriculture and livestock ministry spokesman Akbar Rustami told AFP.

At the same time, the cost of fodder has soared. Rustami said most of the country's livestock are in ""urgent need of food"".

Afghan authorities have so far provided limited assistance to farmers and international aid agencies are struggling to meet the growing demand.

UN food and other assistance has reached more than 460,000 people in drought-affected provinces in recent months, Lanzer said—less than a quarter of those who need it.

An agreement between international agencies and the Afghan government to release 60,000 tonnes of wheat currently held in the country's strategic grain reserve and turn it into mineral-fortified flour will help.

""It won't be enough for what is needed, but it's a very good start,"" Lanzer said.

If much-needed aid does not reach farmers soon, more might turn to more drought-resistant crops such as opium poppies, Abbas warned.

Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of opium, despite billions of dollars being spent on counternarcotics efforts since the US-led invasion in 2001.

""A government which is hardly able to pay its soldiers to fight cannot reach out to help people in these remote areas,"" Abbas said.

""The conditions will eventually force people to turn to illegal crops.""

Torrential rainstorms have lashed drought-stricken Afghanistan in recent days, bringing widespread flooding that has killed at least five people and washed away homes including in the capital Kabul, officials said Tuesday.

While some welcomed the wet weather after the punishing dry spell of recent years, residents complained about the lack of infrastructure and government assistance to help them clear up from the deluge.

Sixteen of Afghanistan's 34 provinces were hit in the past 24 hours, destroying or damaging hundreds of houses and sweeping away livestock, said Hashmat Bahaduri, a spokesman for Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA).

Hardest hit was Herat province in western Afghanistan, where at least five people were killed when their houses collapsed, Jilani Farhad, a spokesman for the local governor said.

Officials were also searching for 17 people whose minivan was swept away by flooding in the province's Obey district late Monday, Farhad added.

""There were women and children in the vehicle, we are searching but haven't found any sign of them yet,"" he said.

Extraordinary scenes played out in the capital, where the usually parched Kabul River swelled suddenly, bursting its banks in places and swamping surrounding streets and neighbourhoods with about one metre (three feet) of water in places.

Drug addicts who normally spend their time in the riverbed or hiding under bridges could be seen openly smoking opium at street level as water swirled around them.

By Tuesday, authorities were warning locals living along the river to be prepared to evacuate their homes as water levels surged.

Bahaduri said 113 houses had already been partially or completely destroyed in Kabul.

In the capital, a university student named Mujtaba bemoaned a lack of drainage canals, but others welcomed the rain.

Years of dry weather, combined with a booming population and wasteful consumption, have drained Kabul's water basin, forcing residents to drill ever-deeper wells.

This winter saw heavy snowfall across parts of Afghanistan, which had led to flash floods in the spring melt.

Over one hundred people had been killed as of March 28 due to flooding in Afghanistan so far this year, according to ANDMA.

Description of the disaster

Afghanistan’s climate can be characterized by hot and dry summers and cold winters. Most of the annual precipitation takes place in the northern region in the form of snow. Afghanistan is highly prone to intense and recurring natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes, snow avalanches, landslides and droughts due to its geographical location and years of environmental degradation. Climate change is also posing a threat to the country’s people and ecosystems. Climate change predictions such as changing temperature and precipitation pattern might lead to extreme weather event such as drought and flash floods. Changing weather is also affecting the productivity of agriculture, of which most Afghans depend on for their livelihoods, causing food security problem. Most areas in Afghanistan have experienced between four to six consecutive seasons of far below average rainfall over the last three years. This has resulted in significant reductions in snow depths, river flows, water level in dams, water tables, and soil moistures. In July 2018, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS) reported that 22 out of 34 provinces of Afghanistan, its cumulative rain and snowfall during October 2017 to May 2018 was 30 to 60 per cent below average. These conditions have already negatively and irreversibly impacted the agricultural season in Afghanistan. In addition, due to four decades of war and lack of planned development and adequate management of natural resources, deforestation enhances the impact of dry spells and drought. Repeated cycles of drought and verging on pre-famine conditions in many areas have increased vulnerabilities, resulted in the loss of crops, livelihoods and livestock, and weakened purchasing power.

According to the data presented by OCHA on 13 September 2018, the drought affected IDPs were estimated at 266,000. 84,000 of them are settled in Herat, and 182,000 within Badghis, their province of origin. In October 2018, more than 84,000 people have been displaced to Herat city and 18,579 families (94,945 people) have been displaced to Qala-eNaw City (capital of Badghis province). IDPs are residing in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities, or in makeshift shelters within the main cities. This makes it more difficult to reach them in a smaller number of catchment areas.

Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in the northwestern provinces. Ninety-five per cent of the population there rely on agriculture, livestock and crops to survive. People have been left without enough food to feed their families. The upcoming severe winter months will likely deteriorate their situation. Temperature in these areas has already dropped close to zero degrees at night, the coming weeks will really be testing for the drought affected families with freezing conditions, potentially resulting into winter related sickness and potential deaths. On 16 October 2018 the United Nations’ Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) have released funds to support people affected by a severe drought.

The overall response in drought-affected communities has been hampered by the access restrictions caused by security concerns. Humanitarian actors, including the Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement, have had very limited access in the past three months. For instance, Ghazni City was attacked by an armed opposition group (AOG) which took control of the locality straddling the highways. An ensuing fight resulted in displacement and deaths, including of civilians. The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has reported that there were 210 civilian casualties during the month of August 2018. In addition, the RCRC Movement encountered access limitations following a declaration by an AOG in mid-August that security guarantees given to RCRC operation in Afghanistan would be withdrawn. This resulted in restricted personnel movement and reduced operational capacity pending dialogue to address concerns of the AOG. After weeks of dialogue, security guaranties to the RCRC Movement were restored on 14 October 2018. These developments have now set the pace for RCRC Movement partners to gradually resume activities, including to roll out interventions in support of communities affected by food insecurity. In this context, DREF was requested by the NS to support drought affected population in Herat and Badghis and IFRC country office launched a DREF.. Beyond that DREF support, a scaled-up response, utilizing other established resource mobilization channels, were envisioned.

Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) reports in Ocober 2018, alarmed that in the absence of adequate humanitarian assistance for drought affected communities the severity of drought is likely to be one step worst in most part of the country in coming months. Resulting in the further expansion of crises situation in north, northwest, central and south-central provinces and that started the emergency phase in northwestern provinces of the country. People in these areas were expected to face more challenges to meet their consumption requirements until the next year spring harvest. The onset of severe winter also created a large food deficit for the worst affected households, and the drought affected population is critical need of food and livelihood assistance during this lean season. Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and contributed to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households were likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter.

Households started preparing for the winter wheat planting season in October 2018. The area planted for winter wheat was anticipated to be higher than last year due to the increased likelihood of El Niño. Due to the forecasted El Niño, there was an increased likelihood of average to above-average precipitation during the 2018/19 wet season however, there remains a large spread of possible precipitation outcomes for the season.

FEWSNET projected food assistance outlook for the lean season Dec 2018 - April 2019 (issued on 30 Sep) says “Belowaverage precipitation in most areas and drought in northern parts of the country has negatively impacted wheat production, livestock body conditions, and labor opportunities. Large areas of the country are anticipated to experience Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes in February at the peak of the lean season. In the worst-off drought-affected areas,

Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes are anticipated”.

Summary of response

Overview of Host National Society

The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) remain vigilant and have been monitoring the situation since the start of dry spell. ARCS is in close coordination with Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). Observing the gravity of the situation in September and October 2018, ARCS headquarter requested all 34 provincial branches to submit primary information reports regarding drought situation in their respective provinces. ARCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to coordinate with relevant stakeholders and update on the situation on regular basis. ARCS started coordination meetings with in country movement partners, since May 2018.

Based on the primary information reports from the branches ARCS developed its draft response plan and conducted an access mapping in the affected provinces. The access mapping was shared with movement partners as well for their comments and input. ARCS is also coordinating with clusters and national disaster management authorities. ARCS has developed a very initial response plan for drought 2018 and is committed to provide humanitarian assistance in the areas where unmet emergency needs have been identified by the Inter Cluster Coordination Team (ICCT) and ARCS provincial branches. ARCS drought response plan is to meet the immediate needs of 105,000 drought affected people (15,000 families) in the areas of food, nutrition, livelihood, health, WASH and emergency shelter. Tentative timeline for ARCS drought response is one year starting from August 2018 to July 2019.

ARCS drought response plan is flexible to adapt the changing needs and access situation, two major contributors to update ARCS response plans are; continuous need assessment: needs and unmet needs are changing on ground due to evolving nature of drought and changes in available resources with humanitarian actors. Continuous Access monitoring: On ground access is frequently changing due to unpredictable security situation in the country and ongoing fight between Armed Opposition Groups (AOGs) and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).","Thu, 27 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1319794-MDRAF004dfr.png?itok=xFqM_ek7,"['situation', 'food', 'access', 'mdraf004', 'affected', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'final', 'report', 'response', 'arcs', 'dref', 'n', 'operation', 'areas']",

Three years of drought have contributed to massive crop failure, economic hardship, hunger and loss of life, and forced 266,000 people from their homes, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in a statement issued Thursday.

In the outgoing month of March, it noted, extreme weather deepened extreme hardship, when above normal rain and snow fell on soil with limited vegetation or ability to soak up the water, bringing flash floods to nine provinces in Afghanistan. The calamity killed 63 people and displaced at least 281,000 to makeshift camps with inadequate services.

Rising temperatures due to climate change are increasing the hardship for Afghans because they are leading to changes in snowmelt, and rainfall is getting more erratic, with an increased risk of floods and droughts in a country where repeated disasters and ongoing conflict have eroded the people’s capacity to cope, the agency said.

“The floods should be the wake-up call that triggers a massive investment to help people who at the moment are out of sight in an under-estimated, silent crisis with limited access by humanitarian agencies or media,” said Ariel Kestens, IFRC country chief.

“They are out of reach because of conflict and out of scope because this is a large, slow-onset disaster, and because many people in need are displaced by disaster,” Kestens added.

Aid workers note that across many parts of Afghanistan, people suffer from a lack of safe water, proper sanitation and healthcare, which contribute to catastrophic levels of malnutrition.

UN Launches Multibillion-Dollar Appeal for World's Most Vulnerable The United Nations is launching a $21.9 billion humanitarian appeal for 2019 to help nearly 94 million people in 42 countries survive conflict, hunger, homelessness, deprivation, and the impact of climate change. The United Nations said it expects its 2019 appeal will reach a record-breaking high of $25 billion after Syria's humanitarian needs are fully assessed early next year.

The United States this week also announced more than $61 million in additional humanitarian assistance for providing emergency food assistance, nutrition services, hygiene kits, safe drinking water, access to latrines and protection for people in the worst affected Afghan regions.

The U.S. has provided more than $293 million in financial relief to the crisis-hit country since the fiscal year 2018, making it the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance. Washington has recently also stepped up diplomatic efforts to seek a political settlement to the conflict with the Taliban.

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, this past Saturday began the first in a series of airlifts to western Afghanistan bringing thousands of tents for people displaced by a mix of conflict and an ongoing severe drought.

Together the drought and ongoing conflict have seen over quarter of a million Afghans being displaced in this region of the country since April.

Currently, some 220,000 families are living in makeshift shelters in the western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor. And, with winter approaching, in conditions that are increasingly desperate. Already we are seeing an increase in child deaths.

UNHCR’s airlift will comprise 12 flights in total, bringing 15,100 family size tents – with the aim of easing the plight of almost half the displaced population. The tents are being loaded in Pakistan’s Lahore and being shipped in as close as possible to the affected populations via the airport at Herat. There, ground crews have been handing them over to our partners for delivery.

The tents are part of a larger aid delivery being organized by the Afghan Government and its partners to Herat and Badghis. With many displaced having settled on private land and facing risk of eviction, UNHCR is also supporting the Government’s efforts to make land available.

More than 42,000 people have been displaced by the floods since the start of 2019. In all, 163,000 people in 16 provinces need urgent help.

In Herat, Helmand and Badghis provinces, for example, heavy rainfall triggered flash floods in March and early April, spoiling vast swatches of agricultural land. Some affected areas remain inaccessible due to roadblocks or deteriorating security conditions, preventing humanitarian agencies from providing assistance.

Sometimes we go to villages and discover that everyone has lost everything.

“Sometimes we go to villages and discover that everyone has lost everything,” says Fazl Rabi, the International Rescue Committee’s field coordinator in Herat. In the village of Shadi Bara, in Injil district, 185 of 190 families saw their homes destroyed.

In one town in Helmand, 200 of 300 families were severely affected by the flooding. Sadar Mohammad, breadwinner for his family of five, is among those receiving emergency cash from the IRC. The IRC is also providing shelter, clean water and sanitation services to more than 4,000 people in the three provinces.

“We provide tents, cash, hygiene kits—but, unfortunately, we can only assist some of those affected and hope that more funding can come to help the rest,” says Rabi.

The IRC continues to assess the needs across the country. Additional resources are urgently needed to support thousands of households during the coming months, which are expected to bring more devastating rain. Families living in camps are particularly vulnerable.

18,18,DR-2021-000022-AFG,"Afghan capital's thirsty residents dig deep to combat drought, overuse - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-water-idUSKBN1670FO,"KABUL (Reuters) - A growing population is straining water supplies in Afghanistan’s capital, forcing those who can afford it to dig unregulated wells ever deeper to tap a falling water table.

Finding water in arid Afghanistan is virtually always a challenge, but a drop in the groundwater level in Kabul caused by overuse and drought is making it even more difficult for residents, especially the poor.

Modern Kabul was originally planned to support about 1 million people, but is now home to more than 4.6 million, according to U.S. government estimates, with people fleeing violence and seeking jobs thronging into urban centers.

Several unseasonably dry winters, with little rain and a dusting of snow, have exacerbated the problem. Heavy rain and snow this year has raised hopes that groundwater can be replenished, at least for a while.

“The increase in population and drought has resulted in a shortage of water in Kabul, so more people are demanding deeper wells to get it,” said Aslam Khan, who runs a well-digging business.

Since 2001, Kabul’s sprawl has expanded by nearly 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles), according to the World Bank, with some of the poorest arrivals perched in homes on rocky hills around the city, where wells are generally non-existent.

At the base of the hills, children cluster around hand-operated pumps, filling buckets and cans before climbing back up to their homes.

“We have lots of problem in getting water,” said 15-year-old Mohammad Jaweed, bent under a load for his family.

‘NO SERIOUS ATTENTION’

People who can afford it usually dig a well rather than depending on the city’s limited water system, but they are having to go ever deeper to reach the receding water.

The depth of a well varies across the city, but Khan said many residents are being forced to dig 10 to 20 meters (32-64 feet) deeper than in the past.

In some cases, wells have to go down 150 meters (492 feet) or more to reach clean water, at a cost of more than $5,200, he said, a price out of reach of many people.

Officials say well digging has spiraled out of control, with little or no regulation of how the ever more scarce water is exploited.

Slideshow ( 6 images )

“Unfortunately there hasn’t been any serious attention to this,” said Hamidullah Yelani, director general of the government’s Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation.

In the past, residents have been banned from digging wells within 100 meters (328 feet) of each other, but wells are now routinely dug 5 to 10 meters (16-32 feet) apart, sucking ever more water from the aquifers, said Khan.

Yelani said the government was looking to implement a licensing system. The ministry of water and power did not respond to requests for comment.

Poor residents are not optimistic authorities will get a grip on the problem, at least in a way that will help them get better access.

“The government mustn’t allow people to dig deep wells because it has caused many problems,” said Mohammad Karim, 60, who said he was too old to carry water up to his home on a hill.

About 223,000 people have been uprooted from their homes in the drought-hit western provinces of Herat, Badghis and Ghor this year, according to the U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF).

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Afghan families have been skipping meals, selling off livestock and moving to cities where it is easier to access aid and services.

Some displaced families are taking even more drastic measures, according to UNICEF, which documented 161 child betrothals or marriages in Herat and Badghis between July and October. Of those, 155 were girls and six were boys.

“The drought is the worst in decades,” UNICEF spokeswoman Alison Parker told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

“Children are becoming the collateral.”

Families receive a bride price that can ease their financial woes, having lost their livelihoods and assets, said Parker.

Many drought-hit families have had to borrow money to pay for transport, food or healthcare, the United Nations said.

The charity World Vision reported that half of households it surveyed in Badghis in September said child marriage was a measure taken to put food on the table in times of drought.

About 11 million people - almost half of Afghanistan’s rural population - will be facing “severe acute food insecurity” until February, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system used by charities to measure hunger.

“Years of civil conflict and instability as well as the severely degraded condition of much of the land have compounded the impacts of the drought,” said an IPC report from August.

In addition to those forced by drought to leave their homes, conflict between the government and an array of armed groups, including the Taliban, has uprooted at least 282,000 people so far this year, according to the United Nations.

The 17-year war has also devastated Afghanistan’s education system, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, an alliance of aid agencies that includes UNICEF and Save the Children.

With a rising number of attacks on schools, teachers and students, the number of children who are not in education is increasing for the first time since 2002, the agencies said.","Tue, 27 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['afghans', 'food', 'marry', 'drives', 'afghanistans', 'badghis', 'drought', 'united', 'families', 'homes', 'according', 'education', 'unicef', 'children', 'money', 'desperate']",

The IFRC last week issued an emergency grant of humanitarian cash of just over US$ 250,000 to help the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) tackle the consequences of four consecutive years of drought and prepare for an expected increase in needs this winter.



Fourteen-thousand of the worst-affected people in north-west Herat and Badghis provinces will be helped by the from the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund in an operation due to last at least until March.



It complements an existing ARCS plan to meet the immediate needs of 15,000 families for food, livelihoods, health, water and sanitation.



The ICRC last month welcomed the renewal of security guarantees in Afghanistan that will enable it and Movement partners to continue to reach people in need, including the many thousands who are internally displaced.



The IFRC on Thursday said a combination of below-average rainfall and above-average temperatures since last October had reduced snow, river levels and water tables, “negatively and irreversibly” affecting the most recent two harvests.



‘Increased needs’



It added: “Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in the north-western provinces,” where almost all the population depend on livestock and rain-fed crops.



The IFRC quoted UN country data as showing that the number of people displaced by drought in western Afghanistan and mostly forced to take refuge in the Herat and Badghis provincial capitals had reached 266,000 in September.



“Temperatures in these areas has already dropped close to zero degrees at night,” the International Federation says, and “the coming weeks will really be testing for drought-affected families with freezing conditions potentially resulting in [sickness and death].”



Households have started preparing to plant winter wheat, and because of the current forecast likelihood of El Niño – associated with wetter than average conditions in most of Afghanistan – the “area planted…is anticipated to be higher than last year,” the IFRC says. But it adds that “there remains a large spread of possible precipitation outcomes for the season.”



The latest sitrep from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, cited by the IFRC, says that amid the drought, “Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rain-fed staple [crop] performance, and will contribute to increased food-assistance needs as compared to recent years.”



The latest FEWSNET chart for October to January 2019 shows several areas of Badghis and Faryab provinces in red for emergency status.



Conflict-climate



Climate Centre Director Maarten van Aalst writes: Scientists say that for obvious reasons there is an acute shortage of data in Afghanistan that might help them determine whether any long-term climate-related trends exist in droughts or precipitation.



But some climate models indicate up to a 10 per cent decrease in precipitation in the future in parts of the country, and higher average temperatures would also mean less snow in winter and hence less water after the thaw.



In any case, the experience of the last few years in Afghanistan demonstrates that we need to raise our game on managing extremes and be prepared to deal with growing uncertainties.



The humanitarian system is rising to the challenge through, for example, the Afghan Red Crescent’s current drought-response plan that is flexible enough to adapt both to changing needs and security constraints.



It’s also worth noting that although this is not an FbF operation, the DREF was expanded earlier this year to include a window for forecast-based financing that could include droughts.



Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in north-western provinces.

Description of the disaster

Below average precipitation and above average temperatures since October 2017 have resulted in significant reductions in (1) snow depths, (2) river flows, (3) water level in dams, (4) water tables, and (5) soil moistures. These conditions have already negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter 2017–2018 and spring/summer 2018 agricultural season in Afghanistan. According to the data presented by OCHA to the latest Humanitarian Country Team meeting on 13 September 2018, the drought affected IDPs are estimated at 266,000. 84,000 of them have settled in Herat, and 182,000 within Badghis, their province of origin. In the last month alone, more than 84,000 people have been displaced to Herat city and 18,579 families (94,945 people) have been displaced to Qala-e-Naw City (capital of Badghis province). IDPs are residing in dozens of sites on the outskirts of the cities, or in makeshift shelters within the main cities. This makes it more difficult to reach them in a smaller number of catchment areas.

Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for millions of Afghans in the northwestern provinces.

Ninety-five per cent of the population there rely on agriculture, livestock and crops to survive. People have been left without enough food to feed their families. The upcoming severe winter months will likely deteriorate their situation.

Temperature in these areas has already dropped close to zero degrees at night, the coming weeks will really be testing for the drought affected families with freezing conditions, potentially resulting into winter related sickness and potential deaths. On 16 October 2018 the United Nations’ Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) and Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) have released funds to support people affected by a severe drought.

The overall response in drought-affected communities has been hampered by the access restrictions caused by security concerns. Humanitarian actors, including the Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement, have had very limited access in the past three months. For instance, Ghazni City was attacked by an armed opposition group (AOG) which took control of the locality straddling the highways. An ensuing fight resulted in displacement and deaths, including of civilians.

The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has reported that there were 210 civilian casualties during the period 10 August to 15 August. In addition, the RCRC Movement encountered access limitations following a declaration by an AOG in mid-August that security guarantees given to RCRC operation in Afghanistan would be withdrawn. This resulted in restricted personnel movement and reduced operational capacity pending dialogue to address concerns of the AOG. After weeks of dialogue, security guaranties to the RCRC Movement were restored on 14 October 2018.

These developments have now set the pace for RCRC Movement partners to gradually resume activities, including to roll out interventions in support of communities affected by food insecurity. It is in this context that this DREF request is being submitted. Beyond that DREF support, a scaled-up response, utilizing other established resource mobilization channels, is envisioned.

The latest reports from Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) alarming that in the absence of adequate humanitarian assistance for drought affected communities the severity of drought is likely to be one step worst in most of the country. Resulting in the further expansion of crises situation in north, northwest, central and south-central provinces and start of emergency phase in northwestern provinces of the country. People in these areas are expected to face more challenges to meet their consumption requirements until the next year spring harvest. The onset of severe winter will also create a large food deficit for the worst affected households.

Though there are positive signs in terms of area planted for winter wheat is anticipated to be higher than last year due to the increased likelihood of El Niño. Government and organizations are also encouraging households to start preparing for winter panting season. However, the drought affected population is critical need of food and livelihood assistance during this lean season.

Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are present throughout Afghanistan due to declining purchasing power, disruption of normal livelihoods due to conflict, and poor rainfed staple performance and will contribute to the increased food assistance needs as compared to recent years. Poor household dependent on rainfed wheat production, particularly in northern, northeastern, and northwestern areas, are expected to experience difficulty meeting consumption requirements until next year’s spring harvest. The worst-affected households will likely experience Emergency (IPC Phase 4) as large food deficits emerge with the onset of winter.

Households have started preparing for the winter wheat planting season, likely starting in October. The area planted for winter wheat is anticipated to be higher than last year due to the increased likelihood of El Niño. Due to the forecasted El Niño, there is an increased likelihood of average to above-average precipitation during the 2018/19 wet season however, there remains a large spread of possible precipitation outcomes for the season.","Fri, 02 Nov 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1192163-MDRAF004do.png?itok=Lkp96zdG,"['food', 'likely', 'mdraf004', 'affected', 'epoa', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'season', 'movement', 'plan', 'wheat', 'dref', 'rcrc', 'winter', 'action', 'n', 'emergency']",

It wasn’t the fighting, though, that forced him leave his home in western Afghanistan.

Instead, he is seeking shelter from a devastating drought that has ruined his livelihood.

A prolonged lack of rain and dissipating groundwater destroyed his fields and killed his livestock, prompting Qayoom to move with his wife and their eight children to the western city of Herat from their village in neighboring Badghis Province.

Speaking with Radio Free Afghanistan from his temporary home in Dasht-e Shaidayee on the outskirts of Herat, he described how the drought disrupted their lives and eventually forced them to leave their village, Sharshar.

“We were forced to leave because there was no water. All wells and the springs dried up,” he said. “We could not farm our lands because of the lack of rain. I had cows and sheep, but they died because there was no grass or pasture.”

When the cattle began to die, the price per cow dropped from $1,400 to just under $300, and it was difficult to find a buyer for a sheep for under $30.

Qayoom is one of the 5,000 families that local authorities say have sought refuge in Herat during the past month. All fled their villages in the nearby provinces of Badghis, Ghor, and Faryab.

Just recently a UN office warned that this year’s drought has affected Afghanistan’s 20 provinces including Badghis, Uruzgan, and Jawzjan.

In its report released in May, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) said that “this drought will have a particularly detrimental effect on already chronically food insecure farming households.”

UNOCHA estimates that out of approximately 2.2 million people affected by the drought, at least 1.4 million will become acutely food insecure. They will require emergency assistance over the coming months and into the next lean season, the report said.

“We are concerned that the poorest cohort of Afghan society, particularly those already displaced by conflict, will be worst affected,” said Christopher Nyamandi, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) country director in Afghanistan.

“Displaced people affected by the drought are prevented from reaching markets and aid due to the ongoing armed conflict,” he added.

A survey conducted by the NRC in January found that “one in two displaced Afghans said they could not adequately feed their families and were often skipping meals.” This figure is an increase from one in three six years ago.

A June 4 statement by the NRC noted that regional differences are stark. “One in four respondents in conflict-affected [southern] Kandahar and [eastern] Nangarhar provinces say they had suffered hunger over the past year, compared with one in six in Kabul,” it said.

Janan Kochi is a nomad and a livestock herder in Charchino district of southern Uruzgan Province. Speaking with Radio Free Afghanistan, he said nomads have been devastated by this year's drought.

“The Kochis have been affected very badly,” he said. “We spent the winter and spring without rain. There is no grass in the mountains nor in the desserts.”

In northern Jawzjan Province, residents have similar concerns.

Shukrullah, 50, a local farmer, has been recently displaced from the Qush-Teppa district. He now lives in a rundown house in the provincial capital, Sheberghan, together with his wife and their five daughters.

“We planted some 700 kilograms of wheat seeds, but our crop was destroyed by a lack of rain,” he said. “I lost my cows, sheep, and chickens, as well, which prompted me to move to the city.”

Najib Aqa Fahim, head of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, says his country is experiencing the peak of a drought.

“Thirteen million Afghans in 20 provinces [out of a total 34] are affected by drought,” he told journalists on June 3. “Out of these, 1 million people and 3 million livestock are in urgent need of food and water.”

Earlier, the Afghan Agriculture and Livestock Ministry said it is working on a $100 million plan to help the drought-stricken communities during the next two months.

Despite these pledges, Qayoom says his family has received little assistance.

“All I need is food and a shelter to live my life. I just don’t want to die from hunger and the hot weather,” he said.","Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/C54D0E2A-D05F-45F6-BECB-4D1395450BAB_w1200_r1.png,"['sheep', 'food', 'livestock', 'hit', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'affected', 'nrc', 'twothirds', 'provinces', 'rain', 'qayoom']",

Reports from the U.N. and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow following crop failures in some areas and livestock dying for the want of anything to eat.

Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 percent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.

In a regular update, the U.N. humanitarian office reported that 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in Qala-e-Naw city in Badghis province in the week to Sept. 9.

A second U.N. report, with data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month. It estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.

In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.

The U.N. cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International that 99 percent of people in Badghis said their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.

""The assessment also indicates that most farmers lost last season's harvest and nearly all of them lack seeds for new planting season,"" the U.N. report said, noting reports that about 40 per cent of livestock has been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder.

The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a U.S. funded food security monitoring service, said in a report on Aug. 31 that the number of Afghans in a food ""crisis"" was atypically high.

""Crisis"" is step three on a five step scale, where four is ""emergency"" and five is ""catastrophe"" and possible famine.

In Badghis and Faryab provinces, emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in January, FEWS NET said.

""Normally during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labor opportunities, and continued conflict more households face Crisis outcomes than normal,"" it said.","Tue, 11 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/3B607D63-BA5B-45D9-9D0E-0512E1AF822B.jpg,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'food', 'step', 'badghis', 'drought', 'million', 'worse', 'seeds', 'conflict', 'report', 'aid', 'outcomes']",

Twice a week, Farid Rahimi gets up at dawn, wraps a blanket around his shoulders to keep warm, gathers his empty jerrycans, and waits beside the tap outside his house in a hillside neighbourhood above Kabul.

At 7am sharp, water bursts from the pipes, filling Rahimi’s tank and buckets. He labours away, saving every drop until – just an hour later – the last drop falls.

“We can’t afford to miss it,” said the 35-year-old. “It’s barely enough.“

Afghanistan’s capital is running dry – its groundwater levels depleted by an expanding population and the long-term impacts of climate change. But its teeming informal settlements continue to grow as decades-long conflict and – more recently – drought drive people like Rahimi into the cities, straining already scarce water supplies.

With large numbers migrating to Kabul, the city’s resources are overstretched and aid agencies and the government are facing a new problem: how to adjust to a shifting population still dependent on some form of humanitarian assistance.

e21b5337_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Farid Rahimi prepares to fill jerrycans with water. His family has access to clean drinking water twice a week for only an hour. Rahimi fills up every available bucket and jerrycan to make sure the water lasts through the rest of the week.

Rahimi came to Kabul nine years ago to find safety and better job opportunities, but he says it hasn’t been easy. He now shares his house with 12 family members and each month he pays a steep 1,500 Afghani, or $20, for water from a private company.

“Last year we shut down our well,” Rahimi said. “There wasn’t any water left. A few years ago, the situation was a lot better.”

On the move

The UN says more than half a million people in Afghanistan were forced to leave their homes in 2018 due to conflict and drought. An even greater number of Afghans, more than 800,000, returned from Pakistan and Iran during the same year. About seven percent of Kabul’s population are either displaced by war or returnees who previously fled the country, according to estimates from the UN’s migration agency, IOM.

The majority migrate toward cities, which are now home to one third of Afghanistan’s population of 36 million. According to UN Habitat, 80 percent of urban areas in Kabul are informal settlements.

e21b4210_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Kabul’s outskirts are home to informal settlements where the majority of residents are people displaced from the countryside by fighting and drought. While some families arrived in recent months, others have lived in these settlements for years.

In Rahimi’s case this means that a muddy, unpaved road winds its way through his neighbourhood and up an overpopulated hill, where simple mud or concrete houses have been built on “grab land”, claimed by those who arrived in Kabul over the past decade without initially registering or even purchasing the property. Electricity is available sporadically, while health facilities and schools are either absent or far away. A private company is in the process of installing water pipes throughout the neighbourhood, but most public services are yet to be provided by the government.

But when people from rural areas leave their homes for the cities, they may also leave behind the humanitarian aid they had previously relied on.

Pir Mohammed arrived in Kabul five months ago, escaping violence and bombings in his native Helmand province, a Taliban heartland in southern Afghanistan.

The 35-year-old had hoped the move would make his life safer and easier. But the family lives in a tent in the middle of Afghanistan’s bitter winter; his cousin has pneumonia.

“It’s just so cold. In Helmand, we received some assistance. Here, we were told the government would help us, but nothing has happened so far,” Mohammed said, while digging a trench outside his shelter to prevent water from leaking into the tent.

e21b4661_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN Pir Mohammed shovels dirt in front of his cousin's tent. His family arrived in Kabul five months ago, fleeing fighting and air strikes in Helmand province. He says it’s safer in Kabul, but he can’t access the humanitarian aid he relied on back home.

Much of the snow falling onto the family’s home is melted and used as drinking water. The current winter has been harsh, with temperatures dropping well below zero most nights.

Rethinking aid

Alison Parker, UNICEF’s communications chief, said the urban shift means aid groups must also rethink how to help people who may still need assistance in the cities.

“Rurally, it’s easier because you engage with communities at the local level. In Kabul, we need to engage with the government and other actors,” Parker said. “It needs a shift in thought and more players need to be on board.”

Yet city planning and humanitarian work often do not go hand in hand, says the city’s deputy mayor, Shoaib Rahim. “Humanitarian services are meeting immediate needs, but urban planning is for the long term,” he said.

While aid agencies do provide some services in urban areas, especially in places where newly displaced people have settled, both private companies and the government take up large – yet still insufficient – chunks of the work.

“Aid professionals often distinguish between humanitarian work and development, but they are intertwined,” said Oxfam Afghanistan country director Ruby Ajanee.

The majority of former refugees and asylum seekers returning from abroad, for example, settle in urban areas, where they may need both short-term aid and and more long-lasting help.

“While their immediate needs for food and shelter are addressed by humanitarian agencies, the long-term development needs of reintegration are addressed by the development agencies, with often a disconnect from the humanitarian agencies,” Ajanee said. “These two sectors have to work together seamlessly where humanitarian effort is linked with development work.”

Rainfall patterns

Comparatively, urban residents are still better off than their rural counterparts. The proportion of people with access to basic water is 63 percent countrywide – 89 percent for the urban population and 53 percent for rural households, according to UNICEF. But migration patterns and a changing climate point to long-term strains on water supplies.

e21b5657_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN A man draws water from a public pump in Kabul. Many households lack access to water in their homes, and groundwater levels have been depleted in recent years.

Afghanistan is one of the world’s top eight countries affected by climate change-induced water shortages, says Paulos Workneh, who heads the water, sanitation and hygiene programme for UNICEF in Afghanistan. As groundwater deteriorates, city dwellers are robbed of their main source of clean water.

“Most of Kabul’s water was accessed through wells, but the situation is now under stress,” Workneh said. “Surface water is polluted by industrial waste, pit latrines and chemicals leaping into the rivers. With rainfall patterns decreasing, sources don’t fill up as quickly anymore.”

While Kabul is starting to tackle the issue of informally built properties – including the registration of many houses initially constructed without permission – one fact remains: the capital grew too quickly.

“The city had 4.6 million people in 2002 and, by 2012, the numbers went up to 7.1 million,” said Koussay Boulaich of UN Habitat, which is offering technical support to a government project responding to the city’s urbanisation trend.

By 2050, one in two Afghans will live in cities, Boulaich said. A similar shift will be needed among the many humanitarian and development groups now concentrating their work in Afghanistan’s rural areas.

“Imagine how important the correlation between urbanisation and development is,” Boulaich said. “In some areas, humanitarian and development work merge, supporting the government in providing long-term sustainable solutions, and urbanisation has to be one of these areas.”

e21b5353_1920.jpg Stefanie Glinski/IRIN A private company has started drilling and construction for new water pipes in this Kabul neighbourhood. Informally built homes line the hillsides in the background.

Reverse city planning

One of the government’s programmes for urban development, including water, is its “City for All” scheme, which aims to turn the country’s urban migration into economic growth, increase living standards, and even contribute to peace. As part of the plan, informal areas in Kabul are now being registered, roads are being built, and water systems are being set up slowly, with technical help from international agencies.

Mohammed Atik, 60, lives in a Kabul neighbourhood currently undergoing development.

“The government has built the pipes in our area. There are none in my house yet, but I do see progress,” he said.

For now, however, his household well has dried up. He gets water for his family only by filling up buckets at a neighbour’s house, and he’s worried what will happen if this supply also evaporates.

“I just hope we don't run further out of water,” Atik said. “We’re already using a lot less than a few years ago.”

In Rahimi’s hillside neighbourhood, the government has promised to pave the road in the coming months, while mainly private companies supply the available water.

Merza Mohammed, a 42-year-old employee with Absharan Tagyet, the company laying pipes down Rahimi’s street, said the new infrastructure will serve roughly 1,300 households – though at a price more expensive than the city government’s standard rates.

“We’re a local business supplying areas that the government has not yet reached,” he said.

A few years ago, water was more widely available throughout the city. But prices have more than doubled, he said.

“Today, we’re scrambling. Water is becoming a pricey commodity in Afghanistan.”

The EA was issued in March and was later revised on 10 May 2019 to extend the operation in four new provinces affected by the floods while maintaining the operation end date of 31 March 2020. The revision was also required to ensure that the planned programmes remain coherent and relevant to the current situation and for the longer term. The sectors covered under the EA are Shelter; Livelihoods and basic needs; Health; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Protection, Gender and Inclusion (PGI).

Six months on, the Emergency Appeal is at 47 per cent coverage which resulted in some key sectoral areas of activities being partially covered or not covered at all due to budget limitations.

Wheat and opium farmer Murad Khan Ishaqzai, 80, has never seen a drought as bad as the one ravaging western Afghanistan where more than 250,000 people have been forced to abandon their homes.

After his crops dried up in Gormach district of Badghis province earlier this year, Ishaqzai rented a truck and drove his family hundreds of kilometres through Taliban-infested areas to the neighbouring province of Herat.

There, he and his family of seven took refuge in a squalid camp on the rocky outskirts of the provincial capital where aid agencies are struggling to meet growing demand for food, shelter and sanitation.

""The farms were destroyed, our livestock perished, and we left our donkeys in the desert because we couldn't feed them any more,"" said Ishaqzai, his face weather-beaten by a lifetime of working in his field.

It was only the second time in his life that drought had forced him to leave his land.

But with Afghanistan ranked as one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, it may not be the last.

""It's the worst drought I have seen,"" Ishaqzai told AFP in August.

""We had a lot of opium and wheat—we lost them.

""The land dried up and we didn't have enough to eat.""

The United Nations warned in October that at least three million people were in ""urgent"" need of food due to the dry spell mainly across northern and western Afghanistan, and could face famine if they do not get help.

Conditions are miserable in the camps where families displaced by the drought have settled as temperatures drop across the country.

Ishaqzai is relatively lucky. He and his family have a canvas tent provided by an international humanitarian group. Others are living in pitiful, makeshift tents that offer little or no protection against the cold and rain.

With these funds, 7 national NGOs, 15 international NGOs and 4 UN agencies will distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelter, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock.

“The impact of the ongoing drought spans the north and west of the country leaving communities in deep distress. Village elders in rural areas tell me that this is the worst drought in their lifetime, and that food, fodder and seeds are needed urgently,” said Toby Lanzer, Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan. “The drought has forced a quarter of a million people from their land, and for the displaced, the need for shelter is critical as winter approaches.”

“The drought comes on top of years of conflict and poverty, and therefore humanitarian assistance goes hand in hand with development programmes to address underlying factors such as poverty and climate change. Our work is closely coordinated with the authorities, yet still more needs to be done so the people of Afghanistan can withstand severe shocks such as this drought.”

The CERF is a global fund managed by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator. The AHF is one of currently 18 country-based pooled funds. Managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs on behalf of the Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan, it plays a vital role in ensuring an effective, coordinated, and prioritized humanitarian response, providing funding to international and national NGOs, and UN agencies.

Since the start of 2018, the AHF allocated $47.7 million in contributions, thanks to the generous support of Australia, Denmark, Norway, Qatar, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations Foundation.

At the same time, humanitarian assistance is being reduced and stores of water are running out.

People fled their villages in the provinces of Herat, Faryab, Badghis, and Ghor in northwestern Afghanistan last year during a severe drought and increased fighting between armed opposition groups and Afghan security forces. One year on, the drought is over but continuing insecurity makes it impossible to return to their homes.

“In summer, the displaced people have no protection from the sun other than their tents, set up on the bare land of the Herat settlements,” says Raphaël Torlach, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) project coordinator in Herat. “Their water supply is inadequate, and their access to health care and basic services is very limited. We are very concerned that humanitarian assistance is being reduced and that it may not be sustained.”

MSF is increasing its medical services at a clinic in Kahdistan, a camp near Herat city, and is calling for assistance from other humanitarian actors.

Dwindling supplies

The displaced people have had insufficient food, water, sanitation, and health care since they first sought shelter outside Herat city, but a reduction in the water supply in recent weeks has seen people begging for water in the neighborhood in order to drink and wash.

“We are struggling to survive amid all these hardships,” says Mohammad, who fled his village in Faryab province one year ago because of constant fighting on his land. “I’ve never ever had such a bad time in my whole life. We have no income, no shelter, everyone is sick, the weather is hot, and we don't have drinking water.”

After Mohammad’s two-year-old son developed a fever, stomach pains, and a rash on his tongue, he brought the child to MSF’s clinic in Kahdistan. MSF has been running the clinic since last December to provide basic health care, including vaccinations and screening and treatment for malnutrition. MSF also has an ambulance to transport people to hospitals for specialized care.

“During the winter, most of our patients came to the clinic for respiratory diseases,” says MSF doctor Hazada Barez. “But now that the weather is getting hot, people are suffering from digestive system disorders, like diarrhea and vomiting. Our patients’ medical conditions are related to poor sanitation, a lack of clean drinking water, and having no protection against insect bites.”

Stranded in desperate conditions

Despite the increasingly desperate conditions in the settlements, the displaced people are unable to return home because of the ongoing conflict. “The road in our area is blocked,” says Delaram, a 40-year-old woman who fled Badghis province with her family 11 months ago. “Once it is reopened, we will return. But for now, this is impossible.”

MSF runs six projects in Afghanistan’s Kabul, Helmand, Kandahar, Herat, Khost, and Kunduz provinces. In addition to its mobile clinic for displaced people in Kahdistan, Herat province, MSF also supports the Ministry of Public Health staff in the Emergency Department in Herat Regional Hospital, especially with triage and management of critical cases.

In 2018, MSF teams provided nearly 140,000 outpatient consultations, assisted 74,600 deliveries, and performed more than 11,400 surgical interventions in Afghanistan. We do not accept funding from any government and instead rely solely on donations from private individuals and foundations for our operations in Afghanistan.","Mon, 22 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/MSF278645.jpg?itok=i2XY2TzB,"['war', 'displaced', 'water', 'msf', 'summer', 'return', 'drought', 'uprooted', 'afghanistan', 'threatens', 'province', 'clinic', 'heat', 'health', 'herat', 'kahdistan']",

Large swathes of Afghanistan have for nearly half a year been gripped by drought, forcing more than 130,000 people from their homes in search of food and water, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Some observers are beginning to sound the alarm on what could be a humanitarian catastrophe. Muhammad Omaid, a resident of Kandahar, told The Media Line that people in the region are drinking dirty water out of desperation and getting sick.

However, government officials and NGOs are not yet hitting the panic button. “It is a bit too early to make drastic statements about the drought, although the predictions so far are indeed that it could be worse than those past,” Zlatan Milisic, Afghanistan Director of the United Nations’ World Food Program (WFP), asserted to The Media Line.

He emphasized that the government for the first time in its history has given food to the WFP so the agency can assist with distribution services. Kabul also has appointed farm leaders and other community heads to help inform local growers on how to develop ways of minimizing the impact of the drought in areas controlled by hostile groups.

The government views the farmers, many of whom are educated and own property, as invaluable partners in the current water crisis. They provide government officials with much-needed information about far-flung areas. For example, the government is working with them to prepare seeds that can be planted when more rain is predicted. It is also enlisting the help of UN researchers to develop ways to weather future droughts.

“Afghanistan goes through a continuous cycle of three or four years with white, snow-capped mountains across the country, and three or four years of water shortages,” Hamdullah Amdare, Afghanistan’s acting Deputy Minister of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock, explained to The Media Line. He added that this cycle could bring more snow and hence more water soon, thereby ending the drought.

“We really need to wait for next year. If it continues then, of course, this could become a big disaster because this year we had limited dry-land agriculture,” Amdare elaborated. He stressed that the severity of the drought, while not yet a year-long, has not been experienced in many years.

“Next we will be focusing more on irrigation, as this is the next big issue.”

Philippe Kropf, OCHA’s public information officer, told The Media Line that most of those who left their homes were from rural areas. “They are now taking up temporary residence in makeshift sites in urban centers.”

According to OCHA’s Afghanistan Humanitarian Bulletin “many affected families are living on one meal a day, consisting only of bread and water.”

Agencies, Kropf expounded, are presently collecting data on emergency food needs that will give the WFP a better idea of the extent of the drought in different areas of the country. Farmers are acutely feeling the water shortage because this time of year is usually harvest time. But the lack of rain has decimated typical yields.

Other factors are making this drought worse than previous dry spells. Ongoing Afghan anti-terrorism operations have made it harder for government and UN personnel to reach remotes areas most affected by the drought.

As for now, Kandahar resident Omaid believes the government is doing all it can given its limited resources and the breadth of the water shortages. Nevertheless, he concluded, “at this point people are shocked and very worried about how long this drought will last; they are suffering a lot.”

The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) is coordinating closely with Afghanistan authorities, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), other Movement partners with incountry presence, and humanitarian actors regarding potential humanitarian intervention. As of now, no external assistance is determined yet.

The situation

After decades of conflict, the current intensification of fighting and growing insecurity are hampering the Afghan population to have access to humanitarian aid and essential services. In the current unstable and volatile context, the civilian population is paying the highest toll of the protracted conflict in Afghanistan. On top of the conflict related humanitarian needs, below average precipitation and above average temperatures since October 2017 have resulted in significant reductions in snow depths, river flows, water level in dams, water tables and soil moistures. These conditions have negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter of 2017-2018 agricultural season and are expected to also negatively impact the spring and summer of 2018 agricultural season in Afghanistan.

Cumulative precipitation for the season through February 2018 was well below average in most areas, with record low snow accumulation in some basins. Moderate (50-100 mm) to locally heavy (200-300 mm) precipitation occurred over central, north-western, and eastern parts of the country during the months of March and April. However, cumulative seasonal precipitation deficits remain significant in most areas, especially in the north and southwestern parts of the country. Despite increased precipitation in March and April, initial estimates from field reports indicate that area planted for rainfed wheat is smaller than last year, reflecting dry soil conditions and the use of extended areas for grazing.

The overall combined effect is a significant shortage of water for rain-fed agriculture, irrigated agriculture, and pasturage. Based on satellite imagery and data analyses by Information Management and Mine Action Programs (IMMAP) and Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET), combined with observations by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP), this shortage could affect up to 2 million rural population in 20 provinces who are reliant on agriculture, livestock, or agriculture-related wage labor for their food security and livelihood.

Forecasts indicate below-average to average precipitation for the remaining weeks of the spring wet season. Along with cumulative precipitation deficits, the below-average forecast is reflective of a low frequency of storms entering the region, increasing the risk for extended periods of dryness that could further impact agricultural production.

Livestock products are major source of nutritious food and income for vulnerable farmers especially women headed households. As it is difficult for people to maintain livestock in absence of fodder and water, livestock production has gone down and livestock sale prices have decreased on average between 20-30 per cent since October 2017. Concurrently, agricultural labour opportunities have declined, and combined with increasing migration of rural workers, have resulted in reduced casual labour wages throughout the country. Limited or no harvest and reduced livestock production can lead to food insecurity and reduced income for those households that are reliant on agriculture. Monitoring of the situation should start immediately and continued during winter 2018 to avoid asset depletion migration and malnutrition.

The latest figure published on 1 May from Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) shows that around 1.9 million people in 20 provinces (Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Samangan, Daykundi, Saripul, Badakshan, Baghlan, Kunduz, Takhar, Nuristan Badghis, Farah, Ghor, Herat, Helmand, Kandahar, Nimroz, Uruzgan and Zabul) are affected by the prevailing drought conditions. The map of the 20 affected areas is as shown in Figure 1.

Badghis, Balkh, Faryab, Jawzjan, Hilmand, Nimroz, Uruzgan, Kubduz, Takhar, Herat, Ghor and Farah are among the worst affected provinces. The population in these dry spells affected provinces, which are most ikely to need support in the areas of nutrition and food security, water and sanitation, emergency shelter and non-food items.

The Government of Afghanistan requested the international community’s support in mid-April 2018. A technical committee composed of the Ministry of Relief & Rural Development (MRRD), Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Independent Directorate of Local Governance (IDLG), ARCS, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA), Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC), WASH, and nutrition clusters has been established to develop a detailed response plan. According to MAIL available data and field observations, lifesaving and agriculture livestock protection needs are massive across the country. The government launched a USD 100 million appeal in mid-April through MAIL for immediate livestock protection for an initial two months of assistance for fodder/feed support and an overall demand of USD 550 million for a 10 months fodder / feed support throughout the 34 provinces of Afghanistan.","Wed, 16 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1095389-IBAFdr160518.png?itok=qQlB2FJp,"['bulletin', 'food', 'water', 'livestock', 'precipitation', 'support', 'information', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'provinces', 'humanitarian', 'n', 'agriculture', 'average', 'areas']",

The operation focuses on the following sectors: shelter; health and care; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and livelihoods and basic needs; disaster risk reduction (DRR) and strengthening the capacity of the National Society. This revised Appeal results in a funding gap1 of 4.6 million Swiss francs based on an increased number of beneficiaries, an increase in activities and an enlarged geographic scope (to support four additional provinces affected by flash floods in late March 2019). The planned response reflects the current situation and information currently available. It is likely to be adjusted based on further developments and ongoing detailed assessments.

The disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date

April 2018: The government of Afghanistan declared a drought in mid-April and requested the international community support to drought affected population in Afghanistan.

May 2018: The long dry spell exacerbated drought conditions, leading to reduced pasture land, water shortages, and deaths of livestock, increasing the number of acutely food insecure people to emergency levels, with 2.2 million people in need at this time. IFRC released Information bulletin no. 1 on the crisis and ARCS’s response.

November 2018: The Afghan Government Chief Executive Officer stated that more than 3.6 million people were severely affected by drought in 22 out of 34 provinces of Afghanistan. Agriculture and related sectors are under threat from extreme weather events, as demonstrated by the current drought that leads to land degradation and desertification, causing lower production, food insecurity, economic degradation, displacement and loss of lives.

November 2018: Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) allocated CHF265,185 to support ARCS’s response to the drought through the provision of food assistance to 14,000 people (2,000 households) while an emergency need assessment, was being carried out. The DREF operation ended on 31 March 2019.

December 2018: IFRC Surge Capacity deployed to support ARCS for Emergency Need Assessment of drought affected areas.

March 2019: The climatic context changed with heavy precipitation and snow fall in about 16 provinces across the country, resulting in flash floods and affecting more than 250,000 people, resulting in damages in nine provinces, with additional floods anticipated in seven other provinces.

March 2019: The government of Afghanistan established a command and control center under the supervision of Minister of State for Disaster Management, for coordination and to assist flood affectees. The government included civil and military departments from the country and in order to better respond to the needs of the flood affected population in provinces, organized by the Chief Executive Officer.

March 2019: Emergency Appeal launched on 13 March 2019, with DREF allocation of CHF 400,000.

May 2019: Revised Emergency Appeal launched on 10 May 2019 to include four new provinces affected by spring floods in late March, with second DREF allocation of CHF 350,000. Total DREF allocated is now CHF 750,000.","Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1292438-MDRAF005rea.png?itok=7dpjWIcq,"['revised', 'support', 'affected', 'drought', 'appeal', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'mdraf005', 'flash', '2018', 'provinces', 'response', 'dref', '2019', 'red', 'n', 'emergency']",

(This personal story was one of three told to Gorata Fembo published by the IFRC’s Asia-Pacific regional office in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. It graphically illustrates what has become known as the ‘climate-conflict nexus’ that was the focus of the policy round table in The Hague last week.)



Shamsia Atayee, 35, is five months pregnant but hardly shows it. When she’s congratulated on her pregnancy, she forces a polite smile and says “thankyou’’ in a low tone.



“I would not wish a sixth child on anyone, certainly not in the state of poverty I am in.



“If it was by choice, I wouldn’t have fallen pregnant because we hardly survive. We have to borrow money for food.”

‘Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight.

Now since the drought and conflict

everything is destroyed’

Drought and conflict robbed her family of a good life in Baghlan province. “My family’s income was reliant on crops and farming, as my husband used to grow and sell vegetables.



“On a week’s sale we could make enough to sustain the family’s food supply for a month, and we could buy clothes for our children and keep them warm during the cold winter.



“The drought has finished all our livestock; now it’s killing people. As our livestock died and our stored food ran out, we had nothing to live for in Baghlan.



“Conflict contributed to our hunger. We were tormented by the frequent exchange of firearms and explosions. We couldn’t go out to take care of our livestock.



“It is a double tragedy we are faced with. Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight. Now, since the drought and conflict, everything is destroyed. There was grass then and livestock would graze, but now it is only hard patches of cracked lands and houses with bullet marks and broken bridges.



“Families are constantly on the move. When we migrated to Kabul, we travelled with other people from our community in search of a better life. The journey was filled with unimaginable suffering for us.



“In Kabul, we live in a rented two-room house costing 40 US dollars a month. Some months we can pay the rent, some we cannot.



“We used the last of our savings and my husband carried out small jobs in town. When we arrived in Kabul a couple of months back, my husband was employed as a security guard for government buildings but he was later retrenched, making life even harder for us here.



“Since falling pregnant, I have not visited the doctor for ante-natal care services. I was also diagnosed with a heart condition that requires close medical attention.



“In Baghlan, I used to visit the Afghan Red Crescent clinic, but since moving to Kabul I do not have the money to travel to the hospital. Once I had to pay a consultation fee which I did not have, and we ended up borrowing money from relatives. Life is far from easy here.”



Shamsia Atayee’s family has received emergency help from the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Aid includes shelter, household items such as kitchen sets, water containers, tarpaulins and blankets.

34,34,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Severe drought tests faith in government among war-weary Afghans - Stars and Stripes,https://www.stripes.com/news/severe-drought-tests-faith-in-government-among-war-weary-afghans-1.532025,"Approximately 20,000 Afghans displaced from their drought-ravaged farms in Ghor, Baghis and Faryab provinces fled to camps on the outskirts of Herat in the last month, where they await national and international aid.

HERAT, Afghanistan — Severe drought and violence have sent thousands of Afghans fleeing to camps on the outskirts of this city during the past two months in search of aid from the government, a situation that could benefit the Taliban if Kabul is seen as failing to care for its people.

The camps next to the capital of Herat province, which borders Iran, have become home to as many as 28,000 people, many of them farmers and their families, officials say.

About 70 percent come from Badghis, a war-torn province next to Herat, though the drought has affected almost two-thirds of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces and could harm an estimated 2.2 million farmers in the coming months.

The Taliban could gain influence if Afghans perceive their government as incapable, said Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan expert at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif.

The drought could also pressure Afghan soldiers and security personnel to desert to take care of their families, Johnson said, which would hinder U.S. and allied military efforts to help their Afghan counterparts gain control of the country.

“With the stagnant economy and 55 percent of the population living below poverty level, having a drought is just a recipe for disaster,” Johnson said.

The first sign of trouble in Badghis and other provinces came in the winter, when the mountain snow that normally melts into rivers never fell.

Less snow fell on Afghanistan last winter than in any year going back to 2001, when NASA scientists first began recording the data. Much of the country measured a 70 percent shortfall of rain and snow over the unusually warm winter. The driest provinces received a third of their normal rainfall.

Increased bloodshed often follows long periods of drought, according to research by Colin P. Kelley of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University. Kelley’s research traced how a multiyear drought, agricultural collapse and internal migration heavily contributed to outbreak of the Syrian conflict.

“When there is heightened vulnerability, particularly in an agrarian society that is strongly dependent on its rainfall, then severe drought episodes can cause displacement and potentially conflict,” Kelley said.

War and famine

Each year, Afghanistan needs more than 6.6 million tons of wheat to feed its people, according to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Country Team, which consists of U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations. Analysts forecast a crop of only 3.8 million tons this year.

The Kabul government says it has stockpiled more than 220,000 tons of wheat.

But in Herat, officials say a wheat distribution, expected to begin next week, will not be enough to solve the misery driving Afghan migration.

“Insecurity plus drought is what brings people to Herat,” said Hamid Mobariz Hamidi, said director of Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, Western Region. “The problem is not going to be solved by wheat.”

The drought wiped out about half of the wheat in Herat province, said Abdul Saboor Rahmany, the province’s agricultural chief. The many farmers who did not have irrigation and relied on winter snowfall lost everything, he added.

In Badghis, 80 to 85 percent of farmers lack irrigation and most lost their entire spring crop, according to a report by the Norwegian Refugee Council.

As spring arrived, the livestock — mostly goats and sheep — began to die. Prices plummeted as everyone tried to rushed to sell their livestock, as they had no way to feed them.

Abdullah, a farmer from Badghis now in the camps in Herat, said he found a patch of fresh grass on a mountainside, and he brought his hardiest sheep to graze there. Then a freak spring snowstorm killed them, he said.

Spring storms swept through Afghanistan, leading to floods killing 20 people in Badghis, but those rains came too late to save the wheat crop, analysts said.

Allah Dad, a displaced farmer from the rocky hills of Badghis province, joined an exodus of thousands of families in Western Afghanistan two months ago. He said he sold the last of his livestock for a steep discount to move his family to Herat.

“We cannot go back,” Allah Dad said. “There’s drought, there’s no work, there’s insecurity. We have no choice left but to stay here, no matter what comes.”

Adding insult to injury, the arrival of the drought came as Taliban began their spring offensive. In Badghis, the Taliban claimed they overran a district center on May 16, and they have ambushed and killed police officers and tribal leaders there.

Fighting in many parts of Afghanistan has inflamed the effects of the drought, as farmers are unable to access markets, according to a United Nations report in May.

The drought, in turn, could intensify insecurity by encouraging increased desertion in the Afghan National Security Forces.

“The ANSF, even in the best of times, they have had trouble feeding themselves,” said Johnson, of the Naval Postgraduate School. “If the soldier’s family is suffering from starvation he’s not going to stick around in the military; he’s going to go and help his family.”

The Taliban, meanwhile, are often fed directly by the local population, in addition to getting supplies provided by foreign backers such as Pakistan, Johnson said.

Call for aid

International aid organizations have issued an urgent appeal for drought aid. Aid organizations recently revised their plan for humanitarian action in Afghanistan, calling for $547 million this year, increasing their request by 27 percent due to the drought’s severity.

“Without quick action, the number of families and gravity of suffering will grow exponentially and that will end up costing us much more later,” United Nations Humanitarian coordinator Toby Lanzer told Stars and Stripes.

The money will go to six months of food aid for 1.4 million people and emergency water supplies, Lanzer said.

Aid organizations are now surveying the displaced families near Herat. The region already has so many families displaced by fighting that it was difficult to find out how many arrived because of drought, officials said. The World Food Program halted its first round of distribution in late May to conduct an additional survey.

Delivery of food and cash, now on hold, is expected to begin next week, when the assessment is complete.

The delay in aid is another disappointment for Allah Dad, who distrusts the government in Kabul and whose province is a battleground.

“If the government was capable of doing anything, they would have helped us already,” he said.

Situation Overview

An estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region. In the past two weeks the total reached around 275,000 people, before some 28,000 individuals returned to their villages in Muqur district of Badghis from the displacement sites in Qala-e-Naw city upon assurances of food distributions in their home villages. Efforts are ongoing to scale up assistance in areas of origin, particularly food assistance from both WFP and government wheat reserves. Timely pre-positioning and distribution is critical, as physical access will become difficult with the onset of rain and snow.

In parallel, efforts are ongoing to meet needs at displacement sites. Existing response capacity at more than a dozen sites in Qala-e-Naw and its surroundings is limited: around 42,000 people have insufficient access to safe drinking water and over 130,000 people have no access to sanitation facilities. There has been no emergency shelter response, leaving people in makeshift shelters. Five mobile health teams in operation are unable to deliver services at the required scale.

While some displaced families are expected to return voluntarily to areas of origin ahead of the planting season in October-November, those that remain at the displacement sites will require integrated assistance, including support to survive the harsh winter conditions.

Some 690,000 people have been reached under the prioritised, integrated response plan that targets 1.4 million people by the end of October.","Sun, 16 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1175554-20180920_afghanistan_drought_sitrep_no_2.png?itok=uueIyweQ,"['situation', 'displaced', 'sites', 'reporting', 'badghis', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', '16', 'report', 'response', 'assistance', 'displacement', 'origin', 'reached', 'areas']", 
36,36,DR-2021-000022-AFG,'Chilling reality': Afghanistan suffers worst floods in seven years - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/mar/06/chilling-reality-afghanistan-suffers-worst-floods-in-seven-years,"Afghanistan has been hit with the worst flooding in seven years, with 20 dead, thousands of homes swept away and many families, already displaced by drought, forced to leave their homes for the second time.

The latest climate shock, which affected eight provinces including Kandahar, came as the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan criticised the European Commission for its “wholly insufficient” response to hunger and suffering in a country already in the grip of what analysts describe as the world’s deadliest conflict.

Toby Lanzer said he was “shocked and surprised” at the low level of engagement from donors to the crisis in Afghanistan, where more than 13 million people are severely food insecure and a further 3.6 million are “one step away from famine”. The levels of hunger, he said, were unprecedented, after an 11-month drought which has ravaged the north and west of the country. He said the suffering on the ground was “as bad as I’ve ever seen”.

“It is a combination of high levels of violence, a devastating drought, bitter cold and abject poverty. It is a very chilling reality.”

Lanzer, the UN’s deputy special representative in Afghanistan, said the UN had set a “modest” target of $612m (£465m) to appeal to donors. It is only 3% funded so far, “which at the end of February is shocking”, he said.

Afghanistan has suffered the worst drought in recent years, resulting in the humanitarian crisis that has displaced 260,000, more people last year than the war between Afghan forces and the Taliban. Flash floods are common after a drought, because it kills bushes and other vegetation that trap water as well as drying out land, further limiting water absorption during heavy rains.

Khalil ur Rehman, 54, a farmer from southern Kandahar province, told the Guardian: “We are again on the move, but this time due to flooding. Last year our entire family had left the village because of drought which had severely affected agriculture and now rains have destroyed our livestock.”

Kandahar province received 75mm of rainfall last year, much less than the required level of at least 400 a year.

Abdul Hanan Moneeb, the province’s deputy governor, said an estimated 2,000 homes had been damaged by the floods.

“The current flooding is the worst in at least seven years,” said Moneeb. “It has destroyed the nomadic herders’ camps and caused loss of their livestock.”

Heavy snowfall across Afghanistan has cut off many areas and raised fears of further floods in the spring.

Ahmad Tamim Azimi, of Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said Kandahar, Herat and Farah were the worst affected areas.

“Since February, at least 95 people have been killed across Afghanistan and 10 people are missing from Kandahar,” Azimi said. “We have requested the INGOs provide relief to the people across the country.”

The European Commission is providing an initial donation of €25m to meet humanitarian need in Afghanistan, but said it may give more depending on future requirements.

“It is somewhat surprising, as people who are in deep distress move,” said Lanzer. “First they move inside the country, and then they move to Europe. This is one of the points I made in Brussels.”

Afghans make up the largest group of asylum seekers travelling to Europe, after Syrians, according to the latest Eurostat data.

The main donors to the UN’s humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan last year were the US, with $183m, the UK, with $82m, and the European Commission, with $48m.

Lanzer said the UK had been generous last year and he was confident of its continuing support, expecting an announcement soon.

An EU official said the commission was a “leading global donor” for Afghanistan and had announced €474m in 2018 to support state building and public reforms, as well as for migration and displacement challenges.","Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a5420b93f8a6384338cbf14ec79ccf388d3cf7e/0_128_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f65190666eecba1e3da030f3f5259e6f,"['uns', 'reality', 'flooding', 'drought', 'worst', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'commission', 'seven', 'kandahar', 'suffers', 'humanitarian', 'european', 'homes', 'chilling']",

The 20 provinces in the war-torn country saw a 60 percent shortfall in rain and snowfall during the winter season.

“This year drought has reached a level that we will have to announce an emergency in several parts of the country,” said Hashmat Khan Bahaduri, spokesman for the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority in Kabul.

Bahaduri said funds would be allocated to mitigate the impact but that the country would have to import, or receive donations, to overcome food shortages.

According to Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a group set up by USAID to help planning for humanitarian crises, snowfall in Afghanistan’s last winter season was the lowest since 2002.

Snowmelt is an important source of water for crops and irrigation in a country where food is scarce for many households.

The U.N. Children’s Fund (UNICEF) appealed on Monday for $10 million to help children and their families in drought-affected provinces.

The UN agency stated that food insecurity and reduced access to drinking water were beginning to take their toll in the 10 worst affected provinces, where 20 to 30 percent of water sources were reportedly dry.

“The priority is to prevent the situation from deteriorating, by responding to the needs of children and families in the worst affected areas,” said Adele Khodr, UNICEF representative in Afghanistan.

Poor rains and scanty snowfall mean less winter wheat, Afghanistan’s most reliable, resilient cereal crop.

An official at the agriculture ministry said it would start distribution of 2,000 metric tonnes of wheat imported from India and Kazakhstan before seeking fresh aid.

Last week, President Ashraf Ghani ordered officials to attend to the needs of distressed farmers and livestock producers.

But the situation is further complicated by an escalating conflict that often picks up with the start of warmer spring weather, leading to increased displacement and reduced access for humanitarian workers.","Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180423&t=2&i=1254464019&r=LYNXMPEE3M0XF&w=800,"['wartorn', 'snowfall', 'water', 'food', 'alerts', '20', 'drought', 'worst', 'afghanistan', 'loom', 'provinces', 'wheat', 'hold', 'country', 'winter', 'takes', 'emergency']",

Providing support for winter to affected people

Humanitarian context

Conflict and insecurity, recurrent natural disasters continue to force people to be on the move in in Afghanistan. In the first ten months of the year, over 400,000 people fled their homes due to conflict, with a total of 32 out of 34 provinces affected.

In addition, nearly 300,000 people were affected by natural disasters in 32 out of 34 provinces resulting in at least 149 people killed and 165 injured; and over 39,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. With the onset of the winter season, people in need have become more vulnerable compounding the effects of displacement as many people have exhausted their coping mechanisms as decades of war have eroded people’s resilience. The combination of conflict with repeated displacement, poverty, and the wide-ranging consequences of under-investment in services has resulted in many families to be burdened by burgeoning debt. For example, it is estimated that it will take 16 years for returnees in Badghis to repay the debts they incurred while displaced during the drought

Furthermore, about half a million people from Afghanistan returned from Pakistan, Iran and other countries in 2019. As in previous years, many returnees are returning with minimal assets and are in need of humanitarian assistance upon arrival as well as income-earning opportunities. Without assistance, people have little capacity to cope and recover. Next year, humanitarian needs are expected to increase with almost a quarter of the population or 9.4 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance; 56 per cent of people in need are children. Humanitarian organisations will need US $733 million to reach 7.1 million people in need in 2020.","Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1430893-Situation%20Report%20-%20Afghanistan%20-%2020%20Dec%202019%20%281%29.png?itok=aANDJaMR,"['situation', '20', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'season', 'onset', 'report', 'provinces', 'humanitarian', 'assistance', 'need', 'returnees', '2019', 'winter']",

Shamsia Atayee, 35, is five months pregnant but hardly shows it.

When she’s congratulated on her pregnancy, she forces a polite smile and says ‘’Thank you’’ in a low tone.

“I would not wish a sixth child on anyone, certainly not in the state of poverty I am in. If it was by choice, I wouldn’t have fallen pregnant because we hardly survive. We have to borrow money for food.”

Drought and conflict robbed her family of a good life in Baghlan province.

‘’My family’s income was reliant on crops and farming, as my husband used to grow and sell vegetables. On a week’s sale, we could make enough to sustain the family’s food supply for a month, and we could buy clothes for our children and keep them warm during the cold winter.

“The drought has finished all our livestock, now it is killing people. As our livestock died and our stored food ran out, we had nothing to live for in Baghlan.

“Conflict contributed to our hunger. We were tormented by the frequent exchange of firearms and explosions. We couldn’t go out to take care of our livestock.’’

‘’It is a double tragedy we are faced with. Baghlan used to be such a beautiful sight. Now, since the drought and conflict, everything is destroyed. There was grass then, livestock would graze but now it is only hard patches of cracked lands, houses with bullet marks and broken bridges.

“Families are constantly on the move. When we migrated to Kabul, we travelled with other people from our community in search of a better life. The journey was filled with unimaginable suffering for us.

“In Kabul, we live in a rented two-room house costing 40 US dollars a month. Some months we can pay the rent, some we cannot. We used the last of our savings and my husband carried out small jobs in town. When we arrived in Kabul a couple of months back, my husband was employed as a security guard for government buildings, but he was later retrenched and making life even harder for us here.

“Since falling pregnant, I have not visited the doctor for antenatal care services. I was also diagnosed with a heart condition that requires close medical attention. In Baghlan, I used to visit the Afghan Red Crescent clinic, but since moving to Kabul I do not have the money to travel to the hospital. Once I had to pay a consultation fee which I did not have, and we ended up borrowing money from relatives. Life is far from easy here.”

Shamsia Atayee’s family has received emergency help from the Afghan Red Crescent Society. Aid includes shelter, household items (kitchen sets, water containers, tarpaulins and blankets).","Tue, 07 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['finished', 'livestock', 'pregnant', 'baghlan', 'red', 'drought', 'kabul', 'afghanistan', 'life', 'husband', 'killing', 'months', 'used', 'money']", 
40,40,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Communities affected by drought in Afghanistan are struggling with hunger - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/communities-affected-drought-afghanistan-are-struggling-hunger,"Consecutive drought in the last three years – followed by a severe drought during the 2017/2018 wet season – hit almost two out of three provinces in Afghanistan, destabilizing the lives of vulnerable families and pressuring the adoption of negative coping strategies. The varied coping strategies include distress sale of productive assets (livestock and land), indebtedness and displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in the West region.

The severe drought compounded the chronic food insecurity caused mainly by the years of conflict and recurrent natural disasters. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, an estimated 13.5 million people across the country are severely food insecure.

The hardest hit area was the western region, where more than 300 000 people have fled to Badghis, Ghor and Herat provinces. In Herat, more than 1 million people are in dire need of food and water. This figure has been added upon an already number of drought-affected people, who are in immediate need of emergency assistance in Herat.

Rezeshk, a poor village in Herat, was particularly affected by the drought. Families living in this village are highly dependent on farming and their livestock to make a living. The persisting drought in this village resulted in crop production losses, animal mortality and morbidity, distress sale of livestock and outbreak of human diseases due to lack of nutritious food.

For 60-year-old Ziba, a Rezeshk-native living in a household of ten members, this is the reality. Agriculture is the main source of income for her and her family. But this year, their animal failed to produce enough milk and their crops failed due to water shortage. “The drought has ruined our lives. Our crop production has become low and we do not get enough nutritious food. We all have become sick,” she said.

The drought has further exacerbated malnutrition levels. Ziba explains that before the drought, their diets were diverse, nutritious and healthy. However, due to lack of access to food, her and her family are constantly ill and cannot afford health services. To cope, they have reduced their meals from three to two times a day.

Ziba is not alone. Afsana is a 20-year-old mother to two daughters and shares an accommodation with four other families to save costs. As a farmer, Afsana’s husband, and other vulnerable families in the area, fully rely on agriculture for their income. Before the drought struck their village, Afsana and her family used to earn money through their crops and by selling their cattle’s milk. After the drought, they had to reduce the number of animals they had because it was difficult to feed them. With two cows remaining, Afsana is forced is to sell her livestock as she cannot afford to buy animal feed. Yet, no one buys them.

“The pasture has dried up and the fodder price has gone up. We cannot afford to buy fodder from the market. Our cattle do not produce enough milk and it’s obvious if they do not eat sufficiently, they will not produce enough milk,” said Afsana. She explained that the money they get from the sale of milk is not enough to contribute to their livelihoods because that money goes towards buying animal feed for their cattle.

Mohammad Dawood, a 57-year-old, is head of a farmers committee in Rezeshk. He recounts how the droughtaffected employment and heavily damaged agricultural lands. He also recounts how his village was more watershed than any other village, but now the water level has gone down by more than 5 m. “This is the first time in 57 years of my life that I am experiencing such a condition. I do not ever remember experiencing lack of water in our streams, but now it is continuously absent for 2-3 days,” he said.

So far, with generous support from resource partners, FAO reached 1 million vulnerable drought-affected people like Ziba, Afsana and Mohammad to meet their immediate needs through emergency livelihoods assistance, enhance their resilience to shocks and prevent further migration and abandonment from their homes.

FAO’s intervention for emergency livestock protection has included the provision of drought-resistant fodder seeds and training to equip farmers with the required skills and tools to get the best yield possible. To ensure the protection of livestock, FAO has distributed concentrated animal feed during the harsh winter.

While significant efforts have been made by resources and humanitarian partners to address the needs of vulnerable households affected by drought, the needs and gaps still remain high. Continuous drought in the last three years has destroyed assets, leaving vulnerable households with little to no option for their livelihoods. More effort is needed to ensure that affected farming families get back to their normal lives.

This past winter season, Afghanistan experienced better precipitation over the last three years. However, reports suggest that many parts of the country will be hit by flooding and landslides, which will increase the number of people in need.

“The impact of drought is particularly distressing for farmers. They do not have the ability to buy seeds for their farmlands nor protect their livestock. Our goal is to support those most affected by the drought in their places of origin to enhance their resilience to shocks and prevent further migration and abandonment from their homes,” said Rajendra Aryal, the FAO Representative in Afghanistan.

In 2019, FAO is appealing for USD 30 million to reach 1.4 million vulnerable drought-affected people, especially those facing emergency levels of food insecurity. Emergency livelihoods support to vulnerable farmers and pastoralists will enable them to cultivate summer crops, nutritious vegetables and the main staple of the country – wheat, as well as to protect their core breeding animals, and increase their income generation and intake of nutritious food with poultry distribution.","Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/1_afghanistan.jpg?itok=9GP9WNpN,"['struggling', 'food', 'livestock', 'village', 'milk', 'affected', 'hunger', 'communities', 'afghanistan', 'drought', 'million', 'nutritious', 'families', 'vulnerable', 'emergency']",

Poor rainfall, harsh winter, ceaseless conflict, long-term displacement.

Any one of these hardships would be too much to bear, but as drought and conflict drive widespread humanitarian need throughout Afghanistan, many families are facing them all.

This year, Afghanistan is in the midst of the most severe drought since 2011, increasing the humanitarian needs of households struggling to cope with multiple shocks. Households who depend on farming and herding for their income and food have seen their livelihoods decimated by poor rainfall and high temperatures.

Many herders have had to sell their livestock because their grazing land is damaged, particularly in north and west Afghanistan. As of mid-2018, at least 3.5 million Afghans across 20 provinces are acutely food insecure as a result of the drought, according to the UN. In addition, the number of people displaced by drought in 2018 — more than 249,000 people — has almost surpassed the number of people displaced by conflict.

The looming Afghan winter is unforgiving. To help communities in need, USAID’s Office of Food for Peace is providing emergency food and nutrition assistance, including critical support for drought and winter response activities, to help vulnerable families meet their critical food needs through the frigid winter months amidst drought.

USAID partner the UN World Food Program (WFP) has supported the most at-risk people since the first signs of drought. WFP already reached more than 1 million people across 15 provinces with emergency food assistance — including split peas, salt, and vegetable oil — and supported access to food in local markets between July and October, and it plans to reach up to 2.5 million people with life-saving food by the end of 2018.

To meet this goal before the worst of winter makes roads to remote, drought-affected areas impassable, WFP is pre-positioning urgently needed assistance in advance. For example, WFP transports supplies across the Amu Darya River from neighboring Tajikistan to reach Afghanistan’s northern provinces, depositing the food and specialized nutrition products in warehouses, stores, and health centers as close as possible to the people who need it.","Wed, 19 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['food', 'snow', 'wfp', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'conflict', 'provinces', 'responds', 'families', 'nutrition', 'need', 'usaid', 'assistance', 'winter']",

Ongoing conflict, natural disasters, internal displacement and cross-border movements continue to increase food insecurity. This year, farmers are also suffering from a drought that is affecting the majority of the country.

Ahmadullah lives in Burj, a village in Zairy District, Kandahar. Like many Afghans, he is a smallholder farmer who owns livestock and grows fruit on his small plot of land. Drought has caused his gardens to dry out and many of his crops to fail. His animals are not breeding, and he has had to sell many of them. All his neighbours are in the same boat. They cannot afford to buy livestock feed due to drought-induced price increases, so their only viable option is selling meat at low prices.

Ahmadullah and his neighbours received animal feed as part of a FAO drought-mitigation project in Kandahar, one of the most drought-stricken provinces in the country.

Many farmers are coping with the drought by digging deeper tube wells to source both drinking and irrigation water. However, this is not a sustainable strategy. Deeper wells just mean that groundwater is becoming depleted faster. Such short-term coping techniques, coupled with the near-yearly droughts of the past two decades, mean that underground aquifers are emptier than ever before. Farmers know this strategy is not going to keep working in the long run. They know less rain is falling, they see river flows decrease, and they watch mountain snow cover shrink with each passing year.

Accessing food and water has always been a struggle for Ahmadullah’s family. “Since the time the Taliban were ruling, I’ve often had to borrow money from relatives and friends in order to get enough to eat,” he said. “I’m worried we will have to do the same this year, or worse – we could have to move. But, with so many provinces suffering from drought, I don’t know where we’d go.”

With droughts happening so frequently, farmers barely have time to recover before the next one hits. High temperatures this year in parts of the country have also made the current drought particularly punishing. Decades of war have destroyed much of Afghanistan's irrigation infrastructure. Without timely rebuilding of proper irrigation systems, many farmers fear they will not be able to go back to farming and ultimately lose their main source of livelihood.","Wed, 15 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/hirat%20garden%20dry%20spell-L_0.jpg?itok=w6LQERLc,"['situation', 'water', 'conflictaffected', 'strategy', 'drought', 'suffering', 'afghanistan', 'irrigation', 'wells', 'provinces', 'source', 'exacerbates', 'know', 'farmers']",

May 29 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Millions of Afghans face hunger after a drought decimated crops in the war-ravaged country, U.N. officials said on Tuesday, calling for an extra $115 million to help families buy food.

Two thirds of Afghanistan's 34 provinces have been hit by a lack of rain or snowfall since late last year, said a bulletin from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Some rivers and water points have totally dried up, and the last wheat harvest has been ""completely lost"", according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.

""Six months down the road, millions of people could be in a situation of untenable hunger without knowing where their next meal will come from,"" said Toby Lanzer, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.

Already, the drought has forced 21,000 people to leave their homes and settle on the outskirts of the western city of Herat, said OCHA.

The U.N. hopes to distribute cash to enable families to buy food and try to prevent further migration.

""People prefer cash, which allows them to buy what they need most,"" he said. ""We prefer not to truck food across the country, also because doing so is expensive and can disrupt markets.""

The U.N. is revising its humanitarian appeal for 2018 because of the drought, and says it needs an extra $115 million to help 1.4 million of the hardest-hit people.

Only one quarter of the $430 million the U.N. requested for 2018 was funded as of May 23.

The drought has also hurt nomadic herders known as Kuchis, as pasturelands have dried up in some areas, including the northeastern provinces of Badakhshan and Kunduz.

""The animals are too weak to walk to their usual pastures in Badakhshan province and herders have to rent trucks to bring them there,"" OCHA quoted Abdul Majidi, head of the Kunduz agricultural department, as saying.

Prices for sheep have fallen by as much as 40 percent, but many Kuchis are selling them out of desperation, according to OCHA's report.

The Afghan government and its allies are fighting an array of militant groups, including the Taliban and the Islamic State, which has exacerbated the effects of the drought in some provinces.

""In Helmand, village elders reportedly need to obtain special approval from the armed groups controlling their districts to access markets in areas under government control,"" said the bulletin.

The cost of wheat shot up by 50 percent and produce prices quadrupled in Kandahar City when roads were temporarily closed in April due to fighting, it said.

Water points and fountains across the country have dried up, and the lack of rain and snow melt has caused rivers to run low or dry up completely, according to a weekly report by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA.

The lack of water has prompted farmers to delay planting crops and reduce their field sizes in an effort to minimize losses. U.N. officials said in many cases there was nothing formers could do but watch the seeds dry out.

The humanitarian agency cautioned that the drought already has “negatively and irreversibly” affected the winter agricultural season of 2017/2018, and it also is expected to have a negative impact on the 2018 spring and summer agricultural season. It added that the last harvest must be considered completely lost.

The agency already has documented the first migration movements of more than 21,000 people since the beginning of May to urban centers due to drought and depleted food stocks of families.

""Some 1.5 million goats and sheep in the northeastern region are struggling to find food, and more than 600 out of nearly 1,000 villages in the province are suffering from the lack of water,"" OCHA said in a statement.

OCHA said humanitarian partners urgently need $115 million to respond to the needs of the 1.4 million most vulnerable people hit by the drought.

The agency said the intensified conflict across many parts of Afghanistan is exacerbating the effects of the drought and has limited the communities’ access to markets.

The Taliban insurgency, which controls or contests nearly, half of the Afghan territory, has intensified attacks across the country and overrun new districts.

Humanitarian workers cite security concerns due to active fighting in insurgent-controlled areas for a lack of access to communities in need in these areas.

A U.S. government oversight agency, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), in its latest quarterly report has noted that more than 11 million Afghans are living in areas that are contested or under control of Taliban-led armed groups.","Sat, 26 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/4350F209-7E05-4E56-813E-E8524DFB0952.jpg,"['food', 'water', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'season', 'report', 'twothirds', 'warhit', 'grips', 'humanitarian', 'lack', 'need', 'agency']",

Between 31 July and 3 August 2018, the first phase of the Drought Impact and Needs Assessment (DINA) surveyed 350 households, held 10 Key Informant interviews and conducted 5 Focus Group Discussions with drought-induced internally displaced people in Hirat city, Hirat (around 12,000 families), Qala-e-Naw city, Badghis (around 1,000 families) and Chaghcharan, Ghor (around 600 families). Most respondents had arrived from Badghis (73 per cent), specifically from Balamurghab and Muqur districts, while 14 per cent had arrived from Ghor and 8 per cent from Faryab.

Drivers of displacement

Assessment results reveal the impact of the drought on agriculture-related livelihoods as a key driver of displacement. Over 70 per cent of respondents’ livelihoods depended on agriculture at home. Of those respondents who owned land, 84 per cent said that production last winter season was only half, or less than half, than in a normal year. Those who had owned livestock reported having lost almost all their poultry and camels/horses, as well as 93 per cent of large ruminants and 90 per cent of small ruminants.

The lack of water is a key concern. 78 per cent of respondents reported severe shortages of water for agriculture. Over half reported that, when they left home, availability of water for domestic use was very low (47 per cent) or that water was not available at all (7 per cent). 60 per cent reported major shortages of water, and 47 per cent reported a significantly lower quality of water as compared to previous years prior to displacement.

The drivers of displacement are multi-faceted. Only 10 per cent of respondents were planning to return to their areas of origin for a number of reasons: 71 per cent mentioned insecurity; many also referred to the lack of basic services (39 per cent), water (47 per cent) and livelihood opportunities (40 per cent).","Sun, 24 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1248119-afghanistan_dina_report.png?itok=rLHys2Z_,"['water', 'afghanistan', 'hirat', 'owned', 'cent', '47', 'drought', 'internally', 'families', 'needs', 'shortages', 'respondents', 'displaced', 'provinces', 'impact', 'ghor', 'key', 'badghis', 'reported', 'half']",

Three years of drought have contributed to massive crop failure, economic hardship, hunger and loss of life, and forced 266,000 people from their homes. In March 2019, extreme weather deepened extreme hardship, when above normal rain and snow fell on soil with limited vegetation or ability to soak up the water, bringing flash floods to nine provinces, killing 63 people and displacing at least 281,000 to makeshift camps with inadequate services.

Climate change is increasing the hardship for people in Afghanistan. Temperatures are rising, leading to changes in snowmelt, and rainfall is getting more erratic, with an increased risk of floods and droughts. Repeated disasters have eroded people's capacity to cope.

""Millions of people need both immediate, life-saving humanitarian assistance and a way out of this protracted crisis,"" said Afghan Red Crescent Secretary General Dr Nilab Mobarez. ""The floods are the latest disaster to bitterly test the resilience of people already stretched to breaking point by drought. It's extremely worrying because more floods are expected.""

Across many parts of the country, people lack safe water, proper sanitation and healthcare, which contribute to catastrophic levels of malnutrition.

""The floods should be the wake-up call that triggers a massive investment to help people who at the moment are out of sight in an under-estimated, silent crisis with limited access by humanitarian agencies or media,"" said Ariel Kestens, IFRC Head of Country for Afghanistan, ""They are out of reach because of conflict and out of scope because this is a large, slow-onset disaster, and because many people in need are displaced by disaster.""

On 17 March 2019, IFRC launched an emergency appeal seeking 7 million Swiss francs to support the Afghan Red Crescent Society to provide shelter, health and care; water, sanitation and hygiene; and livelihoods and basic needs for up to 650,000 people (92,500 households) affected by flood and drought for 12 months. The plan also includes disaster risk reduction activities and strengthening the capacity of the Red Crescent. A longer-term resilience-oriented approach will address some of the underlying causes of people's vulnerability. Examples are water, sanitation and healthcare, agricultural support such as in climate-smart practices and cash-based intervention.

People in displacement settlements in Badghis are sleeping in flimsy makeshift shelters that are ill-equipped to withstand Afghanistan’s harsh winters. In addition, once winter sets in the dry river beds where many displaced families are settled will swell with water and flash floods will dangerously compound the already dire situation for drought-hit communities. Water-borne diseases may become rife, and claim the lives of already malnourished, cold, displaced children.

""We came here and slept in the open with nothing but a tarpaulin over our head. My daughter first got pneumonia. Then she died,"" said young mother Sultana, 24. After being displaced two months ago because of the drought, she lost her three month old daughter due to the cold in one of the displacement settlements in Badghis.

Four years of failed rains have led to massive loss of livelihoods for half a million Afghans in the northwestern province of Badghis. Ninety-five per cent of the population there rely on agriculture, livestock and crops to survive. People have been left without enough food to feed their families. The upcoming severe winter months will likely deteriorate their situation.

Over 260,000 people have so far been displaced by drought across four provinces in western Afghanistan. Many families have been split up – some have left their homes to find assistance, while others have stayed behind in their villages.

“We cannot abandon Afghanistan at this critical junction. Better shelters must be built, and food stocks put in place, so families can survive the freezing months ahead. We have to ensure Afghans survive this winter despite the odds,” said Nyamandi.","Thu, 18 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.nrc.no/image/68757/365a0902.jpg?width=1200&height=801,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'survive', 'shelters', 'temperatures', 'brace', 'afghanistan', 'settlements', 'families', 'droughthit', 'winter', 'harsh', 'months', 'cold']",

Summary of current response context

Poor precipitation during the winter of 2017/2018 in the mountainous regions of Hindu-Kush is responsible for the severe drought that hit Afghanistan in the first half of 2018, particularly over the northwestern regions. These semi-arid/arid areas rely heavily on rain and melted snow flowing from the mountains for the majority of their water resources. As most of Western Afghanistan does not receive any precipitation between June and October, the lack of it in earlier months compromises water supply for the rest of the year.

The drought caused losses to the rural communities (70 per cent of population live in rural areas) and forced people to move toward makeshift camps and cities, to avoid famine as many people have been left without enough food to feed their families. Helmand ANDMA reported about 1,400 individuals displaced from Khanshin to Lashkargah due to drought and lack of water. As part of the drought response in rural areas, WFP and its partners delivered 3,500 metric tons of food for more than 398,000 people in 13 provinces, in the last week of November (20-27 November). In the past month, more than 1.4 million people received food or cash from WFP as part of the ongoing full-scale drought response that plans to reach 2.5 million people by end of the year.

The Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) remains vigilant and have been monitoring the situation since the start of dry spell. ARCS is in close coordination with Afghan National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA), Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC). ARCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to coordinate with relevant stakeholders and update on the situation on regular basis. ARCS started coordination meetings with in country movement partners since May 2018.","Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1258338-MDRAF004du2.png?itok=RU5-reur,"['food', 'water', 'update', 'mdraf004', 'wfp', 'epoa', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'plan', 'response', 'arcs', 'dref', 'rural', 'action', 'yearthe', 'n', 'emergency', 'areas']", 
53,53,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Drought in Afghanistan: Worst in recent history - SOFREP,https://sofrep.com/news/drought-in-afghanistan-worst-in-recent-history/,"War, corruption, and poverty have plagued Afghanistan for generations. These have generally led to a myriad of exacerbating issues like a lack of healthcare infrastructure, education, and political unification. Now another devastating obstacle has struck the country: the worst drought in decades.

Droughts of this magnitude are going to affect any country severely, but this one hits Afghanistan particularly hard. Agriculture is Afghanistan’s economic foundation — according to the CIA World Factbook, it composes approximately 23% of the country’s GDP. To contrast, agriculture makes up 0.9% of the United States’s GDP.

20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces have felt the brunt of this drought, and millions of Afghan people have been devastated by its effects. This means dead livestock, failed harvest, and of course, a lack of basic access to water. Thousands of households have been displaced, forced to abandon their homes and move elsewhere where they can find water.

According to the European Commission Humanitarian Aid and Emergency Response Mechanism,

Particularly hard hit are the provinces of Ghor and Badghis, who have generated displacement of over 9,000 households into Herat City, and approx. 1,000 households in Qala e Now, Badghis. The vast majority of these households remain unassisted, lacking access to safe drinking water, shelter or adequate sanitation facilities and food, and as a result, sinking into increased vulnerability; sinking into increasing levels of vulnerability and employing negative coping mechanisms such as skipping meals and using money lenders to feed their families.”

Some countries are pitching in to help — the U.K. recently donated $13.1 million to The World Food Programme, who aims to provide aid in the areas worst affected by the drought. They plan to reach and contribute to 1.4 million people, not only providing them with basic supplies but enabling them to have a more successful harvest next year.

This is an essential approach to humanitarian aid necessary to help the Afghan people suffering from this drought. A short-term fix may be welcome, but a more effective, long-term solution includes a level of sustainment that will last longer than just a few months. This is particularly important not only for the families themselves, but to mitigate all the issues involved in mass-migration into major population centers. The drought we see now could amount to what would effectively be a domestic refugee crisis, akin to what the U.S. saw as the “dust bowl” dried up in the 1930s — except in a country that is already afflicted by perpetual war.

KABUL, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of overjoyed Kabul residents poured to the streets on Saturday to welcome and celebrate the first winter snowfall in the Afghan capital after long-lasting droughts in the war-battered country.

Afghans believed that concerns about drought, water shortage and fatal air pollution would somehow be eased as they were joyfully watching the snow, with the capital's nearby hills and mountains covered with white snow blanket.

Kabul residents seemed to worry less about the future of their country because of this snowfall and more snowfalls in the coming months, which is expected to end the drought and lead to higher groundwater level.

""Continued snowfall causes ground water increase and help us grow various crops. In the past, people faced harsh problems regarding water shortage in the country,"" Rahimullah, a resident of Kabul's Qargha locality who seemed extremely happy with the natural bless, told Xinhua.

Apart from Kabul, some other provinces also witnessed promising snowfall in the last few days.

Some poor households struggled to heat up their rooms as the snowfalls further brought down the temperature.

Harsh winter and possible heavy snowfalls will affect thousands of displaced families, who mostly migrated to the capital from conflict-affected areas and live in tents in the freezing weather.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghan social media users took pictures from various snow-covered landscapes and posted them on social media pages to share their joy and happiness.

The daytime air pollution mixed with fog has recently increased in the capital city, triggering various diseases among the residents, particularly children. The long-awaited snowfall was expected to reduce air pollution in the densely populated city.

Earlier, the Afghanistan Environmental Protection Authority warned that the growing air pollution would lead to a catastrophe unless the government takes measures to deal with it.

In addition to the endemic insurgency and insecurity, hundreds of thousands of people have left their houses due to water shortage as many of their livestock have perished mostly in the countryside.

55,55,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Drought Intensifies Iran-Afghan Dispute over Water Resources - Future Directions International,https://www.futuredirections.org.au/publication/drought-intensifies-iran-afghan-dispute-over-water-resources/,"Background

Iran is currently facing its worst drought in fifty years, with nearly half the population likely to face severe water shortages. The situation in Afghanistan is also dire, with a 60 per cent shortfall in rain and snow during winter; a drought emergency has been declared in several parts of the country. The availability of water per capita is expected to decline by 50 per cent over the next three decades. Afghanistan’s inferior infrastructure has left it with one of the lowest water-storage capacities in the world and large parts of the country cannot effectively use their allocated water resources. In light of this situation, the decision by the Afghan Government to build several dams along the Helmand River has raised tensions with Iran over water allocation, at a time when both countries need every drop.

While there is a bilateral water-sharing agreement between the two countries, the 1973 Helmand River Treaty, it has been ineffective in resolving this dispute; both sides accuse the other of failing to meet their obligations. Iran is haunted by memories of the Taliban closing the sluices of the Kajaki dam in 1998-2001, an action that cut off the water usually supplied to Iran. Iran complains that the Afghans are cultivating more land in Helmand by using Iran’s share. On the other side of the dispute, Afghan officials believe that Iran receives significantly more than the agreed amount and has been providing support to Taliban militants to disrupt the construction of water infrastructure.

Comment

Iran and Afghanistan have generally maintained close relations since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. Water allocations, however, have been a source of tension for decades, flaring up periodically in times of drought and hardship. Currently, both countries are suffering from significant droughts; consequently, the issue of sharing water has become highly politicised.

For Afghanistan, dams are an essential tool for both irrigation and electricity generation. They provide a much-needed boost to the agricultural sector and reduce its dependence on electricity imports from neighbouring countries. Currently, only one-third of the water that originates in Afghanistan is used inside the country, the rest flows into Iran and Pakistan. Iran, however, fears that any reduction in the flow of water from Afghanistan could have detrimental economic and environmental effects, as it is reliant on the flow of the Helmand River to meet its water needs.

A speech given by the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, in July 2017 led to demonstrations in Afghan cities and uproar on social media. Many interpreted his statement as a threat of retaliation if Afghanistan continued to build more dams. In a response to those events, the Iranian ambassador to Afghanistan claimed that President Rouhani’s speech was misinterpreted; he rejected any accusations that Tehran had disrupted Kabul’s water projects.

Regardless of whether those accusations are true, Afghanistan plans to build more dams, which is likely to result in weaker relations with Iran. While the development of dams is necessary for Afghan agriculture and industry, Kabul needs to maintain dialogue with Tehran on water sharing, as Iran has a right to its share of the water originating in Afghanistan.

The first step to resolving the water dispute is to record reliable data on the flow and distribution of water between Afghanistan and Iran. Despite claims in the media, there has been no accurate measurement of how much water enters Iran via the Helmand River since Soviet forces destroyed a measuring station built by the United States in the 1970s. The importance of reliable data cannot be understated, as monitoring the quantity of water flowing into Iran will allow both countries to better abide by the terms of the 1973 Helmand River Treaty.

The second step is to improve existing water management practices. Both countries have a history of building dams, digging wells and diverting the flow of water without conducting environmental surveys. They have also planted crops that are not suitable for the changing climate. Domestic water use in Iran is about 70 per cent higher than the global average, despite 87 per cent of Iranian water resources being over exploited, mostly through drilling and an over-reliance on dams.

Finally, the terms of the 1973 Treaty should be revised to reflect the current situation. That would help to create a framework to resolve future disputes over water and build a basis for future co-operation on the use of water resources.

With water becoming an increasingly politicised issue in both Iran and Afghanistan, however, it is doubtful that the water dispute will be resolved any time soon. The Afghan population has called on its government to continue building more dams, despite significant opposition from Iran. Consequently, in the immediate future, relations are likely to remain tense.","Wed, 01 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/index.ico,"['flow', 'resources', 'water', 'dams', 'iran', 'drought', 'helmand', 'dispute', 'afghanistan', 'river', 'afghan', 'iranafghan', 'intensifies', 'countries']",

The number of people displaced due to the drought has surpassed 150,000 in August in the Western Region. Most of them are located in informal sites in Hirat and Qala-e-Naw cities.

Some 311,000 people received food, cash or livelihood assistance in Badghis, Ghor, Hirat, Jawzjan,

Faryab and Kandahar provinces in August.

Water trucking reached 34,000 people in rural areas of Badghis Province and more than 100,000 residents of informal sites in Hirat and Qala-e-Naw.

An increase in early marriages and child labour has been noted at informal sites in Hirat City, as the most vulnerable attempt to cope with the situation.

As the planting season and winter approach, humanitarian partners in the Western Region are preparing a transition plan to i) enable voluntary returns to areas of origin; ii) provide alternative solutions to encourage off-site movement; and iii) provide winterization support.

Situation Report

Food distributions continue in drought-affected areas of origin across the country. In August, around 311,000 people received food, cash and livelihood assistance across the country. In two districts of Badghis Province, emergency water supplies reached 34,000 people in rural areas. Plans are in place to expand the provision to another 50,000 people in three districts of Hirat Province. There is a need for a scale-up in food and livelihoods assistance in the coming months, supporting people to return to their areas of origin, or remain in their homes and close to their fields to take advantage of the next planting season. Complementary activities in health, nutrition, protection and WASH remain essential.

Drought-induced displacement continues, with an estimated 150,000 people at informal displacement sites. The number of displaced people in and around Qala-e-Naw, Badghis, is estimated to be 66,500, most of them from Muqur and Abkamari districts. Around 5,000 people have reportedly displaced to Abkamari district centre from surrounding villages and small-scale displacement has been reported in the Qadis district centre. In Hirat City, where some 84,000 displaced people were registered in July, another 3,000 family petitions have reportedly been submitted to the authorities, indicating that the total number of drought-induced IDPs in the city may be higher than 100,000. In Chaghcharan City, Ghor, the number of drought-induced IDPs is currently 4,060.

In Qala-e-Naw, operational capacity and existing supplies are insufficient to meet the life-saving needs of newlyarrived families, and an immediate scale-up across all sectors is required to respond. The most urgent gaps are in emergency shelter and non-food items (ESNFI), water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection. In Hirat City, food, cash and WASH assistance have been provided, and health and nutrition services are increasingly available on the ten informal sites. The response is however hampered by uncertainty regarding the tenability of the sites, difficulties in registration, and limited capacity to respond. Many families remain exposed to the elements, surviving in make-shift shelters, while some have resorted to self-building mud-brick huts. Serious protection concerns have also been reported from the sites, with a spike in early marriage and child labour.","Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1163774-20180903%20Afghanistan%20Drought%20Sitrep%20No%201_FINAL.PDF.png?itok=41_4fdSn,"['situation', 'displaced', 'sites', 'food', 'badghis', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'hirat', 'report', 'response', '31', 'city', 'number', 'assistance', 'informal', 'areas']",

The temperature routinely tops 110 F (43.3 C). There isn’t a hint of rain. When, every May, a vicious, hair dryer-like wind, known as the Wind of 120 Days, begins to whip in across the semi-arid flatlands, the entire area wanes under a months-long barrage of sand, cloying dust, and noise.

American soldiers across the border in neighboring Afghanistan are warned to be particularly wary when these gusts pick up. “High winds can turn tent pegs and loose objects into flying missiles (which may not be visible in blowing sand),” cautions “A Soldier’s Guide to Staying Healthy in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” a U.S. army medical manual. Locals are sometimes forced to shout at one another just to make themselves heard amid the breathless whistling.

And that was before things really went wrong. In recent years, Sistan and Baluchestan province, which makes up much of the most affected area, has become bogged down in a relentless wave of environmental disasters. A prolonged drought has hastened the disappearance of the storied Hamun wetlands, while higher temperatures continue to evaporate what meager surface water remains. At up to 1,500 square miles (4,000 square kilometers), the wetlands were a bountiful source of irrigation and promise in a land with little of either.

But now the dust storm season has expanded, sometimes spanning half the year—and so, as a consequence, has the volume of respiratory problems. In 2016, the UN’s World Health Organization ranked Zabol, a provincial hub, as the most polluted city on the planet. With agriculture now all but impossible and everyday life a struggle, locals and officials alike say that the region risks becoming uninhabitable.

“From one side of the wetlands, Afghanistan has built several dams in the upstream, and on the other, the area is faced with constant drought,” said Naser Moghaddasi, a senior advisor to the Iranian Department of Environment and the country’s delegate at the COP 24 climate conference in Poland in early December. “It’s created a hotspot in what was once a prime area for cultivation and created big problems for a lot of people.”

Country-wide threats

Where once deer and leopards rummaged for food, now fire engines stand ready to tackle the blazes that often erupt across the bone-dry landscape. According to local media reports, Sistan and Baluchistan received only 1.1 inches (29 mm) of rain this past winter, less than a third of its requirements.

Much of the Gulf might soon be too hot for humans.

Iran as a whole is buckling under the pressures of climate change and poor water management. Lake Urmia, formerly its largest body of water, has mostly withered away—as has Lake Bakhtegan, once the second largest in the country. At Isfahan, the Zayandeh River seldom flows these days, leaving the city’s famous arched Khaju Bridge high and dry. And, in June 2017, Ahvaz in Khuzestan province, aside the Persian Gulf, posted one of the highest temperatures ever recorded, 128.7 F (53.7 C). (Read more about the collapse of Lake Urmia.)

There’s every possibility the situation might deteriorate further, experts warn. Climate change-related woes are thought to have played a part in the fierce anti-government protests which roiled Iran in late 2017 and early 2018 and ultimately left at least 20 people dead. Much of the Gulf might soon be too hot for humans, according to a 2015 MIT study.

Regional collapse?

But in Sistan and Baluchistan, many horrors are already playing out. As a distant and isolated province with an almost entirely agrarian economy, it’s been poorly placed to adapt. In a possible harbinger of things to come elsewhere, it’s slowly falling apart.

Residents have migrated in droves. Up to a fifth of the province’s 2.5 million people are or soon will be on the move, according to a local member of parliament. Drug smuggling and addiction have proliferated, as some unemployed farmers get sucked into the trade and others get hooked on its wares. Some $28 billion-worth of drugs, mostly heroin, are ferried over the border from Afghanistan every year, according to the UN, some of which is launched over frontier guards by catapult under the cover of dust storms. Amid deepening poverty, rates of child marriage have reportedly surged, with girls as young as nine married off, often for their dowries.

Authorities insist they’re aware of the danger. “We know we cannot continue to operate open agriculture in dryland areas,” Moghaddasi said. “We need to diversity our economy among people who depend on nature.”

He says his government is discouraging the cultivation of water-intensive crops, like rice, and expanding medical services in dust storm-heavy districts, such as Zabol. But the state is still mismanaging its water resources, experts say, leading some scientists to refer to the crisis as a “socio-economic drought.”

At the same time, Iran has jailed at least a dozen prominent environmentalists, including one who died in prison in suspicious circumstances early in 2018. Four of these men have since been charged with crimes that often receive the death penalty there. All are accused of espionage, in part because of their use of specialized equipment, such as camera traps, to record rare Persian leopards.

From international science collaborations to on-the-ground fieldwork, much environmental research has since come to a standstill. NGOs “have become paranoid. You self-censor. You limit your activities.

Over 3 million people including an estimated 1.6 million children are affected by the impact of drought across the country. The number of food insecure population is likely to increase to over 6 million people during the lean season

While some people are returning to their areas of origin, new arrivals continue to settle in the IDP camps. With the onset of winter season, temperatures continued to drop. With reports of an increasing number of patients with acute respiratory tract infections and two winterrelated deaths, winterization activities continue to be prioritized. UNICEF has delivered clothes and blankets to over 10,000 droughtaffected children in IDP settlements.

Water, sanitation and hygiene activities continue to be a priority. With partners, UNICEF is providing over 146,500 (95 per cent of target) people with safe drinking water. UNICEF installed culturally-sensitive latrines benefitting over 60,000 people (75 per cent of target) across IDP sites in Herat and Badghis.

Malnutrition rates remain high amongst displaced children. Of the 19,300 children screened in Herat and Badghis IDP settlements, 1,379 were found to be severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases and were referred for treatment at facilities in Herat and Badghis provinces.

UNICEF and partners recently conducted measles campaign reaching over 61,510 children to prevent outbreaks among IDP children.

The drought response is 60% funded with the generous contribution of several donors. UNICEF urgently require US$4 million the needs of a quarter million people. UNICEF was forced to suspend some development activities to focus on life saving interventions.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs

The drought situation remains dynamic with fluctuating numbers of displaced people as some return while some new IDPs arrive in the temporary settlements. The number of people facing emergency levels of food insecurity has increased by over 74 per cent to reach 3.3 million people compared to last year. According to FEWSNET, the total food insecure population is expected to increase as high as between 6 and 7 million due to a combination of droughts effects, conflict, and weak labour opportunities and remittances from outside the country.

The worst affected provinces include Badghis, Daykundi and Badhakshan which will continue under IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) until mid-next year. Apart from fuelling large scale displacements, drought impacts have compounded the already vulnerable and impoverished communities forcing them to engage in negative coping mechanisms such asset disposal, “selling” of girl children1 or forced marriages, and withdrawal of children from school. There are reports of continued prevalence of child marriage, child labour and child engagement in all IDP settlements in Herat and Badghis.

According to the recent verification exercise, a total of 223,000 people have been displaced due to drought, of which 148,000 are based in Herat, 70,000 in Badghis and 5,000 in Ghor province2 . While the displacement trends remained stable in Herat during the month of November, the number of displaced people increased significantly in Badghis due to the worsening food insecurity. In addition, 301,000 people have been displaced due to the conflict this year with 11,000 people being forced to flee their homes over the past weeks. In addition, some 4,700 IDP families have expressed an interest in returning to their areas of origin. They have been provided with non-food items (NFIs) through IOM, and are awaiting a food distribution before the Government facilitates their return home – UNICEF will continue to support them in areas of origin as needed through durable water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities, and access to mobile health and nutrition teams (MHNTs). Most IDPs however, have confirmed that they will remain in IDP sites at least through the winter.

Displaced families living in temporary and poorly insulated shelters face not only the risk of harsh winters but also the risk of flash floods, especially those residing on dry-river beds. Most recently a number of families in these high risk areas have relocated to higher ground. In addition, the risk of acute respiratory infection is very high during the winter season particularly among children due to indoor pollution as families burn wood to keep themselves warm. With 68 per cent of the internally displaced populations living in Herat reporting not intending to return to their areas of origin there is need for the government and humanitarian actors to develop durable solution beyond the current humanitarian response Due to lack of adequate food and access to other basic needs, the nutritional status of IDP children and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) continue to deteriorate. Recent assessment conducted by the Nutrition Cluster indicate that 25 per cent of children aged 0-59 months are acutely malnourished. It is estimated that over 50,000 children under five and about 20,500 pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) are currently displaced in Herat and Badghis as a result of drought. Timely and scaled up emergency nutrition response is required to avoid malnutrition related morbidity and mortality among this at-risk population.

Furthermore, on a weekly basis, during the month of October an average of 1,800 displaced children were diagnosed with diarrhoeal diseases in Herat and Badghis IDP sites. As of November, these numbers remain stable and agencies are promoting increased sanitation and hygiene behaviours. In early November, increased cases of bloody diarrhoea, reaching outbreak levels, were recorded, particularly in Badghis. However, by midNovember, these cases declined significantly. Similarly, despite the presence of outbreaks of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Herat province, there were no reported cases among displaced people.","Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1210738-UNICEF%20Afghanistan%20Western%20Region%20Drought%20Response%20Humanitarian%20Situation%20Report%20%233%20-%2015%20November%202018.png?itok=3zQtILDk,"['situation', 'western', 'displaced', 'food', 'badghis', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'report', 'response', 'region', 'humanitarian', 'unicef', 'idp', 'children', 'herat']", 
61,61,DR-2021-000022-AFG,REACHING OUT - Implementing a Comprehensive Response to Drought in Afghanistan - Afghanistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/reaching-out-implementing-comprehensive-response-drought-afghanistan,"NGOs call for comprehensive response to Drought in Afghanistan:

4th July 2018, Kabul, Afghanistan

Afghanistan remains one of the worst funded of the large crises around the world. Millions of people are in need of humanitarian assistance, mostly due to conflict, rapid-onset natural disasters and situations of protracted displacement. So far this year only 29% of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is funded; but on top of the initial response plan, a drought is further escalating needs.

Below average precipitation since October 2017, has destroyed and degraded agriculture and livelihoods, significantly increasing the number of people in need. For example, in Kandiwal, a village of 300 families in Ghor province, only 15 families had cultivated their crop this year. At least 40 families from there had already moved to Herat, joining at least 2,000 drought-displaced families. In the North and NorthEastern regions, only 68% of rain-fed land cultivated last year was cultivated this year and the price of goats is almost two times less compared to the previous year. Approximately 30% of the population of Chakhansoor district, Nimroz, have abandoned their villages because they were unable to meet their basic needs, moving towards the already overpopulated provincial capital of Zaranj, across the border into Iran, or towards Europe, where they face increased protection risks.

The situation for those who have already been displaced by drought and conflict is dire. Many lack access to safe drinking water, shelter or adequate sanitation facilities and diseases such as diarrhoea, as well as malnutrition, are widespread among drought-induced IDPs. Greater leadership from the clusters, particularly at a field level, is required to address this situation.

Whilst resource mobilisation to address these immediate needs has started, the current levels of funding are likely to be insufficient to meet growing needs – especially if more people displace. As such, in addition to providing necessary emergency assistance to IDPs, the aid community must structure the response in a way that ensures both the immediate and longer-term needs of drought-affected communities in their areas of origin are equally addressed. Thereby providing drought-affected communities in their areas of origin with equal access to assistance and helping prevent further forced displacement.

In addition to emergency assistance, resources are required for early recovery and resilience to provide sustainable livelihoods for communities in their areas of origin. The current drought is likely to cause a protracted crisis. The negative impact of the drought on harvests will deprive many families of income and sustenance until the next harvest season and potentially beyond as many families, who have not cultivated this season, will lack seeds to plant for the next harvest – effectively creating a vicious cycle of deprivation for the years to come. Without this investment, the situation for drought affected communities is likely to become more protracted, negatively impacting future harvests, discouraging those already displaced from returning and may cause a further drift into urban centres and provincial capitals increasing the strain on resources on local communities as well as displaced households.

Currently linkages between the mobilised resources for emergency response and longer-term resilience, early recovery and development interventions are severely lacking. Humanitarian and Development donors must work together to strengthen these links and ensure adequate resources for long-term support in response to the drought. In particular, development actors must be engaged from the very beginning of the response to ensure that their investments in agricultural and community-based development projects continue and receive extra-attention to ensure they are sensitive to the impact of the drought. In addition, given the protracted nature of this crisis, the need to promote early-recovery and resilience should be reflected in Humanitarian programme cycle planning and annual updates to the 2018-2021 HRP.

The response must be guided by the principle of ‘Do No Harm’. Emergency assistance to droughtinduced IDPs should be a last resort. Without the additional assistance to drought-affected communities in their areas of origin – humanitarian assistance to IDPs risks becoming a pull factor and encouraging further displacement. This displacement has already caused additional protection concerns linked with the inability to access safe shelter, the lack of safe water, the absence of adequate sanitation facilities. In addition, several incidents of violence and increased tensions between host communities and IDPs have occurred in cities such as Qal-e-Naw, Badghis and Injil, Herat. It is therefore important to involve both host communities and IDPs, from the beginning of any response and where necessary allocate a proportion of resources to target particularly vulnerable host families.

Drought-induced displacement has also increased the protection issues faced by those who have remained in their villages. In Nimroz, up to 30% of males have left their villages to find work in Zaranj or Iran. Without a male family member to act as their Mahram (Guardian), many women and children have decreased mobility in their day to day lives due to existing cultural norms that do not allow for women and children to travel without a male companion, which means that in some cases, they are unable to access medical treatment should they need it. A targeted response in areas affected by drought is required in order to minimise the risk of creating a ‘pull factor’ for displacement, decrease further strain on local communities in urban centres as well as the IDPs themselves, and support those potentially unable to leave drought stricken areas.

Finally, an enabling operating environment is required in order to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of drought-affected communities. Humanitarian access continues to be an issue in many provinces of Afghanistan. All actors, including Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs), must facilitate safe and unhindered access to communities affected by the drought. In addition, NGOs currently face a number of bureaucratic constraints in the implementation of their response to ongoing needs in Afghanistan resulting from conflict, displacement and natural disasters. In particular, the complexity of the current MOU process leads to significant delays in the implementation of current programmes. Given the critical situation, humanitarian actors should be exempt from this process in adherence to article 23 of the NGO law, to operate in lieu of a MOU when a humanitarian crisis such as drought requires immediate, independent, and effective response.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Humanitarian and Development actors must work together to produce a comprehensive, protectionsensitive response strategy to the drought, in both areas of displacement and origin, to respond to the emergency and to support early return and recovery, as well as resilience-building, to be integrated into the multi-year HRP update this year. Donor resources must be made available accordingly Protection risks must be adequately analysed and responded to, through both host and displaced community participation, to prevent recourse into harmful coping strategies, including resorting to irregular immigration into Iran and beyond Cluster Lead Agencies must demonstrate greater leadership, particularly at a field level, to take prompt action by better coordinating responses and more clearly understanding needs, and effectively dealing with potential obstruction from local and national stakeholders.

Context & humanitarian impact of the crisis

Afghanistan is now the scene of the deadliest conflict on earth. Fighting continues to rage, exposing civilians, particularly women and children, to daily deadly risks, prompting mass displacement and choking the country’s unstable economy. Years of shocks have left an acutely vulnerable population with few economic resources, an eroded capacity to cope with the unfolding crisis and little hope of recovery if the current conditions persist.

Scope of the analysis

The Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) is based around a common projected scenario for 2020 which expects the status quo to continue or conditions to slightly worsen over the year ahead. This scenario would see a continuation of the highest levels of violence, protection risks for civilians and ongoing violations of international humanitarian law. In view of the bleak outlook, the Humanitarian Country Team conducted a mid-term review of multi-year planning parameters. It concluded that the scope of humanitarian analysis and action during the past two years in Afghanistan was too restrictive and not aligned with the current trajectory of needs, which have reverted to past levels. It was agreed that due to the continued high tempo of the conflict and the setbacks created by the drought, the current multi-year projections and framework for action required a course adjustment in 2020 and 2021, broadening of the scope of humanitarian action and resulting in a significant increase in people in need.

Humanitarian consequences

The humanitarian consequences of the crisis now affect every aspect of life in all corners of the country. People’s survival and well-being is threatened by ongoing conflict, inflicting high levels of civilian casualties and life-altering traumatic injuries. Afghanistan is the world’s deadliest conflict for children. Around four million people are estimated to live with physical disability.2 Constant exposure to high-stress, conflict situations and repeated loss of friends and family members are taking their toll on the mental health of people living in Afghanistan. Hunger and malnutrition remain at dangerously high levels despite the passing of the drought with 14.28 million people forecast to be in crisis or emergency food insecurity in the first months of 2020. People’s living conditions have been eroded by years of war and disaster. Inability to access services is a key consequence of the crisis and is a product of a range of factors including conflict, insecurity and fear, poverty and under-investment. Across the country, 3.7 million children are out of school and millions of displaced families lack permanent shelters and appropriate sanitation. About one third of the population (mostly those living in hard-to-reach areas) does not have access to a functional health centre within two hours of their home. The country is facing a protection crisis where people’s rights to safety, security and well-being under international law are regularly threatened. Conflict and displacement have resulted in internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable people resorting to severe negative coping mechanisms such as early/forced marriages, child labour and begging. Women and girls are deprived of basic rights, particularly education, and gender based violence is pervasive. Afghanistan is littered with landmines and other explosive hazards (new and old), exposing civilians to daily risks. Insecure housing, land and property rights are a key source of vulnerability for many Afghans, particularly IDPs, returnees and women. The cumulative impacts of decades of war, combined with repeated displacement, grinding poverty, a lack of jobs and crippling debt have eroded people’s resilience and capacity to cope with recurrent shocks. A large proportion of the population now lacks the emotional strength or resources to support their own recovery, perpetuating a cycle of aid dependency.

People in need

As a result of the new scope of analysis and the cumulative impact of conflict and disaster, almost a quarter of the country’s population (9.4 million people out of a population of almost 38 million) is now estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020. The majority of those in need are children (56 per cent). Upward adjustments in needs have been made across every sector with Protection needs showing the largest change (2.4 million in 2019, 7 million in 2020). Looking forward to 2021, the final year of the current multi-year HRP, clusters have projected a similar figure for people in need, based on a continuation of the current security scenario. Overall the PiN figure will decrease slightly to 9 million in 2021.

Severity of needs

The crisis in Afghanistan is now affecting every province in the country with shock-affected households facing multiple humanitarian needs simultaneously, undermining their capacity to cope and recover. In the Whole of Afghanistan (WOA) Assessment, 62 per cent of shock-affected households nationally were found to have concurrent sectoral needs in two or more sectors. Inter-sectoral needs were prevalent across all geographical areas suggesting a necessity for a stronger focus on integrated response across the country. Overlapping sectoral needs were highest among shock-affected households in Uruzgan in the south and Takhar in the north-east. Both provinces have been heavily affected by conflict and displacement, overloading existing basic services and stretching the capacity of aid agencies for a comprehensive response. Shock-affected households in rural areas are significantly more likely to face at least two simultaneous sectoral needs (71 per cent) compared to households living in urban areas (55 per cent).","Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1432243-afg_humanitarian_needs_overview_2020.png?itok=_dN_uzeZ,"['households', '2019', 'crisis', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'current', '2020', 'conflict', 'population', 'humanitarian', 'country', 'overview', 'needs']",

19 November 2019, Kabul/Rome - The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) has contributed $9.5 million to an FAO-led project that aims to boost the resilience of farmers affected by conflict and natural disasters in 16 of Afghanistan's most food insecure provinces, the two partners announced today. Over 10 million people in Afghanistan are now coping with severe acute food insecurity and in need of urgent humanitarian support, according to a report issued last week by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative (IPC).

The new FAO project will work to enhance the resilience against future shocks of over 660,000 people belonging to nearly 100,000 households whose livelihoods have been affected by conflict and natural disasters, with the provision of essential agriculture inputs - in particular improved and certified wheat seed, fertilizer, and training on improved agriculture practices.

This will enable highly vulnerable small farming households to grow wheat during the upcoming cultivation season and contribute to higher farm yields, boosting people's food self-sufficiency and generating surpluses that can be used as seed stock or sold for profit. The AHF is administered by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) under the leadership of the Humanitarian Coordinator.

""The impact of the 2018 drought and 2019 floods, exacerbated by the protracted conflict, has been devastating for smallholder farmers, impeding their ability to cultivate large plots of land or carry over surplus seed stocks for use in future planting. It disrupted local markets as well. This meant zero or little availability of local or improved varieties of seed within local communities,"" said Rajendra Aryal, FAO Representative in Afghanistan.

""This AHF assistance will restore access by food insecure farmers to certified seed for the upcoming season, protecting their livelihoods and the main source of food and income for their families. FAO is extremely grateful to the AHF for this time critical support,"" he added.

Under the project, each beneficiary family will receive inputs sufficient to plant around half a hectare with wheat, allowing them to grow and harvest more than 900 kg of the staple grain. That's enough to cover their household consumption needs for one year as well as possibly generate surpluses.

All told, the AHF-supported FAO distributions are expected to result in a total gross wheat production of 113,200 metric tonnes in 2020.

Deliveries and training will be implemented by FAO in close collaboration with NGO partners of the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster and the Afghanistan's Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock (MAIL) in Badakhshan, Kunduz, Faryab, Sar-i-pul, Samangan, Daikundi, Nimroz, Nuristan, Helmand, Kandahar, Bamyan, Badghis, Farah, Herat, Ghor and Wardak provinces.

""Farmers are key to ensure food production in Afghanistan and yet they have limited access to good quality seeds and other essential farming inputs,"" said Toby Lanzer, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan. ""This time-critical allocation to FAO and partners will protect farmers' livelihoods and enable them to cultivate wheat during the ongoing season, which is vital in fighting the widespread food insecurity that is affecting so many vulnerable people"", he added.

Small farms key to food security, yet highly vulnerable

Around 70 percent of Afghans rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, making the sector critical to poverty reduction and food security. At the same time, most farmers in the country are smallholders (67.5 percent) who work in irrigated plots generally ranging from just half a hectare to a hectare and a half.

Many smallholders in marginal areas of the country are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity and seed insecurity. Their lack of physical and economical access to farming inputs - as well as escalation prices for those inputs - are a large part of the challenge.

Afghan farmers are also affected by declining soil fertility, leading to an increase in the use of marginal and fragile lands. Drought and floods tied to climate change are also a growing threat. In order to build resilience of communities and ecosystems to drought, FAO is also supporting MAIL in the formulation of a long-term national drought risk management strategy.

65,65,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Afghans fleeing conflict face worsening hunger | NRC - Norwegian Refugee Council,https://www.nrc.no/news/2018/june/afghans-fleeing-conflict-face-worsening-hunger/,"“We are concerned that the poorest cohort of Afghan society, particularly those already displaced by conflict, will be worst affected. Displaced people affected by the drought are prevented from reaching markets and aid due to the ongoing armed conflict, said Christopher Nyamandi, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s (NRC) country director in Afghanistan.

Over two million people in Afghanistan are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming months and are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in order to survive, according to the United Nations. The North and West regions are estimated to be particularly at risk due to lack of snow and rainfall leading to dried up water points.

“Rivers and water points started drying up and we couldn’t find any grass. Last month we had to sell all our sheep and goats for 80 to 90 per cent less than what they are worth, and we fled to Qala-i-naw. Those with more money to pay went to Herat, but we couldn’t afford the travel so we stayed in Badghis. Even here, we don’t have water to drink or food to eat. The weather is hot and there is no roof over our heads. Our children are suffering under the sunlight and there is no one to help us,” displaced Abdul Salaam Babi, 35, told NRC staff. He is originally from Muqur district in Badghis province.

In a surveyconducted by NRC in January, one in two displaced Afghans said they could not adequately feed their families, and were often skipping meals. This is an increase from one in three in 2012. Regional differences are stark – with one in four respondents in conflict-affected Kandahar and Nangahar provinces saying they had suffered hunger over the past year, compared with one in six in Kabul.

In hard-to-reach Badghis Province in the northwest of the country, the most food insecure province in the country, NRC is currently assisting Afghans fleeing from fighting in Qadis District to the provincial centre. Over half of the displaced had no food stocks, and the rest had less food than to last them for a full week. 86 per cent of these displaced households had below borderline food consumption scores, with three quarters borrowing food, two thirds going into mounting debts, and a third eating smaller portions and fewer meals. One in four had restricted their own eating so that small children could eat. Prices of basic staples of wheat flour and rice have begun to climb by about 20 per cent, according to a new assessment conducted over the last weeks by NRC.

“The humanitarian crisis is not only a consequence of the severe drought, it is also a sad result of man-made factors. An under-developed irrigation system and the weakening economy is hitting ordinary families hard.

Kabul/Kuala Lumpur/Geneva 28 March 2019 –Ten million people in Afghanistan – more than a quarter of its population – face severe acute food insecurity and need urgent help after floods and drought, say the Afghan Red Crescent Society and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

Three years of drought have contributed to massive crop failure, economic hardship, hunger and loss of life, and forced 266,000 people from their homes. In March 2019, extreme weather deepened extreme hardship, when above normal rain and snow fell on soil with limited vegetation or ability to soak up the water, bringing flash floods to nine provinces, killing 63 people and displacing at least 281,000 to makeshift camps with inadequate services.

Climate change is increasing the hardship for people in Afghanistan. Temperatures are rising, leading to changes in snowmelt, and rainfall is getting more erratic, with an increased risk of floods and droughts. Repeated disasters have eroded people’s capacity to cope.

“Millions of people need both immediate, life-saving humanitarian assistance and a way out of this protracted crisis,” said Afghan Red Crescent Secretary General Dr Nilab Mobarez. “The floods are the latest disaster to bitterly test the resilience of people already stretched to breaking point by drought. It’s extremely worrying because more floods are expected.”

Across many parts of the country, people lack safe water, proper sanitation and healthcare, which contribute to catastrophic levels of malnutrition.

“The floods should be the wake-up call that triggers a massive investment to help people who at the moment are out of sight in an under-estimated, silent crisis with limited access by humanitarian agencies or media,” said Ariel Kestens, IFRC Head of Country for Afghanistan, “They are out of reach because of conflict and out of scope because this is a large, slow-onset disaster, and because many people in need are displaced by disaster.”

On 17 March 2019, IFRC launched an emergency appeal seeking 7 million Swiss francs to support the Afghan Red Crescent Society to provide shelter, health and care; water, sanitation and hygiene; and livelihoods and basic needs for up to 650,000 people (92,500 households) affected by flood and drought for 12 months. The plan also includes disaster risk reduction activities and strengthening the capacity of the Red Crescent. A longer-term resilience-oriented approach will address some of the underlying causes of people’s vulnerability. Examples are water, sanitation and healthcare, agricultural support such as in climate-smart practices and cash-based intervention.","Thu, 28 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pw-AFG1880-LR.jpg,"['afghans', 'crescent', 'water', 'severe', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'weather', 'floods', 'face', 'hardship', 'drought', 'sanitation', 'disaster', 'afghan', 'need', 'red', 'extreme']",

Planned Reach 7.1 million

Requirements (US$) 733 million

Operational Partners 147

The 2020 update to the Afghanistan multi-year Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP 2018-2021) requests US$733 million and aims to reach 7.1 million people who are acutely affected by the humanitarian consequences of the country’s four decades-long conflict, as well as natural disasters. The complexity of needs and response in this environment cannot be underestimated with every one of the crosscutting problems identified in the 2020 Global Humanitarian Overview1 currently affecting the people of Afghanistan.

Due to the continued high tempo of the conflict and the setbacks created by the drought, the HRP’s multi-year projections and framework for action have been reviewed. As part of a course adjustment, a revised, broader definition of humanitarian action is being applied for 2020 and 2021 which more accurately reflects the current scale and trajectory of needs in a highly volatile security environment. The revised response strategy maintains the HCT’s prioritization of emergency needs but also extends the scope of the response to include vulnerable people with ongoing needs for support, as well as people who require resilience and recovery assistance to prevent them slipping into more serious humanitarian need. This will see humanitarians respond to some of the country’s estimated four million protracted IDPs who had previously been outside the plan, as well as more people with specific vulnerabilities such as women who are heading households, people with disabilities and those experiencing mental health issues. Several sectors have included a range of resilience and recovery activities which, while more expensive in the short-term, will create savings and reduced suffering for beneficiaries in the long-term. The result has been a higher number of people in need (9.4 million), a more ambitious plan for reach (7.1 million) and an increased financial requirement ($733 million).

Cross-cutting response priorities for 2020 include continued action on prioritised recommendations from the 2019 Peer-2-Peer mission; an expansion of in-country cash capacity and improved decision-making on the use of cash; piloting of Area-Based Response; expanded thematic preparedness planning; a focus on accountability to affected people; improved monitoring of response coverage; and better analysis of the gender, disability and mental health dimensions of the response. The forging of closer relationships and aligned planning between humanitarian and development actors is also a continued priority under the HRP. Leveraging the relatively expansive footprint and human resources of humanitarian organisations to help vulnerable people bridge to longer-term, sustainable development assistance is a focus for 2020. This was a key lesson learned from the 2018-2019 drought response.

Revised definition of humanitarian action in Afghanistan

Humanitarian action in Afghanistan provides life-saving emergency assistance to people in need, whether they are displaced or not. It also supports the most vulnerable people who are unable to access basic services or ensure their own survival, aspiring to leave no one behind. It aims to preserve people’s dignity, improve their living conditions, and strengthen their coping capacity and resilience. Humanitarian action also assists host communities to cope with accommodating IDPs, refugees and returnees.

Humanitarian action in Afghanistan aims to protect people’s rights and safety under international law and support those with special needs. The humanitarian community responds to people with physical and psychological trauma to foster their recovery and ability to play an active role in society. Humanitarian action opens the way for recovery of vulnerable populations through livelihood, asset- creation, cash-for-work and system-strengthening programmes, bridging people to more sustainable development assistance.

Humanitarian action aims to be integrated, coordinated, principled, rapid, effective and accountable, and guided by multi-year planning. It includes the use of cash where appropriate and aims to address people’s needs across all sectors. The humanitarian community supports affected people to make decisions about the assistance they receive and to safely access complaints mechanisms.","Tue, 31 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/afghanistan-24684_0027%20%281%29.jpg?itok=GyvtNAx3,"['aims', 'recovery', '2019', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', '2020', 'plan', 'response', 'vulnerable', 'humanitarian', 'need', 'revision', 'action', 'needs', '2021']",

Standing in his garden in Kabul, Baz Mohammad Kochi oversees the drilling of a new well more than 100 metres deep after his first water reservoir dried up. He is not alone.

A shortage of rain and snow, a booming population and wasteful consumption have drained the Afghan capital's water basin and sparked a race to the bottom as households and businesses bore deeper and deeper wells in search of the precious resource.

""The water level has dropped so much that it is now necessary to reach other underground basins 100 metres, even 120 metres"" deep, says well digger Mohammad Aman as his dilapidated machine pierces the ochre earth in Kochi's yard.

Every year 80 million cubic metres (2.8 billion cubic feet) of water are extracted from Kabul's aquifers—nearly double the natural recharge rate through precipitation, according to utility Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation.

As a result Kabul's water table has fallen at least 30 metres (100 feet) in recent years, says Asian Development Bank deputy country director Shanny Campbell.

Snow has fallen in the city this month but it is not nearly enough to solve the water shortage—in some areas the level has dropped 20 metres in the past year.

""The problem we have in Kabul is the massive increase in population, impact of climate change and overall less precipitation and snowfall,"" Campbell explains.

Only around 20 percent of Kabul is connected to the city's piped water system, leaving many residents to ensure their own supply by digging wells that are often shared by several neighbours.

Others buy water from private companies, or, like Mohammad Nazir, fill up jerry cans at mosques or more than 400 public taps scattered around the city.

Every year 80 million cubic metres (2.8 billion cubic feet) of water are extracted from Kabul's aquifers—nearly double the natural recharge rate through precipitation, according to utility Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation

""There is no point turning on the taps—there is no water here,"" says Nazir, 50, who lives on a hill where the ground is too hard to dig a well and the city's pipes do not reach.

""It's the worst year we've ever lived.""

Undrinkable

Water is not only scarce in Kabul, but most of it is undrinkable, according to the National Environmental Protection Agency.

Around 70 percent of the city's groundwater is contaminated by waste and chemicals from leaky household septic tanks and industrial plants that can cause diarrhoea or other illnesses if the water is not boiled or purified properly.

Efforts to increase connections to the municipal piped water network and improve sanitation systems are under way.

But progress is slow as authorities struggle to keep up with demand in one of the fastest growing cities in the world.

Kabul's population has more than doubled to around five million in the past 30 years, boosted by the arrival of people fleeing war and poverty.

It is expected to reach eight million by 2050, according to a report published in the Washington-based SAIS Review of International Affairs in 2017.

Kabul's population is expected to reach eight million by 2050, according to a report published in the Washington-based SAIS Review of International Affairs in 2017

Improving living standards for many households also means more people are showering and washing cars than ever before.

A lack of public awareness about water conservation and no restrictions on its usage means much of it is wasted.

While they try to work out how to replenish the city's subterranean reserves, authorities are using a television campaign and the influence of religious leaders to encourage households to save water.

""In our Friday sermons, we call on the faithful not to waste water,"" said Abdul Raouf, a member of the Ulema Council, the country's highest religious body.

As they wait for the first winter snow in the city, worshippers also pray ""for this drought to end as soon as possible"".

Even the Taliban are on board, issuing a statement to followers to ""pray for rain"".

Quick fix

Authorities are not waiting for divine intervention to fix Kabul's water problem.

With droughts, like the one affecting swathes of Afghanistan this year, expected to increase in severity and frequency as a result of climate change, a long-term solution is needed.

Around 70 percent of Kabul's water is contaminated by waste and chemicals from leaky household septic tanks and industrial plants, according to the National Environmental Protection Agency

Among the options being explored by the ADB are ""spreading basins""—large ponds that trap rainwater long enough for it to seep into the soil and recharge aquifers.

The ADB is also looking at using ""pumps to inject the water directly into"" the basins and the construction of a dam on the outskirts of Kabul.

""The answer is not in one technology but in a mixture,"" Campbell said.

""Kabul is under a situation of water stress so we're looking for a solution with lower impact, lower cost technology that could fix the problem quickly.""

That would be welcome news to Kochi, who cannot hide his relief as water gushes out his new well. He knows the borehole could dry up again soon.

""We have survived revolution and civil wars, the Taliban regime and suicide attacks, but this water shortage may force us to leave,"" Kochi says.

""There is no life without water.""

The United Nations has stated that water scarcity — not war — is a rising cause for displacement in Afghanistan. There are 1.5 million Afghans, approximately 4 percent of the population, that are displaced and 448,000 were added in 2017 alone. The U.S. Geological Survey has stated that the groundwater level has, on average, declined by 1.4 mm between 2004-2012, and 22 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces are facing drought today. According to the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), only 27 percent of the Afghan population has access to safe drinking water and 37 percent use sanitation facilities.

Water Scarcity or Crisis?

There are very real ground realities indicating water scarcity; however, in aggregate terms, Afghanistan has an adequate amount of water. There are approximately five major river basins in the state — Amu Darya, Harirud-Murghab, Helmand, Kabul, and Northern — and altogether these are estimated to provide 75 billion cubic meters (BCM) of accessible water. According to Cooperation for Peace and Unity, this averages out to 3,063.1 cubic meters per capita. Furthermore, the Afghanistan National Development Strategy has listed the present usage as 19.08 BCM — which is merely 33 percent of total surface water.

Access to water is not the same as availability of water. The only basin in which 100 percent of water is presently being used is the Northern basin; all others are using less than 60 percent of total available water. Among the drought affected provinces, Bamyan, Daykundi, Ghor, Helmand, Kandahar, Jawzjan, Nangarhar, Nimroz, Nuristan, Takhar, Badghis and Uruzgan have been reported as critical priority for nutrition and water sanitation, and hygiene assistance. The issue of water scarcity is not evenly felt across the state, as geographical constraints provide different realities for people in different areas. The water crisis is further complicated due to seasonal time scale and spatial distribution of water sources. Therefore, Afghanistan is not necessarily naturally water stressed — it is facing a water crisis that has been exacerbated by the mismanagement of its available water supply.

Mismanagement, Climate Change and Geopolitics

The United Nations in 2006 stated that the water crisis is not due to a physical absence of freshwater, rather the mismanagement and lack of investment in water supplies. Three decades of war destroyed much of the water management system that existed in the country. However, with the assistance of the international community, Afghanistan has been rebuilding these systems. The international community providing assistance has primarily focused on rehabilitating and rejuvenating old water networks and systems that were destroyed. However, the World Bank cited that the investment and programs for the Agricultural and Water sector has had modest impact on the “rural economy and improving rural livelihoods.”

The Ministry of Water and Energy reports that 90 percent of total water consumption in the country is for agricultural purposes, which sees more than 50 percent water loss due to inefficient systems of water management — mainly unsustainable irrigation for crop production. There are formal and informal irrigation systems in Afghanistan. The formal systems are large-scale irrigation schemes developed with the assistance of the central government in financing, management, operations, and maintenance. However, 88 percent of the total irrigated area is still done through informal systems of irrigation, which are centuries old and traditionally developed to address water management locally. In informal systems, water management is monitored and administered by traditional water masters called Mirabs. Farmers meet with the local Mirab for a number of different purposes, including discussing irrigation plans as well as resolving disputes — in some cases the Mirabs physically open and close the channels for irrigation.

The Ministry of Water and Energy blames most of Afghanistan’s water crisis on its “vulnerability” to climate change, citing a 62 percent drop in rainwater. Higher average temperatures are also increasing the amount of snowmelt from the mountains earlier in the year. A lack of infrastructure will result in this snowmelt being lost as runoff rather than being stored in reservoirs. With 8 million Afghans currently facing food insecurity, this number will drastically increase with the drought aggregating the food deficit in 2018. Afghanistan is also considered one of the world’s most prone areas to desertification, which is the rising cause of natural disasters such as droughts, floods, soil erosion and landslides.

Furthermore, water is not a national resource — it is a transboundary resource that extends beyond political borders. Afghanistan is not the only state in the region facing shortages of water. Iran, Pakistan, and other neighboring states are also facing water shortages. Therefore, as Afghanistan begins to invest in the management of its water supply by constructing dams, irrigation systems, diversions and other infrastructure at a larger scale, it will alter hydrological relations with neighboring states. Currently, Afghanistan only has one agreement with Iran that was signed in 1973, which outlines the allocation of discharge from Helmand river to Iran year round.

The United States 2011 Water Scarcity report stated that “the U.S. approach could exacerbate regional tensions” if the interconnectivity of water issues between Central and South Asian states is neglected. Thus, the management of water requires a national policy that ensures the most efficient usage and sustainable extraction of water, within a larger international framework that has been negotiated with neighbouring states. It is absolutely essential for the Afghan government to engage in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, through a process known as hydrodiplomacy, which it has been largely absent from. Without this vital process, infrastructure development will be faced with strict obstruction.

Along with worsening conflict and a precarious economic outlook, one of the worst droughts in decades is compounding food insecurity in Afghanistan, especially in the north and west of the country. A La Niña event has caused a rain and snow deficit of 70 per cent this year and the wheat production forecast looks grim. As the drought has worsened, there has been a 45 per cent reduction in agricultural output this year. This is a further fall from 2017’s figures, which saw wheat production fall 57 per cent below the five-year average.

Comment

Afghanistan relies on agriculture as the backbone of its economy. It employs 44 per cent of the workforce and contributes 25 per cent of GDP. In better years, it drives economic growth and provides some form of income to 61 per cent of households. Agriculture could set Afghanistan up for significant economic transformation, if not for its exposure to a series of calamities that have engulfed the country.

The first of those calamities is drought. Though water shortages have not been uncommon in Afghanistan over the last decade, the 2018 drought has been especially alarming. Over 250,000 people have been displaced and a further 1.4 million people require humanitarian assistance, due to poor rainfall. In Badghis province, 95 per cent of cropland has become unusable, as have pastures for livestock. This is made worse by haphazard approaches to water management.

Irrigation, for instance, tends to be practiced in traditional ways, as rainfall is unpredictable, making irrigation central to agriculture. Usually this means using canals. That is by far the most common method in Afghanistan; 75 per cent of crops are irrigated using this way. The use of canals is fine when water is plentiful, but it relies on snowmelt, which has been scarce this year. It also tends to waste significantly more water than many modern methods of irrigation, waste that Afghanistan can ill afford.

Conflict has also had serious consequences for the development of agriculture in Afghanistan. Low rainfall and high temperatures have been the primary driver of the drought, but decades of conflict have also helped shape the conditions that have led to a crisis. Again, irrigation has an important role here. As the fighting has continued, canal management has collapsed. Though recent conflict related damage has not been assessed, irrigated land has declined by more than half since 1978 and many canals no longer deliver water.

Water has also been used as a weapon of war. Allegations recently surfaced that the Taliban blocked the flow of water to farmers to force their compliance with demands. Worsening conflict in 2018 has also been partially responsible for driving down economic growth, causing low rates of employment and high consumer prices. All of this is making access to food more difficult for many people.

Regional developments have also influenced Afghanistan’s economic prospects and affected its access to other suppliers and the availability of food. Iran’s faltering economy has forced 552,000 Afghans out of the Islamic Republic since the start of 2018, many of whom were deported suddenly. Those left in Iran face shrinking incomes due to a shortage of work. That has meant fewer remittances to Afghanistan from Iran, which normally makes up at least 40 per cent of total remittances. Iran is also facing a major drought of its own. Increasingly politicised rhetoric over water sharing on the Helmand River is making it more and more difficult for Afghanistan to effectively utilise its surface water for agricultural development.

It is possible for Afghanistan to improve its food security prospects, but doing so will rely on bringing peace to a war-torn country, prudent economic management, building climate-resilient agriculture, and strong hydro diplomacy. Considering the hurdles that it faces, it is likely that Afghanistan’s food and water security will remain precarious for the foreseeable future.","Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.futuredirections.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/index.ico,"['food', 'water', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'security', 'producing', 'regional', 'afghanistan', 'conflict', 'consequences', 'dire', 'making', 'unrest', 'afghan', 'economic', 'cent', 'agriculture']",

The country’s susceptibility to recurrent, extreme climatic shocks was reinforced in 2018 with what was described by many locally as the worst drought in a lifetime. Several consecutive seasons of low rain and snowfall were compounded during the 2017/18 winter period by a La Niña event. This contributed to a precipitation deficit of more than 70 per cent across many parts of the country. The drought – which impacted 22 provinces in total – had a particularly devastating effect on rural populations, many of whom depend on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. With crops failing and limited water supplies, as well as increased malnutrition and illness, hundreds of thousands of people left their homes to seek help near major cities.

While conflict-induced displacement in 2018 (382,627 people) was 21 per cent lower than in 2017 (483,946 people), displacement due to drought (251,000 people) brought the total number of people displaced in 2018 to more than 635,000, up from 512,000 in 2017. The impact of the drought meant that the number of People in Need (PiN) of international assistance was revised up twice – firstly from 3.3 million people to 5.5 million mid-year, and then to 6.57 million people towards the end of 2018. Based on projections from the Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA) and the IPC (Integrated Phase Classification of Acute Food Insecurity) it was expected that from November 2018 to February 2019, the total population in IPC Phase 3 and Phase 4 (crisis or emergency) would increase to 13.5 million or 47 per cent of the rural population.

The drought created enormous suffering and a number of challenges for the humanitarian response in the country, necessitating a substantial mid-term review of the Humanitarian Response Plan. The response was complicated by the fact that the “cause” of displacement was often a mix of drought, conflict and development issues, including chronic poverty which has reduced coping capacities. There were only limited development or durable solutions provided in the early warning/initial phases of the drought. Similarly, while the drought response was rapidly scaled-up from the third quarter of 2018, activities and durable solutions to address the emerging threat of prolonged displacement in the West were not put in place before the end of the year. As a result, effective implementation of plans to support returns or transition to relocation sites where displaced people can establish durable solutions will be a major challenge for 2019.

Despite the severe impact of the drought and the humanitarian community’s focus on drought-realated needs, conflict actually remained the largest driver of humanitarian need in Afghanistan throughout 2018. Ongoing hostilities across large parts of the country, including ground engagements, aerial operations, and use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) continued to cause extreme levels of physical and psychological harm to civilian populations. In their annual Protection of Civilian Report, UNAMA documented 10,993 civilian casualties (3,804 deaths and 7,189 injured), as a result of the armed conflict, representing a 5 per cent increase in overall civilian casualties and an 11 per cent increase in civilian deaths compared to 2017. An increase in mass casualty incidents, escalating hostilities and the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance all contributed to record-high numbers of trauma cases in 2018.

The situation in 2018 was further compounded by returns of Afghans from outside the country. While returns from Pakistan were at an all-time low, with only 46,300 recorded in 2018, 775,000 Afghans came back from Iran during 2018. This new trend has been driven by a deterioration of the Iranian economy which has caused labour opportunities for Afghans to dry up. Of particular concern was the higher prevalence of vulnerable individuals among returnees from Iran, including unaccompanied minors and single women.

Humanitarian needs are simultaneously exacerbated by chronic poverty, lack of development and access to quality basic services across the country. The most recent Afghanistan Living Conditions Survey (ALCS) estimates that 55 per cent of Afghans lived below the national poverty line in 2016-17 (compared to 34 per cent in 2007-08), which is measured as 93 cents per person per day. The situation is feared to have further deteriorated since that data was last collected, including as a result of drought and 17 years of conflict.

Without addressing these underlying development challenges, Afghanistan will remain vulnerable to humanitarian crisis from natural and political shocks.","Mon, 03 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1306659-afg_hrp_year_end_report_2018.png?itok=715j3tVI,"['drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'including', 'report', 'response', 'plan', 'civilian', 'humanitarian', 'financing', 'achievements', 'country', 'increase', 'challenges', 'cent', 'yearend']",

The deteriorating food security and livelihood situation has continued into 2019, driven mostly by the combination of widespread hostilities, mass displacements, and slow and sudden-onset natural disasters.

Nearly 30 percent of the population is severely food insecure. They have limited food production, depleted assets and livelihoods, reduced incomes and weakened health.

The lingering impact of the drought remains and millions of Afghans are expected to be affected during the second half of 2019.

Record-high floods and landslides affected almost 300 000 people during the first six months of 2019 – a 375 percent increase compared to the previous year.

USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is responding to the crisis with a major airlift of aid, including plastic sheeting, blankets and kitchen sets, to help 10,000 families or 70,000 individuals. IOM is organizing warehousing of the aid and its distribution in Herat and Badghis over the next three weeks.

The first of three C-17 aircraft carrying the aid landed in Herat on Saturday (17/11). Two more aircraft are scheduled to arrive in the coming days.

Ambassador John Bass, speaking at Herat airport, welcomed the airlift. “The United States confirms its continuous support to the Afghan people, and we thank IOM for cooperating with USAID/OFDA in helping thousands of displaced Afghan families,” he said.

Deputy Governor of Badghis Malikzada also welcomed the aid but said that more would need to be done to alleviate suffering caused by the drought. “Assistance also needs to be provided in places of origin through investment in the agricultural sector, so that people can sustain themselves in their places of origin. We do not want to establish camps in urban centres and create subsidized communities that permanently rely on aid for survival,” he said.

So far, 8,341 families have received non-food relief items, including blankets and household items, and 5,031 have received emergency shelter. The assistance was distributed by IOM, UNHCR, IFRC, DRC, IRC and NRC. UNICEF has committed to cover the needs of an additional 3,000 families.

3.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in 20 of the most drought-affected provinces in Afghanistan, UN World Food Programme reported last week.

74,74,DR-2021-000022-AFG,Nine Afghan children killed or maimed daily in world's most lethal warzone - UNICEF,https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/nine-afghan-children-killed-or-maimed-daily-worlds-most-lethal-warzone,"NEW YORK/GENEVA/KABUL, 17 December 2019 – The 40-year-old conflict in Afghanistan is having a devastating impact on children and parties are failing in their duty to shield them from its consequences, UNICEF said in a new report released today.

Preserving Hope in Afghanistan: Protecting children in the world’s most lethal conflict notes that in the first nine months of 2019, an average of nine children were killed or maimed every day. This marks an 11 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2018 and is largely due to a surge in suicide bomb attacks and ground engagements between pro- and anti-government forces.

“Even by Afghanistan’s grim standards, 2019 has been particularly deadly for children,” said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Children, their families and communities suffer the horrific consequences of conflict each and every day. Those same children are desperate to grow up, go to school, learn skills, and build a future for themselves. We can, and must, do so much more to reinforce their extraordinary courage and resilience.”

Between 2009 and 2018, nearly 6,500 children were killed and almost 15,000 others injured, helping make Afghanistan the world’s most lethal warzone in 2018, the report says.

Besides the direct impact of violence, children’s lives are also being blighted by the combined effects of natural disasters, poverty, and under-development, according to UNICEF.

Additional facts from the report include:

3.8 million children need humanitarian assistance;

1 in 3 girls marries before her 18th birthday;

3.7 million school-aged children who are out of school;

600,000 children under the age of five are severely malnourished;

30 per cent of children are engaged in child labour;

400,000 young Afghans enter the labour market each year but many lack the vocational skills necessary to find jobs and livelihoods.

“Young Afghans need to know that their career prospects extend beyond joining an armed group, or escaping the country to try their luck abroad,” said UNICEF Afghanistan Representative Aboubacar Kampo. “With the right support, they can begin to break free of the cycle of violence and underdevelopment and create a better future for themselves and Afghanistan.”

UNICEF is working with the authorities and local communities to address a range of negative social norms. Girls are at risk from honour killings, domestic abuse and sexual violence.

Working through partners, UNICEF is also providing treatment to 277,000 severely malnourished children. But the programme needs to be substantially scaled up if another 300,000 children in need are to be reached.

UNICEF is increasingly using sustainable gravity-fed and solar-powered water systems to help some of the 2.8 million Afghans affected by a severe drought last year. Even so, only 64 per cent of the population have access to improved drinking water that is protected from outside contamination.

All parties to the conflict must fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law, which require them to protect children, end the targeting of schools and health centres and allow access to humanitarian assistance.

Donor support is also critical. UNICEF needs $323 million to support its Afghanistan operations in 2020, of which 75 per cent is unfunded.","Mon, 16 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_desktop/public/UN0280720.jpg?itok=lGsP71kI,"['killed', 'maimed', 'support', 'daily', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'lethal', 'conflict', 'report', 'cent', 'afghan', 'need', 'humanitarian', 'unicef', 'warzone', 'children', 'worlds']",

Key points

• Most households are moving to cities, distress selling livestock, reducing planting area, skipping meals or eating poor quality food. Overuse of these emergency livelihood coping techniques will compromise their ability to recover asset losses and deal with future shocks.

• Without assistance, the food security and livelihood situation will not improve and could deteriorate.

• Affected populations require urgent agricultural inputs in time for the winter planting season and livestock protection for the peak harsh winter months up to February 2019 in the main 12 drought‑affected provinces.

Planned response

• Distribute certified wheat seeds and quality fertilizer to 102 000 households (714 000 people) in December–January

• Distribute concentrated feed and de-worming to 61 200 households (428 000 people) throughout the winter

Poor precipitation during the 2017/2018 winter and early spring in mountainous regions of Hindu Kush are responsible for the severe drought that hit Afghanistan in the first half of 2018, particularly over North-western regions. These areas are for the most semi-arid or arid and rely heavily on melted snow flowing from the mountains for the majority of their water resources.

Due to the low coping capacity of rural communities, the drought caused devastating losses to farmers and herders. Consequently, they faced an actual risk of famine and fled their households towards refugee camps and cities. International aid was required with the utmost urgency. Dust storms and drought related diseases were reported as well.

As most of Western Afghanistan does not receive any precipitation between June and October, the lack of rain and snow in earlier months compromises water supply for the rest of the year. However, October 2018 brought significant rainfall and a wet tendency should persist through the rest of autumn, albeit it is uncertain whether this will benefit displaced communities.","Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1321189-GDODroughtNews201811_Afghanistan.png?itok=G563wuX-,"['water', 'snow', 'analytical', 'precipitation', 'regions', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'communities', 'report', '12', 'winter', 'gdo', 'rest']",

Almost 80,000 of the internally displaced persons are living in Kabul, said Sayed Hussain Alemi Balkhi, the Minister of Refugees and Repatriation.

Balkhi said drought has displaced residents of 20 provinces in the recent years.

“We have 52 camps for displaced families in different parts of Kabul. Nearly 10,000 displaced families are living in these camps. The total number of the displacedpersons in Kabul is between 70,000 to 80,000,” said Balkhi.

Some displaced families from Nangarhar said they are faced with “numerous challenges”.

“Clashes are ongoing in our district. There is no one to collect, transfer and bury those who lose their lives in the clashes. We are faced with various problems at the moment,” said Mohammad Ali, an internally displaced person from Nangarhar’s Achin district.

Ezor Khan, a resident of Achin district, said insecurity forced them to leave their homes two times.

“Achin residents are facing with lots of problems imposed by Daesh. A number of people had to go to mountains to collect bushes of pine nuts, but Daesh fighters killed them. Now no one dares to bring the bodies down to the village,” said Khan.

Ziar Khan, 10, member of a displaced family from Nangarhar, said he has bad memories from the clashes in Achin district. He said he continues his education in Kabul to make his future.

“We are tired of war. We want peace and want to live in a peaceful environment,” said Ziar Khan.

A report by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that an estimated 253,600 people are currently displaced from drought affected areas across the Western Region.

The report says that 2.2 million people have been affected by drought in Afghanistan.

According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian AffairS (OCHA), recently 120,000 people have been displaced only in Badghis province due to droughts.

Among displaced families in the provinces of the Western Region, the situation is even more dire with 82 percent of the families having a poor food consumption score and 72 per cent having had to resort to negative coping mechanisms like reducing food intake or the number of meals, according to the Drought Impact and Needs Assessment (DINA) conducted by OCHA, UNDP and partners.","Mon, 14 Oct 2019 07:43:44 GMT",https://tolonews.com/sites/default/files/Refugees_5.jpg,"['afghans', 'displaced', 'western', 'drought', 'kabul', '300000', 'district', 'residents', 'number', 'families', 'achin', 'united', 'displace', 'insecurity']",

Now entering the 18th year of crisis, humanitarian needs in Afghanistan show no signs of abating. A chaotic and unpredictable security situation, combined with a severe drought, have prompted an almost doubling in the number of people in need compared to this time last year, newly displacing more than 550,000 civilians and pushing 3.3 million into emergency levels of food insecurity. Today, 6.3 million people require some form of humanitarian and protection assistance including 3.7 million in severe and major need due to a convergence of factors arising from exposure to escalating violence, forced displacement, the loss of essential livelihoods and limited access to basic services.

Humanitarian Drivers

Armed Conflict & Protection of Civilians Decades of conflict have trapped Afghan civilians in a pervasive protection crisis.

Ongoing hostilities across large parts of the country, including ground engagements, aerial operations, and an indiscriminate use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are causing extreme levels of physical and psychological harm. Already this year, 98 suicide attacks have taken place, while quarterly trends indicate that 2018 is on track to be the fifth consecutive year in which civilian casualties exceed 10,000. Additional systematic violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL) continue to be reported, mainly by non-state armed groups (NSAGs), ranging from attacks on health and education facilities to targeted killings, and the forced recruitment of children. Fighting creates both an immediate and long-lasting burden for civilians, exposing them to sudden and terrifying violence and leaving them vulnerable to unexploded ordnance, both of which generate significant trauma-related needs. In 2019, it is estimated that as many as 250,000 Afghans will require emergency medical treatment as a result of continued conflict, while nearly 1.8 million people live within one kilometre of areas known to be polluted with explosive hazards that are in need of immediate mine clearance.

Population Movement & Forced Displacement

Political instability, natural disasters, food insecurity and poverty continue to conspire to generate significant numbers of people on the move. So far in 2018, some 550,000 Afghans have been forced to leave their homes either due to conflict or the loss of livelihoods associated with drought.4 While returns from Pakistan are at an all-time low, with only 43,000 recorded so far in 2018, an unprecedented 673,000 Afghans have come back from Iran, many of them under duress.5 Populations forcibly displaced, internally or cross-border, are exposed to a host of protection risks both pre- and post-flight, including insecure tenure, and secondary and multiple displacement. With conflict, further economic decline in Iran and an uncertain political and protection climate in Pakistan all foreseen in 2019, it is estimated that one million displaced people will require lifesaving humanitarian assistance across multiple sectors.

Slow & Sudden-Onset Natural Disasters

In 2018 drought has affected more than two-thirds of Afghanistan, devastating the agricultural sector and leaving some four million people across the worst-affected provinces in need of life-saving assistance, including 3.9 million people in need of food and livelihoods support. The drought has unleashed a host of problems on already impoverished communities, reducing incomes by half, debilitating people’s health and causing households to engage in negative coping mechanisms – all of which have had an adverse impact on their physical and psychological well-being. As of November 2018, some 3.3 million people are experiencing Emergency levels of food insecurity (Integrated Phase Classification - IPC 47), a 74 per cent increase on this time last year, and require responses which help them to protect their assets and livelihoods from further depletion, as well as support their re-establishment. An additional 150,000 people are estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance due to other sudden-onset disasters, including avalanches, landslides and flash floods. In 2019, floods may be more ruinous in their consequences due to the current drought conditions and the predicted El Niño weather pattern which is projected to bring higher than normal precipitation next year.

Access to Basic Services

Active conflict, large-scale population movements, and limited livelihood options continue to disrupt and deprive people of access to essential services, particularly health and education. Already in 2018, around 4,000 hours of healthcare delivery have been lost and 335,000 consultations missed due to the forced closure and destruction of health facilities, as attacks against health workers and medical assets mount in both frequency and deadliness. While limited access to essential services affects all members of the population, internally displaced people (IDPs) and returnees are particularly disenfranchised due to either their loss or lack of appropriate civil documentation. Across the country, other development indicators remain stubbornly low and, in some cases, are declining: in two thirds of Afghanistan’s provinces, the prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) is above emergency thresholds; one in three Afghan children are unimmunised; and ongoing conflict continues to hamper maternal and child health, particularly in rural areas where some 75 per cent of women live. With continued insecurity expected in 2019, it is estimated that some 2.64 million people will require humanitarian assistance due to limited access to services, including 1.9 million malnourished children and nursing mothers. In addition, the use of some 4,500 schools, as well as other civilian infrastructure, as voter registration and polling centres in the presidential elections slated for April 2019, may also make these facilities targets for attack, subjecting them to actual violence or damage, or leading parents to keep children away from school and requiring preventative and protective measures to be put in place.","Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1237043-afg_2019_humanitarian_needs_overview.png?itok=uN63td_i,"['protection', 'forced', 'including', 'million', 'afghanistan', '2018', 'require', 'conflict', 'humanitarian', 'need', '2019', 'needs', 'health', 'overview']",

SITUATION

• Severe drought conditions, conflict, and ongoing population movements are driving food insecurity in Afghanistan, where approximately 4.9 million people are in need of emergency food and agricultural livelihoods assistance, according to the UN.

• Following the 2019 wheat harvest, many households countrywide are experiencing improved access to food and facing Stressed (IPC 2) or Minimal (IPC 1) levels of acute food insecurity, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) reports.* However, the November–December onset of the winter lean season may cause Crisis (IPC 3) outcomes in many areas of the country, especially among households with below-average incomes and those recovering from the 2018 drought that affected nearly all areas of the country, according to FEWS NET. As of September 8, natural disasters had affected more than 294,000 people in 2019, the UN notes.

• Between January and early September, conflict displaced approximately 238,000 people in Afghanistan, according to the UN. In addition to disrupting normal livelihoods activities through displacement, insecurity also affects food security for households remaining in their places of origin by limiting access to labor opportunities and safe areas for livestock and markets.

By Robin Gomes

With an extremely dry winter hitting 22 provinces across Afghanistan, the lives of a million people are critically affected, with children the most vulnerable. Another two million could be affected in the coming months, the United Nations children’s fund, UNICEF has said.

Drought exacerbates malnutrition

Food insecurity and reduced access to safe water are beginning to take their toll in the 10 worst affected provinces, where 20 to 30 percent of water sources are reportedly dry. The impact on children could be devastating, as these areas have pre-existing high rates of malnutrition. Without adequate nutritious food and safe water for drinking, as well as for hygiene and sanitation, UNICEF said, children’s health will only worsen.

“The priority is to prevent the situation from deteriorating, by responding to the needs of children and families in the worst affected areas,” said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Representative in Afghanistan..

Children, pregnant and lactating women

Some 1.6 million children and 443,000 pregnant and lactating women suffer from malnutrition across Afghanistan.

Cases of severe acute malnutrition rise on average by about 25 percent each year in the coming summer months.

Noting that the impact of malnutrition on children can last a lifetime, Khodr underscored the need to provide children and families access to nutritious food, safe water and health services.

According to UNICEF and its partners, 92,000 children and 8,500 pregnant and lactating women are in need of urgent nutrition assistance. An estimated 121,000 acutely malnourished children under five and 33,000 pregnant and lactating women could need life-saving nutrition between July and December this year.

Water, sanitation, hygiene

According to the UNICEF-led water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) campaign, some 875,000 people could need assistance in the next three to six months. UNICEF and partners are scaling up their operations to respond to the emergency nutrition and WASH needs.

Thirteen provinces, out of Afghanistan’s of 34 provinces, received less than 30 percent of their average annual precipitation in the period October 2017 to end February 2018.

The Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) was revised to include response to the drought and now calls for $547 million.

In May, flash floods and flooding affected more than 46,000 people across the country.

In provinces like Kandahar, Helmand, Wardak, Paktika, Zabul or Uruzgan up to 85 per cent of all girls are not going to school.

In 2018, more than 320,000 Afghan citizens have returned from Iran, many of them deported by authorities.

The head of ECHO in Afghanistan speaks in-depth on the humanitarian situation and the importance for aid workers to get out of the “Kabul Bubble”.

Funding for the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF)-Afghanistan is only $18 million so far this year.

Afghanistan HRP revised due to drought

The ongoing drought continues to affect families across the country, notably in the west and north. Under leadership the of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, Toby Lanzer, the Humanitarian Country Team has decided to revise the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) to seek an additional US$117 million for this year. “The drought is a natural disaster; it’s nobody’s fault and now is the moment to help. Without quick action the number of families and gravity of suffering will grow exponentially and that will end up costing us much more, later,” Toby Lanzer said. “I ask the international community to show empathy with the people of Afghanistan and respond now.” The additional funding will allow humanitarian partners to incorporate assistance to 1.4 million people mostly affected by the drought in the sectors of food security and agriculture, water, sanitation and hygiene and nutrition. Altogether, the HRP now calls for nearly $547 million and plans to reach 4.2 million people across the country in 2018.

Farmers with no other option than feeding the ruined wheat harvest to livestock

“Last year I cultivated 560 kilograms of wheat seed and harvested more than double that weight. This year I cultivated 640 kilograms but the complete harvest failed,” Abdul Hakim, 30, from Baghak village in Badghis told OCHA. Like hundreds of other farmers, all he could do is cut the non-germinated wheat to use it as animal fodder.

He and his family were selected as one of 1,400 most vulnerable families affected by the drought and received food rations for two months. The project implemented by World Vision International is funded with $400,000 by the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF)-Afghanistan. Another project funded by the CHF-Afghanistan started in April is providing safe drinking water to more than 70,000 people affected by drought in Badghis.

Mohammad Ibrahim, father of eight and suffering from chronic illness, also had been selected by the NGO for food assistance early in the year but is now running out of food. “We have nothing else to eat to survive. My neighbours cannot help me either, because they also have nothing,” he explained. “I will stay here until I am assisted, or die.”

Worst drought in five decades

“We have had droughts in the past, I remember the dry years of the 1970s,” Abdul Rashid, the head of Community Development Councils in Baghak explained. “But in my whole lifetime, I have not experienced such a severe drought as this year.” The food distributed by World Vision International, he said, had kept families from moving to the cities to seek assistance. “Now, a few months later, several hundred families are considering migrating to Hirat, hoping for assistance from the Government or humanitarians.”","Thu, 31 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/hirat%20garden%20dry%20spell.jpg?itok=TQ0Z0o6A,"['bulletin', 'food', 'hrp', 'affected', 'drought', '76', 'afghanistan', 'issue', '2018', 'million', '31', 'response', 'wheat', 'humanitarian', 'families', 'assistance']",

KABUL, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The heavily drought affected Afghanistan is now recuperating as officials give good news about high estimation of wheat products which have shown increase in the current year against the wheat harvested in 2018.

In the current year, according to the estimation, the total wheat products would exceed 5.1 million tons showing 1.52 million tons increase, compared to last year's wheat products, in the country with over 50 percent of about 35 million population living under poverty line.

Afghanistan's demand for wheat is about six million tons in the current year, and wheat deficit will be around 900,000 in 2019, according to Akbar Rustami, the spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock.

The result of a joint survey conducted by Afghan Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, National Statistics Organization, in cooperation with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Program (WFP) shows that wheat yields will increase by over 42 percent this year.

""With an increase of 42 percent of wheat yields, wheat imports worth 400 million U.S. dollar have been prevented,"" Rostami said a couple of days ago.

In the past several years, severe drought together with rampant conflicts have forced hundreds of households to leave their residence to seek food and shelter in capital Kabul city or safer areas elsewhere in the country.

Increase in wheat products this year, as the estimation shows, will have major impact on the reduction of poverty, the official said, adding every Afghan citizen can consume about 62 kg of flour annually.","Thu, 27 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['food', 'tons', 'recuperates', 'current', 'drought', 'million', 'afghanistan', 'products', 'goes', 'wheat', 'increase', 'product', '2019', 'estimation', 'poverty', 'xinhua']",

For all the billions of dollars spent since the Taliban were ousted in 2001, Afghanistan remains a desperately poor country, lacking basic infrastructure, including electricity and paved roads across most of its territory.

Struggling after decades of war, Afghanistan is now facing an acute food shortage in many regions, with 2.6 million people enduring emergency-level food insecurity, one stage short of outright famine, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.

With his crops failing and his animals dying of thirst, Mahiuddin left Kolari village, in an area under Taliban control, for the more stable province of Herat, joining some 223,000 people displaced in western Afghanistan.

""We were forced to leave our home due to drought. We had no food to eat and no water to drink,"" Mahiuddin said. ""We have lost everything and if we go back to Badghis, what should we do there, since everything is lost?""

The exodus underlines the deep environmental problems facing Afghanistan, much of which consists of dry, rugged and inhospitable terrain subject at various times to both drought and deadly flash floods made worse by deforestation.

International aid groups say that without urgent help, 10.6 million people, more than a quarter of Afghanistan's population, could be ""food insecure"" by next year, with 2.9 million facing emergency-level insecurity.

With much of Afghanistan's agricultural land degraded, and many areas lawless after years of war, food insecurity has added to the suffering without generating the same headlines as the fighting.

Although Herat is one of Afghanistan's more prosperous cities, it cannot provide work for the tens of thousands of new arrivals and its infrastructure is under increasing strain, officials say.

""Drinking water will be a problem next year if the situation does not improve,"" said Herat governor Mohammad Asif Rahimi.

""Herat cannot deal with 50,000 families coming next year.""

COLD KILLS

Aid groups provide emergency assistance of 6,000 afghani($80) for immediate needs as well as help with cooking equipment, tents, tarpaulins and fuel but the thousands camped out in settlements are looking forward with apprehension to the harsh winter months ahead.

""The tent is so cold and I have two small children,"" said Abdul Wakil from the northern province of Faryab, who arrived four months ago at a camp outside Herat.

""I turn to one side to warm up and then turn to warm the other.""

Already the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has reported the first deaths among displaced children because of the cold in Herat and Badghis.

Officials say relief efforts have been hampered by a lack of coordination between central and local government and aid organisations, with displaced people spread out over 10 main camps and dozens of smaller settlements around Herat.

""A lot of people have been displaced and all of them are needy,"" said Ahmad Jawid Nadem, head of the local department of refugees and repatriation, who said resources had been badly strained by the thousands of arrivals.

""Our food stocks are empty and we have asked the central government to provide us assistance. Once we receive help from the central government, we will distribute food to displaced people,"" he said.

This injection of $19.5 million comes at a critical time when aid agencies were running out of funds to continue their life-saving work,” said Toby Lanzer, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Afghanistan.

This allocation from the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund will enable non-governmental organisations and UN agencies to provide:

education for 41,000 school-aged children, integrated with protection, water, sanitation and hygiene services;

shelter and core relief items for 97,800 people;

food and agriculture support for 242,900 people;

therapeutic foods to treat severe acute malnutrition for 30,500 children;

services that help 91,800 people, including children and survivors of gender-based violence.

“I thank the people of Australia, Canada, Germany, Norway, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom who enabled their governments to contribute to the fund, thanks to which we can now help keep alive malnourished children, provide shelter to displaced families and help farmers get back on their feet after the drought,” continued Lanzer.

About the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund

The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) Afghanistan was established in 2014 for swift and needs-based emergency response in Afghanistan. Under the leadership of the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the AHF supports the timely allocation and disbursement of donor resources to the most critical needs.

86,86,DR-2021-000022-AFG,UK pledges £35m to Afghanistan as food crisis worsens - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/27/uk-pledges-35m-to-afghanistan-as-food-crisis-worsens,"The UK government has announced £35m of new funding to help the growing crisis in Afghanistan as a new report warns that almost half of the rural population – 10.6 million people – are likely to be affected by severe food insecurity.

The report, by independent multi-agency body the IPC, highlighted the spread of conflict and the ongoing drought which has displaced over 250,000 people, impacting Afghan incomes and leading to widespread malnutrition among children. Coupled with high food prices, there is significant cause to believe that extensive suffering could lead the country deeper into a humanitarian crisis. In a country where 20 million people rely on farming, the drought has caused a 45% drop in agricultural output this year, according to the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture.

Announcing the initiative, the UK international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said “This deadly drought is already affecting millions of Afghans, many of whom have had to leave their homes and livelihoods in desperate search of basic necessities. UK aid will provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of Afghans, including food, clean water, and tents.”

Calling for an international response to avert the crisis Mordaunt said: “Other donors must do more if we are to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe.”

She said that the initiative will provide tents and urgent relief items for up to 260,000 people, food or cash transfers to buy essential items for up to 602,660, with a monthly ration of special nutritious food to prevent malnutrition in young children, and access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation for those affected by drought.

DfID explained that funding for the initiative will consist of £25m from their crisis reserve fund in addition to £10m already provided this year, bringing UK expenditure on the humanitarian response in Afghanistan to £67m.

A separate report also highlights the ongoing debate over the transparency and effectiveness of US efforts to assist in rebuilding the country’s infrastructure.

“The Afghan government now controls or influences the lowest proportion of its own territory since they began monitoring this data in November 2015,” according to the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar), which published details of an audit into US efforts to rebuild Afghanistan’s infrastructure.

The report points to a lack of planning, monitoring and evaluation by the US Department of Defense (US DoD) over four contracts worth $1.62bn (£1.26bn) awarded to DynCorp International to provide contract advisors at the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Ministry of Interior (MoI). Two of the four contracts, valued at $421m, are due to expire this month.

The supposed lack of transparency has allegedly been caused by frequent changes to the rating systems used to measure progress. Between January 2015 and December 2016, 96% of plans and milestones for the Afghan MoD changed and 86% of those for MoI, making it almost impossible to gauge effectiveness and impact of US support.

One area of concern is the lack of training, highlighted as “an important aspect that must be addressed,” by a former combined security transition commander. Reports suggest that there is limited tracking of staff transferred to advisory roles once deployed to the region, leading to questions of suitability and experience. This is coupled with the lack of training standards, with little or no training reportedly being given to uniformed US staff arriving on deployment to help them perform their roles. A recent survey by Sigar revealed that 45% of uniformed staff had received no advisor training before deployment.

When asked, the central command for the US DoD were unable to provide staff training statistics to Sigar, stating they did not retain data relating to who and when staff were trained, leading to questions over the quality of service being offered to Afghanistan.

Flooding caused by heavy rains started spreading on Thursday and left a trail of devastation across seven provinces, said Hasibullah Shir Khani, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Disaster Management Authority.

Another 12 people were missing and more than 700 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, he added.

The floods worsen an already desperate situation. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced in the region by last year’s severe drought and the 17-year-long war with the Taliban.

Floods in early March caused further destruction and put this year’s wheat harvest at risk.

“My house and my farmland have been destroyed by floods. If you go and see the destruction it makes you cry,” said Shir Ahmad, who lives in a village in Herat province, which borders Iran.

Children waded through muddy, knee-deep floodwaters that flowed through tent camps for displaced people after the rain stopped. Some families strung salvageable clothes and bedding to dry.

Floods have destroyed hundreds of homes, some historic sites, thousands of acres of farmland, bridges and highways, said Jilani Farhad, a spokesman for the province.

Floods are a common occurrence in Afghanistan, although not usually this severe. The country has little infrastructure, such as ditches and sewers, to manage water run-off from rain or melting snow.

“There is huge destruction caused by floods,” said Ahmad Jawed Nadem, head of refugees and repatriation for Herat. In one area, he said he saw more than 200 destroyed houses.

In Herat alone, eight people were killed, said Dr. Abdul Hakim Tamana, head of public health for the province.

“They had the drought problem, and the floods and the conflict. They are very poor people and they lose all they have,” the Afghan Red Crescent Society’s secretary general Nilab Mobarez said.

“It’s not as simple as they will go on with their lives.”

World Vision said it appeared tens of thousands of Afghans were affected. Some residents of Badghis province were calling it the worst storm in 20 years, it said.

Iran has also been flooded by torrential rains, overwhelming emergency services in some areas.","Sat, 30 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190330&t=2&i=1371737621&r=LYNXNPEF2T06L&w=800,"['situation', 'displaced', 'kill', 'destruction', '32', 'spokesman', 'shir', 'caused', 'afghanistan', 'floods', 'worsen', 'destroyed', 'herat', 'thousands', 'desperate']",

KABUL, Oct. 22 (Xinhua) -- Harsh poverty and rising unemployment have spread across Afghanistan as the prolonged conflicts and fighting in the country, as well as drought and a decline in agribusiness, added to the miseries of the war-weary Afghans.

More than 2,790 civilians were killed and over 5,250 others injured in conflict-related incidents in the first nine months of the year in the war-torn country, according to figures released by the United Nations mission in the country.

Almost 54 percent of the country's population of more than 30 million currently live below the poverty line, according to the latest information provided by the Central Statistic Organization of Afghanistan earlier this year.

Afghan Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) Nasir Ahmad Durrani said recently that the government plans to provide support for the most needy families, but said the government alone could not fully tackle the nation's poverty problem.

Durrani said the ministry was working on six specific issues to help with food security in the land-locked country.

""For the eradication of famine, lasting food safety and reaching Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SGD2) targets, the MAIL plans involves direct links to food safety resources, such as animal husbandry or in the area of increasing the yields of wheat, rice and other agricultural harvests.""

""This, as well as raising the standard of fruit and vegetable products,"" added the minister.

According to Durrani, the growth of agricultural products, supporting farmers, raising the agricultural and husbandry product quality, rising the value of agriculture and livestock chain products, and reviewing current agricultural policy in light of climate change, are among the factors and work that has been done by the ministry.

The ministry has distributed up to 119 tons of wheat among the needy and vulnerable people in 25 of the country's 34 provinces, he said.

Some 60 tons of wheat has also been made available to the World Food Program (WFP) to be changed into flour, by adding some needed ingredients in cooperation with the local and international aid agencies to be distributed among 1.4 million needy people, said Durrani.

The latest food distribution plans come as up to 20 of the country's 34 provinces have been affected by the drought, and Afghan officials have predicted that around 3 million people will be in need of aid until the end of this year.

In another effort to help the needy people, the United Nations has allocated 34.6 million U.S. dollars to support drought-affected Afghans, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said.

The fund will help seven national non-governmental organizations (NGOs), 15 international NGOs and four UN agencies ""to distribute food and seeds, maintain primary health services, provide emergency shelters, safe drinking water, improve hygiene and sanitation, treat severe malnutrition, and help farmers protect their livestock,"" the OCHA said.

The Afghan unemployment rate has risen 2 percent to 27 percent in the last Afghan year, which ended on March 20 this year, with the number of jobless people keeping growing while private investment continues to decline.

Afghans hope that the just-concluded parliamentary election and the following presidential election which is slated for early next year will bring positive changes to the living conditions of poor people.","Mon, 22 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",,"['prolonged', 'food', 'nations', 'help', 'rising', 'drought', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'products', 'wheat', 'united', 'needy', 'poverty', 'agricultural', 'amid', 'conflicts', 'xinhua']",

1. Summary of needs to be addressed by the cluster

Afghanistan remains one of the poorest and least developed country. Severe impact of the climate change, cross border movement, conflict, poverty caused by lack of proper structures and lack of basic services continued to affect poor people across the country. Despite the past decade of international assistance, severe poverty, inequality and instability remain entrenched. Approximately, 54% of Afghans lives below poverty line and struggle to meet their basic requirements resulting in chronic malnutrition, high level of food insecurity, and one of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates globally. This chronic situation of people exacerbates the humanitarian crisis which has become more intense and more geographically extensive.

Food insecurity in Afghanistan is on the rise because of various humanitarian and structural under-development causes. The recent Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA 2018) verified the results of Afghanistan Living Condition Survey (ALCS) where food insecurity and poverty were rated extremely high. Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) 2018 classified 13.5 million of the rural population (38%) in crisis and emergency (IPC phase 3 and 4) phases in projected period between November 2018 to February 2019. Only people classified in IPC phase 4 reaches to 3.6 million. The estimate corresponds to 13% increase (from 27% to 40%) in number of people falling under IPC phase 3 and 4 in comparison to 2017. Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) estimated 4.9 million people in immediate need of food and livelihoods assistance in 2019.

2017/2018 drought has been one of the main drivers of food insecurity in the country. According to emergency food security assessment (EFSA) 2018, out of the total 17 million rural population residing in 22 drought affected provinces, around 10.5 million people (3.9 million highly and 6.6 million moderately) were affected by drought. 66% of severely food insecure people are living in 22 highly drought affected provinces. West region is the worst drought affected region where almost 300,000 people already left their homes after depleting their assets. Drought Impact Need Assessment (DINA) result shows that food consumption score of 82 per cent of drought displaced people was poor, 13 per cent borderline, and only 5 per cent was acceptable. In Afghanistan, the winter wet season is critical for successful agriculture and food production throughout the year. Drought significantly impacted the crop production, fodder, local pastures and income of the agriculture labor. Agriculture prospect report of the MAIL shows 6 percent reduction in irrigated and 71 percent reduction in rainfed land production for 2018. For 2019 above, average precipitation and above average temperature is forecasted by the science partners which will reduce the pressure of drought in some areas but there is very high probability of floods affecting almost same vulnerable communities.

Conflict remained the second largest driver of humanitarian needs during 2018. Despite increase in conflict, there were less number of conflict affected IDPs across the country during 2018 as compared to 2017. As per various assessments conducted in different areas, food insecurity remains very high among conflict affected IDP’s. Food security and agriculture cluster projected 350,000 conflict affected IDP’s in need of food assistance out of a caseload of 500,000 as per the last 5 years trends data.

Cross border movement remained the third largest driver of humanitarian needs during 2018, and a different trend of Afghan’s returnees was observed from Iran. Nearly 700,000 economic migrants came back to Afghanistan as Iran is facing a high level of depreciation in currency and severe drought resulting in low job opportunities and less income for Afghan migrants. Around 114,000 among the total returnees from Iran in 2019 may need food and livelihood assistance.

According to the findings of EFSA 2018, households experienced different shocks which resulted in reduced income (11 percent), loss of employment (27 percent) and conflict displacement (9.4 percent). IPC 2018 classified Badghis, Kandahar, Nuristan, Daikundy and Badakhshan in IPC level 4 (emergency) under its current and project periods.","Mon, 08 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1402358-fsac_response_plan_2019_final.png?itok=yauToC2k,"['food', 'fsac', 'ipc', 'high', 'affected', 'drought', '2018', 'afghanistan', 'million', 'security', 'conflict', 'plan', 'response', '2019', 'srp', 'insecurity']",

Over 260,000 people have so far been displaced by drought across four provinces in western Afghanistan and Herat province is one of the worst affected areas.

This is one of the worst drought Ghulam could remember. As winter arrives, temperatures at night is dropping down to close to zero degree centigrade.

""Some nights none of these families here have any food, we go sleep hungry and cold. We all have lost so much to this drought."" ----Ghulam

HEALTH RISKS

The drought is yet another burden on a country still wracked by violence. With a fragile health system, the displaced people are faced with a significant shortage of primary health services. The risk of communicable diseases is very high in displacement camps, as well as areas of origin for those affected by drought. Cases of acute watery diarrhea are affecting more than 40 percent of households in displaced sites. Measles are more prevalent than previously reported. Existing health services are unable to cope with the increase demand in the areas of origin and are now out of essential medicines and supplies.

MOBILE CLINICS

Dr. Salehi works at the mobile clinic in one of the informal settlements on the outskirts of Herat city.

""Pneumonia and diarrhoea are common here. Eye infections and skin diseases are on the increase because of lack of water, measles, colds can spread quickly because people are malnourished, their immune system is weak, and we are their only source of healthcare."" Said Dr.Salehi.

NEW MOTHER Aliah came to Herat city from Ghor province. She brought her six months old baby to the mobile clinic for assessment of malnutrition. Mothers are often given iron and vitamin supplements and instructions about their health condition. The services are still far from enough. ""We've seen women often come in with birth complications and the closest healthcare centre is more than an hour's drive away,"" says Fatima, a midwife, ""with the drought, some small complications became serious.""

42% of the households in drought affected districts report a total lack of antenatal care.

WHO IN DROUGHT-HIT AREAS

More than 45,000 people have received health services under the Health Cluster led by WHO. ""We are providing all possible support to address the ongoing challenges. We support the Basic Package of Health Services for implementers to begin rapid responses to areas of greatest threats. We are sending medicines and medical supplies to health facilities in prioritized drought-affected areas."" Says Dr. David Lai, the Health Cluster coordinator at WHO afghanistan, who visits the drought-hit regions regularly to assess the situation.

""This really is a coordinated effort among different agencies, and we've had a lot of support from different donors. For example, the Republic of Korea has been supporting the Health Cluster to help the Afghans who are in dire need during this drought. ""

GHULAM’S FAMILY PLAN

Fara is one of Ghulam’s daughter-in-law. This morning, she brought her 6 months old daughter to mobile health facility supported by WHO. ""If we had any money we would have never come here. Our bad luck brought us here,"" she says. Her daughter is being treated for diarrheal disease. Her other son, who is 3 years old is in hospital being treated for severe acute malnutrition.

Ghulam and his family are stuck. They don't know where they can go next or what would happen to them. While the government of Afghanistan has a plan is in place to move some of the displaced to a more stable site gradually, winter has arrived. More food is needed, better health services have to be provided for those in Herat and other provinces affected by drought.

DTM also tracks the outflow of IDPs returning to their places of origin or into secondary displacement.

Over the reporting period, 3 flow monitoring points (FMPs) have been discontinued (Shedaye, Band Pashtun and Karokh), due to overwhelming numbers of opportunistic, long-term IDPs and host communities arriving at FMPs, attempting to take advantage of presumed distributions.

OSLO, Aug 30 2018 (IPS) - Amid a precarious security situation in Afghanistan, the worst drought in recent history that hit two out of three provinces in Afghanistan in July has destabilised the lives of tens of thousands of civilians, some of whom have already been displaced.

The United Nations has predicted that over two million people are expected to become severely food insecure in the coming period.

The West Region of conflict-stricken Afghanistan has been hardest hit by the drought, and over 60,000 people have been displaced to Herat and Badghis provinces, as a result.

Families that fled to Herat are living in dire conditions in makeshift shelters, where they are exposed to the scorching sun and summer temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius. Many families are subsisting on a single meal a day. Many get by on just bread and water.

Herat has become the closest refuge for about 60,000 people, who have been displaced from their homes due to the drought. Conflict has also prompted many to flee their homes to the relative safety of province.

Over 1700 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the first half of 2018, according to UNAMA. It is the highest recorded number, compared to the same periods for the past decade. The combination of drought and conflict has made tens of thousands of families destitute. They live with few long term prospects or means of regaining stability.

Among the most vulnerable are women and children. Many of the children show visible signs of malnutrition and illness, including skin diseases and eye infections due to dust and the hot weather.

Ayesha Halima is one of thousands of such children, who fled her home for Herat. Leaning against the wall of a distribution center, she patiently awaits her next meal, as her mother moves through the growing crowd to get their rationed supplies.

The lack of sufficient nutrition is visible in the pallid faces of children like Soraya Hawa Gul and FatimaPari Gul, who have become neighbors in Herat. They bake bread together in a clay oven in the open air. The mothers make about ten loaves of bread a day, which they wash down with boiled water or tea.

“We cook together because we share a bag of flour,” said Hawa Gul. “Neither of us could afford a bag of flour alone. We have spent all the money we had and have taken many loans from relatives.”

Given such meagre resources, the unconditional cash grants from ECHO and NRC have become life-lines for tens of thousands of the impoverished households. Despite the rapidly deployed assistance, drinking water, food and medical supplies are falling short.

The blazing temperatures are testing the endurance of those who are in the IDP settlements. Many people are suffering from dehydration, with children and older IDPs particularly susceptible. With few water resources around, drinking water is a prized commodity in the settlements.

“We can’t get enough water to drink or to clean ourselves and our clothes,” displaced Afghans in Herat told staff of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “There hasn’t been any change to our life situation. We fled our homes because there was no water and it is the same here. At least we a had shelter back home in Badghis.”

With illnesses such as diarrhea, skin diseases and eye infections on the rise, many children are in need of comprehensive medical care. One-year-old Ahmad Mohammed has diarrhea, and a skin and eye infection. He lives in a makeshift shelter with his family after they were forced to leave their home in Badghis city/region/province. “It’s been 70 nights since we arrived. My children and my wife are all sick, and I don’t have the money to buy them enough food or medicine,” Mohammed’s father Ziauddin told NRC.

Shelter is another pressing issue, with families residing in makeshift shelters for the time being. While protection from the scorching sun and the high summer temperatures are the present concern, staying warm and winterisation of homes will become a need, if they remain displaced into the winter months.

But, despite the challenges, women like 57 year old Khanim Gul, who have been displaced several times, show remarkable resilience. Gul was forced to leave her family behind in Badghis. “This isn’t the first year we are suffering from drought. Last year we had almost nothing on the table. This is the fifth tent that I am setting up – the heavy wind keeps tearing it apart,” she said.

Amid the struggles of daily survival, protection has been scant, with women and girls facing heightened risks of harassment and gender-based violence. In the absence of regular schooling and safe spaces where they can grow, learn and play, children are more prone to child labour and child marriage.

Amid scarce resources and lack of livelihood opportunities, including daily labour, many of the displaced men in Herat try to travel to Iran in search of work.

With regular wages a far-fetched notion for most of the displaced populations, Karim is counting his blessings these days. With loans from family members, he has set up a vegetable stall and sells onions and potatoes to the rest of the displaced community near his tent in Herat.

For thousands of families displaced from Herat the few items they carried on their backs are the only remnants of their homes. For many, this is not the first instance of leaving their homes and belongings because of drought.

While news of peace talks and bombings in Afghanistan make the headlines, the IDP communities suffering chronic, long term displacement feel “forgotten” by their government and the international community. They are in desperate need of long term assistance.","Thu, 30 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/halima.jpg?itok=RNpE9GxF,"['water', 'gul', 'afghanistan', 'afghans', 'drought', 'families', 'droughtrelated', 'homes', 'children', 'chronic', 'displaced', 'millions', 'amid', 'risks', 'violence', 'face', 'displacement', 'thousands', 'herat']",

The Afghanistan Opium Surveys have been implemented annually by the Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MCN) of Afghanistan in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In February 2019, the Ministry of Counter Narcotics was dissolved during the re-organisation of the Afghan government. This report is therefore the last joint MCN/UNODC Afghanistan opium survey report. The opium survey of the 2019/2020 season is being conducted by the Afghanistan National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA) in partnership with UNODC.

The Afghanistan opium surveys collected and analysed detailed data on the location and extent of opium poppy cultivation, potential opium production and the socio-economic situation in rural areas. The results provide a detailed picture of the outcome of the 2018 opium season and, together with data from previous years, enable the identification of medium- and long-term trends in the evolution of illicit opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This information is essential for planning, implementing and monitoring measures required for tackling a problem that has serious implications for Afghanistan and the international community.

The implementation of the survey would not have been possible without the dedicated work of the field interviewers, who often faced difficult security conditions.

The Afghanistan Opium Surveys 2018 were implemented under project AFG/F98, “Monitoring of Opium Production in Afghanistan”, with financial contributions from the Governments of Japan and the United States of America.","Tue, 30 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1337454-Afghanistan_opium_survey_2018_socioeconomic_report.png?itok=MP2PtskN,"['production', 'poppy', 'security', 'afghanistan', '2018', 'season', 'report', 'peace', 'narcotics', 'survey', 'united', 'surveys', 'sustainable', '2019', 'challenges', 'development', 'opium']",

Drought grips large parts of Afghanistan

A drought is affecting two out of three provinces across Afghanistan with more than two million people expected to become severely food insecure and in need of humanitarian assistance for survival.

Below average snowfall and a precipitation deficit of 70 per cent has been registered in most parts of the country, due to La Niña conditions (see Bulletin 71, December 2017). This has compromised the main wheat planting season of 2017/2018 that lasted from October to February for the fifth year in a row.

Water points and fountains across the country have dried up and the lack of rain and snow melt has made rivers run low or dry up completely. Faced with the lack of water, farmers have chosen to minimise their losses by delaying planting crops and reducing field sizes. “In many cases there was nothing farmers could do but watch the seeds dry out,” said Abdul Majid, the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC) Coordinator of UN FAO. “The drought has already negatively and irreversibly impacted the winter agricultural season of 2017/2018 and is expected to also negatively impact the 2018 spring and summer agricultural season. The last harvest must be considered completely lost.”

Winter harvest lost, livestock and livelihoods of thousands of families in peril

The lack of water also affects farmers with livestock and pastoralists like the nomadic Kuchi tribe as pasturelands have partially or completely dried up or are overgrazed, leaving flocks with little or no feed. “Pastures are overfed and animals are eating the plants down to the roots where they can still find them,” said Abdul Majid.

The condition of animals has deteriorated and reduced their milk production which has led to distress sales and death of livestock: sheep prices have decreased from 25 to 40 per cent across the country while fodder prices have doubled. “The animals are too weak to walk to their usual pastures in Badakhshan province and herders have to rent trucks to bring them there,” explained Mr. Majidi, the Head of Agricultural Department of Kunduz Province.

Some 1.5 million goats and sheep in the North-Eastern Region are struggling to find food and more than 600 out of nearly 1,000 villages in the province are suffering from the lack of water.

The most affected are small livestock holders with ten animals or less. These families are at high risk of food insecurity as once their flocks are drastically reduced, the core breeding animals may be endangered and whole livelihoods are at risk.

Some communities in Hilmand Province have also reportedly started to use their irrigated fields as pastures as a coping mechanism – potentially saving their animals but in consequence not planting crops that could get them through the next lean season.

Conflict exacerbates the effects of the drought The intensified conflict across many parts of the country exacerbates the effects of the drought and has limited the communities’ access to markets: in Hilmand, village elders reportedly need to obtain special approval from the armed groups controlling their districts to access markets in areas under Government control.

In Uruzgan Province, people often cannot access the main market in Tirinkot due to fighting and insecurity on the roads to the provincial capital. Following a temporary closure of the road to neighbouring Kandahar Province in April due to fighting, wheat prices went up by 50 per cent in the city itself, and the price for fresh produce quadrupled within days.

First migration movements due to the drought in the Western Region At the beginning of May, the first migration movements were reported from Badghis and Ghor provinces to Hirat City, Hirat Province, due to the drought and depleted food stocks of families. By mid-May, more than 21,000 people had been assessed by humanitarian partners and verified as having migrated due to the drought.

Mohammad Aman from a village in Badghis is one of the people who was forced to leave his home.

He used to work the land of a landowner but the drought destroyed the crops, killed all the animals and left his employer unable to feed his own family, let alone pay Mohammad Aman’s salary.

The fifty-year old saw no other option than to go to the provincial capital Qala-e-Naw, hoping to find work in the city or assistance. “My entire family’s eyes are on my empty pockets and my inability to buy bread to fill their bellies,” he said. “It is difficult for a father so see his children going hungry.” His family was selected for emergency assistance and received wheat flour, rice, oil, sugar, pulses and salt from World Vision International (WVI) as part of a project to support more than 1,800 vulnerable families in Badghis funded by the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF)-Afghanistan.

Humanitarian partners are gearing up, need $115 million for six-month response

In the 20 provinces most affected by the drought, nearly 15 million people rely on farming, livestock or labour opportunities in agriculture. Of these, an estimated 2 million people will become severely food insecure due to the drought. Humanitarian partners are ramping up their response across the country (see map next page), trying to reach 1.4 million of the most vulnerable girls, boys, women and men struck by the drought. Partners urgently need $115 million; the majority of this amount will provide food support to help families through the lean season and to provide them with drinking water for six months.

A quick, comprehensive response will enable the delivery of food and water to the rural villages and help to avoid the migration of families to cities where they risk losing all of their few possessions, and where they lack shelter and access to health facilities and schools for their children.","Fri, 25 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/headline-images/CVE_4872_0.jpg?itok=126F8GvY,"['bulletin', 'food', 'livestock', 'drought', '75', 'afghanistan', 'issue', '2018', 'million', 'animals', '30', 'partners', 'humanitarian', 'province', 'families', 'lack', 'need']",
