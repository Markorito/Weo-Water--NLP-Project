As the West moves more into a record-setting drought, many are taking a look at how water gets used. Alfalfa grown with Colorado River water is a case study of how and why water gets used as it does.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Who knew a solution to America's trade imbalance with China could be found by mixing desert soil with water? What you get is alfalfa. It used to be alfalfa hay stayed local. Dairy cows ate it that produced milk for Americans. But recently, alfalfa has been satisfying a demand for dairy products in China's growing middle class. Ted Robbins has the story.

TED ROBBINS, BYLINE: The sun is coming up on the Wellton-Mohawk Valley near Yuma, Arizona. When the cut alfalfa smells like a freshly mowed lawn. Farmer Dave Sharp is waiting for the right time to bail it.

DAVE SHARP: If you'll feel this hay right here, you can feel the moisture in it. You can feel the toughness in it. See, it won't break when I - when I work it. That is too tough - too tough - got too much moisture in it.

ROBBINS: When it's a little dryer, Dave Sharp's high protein hay will be a dairy cow's dream.

SHARP: Little bit of time. We'll give it a little bit of time, and then we'll be ready to go.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)

ROBBINS: A few hours in the desert heat, and the alfalfa is ready. Balers move up and down the field, raking the hay and compressing it into big blocks - eight feet long, 1,400 pounds each. Then it's double compressed.

SHARP: It gets pushed into our hay compression machine, which compresses the hay to a smaller density.

ROBBINS: Jim Ohland is general manager of Kuhn Hay in El Centro, California. He supervises the process which made it feasible to send what used to be a local crop around the world. It's even shrink-wrapped.

JIM OHLAND: Exact same thing that a Pepsi-Cola or Budweiser or anybody uses to palletize a product. Only thing we don't do is put it on pallets.

(SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)

ROBBINS: That alfalfa makes its way on trucks to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Here, the containers which bring furniture, auto parts and electronics to this country are loaded with hay for the return trip to China. Because those containers would otherwise go back empty, it's actually cheaper to transport alfalfa from here to Beijing than it is to drive it north to California's Central Valley.

This is where our story about trade becomes a story about water. Farmers in much of the drought-stricken southwest are having trouble getting enough water to grow crops. But there's one place water is still plentiful - the region growing alfalfa near Yuma, Arizona, and just west in California's Imperial Valley.

That's because water here comes from the Colorado River, from high in the Rockies, 1,000 miles away, downhill through one of the largest water storage projects in world history to farms like Ronnie Leimgruber's.

Leimgruber sticks a shovel in the handle of a steel irrigation gate about the size of a large dog door. He yanks it up. When he opens a gate, water floods one of his alfalfa fields. He jogs down the side of the irrigation ditch, opening one gate after another.

This water turned a place which gets just three inches of rain a year into one of the most productive farming regions in the country. But that water supply is threatened by climate change and long-term drought. Lake Mead is hovering at half its capacity.

Robert Glennon is a law professor at the University of Arizona and the author of ""Unquenchable - America's Water Crisis And What To Do About It."" Those containers filled with alfalfa headed for China - he says, they might as well be filled with massive amounts of fresh water.

ROBERT GLENNON: In 2013, that was in excess of 100 billion gallons of water. And most of that is from California, and California is suffering through the worst drought in memory.

ROBBINS: Glennon says, exporting more and more alfalfa is unsustainable - a classic example of an economic dilemma known as the tragedy of the commons. Centuries ago, farmers in Europe grazed their cows on common ground. Each farmer acted rationally in their own self-interest, but together they depleted the common resource -grass. In this case, self-interest is a record high price for alfalfa. The common resource is water.

GLENNON: We've allowed limitless access to a finite supply.

ROBBINS: Agriculture uses 80 percent of Colorado River water. Cities want more of it. But there's no incentive for farmers to conserve water. Under the Byzantine law of the river, farmers like Dave Sharp don't even have the option to use less water. If he doesn't use his allotment, he loses it.

SHARP: I can market it. I can't move it. I have an entitlement to use the water that the irrigation district has - the rights. But I don't have ownership of that that I can sell it, lease it, move it - whatever I want.

ROBBINS: People like Robert Glennon say, it's time to relax the rules - help farmers conserve water. One option...

GLENNON: Temporary suspension of summertime irrigation.

ROBBINS: Stop growing alfalfa during the heat, when it uses much more water than in cooler months. If Colorado River basin farmers can reduce their overall use by just six percent, Robert Glennon says, cities would gain a startling amount of water.

GLENNON: That would double municipal supply in the entire basin - six percent. I don't think anyone thinks we can't conserve six percent of ag. water with really intelligent but very costly improvements in infrastructure.

ROBBINS: For instance, it costs a million dollars to convert a 500-acre farm from flood to drip irrigation. That's a lot for a farmer. But industries could compensate farmers to protect the water supply for their products.

GLENNON: For high-value stuff, like Intel for its chips or Google for its server farms - how do we do that? And I think the way we do that is by insisting that these other user groups pay to modernize farm infrastructure.

ROBBINS: Farmers like Ronnie Leimgruber are wary. Even if cities and businesses pay for ag. improvements, he's convinced they won't use the water wisely once they get it.

RONNIE LEIMGRUBER: Is a better to use our water to grow alfalfa sent to China to feed the kids? Or is it better take our water to L.A. to fill the swimming pools and to build golf courses for the movie stars to enjoy their summer afternoon with their hot toddy by the pool?

ROBBINS: Farmer Dave Sharp agrees. There's a long history of place like L.A. and Phoenix growing unchecked at the expense of farming communities. But he's pragmatic. He recognizes every side has to make adjustments.

SHARP: You can't just make more water. You've got to learn to live with what you've got, work with what you've got. And if your lifestyle is using more water than what you have the capability of getting your hands on, something's got to change.

ROBBINS: Maybe that means sending less alfalfa to China. Maybe it means ripping out more lawns in Las Vegas. It could mean both. The ongoing drought is already changing the West, and Westerners need to adapt to it. For NPR News, I'm Ted Robbins.

2,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"More Chinese on the Coast, Less Fish in the Sea - Scientific American",https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/more-chinese-on-the-coast-less-fish-in-the-sea/,"China's booming economic growth is helping to degrade the country's coastal marine ecosystem at an alarming rate, despite the total population remaining steady, according to a new study.

A joint Chinese and American research team analyzed five decades of data from Chinese government records and found that the country's coastal marine ecosystem has steadily degraded to an almost irreversible point since 1978—the year the Chinese government introduced sweeping reform to industrialize the country's economy.

While China's population has held steady through that time, the economic growth has driven people from the country's interior farmland to the coast, and the combination of industrialization and a swelling coastal population is taking its toll on the marine environment, according to the researchers.

Qiang He, a marine ecologist from Beijing Normal University, led the research while a visiting scholar in Mark Bertness' lab at Brown University. He has studied coastal change in China for the best part of a decade and is first author on a study describing the research, published today in the journal Scientific Reports.

""Our paper shows that economic growth, not population growth, is major cause of China's coastal ecosystem changes,"" he concluded.

More people on the coast, less fish in the sea

And these ecosystem changes may only get worse, threatening the 28,000 different marine species that live along the coast as well as China's 1.3 billion people—half of whom live on the industrialized coast.

Before 1978, the diversity and size of China's fish species were steady, but since the economic reforms took place, both have been steadily decreasing. Coral cover in the South China Sea has crashed to 15 percent of pre-1978 levels, according to the study, and red tides—algal blooms that turn coastal waters a deep, biblical red and can be debilitating and fatal to marine life—have increased from around 10 each year before 1980 to between 70 and 120 each year since.

China's coastal gross domestic product growth and population movements mirror this coastal degradation. Between 1950 and the 1978 reforms, China's coastal GDP grew annually by around $2.2 billion. Between 1978 and 2010, China's coastal GDP increased by over two orders of magnitude with the country's coastal GDP contribution rising from 50 percent of the total to 60 percent. China's coastal population also increased from 260 million in 1954 to 400 million in 1978, and to 590 million in 2010.

During that time, China has been fueling its industrial and economic growth partly through massive development of its coastline. Mariculture and fishing activities have expanded to support local populations, pollution levels have increased, and miles of coastlines have been developed and filled in with mud to build larger and busier ports.

""The coastal degradation has been just phenomenal,"" said Mark Bertness, a marine ecologist at Brown who supervised the study. ""The message here is without some kind of regulation on this, some kind of conservation, they're going to burn out the resource base.""

""All of that stuff is going to be gone, and it's going to be gone in very short order,"" he added.

A 'red flag' for developing countries

China has been gaining attention internationally recently for its aggressive efforts to decarbonize its economy. Record-breaking levels of smog in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai over the winter spurred the government to declare a ""war on pollution,"" investing heavily in renewable energy and technology to clean up its fossil fuel power plants. The country is also close to launching a nationwide carbon market (Greenwire, March 5).

Yet while air quality issues in China have been highly publicized, the study says it has been at the expense of water quality and the degradation of marine ecosystems. Coastal cities like Shenzhen and Fujian are not as populated and are more removed from the public eye, he added.

""The air pollution is very intense, it's very serious in the major cities like Beijing and Shanghai,"" he said. ""But in coastal cities, populations are ... not as high as in those cities.""

There has been a fair amount of research in China on coastal pollution, but Bertness said this is the first study to show that Chinese economic development is accelerating the country's coastal degradation.

China is also one of several nations pulling themselves out of the Third World this century through rapid industrialization. India, Brazil and other developing nations are following a similar trajectory, and Bertness said those countries should also keep an eye on how their industrial and economic development is effecting their coastal marine ecosystems.

""This should be a red flag for all of the developing countries, especially the Asian developing countries,"" Bertness said. ""The nice thing about China was that there was this line in the sand—1978—when everything absolutely changed. But in reality, in a lot of Third World countries, the change has been almost as dramatic.""

A 'mega-star' is born

Bertness was also proud of the work Qiang He did on the study. The young Chinese scientist—who gained the nickname ""Q,"" after the James Bond scientist, while working at Bertness' lab—conceptualized the study almost by himself. But it took some work, Bertness said.

""His first few months in my lab were really kind of trying, because I was trying to get him to think creatively and get him to think of new different things to do,"" Bertness said. ""One of things I stressed with him is if you really want to do something big in China, you want to do something no one in China has done yet.""

After a few months of fruitlessly pitching research ideas to Bertness, Qiang came into his office one day and said he wanted to look into the effect of the 1978 economic reforms on marine environments in China.

""I looked at him and said, 'Yes, that's exactly what you need to do,'"" Bertness recalled.

Bertness predicted that He, who is now a postdoctoral research associate at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, is going to be a ""mega-star"" in marine conservation and ecology in China.

""It was an amazing process watching him go through this metamorphosis,"" Bertness said. ""This was really kind of a coming of age scientifically and creatively for Qiang.""

3,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate change and drought in ancient times - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140811151549.htm,"The influence of climate on agriculture is believed to be a key factor in the rise and fall of societies in the Ancient Near East. Dr. Simone Riehl of Tübingen University's Institute for Archaeological Science and the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment has headed an investigation into archaeological finds of grain in order to find out what influence climate had on agriculture in early farming societies. Her findings are published in this week's PNAS -- Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

She and her team analyzed grains of barley up to 12,000 years old from 33 locations across the Fertile Crescent to ascertain if they had had enough water while growing and ripening. Riehl found that periods of drought had had noticeable and widely differing effects on agriculture and societies in the Ancient Near East, with settlements finding a variety of ways to deal with the problem.

The 1,037 ancient samples were between 12,000 and 2,500 years old. They were compared with modern samples from 13 locations in the former Fertile Crescent. Dr. Riehl and her team measured the grains' content of two stable carbon isotopes. When barley grass gets insufficient water while growing, the proportion of heavier carbon isotopes deposited in its cells will be higher than normal. The two isotopes 12C und 13C remain stable for thousands of years and can be measured precisely -- giving Simone Riehl and her colleagues reliable information on the availability of water while the plants were growing.

They found that many settlements were affected by drought linked to major climate fluctuations. ""Geographic factors and technologies introduced by humans played a big role and influenced societies' options for development as well as their particular ways of dealing with drought,"" says Riehl. Her findings indicate that harvests in coastal regions of the northern Levant were little affected by drought; but further inland, drought lead to the need for irrigation or, in extreme cases, abandonment of the settlement.

The findings give archaeologists clues as to how early agricultural societies dealt with climate fluctuations and differing local environments. ""They can also help evaluate current conditions in regions with a high risk of crop failures,"" Riehl adds. The study is part of a German Research Foundation-backed project looking into the conditions under which Ancient Near Eastern societies rose and fell.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['climate', 'drought', 'ancient', 'agriculture', 'findings', 'riehl', 'times', 'societies', 'water', 'isotopes', 'near', 'change']",drought

The U.S. Drought Monitor, in its weekly report, said that the locations of the rain and the rate it fell minimized the relief for California’s parched landscape.

Because the heaviest showers were limited in scope, had high runoff rates and did not happen in two of the state’s key watersheds -- the Colorado River basin and the Sierra Nevada -- they “did not allow for significant percolation into drought-parched soils,” the report stated.

The report said the only short-term benefits of the rain was reduced irrigation demands and improved evaporation rates.

Though climatologists noted that last weekend’s storm over Mt. Baldy and the Forest Falls community -- the kind only seen once about every 500 years -- was just a stronger version of typical summer weather over the Southwest, the benefits appeared to evade California.

In fact the thunderstorms were incredibly destructive, sending mudflows through mountain towns in the San Gabriel Mountains that destroyed homes and killed one person, while sparking dozens of wildfires that continue to burn in Northern California.

The unusual weather events are occurring against the backdrop of more than half of California being under the most severe level of drought for the first time since the federal government began issuing regular drought reports in the late 1990s.

Since late July, roughly 58% of the state was considered to be experiencing an “exceptional” drought -- the harshest on a five-level scale.

The entire state has been in some level of drought since May, but more of it has since fallen into more severe categories -- “extreme” and “exceptional.” Nearly 22% more of California was added into the exceptional drought category two weeks ago.

California is also more than a year’s worth of water short in its reservoirs and moisture in the state’s topsoil and subsoil has nearly been depleted, according to the report.

“The bottom line is, there’s a lot of ground to make up,” Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center told The Times last week. “Mother Nature can’t put it back in that fast.”

The U.S. Drought Monitor issues updates weekly and is a joint effort of the National Drought Mitigation Center, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Circle of Blue

For the land and water managers working in the aftermath of one of the largest fires in California’s history, the lack of rain and snow – and more significantly the absence of land-ripping thunderstorms – has been a spot of relief in an otherwise bleak and trying year.

Blackened trees and charred homes are misery enough after a destructive blaze. But a severe forest fire also prepares the land for a destructive second act: a flood of muck and debris into streams and reservoirs after a heavy rain. In recent decades large forest fires in the American West, from California to Colorado, have cost water utilities millions of dollars in clean up costs.

The Rim fire burned more than one quarter of a million acres last August in Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park and cost $US 127 million to snuff out. A federal grand jury indicted a hunter last week for accidentally starting the inferno.

Yet the curtain has not lifted on a big second-act flush in the watershed. For that, California’s record drought – which has prompted unprecedented reductions in water availability – is a silver lining.

“The drought has been somewhat beneficial to the watershed,” Mary Moore, a U.S. Forest Service hydrologist working on the Rim fire recovery project, told Circle of Blue. “The rain has been light, wetting rain. That has allowed the seed bank to reestablish.”

The seed bank is the stock of grasses and young trees that begin to push through the denuded soil.

“We’re starting to see green up in the burned area,” Moore said. “There haven’t been any significant effects in degrading the watershed – no gullies or rills.”

Utilities operating in the watershed downstream of the fire are relieved too. No overwhelming cascade of dead trees, brush, and sediment has washed into Don Pedro reservoir, a large manmade lake on the Tuolumne River, said Calvin Curtain, spokesman for Turlock Irrigation District, which operates the dam and reservoir.

“Our biggest concern in relation to the Rim Fire is debris runoff into the reservoir,” Curtain told Circle of Blue. “Fortunately, in this case, we haven’t seen much runoff.”

The district has spent about $US 100,000 to guard mechanical structures in the reservoir from debris, Curtain said.

A Fear of Water

Floods are a problem after a fire for several reasons. First, dead trees and ash can turn streams into a thick cauldron of goo. Fort Collins, Colorado, for instance, sealed its water intake from the Cache la Poudre River in July 2012 after a rainstorm over the recently extinguished High Park fire caused a spike in particulates and a rapid degradation of the watershed.

The second problem occurs if the fire burns with such intensity that it creates a hydrophobic layer of soil that repels water like Teflon.

Image courtesy of U.S. Forest Service A map of the Rim fire with areas classified by how severely the soil burned. High severity burns (shown in red) covered 7 percent of the 103,772 hectares (256,428 acres) that burned. Click image to enlarge.

In the Rim fire, some 7 percent of the burn zone was classified as “high severity.” But roughly 40 percent of the burned acres show hydrophobic soil properties, Moore said.

A week ago Moore was in the field assessing the soil. She found the water-repelling layer at a depth of 2.5 centimeters (1 inch). All of the soil above the hydrophobic coat could potentially wash off.

“One inch is not as scary as three or four,” Moore explained.

Evidence of the flood risk came in late July when one of the few large storms to hit the area parked over Granite Creek. Almost 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain fell in an hour. Moore said the storm tide overwhelmed a culvert large enough for a grown man to walk through.

Hitting the Utility’s Wallet

Turlock Irrigation District has spent only $US 100,000 responding to the Rim fire. Not every utility gets off so cheaply.

Fires in 1996 and 2002 clogged Strontia Springs reservoir and led Denver Water, the owner, to spend $US 26 million to dredge the facility and reseed the surrounding forest.

In Southern California, a series of storms in 2010 that followed a destructive fire in Angeles National Forest prompted a similar response from Los Angeles County, which spent $US 30 million to clear debris from basins it uses for flood control.

After these experiences, several utilities are taking preemptive action. Denver and Santa Fe are among a growing number of cities that are adding the costs of forest restoration and fire prevention to their water rates. They seek to reduce the risk of a catastrophic fire in the watersheds from which they drink.

The U.S. Forest Service, because it often oversees the land upstream of the reservoirs, usually facilitates the programs and has agreements with Colorado Springs in addition to Denver and Santa Fe.

The Bureau of Reclamation, a large federal water agency, joined the party last June as part of the Western Watershed Enhancement Partnerships, one of President Obama’s many climate change initiatives. River basins in six states – Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Washington – were selected for the program.

These efforts will take time – both to thin forests before a fire and guard against ill effects afterward.

Moore, the U.S. Forest Service hydrologist, said that a watershed takes as many as 10 years to recover from a serious fire. Significant damage to rivers and streams can occur even five or six years after the smoke has cleared.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RimFireSoil.jpg?fit=1000%2C747&ssl=1,"['soil', 'recovery', 'large', 'drought', 'forest', 'rain', 'service', 'california', 'moore', 'burned', 'helps', 'watershed', 'water', 'rim']",flood_drought
7,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Bottled Water Comes From the Most Drought-Ridden Places in the Country – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/08/bottled-water-california-drought/,"



Update, 4/13/15: This article has been modified from its original version to include updated drought maps and information from the Desert Sun investigation.

Bottled-water drinkers, we have a problem: There’s a good chance that your water comes from California, a state experiencing the third-driest year on record.

The details of where and how bottling companies get their water are often quite murky, but generally speaking, bottled water falls into two categories. The first is “spring water,” or groundwater that’s collected, according to the EPA, “at the point where water flows naturally to the earth’s surface or from a borehole that taps into the underground source.” About 55 percent of bottled water in the United States is spring water, including Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead.

The other 45 percent comes from the municipal water supply, meaning that companies, including Aquafina and Dasani, simply treat tap water—the same stuff that comes out of your faucet at home—and bottle it up. (Weird, right?)

But regardless of whether companies bottle from springs or the tap, lots of them are using water in exactly the areas that need it most right now.

The map above shows the sources of water for four big-name companies that bottle in California. Aquafina and Dasani “sources” are the facilities where tap water is treated and bottled, whereas Crystal Geyser and Arrowhead “sources” refer to the springs themselves.

In the grand scheme of things, the amount of water used for bottling in California is only a tiny fraction of the amount of water used for food and beverage production—plenty of other bottled drinks use California’s water, and a whopping 80 percent of the state’s water supply goes toward agriculture. But still, the question remains: Why are Americans across the country drinking bottled water from drought-ridden California?

One reason is simply that California happens to be where some bottled water brands have set up shop. “You have to remember this is a 120-year-old brand,” said Jane Lazgin, a representative for Arrowhead. “Some of these sources have long, long been associated with the brand.” Lazgin acknowledges that, from an environmental perspective, “tap water is always the winner,” but says that the company tries to manage its springs sustainably. The water inside the bottle isn’t the only water that bottling companies require: Coca-Cola bottling plants, which produce Dasani, use 1.63 liters of water for every liter of beverage produced in California, according to Coca-Cola representative Dora Wong. “Our California facilities continue to seek ways to reduce overall water use,” she wrote in an email.

Then there’s the aforementioned murkiness of the industry: Companies aren’t required to publicly disclose exactly where their sources are or how much water each facility bottles. Peter Gleick, author of Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession With Bottled Water, says, “I don’t think people have a clue—no one knows” where their bottled water comes from. (Fun facts he’s discovered in his research: Everest water comes from Texas, Glacier Mountain comes from Ohio, and only about a third of Poland Springs water comes from the actual Poland Spring, in Maine.)

A recent Desert Sun investigation reported that the Nestle Waters, the company that owns Arrowhead, has been transporting water out of the San Bernadino National Forest using a permit that expired in 1988. The Forest Service hadn’t examined the impacts of the bottled water industry on the region. Since the investigation, Forest Service representatives have said that examining the permit is a “priority,” and Lazgin wrote that Arrowhead plans to comply with the permit renewal process.

Despite the fact that almost all US tap water is better regulated and monitored than bottled, and despite the hefty environmental footprint of the bottled water industry, perhaps the biggest reason that bottling companies are using water in drought zones is simply because we’re still providing a demand for it: In 2012 in the United States alone, the industry produced about 10 billion gallons of bottled water, with sales revenues at $12 billion.

As Gleick wrote, “This industry has very successfully turned a public resource into a private commodity.” And consumers—well, we’re drinking it up.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/bottles-master_0.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['industry', 'bottled', 'tap', 'places', 'droughtridden', 'jones', 'california', 'springs', 'water', 'comes', 'country', 'mother', 'companies', 'bottling', 'sources']",none

10,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"For groundwater, local management proves effective - California Farm Bureau",https://www.agalert.com/story/?id=7007,"For groundwater, local management proves effective

As the state Legislature considers statewide groundwater legislation in the midst of a severe drought, water agencies and water users say local groundwater management has yielded sustainable and positive results.

""Recent discussions may have left people with the impression that California has no groundwater management, but dozens of local and regional plans are in place and work well,"" said Danny Merkley, California Farm Bureau Federation director of water resources.

Current law enables local entities or agencies to implement their own groundwater basin management solutions and strategies. Local management falls into three main categories: special act districts, created through an act of legislation; county groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies; and court adjudications, where groundwater rights are determined by a court.

For example, the Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District—a special act district—has collected groundwater data since it was formed more than 60 years ago. Special act districts operate under different rules and processes, based on local needs. The Yolo County district was formed at the request of county supervisors and created by the Legislature with the purpose of finding new water sources and managing them efficiently.

Tim O'Halloran, general manager for the district, said its data collection efforts give well owners ""a snapshot twice a year of how their groundwater is doing, a trend over time,"" which allows development of sophisticated, conjunctive water programs that assure sustainable groundwater use.

Effective groundwater management comes from working through the issues collaboratively and locally, he said.

""If an outsider comes in and takes the data, by the time it is processed, it may or may not make sense and they won't have the context to evaluate the data,"" O'Halloran said.

Another special act district, the Sierra Valley Groundwater Management District, was established in 1980 after irrigators became concerned about increased drilling of new wells.

Jim Roberti, a director of the Sierraville-based district, said the district was established to prevent export of water.

""The major goal of the forming of the district has been achieved and the water has been allowed to stay in the valley for the people that live here,"" he said.

Roberti said landowners are required to purchase a meter for any wells with a flow rate of more than 100 gallons per minute. The district owns and maintains the meters, with data collected monthly.

Management of aquifers is also achieved through the use of local groundwater ordinances adopted by local agencies.

The Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation was formed in 1999.

""Butte County started this county water and natural resource department because there were transfers taking place and the residents felt there should be a little more oversight, so the county passed an initiative that restricts transferring surface water and pumping groundwater,"" said Les Heringer, farm manager at M&T Ranch in Chico. ""Since the county started this, it has functioned very well.""

Paul Gosselin, the director of the county department, said Butte County has more than one ordinance that guides groundwater, such as a groundwater management plan and a well-spacing ordinance to ensure that agricultural wells do not interfere with each other.

""It is pretty complex with groundwater flows, surface water flows and the interaction with surface and groundwater, and then how much land use affects either surface-water use or groundwater use,"" Gosselin said.

Butte County has a network of wells that are monitored quarterly, plus additional wells dedicated for groundwater monitoring, with data reported publicly. Landowner volunteers are asked to assist with groundwater monitoring.

""We've had extraordinary involvement and public participation and willingness by landowners to do monitoring and help study the basin,"" Gosselin said. ""The people at the local level did this from the grassroots up because of their understanding and appreciation of the importance of groundwater and what that means for the community, agriculture and the environment.""

A third form of groundwater management is through court adjudication, in which groundwater rights are determined by a court, including how much groundwater well owners can extract and who serves as watermaster to ensure the basin is managed.

John Martin, general manager of the Tehachapi-Cummings County Water District in Tehachapi, said the district has three adjudicated basins.

""Because of the fact that the groundwater is limited and the safe yield is very small, we have an informal arrangement with the farmers that they don't take more than half of their total water needs from the ground and that they get at least half from our (surface) water supply,"" Martin said. ""They have been complying with that for quite a number of years and by doing that, the basin is staying well below the court-determined safe yield.""

The Tehachapi-Cummings district, which acts as the court-appointed watermaster, meters agricultural wells that take monthly readings and groundwater elevations, and people are notified when the supply is getting out of balance.

Merkley said Farm Bureau and other agricultural organizations have been urging the Legislature to move deliberately in considering statewide groundwater legislation. He noted that some groundwater basins face supply-demand challenges, but that examples of successful local programs could ""provide a path for others to follow"" in coming years.

""The complexities of groundwater, groundwater management and interactions with surface water are simply too great to rush to complete an isolated solution,"" he said. ""We recommend a carefully thought-through process to develop appropriate protections of our groundwater resources for future generations.""

Butte County farmer Heringer put it this way: ""One size does not fit all in this state regarding groundwater. Every groundwater basin is different in the state, so local oversight is much better than having somebody from the state come in and tell us how to manage it.""

11,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Drought conditions plague Aandhra Pradesh almost every 5 years - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Drought-conditions-plague-Aandhra-Pradesh-almost-every-5-years/articleshow/40018979.cms,"VISAKHAPATNAM/ HYDERABAD: Even as the two states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana continue to reel from a rainfall deficit this monsoon, weathermen say it is in keeping with the pattern of a drought-like situation every five years in the state of unified AP. Rainfall received so far by the two states during the ongoing southwest monsoon seems to be only lending more credence to this theory. Though the southwest monsoon season usually arrives around June 1, this year its onset was announced only on June 19 by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), but the rainfall began in earnest only in the second week of July.

According to K Sitaram, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad centre, drought conditions have been reported in 1982, 1987, 2002, 2004, 2009 and now in 2014 in AP. ""Except for 2002 and 2004, and the 1990's the gap between two consecutive droughts in AP has been five years,"" Sitaram said.

""Comparing the rainfall as on August 9 of 2013 and 2014, it was deficient this year whereas it was excess in Telangana and normal in Andhra Pradesh last year. The main reasons behind the situation include the weak monsoon and unfavorable low pressures in the Bay of Bengal. Four low pressures formed in the Bay in July and one in the first week of August had no impact in the two states,"" Sitaram said.

The nine districts of coastal Andhra Pradesh should have received 305.6 mm rainfall as on Saturday in the ongoing monsoon season (June 1 to August 9), but received only 194.8 mm, resulting in a deficiency of 36%. Similarly, the four Rayalaseema districts should have received 189.5 mm rainfall in the season, but received only 135.7 mm, registering a 28% deficiency. However, the 10 districts of Telangana witnessed the highest deficiency of 49% in the season by receiving only 221.5 mm rainfall against its normal rainfall of 436.7 mm.

While Sitaram said the deficient rainfall this year was bound to have a negative impact on agriculture, power generation and drinking water supply, he was unable to pinpoint the reasons behind this peculiar pattern. ""We are unable to pin down the reasons behind the periodic drought conditions in AP. Earlier we had assumed that droughts prevailed due to the impact of the El Nino, a prolonged warming in the Pacific Ocean surface temperatures as compared to the average values. However, that assumption did not hold true for some droughts because there was no El Nino effect observed in those years. Now, we are studying the presence of any negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or Indian Nino, which is an irregular oscillation of sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean. The negative phase causes cooler sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean as compared to the east part of ocean,"" Sitaram said.

Meanwhile, other senior weathermen from the Cyclone Warning Centre (CWC), Visakhapatnam, said this year's monsoon witnessed hot weather conditions. The temperatures also remained higher over the past five days due to clear skies. On Sunday, Rentachintala registered a maximum temperature of 38.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 35 degree Celsius, Tirupati clocked 38.4 degree Celsius, Machilipatnam 37 degree Celsius and Visakhapatnam Airport registered 34.8 degree Celsius against its normal of 33 degree Celsius, the CWC officials added.

The company had been comparatively slow to raise prices, possibly because the margins on K-cups are so high that they could absorb coffee price increases for a time.

The gross margin on K-Cups can approach 50% in some cases, huge for any industry, let alone food retail.

The increase will go into effect November 3rd. Behind the jump is a massive increase in the price of green coffee, which is up more than 50% over the past year, after a drought and disastrous harvest in Brazil. The prices have soared, stayed high:

The price increase comes ahead of the company’s rollout of its new Keurig 2.0 machine, which will come with the ability to detect knockoff unlicensed pods, and to brew carafes of coffee instead of just a cup.

In its most recent earnings call, the company said it had locked in its coffee supply through 2015.

Following a directive by the commerce ministry, the department of telecommunications (DoT) has set up a committee, which will study the viability of the Chinese subsidy model and submit its report in the next few months.

The ministry had earlier commissioned the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relation (ICRIER) to study innovative incentive schemes in other countries and recommend measures that India could follow. The ministry gave the directive on the basis of this report.

“India’s subsidies in telecom are several years behind those of China and there is a need to synergise product and service development in an integrated way like China has done,” according to the ICRIER report. Subsidy and incentive schemes for the telecom sector in India are at a nascent stage, especially in the areas of product development, indigenisation of technology and research and development (R&D). According to a DoT official, the committee would prepare a detailed report on the possible subsidy schemes that India could replicate or innovate, based on the existing practices in China.

LEG-UP FOR TELECOM A committee has been set up by the department of telecommunications to examine the viability of the subsidy model being followed by the Chinese government

The committee is expected to prepare a detailed report on the possible subsidy schemes that India could replicate or innovate

Incentives like 10-year income-tax holiday, excise waiver and low-cost bank loans are likely to be considered initially

Government needs to look at rationalisation of taxes, tax incentives and developing integrated infrastructure and sale

Interest subsidy of three per cent to telecom product makers for export of their products are also on the cards

A blueprint to set up three specific funds, with a combined corpus of Rs 17,500 crore has been finalised

One of such schemes, said the official, the financial support that the Chinese government offers to companies such as Huawei, has helped them to be competitive, while Indian companies lag. The DoT official said incentives like 10-year income-tax holiday, excise waiver and low-cost bank loans are likely to be considered initially. At present, 10 per cent excise duty is levied on domestic telecom equipment producers who are not located in special economic zones. India is projected to import electronic goods worth about $400 billion by 2020, from about $45 billion now. “A large part of this would be telecom products. We need to reduce this as much possible and we are working towards it,” said the official. Besides imposing tax on import of telecom products, the government needs to look at rationalisation of taxes, tax incentives and developing integrated infrastructure and sale, as has been demanded by the industry for years, according to the ICRIER report.

The proposed concessions, said the official, seeking anonymity, are likely to enable telecom equipment makers competitive against their global counterparts. The government might also look at providing an interest subsidy of three per cent to telecom product makers for export of their products. The government has also finalised a blueprint to set up three specific funds, with a combined corpus of Rs 17,500 crore; to help the telecom sector develop a strong domestic manufacturing base, encourage entrepreneurship and promote R&D. These funds would provide its recipients start-up and angel funding, finance incubation centres and offer soft loans, besides giving interest subsidy to banks lending to telecom companies.

According to a study by research agency Ovum, Indian companies will constitute 6.6 per cent of the global demand for telecommunication equipment in 2014-15. The industry is expected to spend about Rs 46,000 crore on buying telecom equipment, excluding handsets. The bulk of this money will, however, be spent on buying imported equipment, mainly from Europe and China.

The telecom equipment business in India is controlled by five companies — Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson, Nokia Networks, and Alcatel — which have financial muscle to heft in big deals. According to the Telecom Systems Design and Manufacturing Association (TSDMA), Indian firms that design and manufacture and also have intellectual property, had a three per cent share of the nearly Rs 50,000-crore telecom equipment market in 2012-13.

Foreign companies that have factories in India would raise the share to 10-12 per cent. But the value added in India is less than 11 per cent, limited to system integration and packaging.

According to the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers’ Association, the Indian market for core network equipment, excluding towers and batteries, is worth around Rs 25,000 crore but local firms do not contribute more than Rs 1,000 crore.

According to local telecom equipment makers, Chinese companies get support from their government and Chinese banks have billions of dollars in credit lines for companies buying Chinese equipment. The banks offer credit at two per cent interest, payable in 15-20 years and the interest becomes due only from the fifth year.

In February 2012, the government announced a preference policy in which 30 per cent of the orders of government departments would be reserved for local telecom gear makers, which would have to undertake a minimum value addition of 25 per cent.The policy extended the quota to the private sector, too, asking it to source sensitive equipment from local manufacturers.

@sarmje

Water utilities have been at the center of international political unrest this year as a result of the ""water war"" in Crimea.

""Crimeans voted to break off from Ukraine and join Russia. Their vote represents the re-establishment of a historic cultural relationship. But take away the emotional side of the Crimean referendum and reality hits home -- the economic challenges that are yet to knock on their door,"" CNN reported.

Water service is among the major challenges.

""According to Ukrainian news agencies, [Ukraine's government] has shut down the work of the North Crimean Canal which carried water from the Dnepr to Crimea. The peninsula got 85 percent of fresh water from this canal, which was built in [between] 1961 and 1971,"" ITAR TASS reported.

That creates an expensive issue for Crimea, and for Russia, its new homeland. It will take up to $417 million to solve the problem of water service for Crimea, the report said.

The water problem emerged as a central front in the tug-of-war between Ukraine and Russia over Crimea.

""Satellite images show that [Ukraine] is deliberately trying to cut off Crimea peninsula's water supply by building a dam. In the meantime Russian scientists are trying to find ways to supply Crimea with fresh water,"" RT reported.

The result is an all-out ""water war.""

""Amid the water war between Ukraine and Russia; the former and the current occupiers of the Muslim Autonomous Republic of Crimea, harvest in the devastated Muslim country has been despoiled, but the water war may take more victims, with two major Crimean chemical plants near closure because of a water shortage,"" OnIslam reported, citing a Crimean official.

Crimea formerly depended on Ukraine for water, Pravda reported this month.

Ukraine ""provided up to 85 percent of fresh water supplies to the Crimea through the North Crimean Canal from the Dnieper River. The water was used to irrigate farmland. However, after the reunification of the Crimea with Russia, the new authorities of Ukraine completely cut water supplies from the North Crimean Canal to the republic,"" the report said.

Russia is trying to solve the water problem.

""The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation delivers fresh drinking water to the Crimea from artesian wells,"" the report said.

""Experts from the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources are developing ways to supply fresh water to the Crimea from the Kuban River in the Krasnodar region to the North Crimean Canal which now receives limited water-flow, as Kiev tightens the lid,"" RT reported.

Russian official Dmitry Kirillov told reporters that the country is exploring its options.

“As one of options of providing the peninsula with water, we are considering an option of drawing water supply from the Kuban River and channeling it through the Strait of Kerch to the end portion of North Crimean Canal,” he said, per RT.

Desalination has also been viewed as a potential solution.

""Russia is debating the construction of desalination plants in Crimea to solve the peninsula’s water supply problem,"" RIONOVOSTI reported, citing a Russian official.

""[New] desalination technology and desalination plants could be used in Crimea, because there are many underground salt lakes on the peninsula. Singapore uses desalinized water for irrigation and for technical purposes; the same can be done in Crimea,"" a Russian official said.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/sites/favicons/wol-favicon.ico,"['north', 'supply', 'russian', 'fresh', 'conflict', 'crimea', 'ukrainerussia', 'crimean', 'results', 'war', 'ukraine', 'water', 'canal', 'russia']",none
16,DR-2014-000109-CHN,California lawmakers considering historic shift in groundwater policy - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-water-20140810-story.html,"As California continues to endure a calamitous lack of water from the sky, the state could, for the first time, start to regulate water drawn from the ground.

Groundwater regulation has been politically poisonous since the state’s founding. But lawmakers and Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration are hoping to capitalize on the current parched conditions, and cautious cooperation from once-resistant interest groups, to pass a plan for a groundwater management system by the end of the month.

“This falls under the category of: Never let a crisis go to waste,” said Assemblyman Roger Dickinson (D-Sacramento), an author of the legislation.

The drought has propelled water policy to the top of the Legislature’s agenda in the final month of its session. Brown and lawmakers are also negotiating revisions to a water bond measure scheduled for the November ballot. They’re at odds over how much borrowing voters should be asked to approve to pay for such projects as storage and groundwater cleanup.

Meanwhile, the drought’s effects have been buffered somewhat by groundwater reserves.

A study released last month by UC Davis found the state’s economy has taken a $2.2-billion hit this year because of the drought — costs that would have been much higher except for increased pumping of groundwater. Researchers said increased reliance on underground reserves made up for as much as 75% of the water lost from surface sources.

There are no statewide rules on how much water can be taken from the ground. Since the Gold Rush days, groundwater has been considered a property right; landowners are entitled to what’s beneath them.

As the availability of water from lakes and rivers has become more inconsistent because of drought or environmental regulation, groundwater extraction has increased. That has caused more water to be removed from some underground basins, especially in the agriculture-rich San Joaquin Valley, than is being replaced.

“What we’re doing with groundwater is an equivalent to deficit spending,” said Lester Snow, director of the nonprofit group California Water Foundation and a former state secretary for natural resources. “Something bad is going to happen” in the long run, he said.

Some water districts have started managing underground sources on their own; others have become regulated after long and costly court battles. But some key basins remain unregulated, and there are substantial gaps in information about the state’s groundwater supply.

The Department of Water Resources estimates the state’s wells number from 1 million to 2 million — a significant variance.

“That shows you how out of whack the system is,” said Jay Ziegler, director of policy of the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group.

The legislative proposal contained in two identical bills would direct local agencies to create plans by 2020 for managing their groundwater. The plans could be customized to fit local needs, and the state could step in to enforce them if local agencies aren’t up to the task.

“We do recognize that local management is by far preferable,” said state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), an author of one of the bills.

The governor’s office has helped draft the proposal, buoying its prospects. If the legislation passes, it would mark a monumental shift for California, the only Western state that does not regulate groundwater.

“California hasn’t attempted to change water law this dramatically in 100 years,” said Dave Puglia, a senior vice president of Western Growers Assn., an agricultural industry group.

Past efforts to enact statewide groundwater management have fizzled. Resistance remains, particularly among agricultural interests that are still deeply suspicious of state interference. That has become more pronounced as farmers have increasingly relied on groundwater for their crops.

Among other concerns, the agriculture interests, which hold substantial sway in the Capitol, fear that a new regulatory system could affect property values.

“If the legislation enacted creates even a perception of a loss of access to the groundwater that was accessible before, my land value goes down,” Puglia said.

The farming group wants limitations on when and how forcefully the state could intervene to enact local plans.

It is significant that farm groups are even negotiating, the legislation’s supporters say. And other key interests have changed their stance on state involvement.

“Ten years ago, we were for local control [of groundwater resources] no matter what,” said Tim Quinn, executive director of the Assn. of California Water Districts. “Now, we’re for local control — so long as the locals are managing responsibly.”

These pictures show the shocking injuries sustained by residents of a small farming community in China after a pack of wolves attacked them.

A pack of around four or five wolves surrounded the farm after being 'driven mad' by hunger following the worst drought in decades.

People living there managed to flee, but not before some had their ears bitten off, while others suffered facial injuries, as well as cuts to their hands and chests.

Residents in the Altay village, in China's Xinjiang region, said it was unheard of for wolves to approach humans, never mind launch such a savage attack close to residential buildings.

After the people on the farm had fled the wolves attacked the animals, killing several of them.

The animals have apparently been driven mad by hunger caused by the drought, where the average rainfall was down by a third affecting nearly a million hectares of crops.

Hundreds of thousands of farm animals have also been left without water and the economic damage is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.

Many of the animals that the wolves might have otherwise fed on have died from lack of food.

China has seen lone wolf attacks before, but an attack by a pack of wolves is considered extremely rare.","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article4044847.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/This-man-was-attacked-by-wolves-in-China.jpg,"['starving', 'ears', 'drought', 'hunger', 'email', 'driven', 'animals', 'wolves', 'pack', 'injuries', 'villagers', 'mad', 'bite', 'farm']",none
18,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Shattering Myths to Help the Climate - New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/upshot/shattering-myths-to-help-the-climate.html,"Each new climate-change study seems more pessimistic than the last. This May and June, for example, were the hottest ones on record for the planet. Storms and droughts occur with increasing frequency. Glaciers are rapidly retreating, portending rising seas that could eventually displace hundreds of millions of people.

Effective countermeasures now could actually ward off many of these threats at relatively modest cost. Yet despite a robust scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are at the root of the problem, legislation to curb them has gone nowhere in Congress. In response, President Obama has proposed stricter regulations on electric utilities, which some scientists warn may be too little, too late.

Why aren’t we demanding more forceful action? One reason may be the frequent incantation of a motley collection of myths, each one rooted in bad economics:

Myth 1: The enormous uncertainty of climate science argues for a wait-and-see strategy.

The claim here is that reducing greenhouse gases would be a wasted expense if climate change ends up causing only minor problems. But uncertainty cuts two ways. Things might not be as bad as expected, but they could also be much worse.

In other domains, uncertainty doesn’t counsel inaction. Few people, for example, recommend disbanding the military simply because adversaries might not invade. In any event, many scientists now believe that storms and droughts caused by climate change are already causing enormous damage, so all that remains uncertain is how much worse things will get. And as Robert Shiller has written in this space, when the risk is as high as it now seems, economics tells us that insuring against worst-case calamities is prudent.","Sat, 02 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/business/3-VIEW/3-VIEW-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=298&w=600&s=8ce4c07c18dacbda92c3ac764b768f4ed30813212fd9e0d44fdc63d7c0c26064&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['change', 'climate', 'things', 'storms', 'example', 'droughts', 'myths', 'help', 'scientists', 'enormous', 'greenhouse', 'uncertainty', 'shattering']",drought
19,DR-2014-000109-CHN,China's President Says His Anti-Corruption Drive Is Deadlocked - KPBS,https://www.kpbs.org/news/2014/aug/08/chinas-president-says-his-anti-corruption-drive/,"There's been much to-do about China's anti-corruption drive and the leading example of that effort has been the downfall of a man who was once one of the country's most powerful officials, ex-security czar Zhou Yongkang.

But the Chinese government's unprecedented decision to investigate Zhou, which potentially paves the way for formal corruption charges, may not be quite the triumph many observers assumed. Perhaps the clearest signal comes from a recent assessment by the man at the helm of the corruption crackdown: Chinese President and Communist Party boss Xi Jinping.

""The two armies of corruption and anti-corruption are at a stalemate,"" Xi reportedly told a closed-door Politburo meeting in late June.

""In my struggle against corruption, I don't care about life or death, or ruining my reputation,"" a state-run newspaper in northeast China quotes him as saying, in remarks that have been described as ""shocking.""

Several state media outlets republished the report, which censors deleted later.

It's a glimpse into the party's inner chambers, and of the strength of internal opposition Xi is likely facing. It's also a sign of a potential backlash against the wider anti-corruption campaign, which is popular with ordinary Chinese fed up with endemic graft.

Until his retirement two years ago, Zhou commanded a vast security apparatus whose budget eclipsed even the military's. Now, he is accused of violating unspecified party rules. Criminal corruption charges could follow.

Observers see Xi as eager to make the anti-graft drive one of his signature policies, and to go at it with a blitzkrieg-like intensity. State media report that officials are being investigated at the rate of 50 a month, including, since February, two officials per month at or above the level of Cabinet minister.

State media have commented that China's leaders are determined to break tacit rules that politicians at the highest level are immune from prosecution, a tradition that has centuries-old roots in Chinese political culture.

But the many remaining corrupt officials – both high-ranking, powerful ""tigers"" and lower-level ""flies"" — are unlikely to sit around and wait to be picked off one by one, anti-corruption expert Guo Wenliang told the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper.

So ""the risk of a joint counterattack by the tigers is very, very great,"" said Guo, who teaches at Zhongshan University in the southern city of Guangzhou.

Among the tactics the ""tigers"" might use, he said, is turning the tables on leaders in charge of the anti-corruption drive — by gathering evidence of their corruption.

There's no evidence of a counterattack so far. But the fact that it took so long for the government to announce the investigation into Zhou Yongkang suggests to many observers that it ran into stiff resistance.

Every year, China sees thousands of cases of grass-roots unrest, often triggered by official corruption in the provinces. But the threat of a political counteroffensive by corrupt officials recalls the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping famously dire prediction: ""If China runs into trouble, it will come from inside the Communist Party.""

20,DR-2014-000109-CHN,40 Million People Depend on the Colorado River. Now It's Drying Up. – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/food/2014/08/southwests-water-crunch-even-worse-we-thought/,"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.

Science papers don’t generate much in the way of headlines, so you’ll be forgiven if you haven’t heard of one called “Groundwater Depletion During Drought Threatens Future Water Security of the Colorado River Basin,” recently published by University of California-Irvine and NASA researchers.

But the “water security of the Colorado River basin” is an important concept, if you are one of the 40 million people who rely on the Colorado River for drinking water, a group that includes residents of Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson, and San Diego. Or if you enjoy eating vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and spinach during the winter. Through the many diversions, dams, canals, and reservoirs the river feeds as it snakes its way from the Rockies toward Mexico, the Colorado also provides the irrigation that makes the desert bloom in California’s Imperial Valley and Arizona’s Yuma County—source of more than two-thirds of US winter vegetable production.

We’ve known for a while that the river’s ability to meet such demands has become increasingly strained. Climate change means less snowmelt in the Rockies, the river’s source, and a 14-year drought in the Southwest has further impeded its flow, while adding to the demand on it. “The once broad and blue river has in many places dwindled to a murky brown trickle,” the New York Times reported in January. “Reservoirs have shrunk to less than half their capacities, the canyon walls around them ringed with white mineral deposits where water once lapped.”

Lake Mead, the vast Nevada reservoir that traps a portion of the Colorado’s annual flow for distribution to its various users, has sunk to its lowest level since its creation in the 1930s, under pressure from the past decade and a half of drought. According to an excellent National Geographic piece by Sandra Postel of the Global Water Policy Project, Lake Mead was hovering near capacity when the drought started in 2000, equivalent to about two full years of Colorado River water. Today, it holds just nine months worth of river flow—a steep drop.

But the new paper suggests that the situation is even worse than we previously knew. In addition to rapidly drawing down Lake Mead, the region’s thirst for water has extended underground: to the region’s aquifers. For a project called the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, NASA satellites circle the Earth and carefully measure its mass. “Because changes in water storage result in changes in mass, GRACE provides fairly accurate estimates of water depletion over time,” Postel explains.

And here’s what GRACE researchers found in the Colorado River Basin region: To make up for the gap between what the Colorado River supplies and what people and agriculture demand, farmers, landowners, and municipalities are dropping wells and tapping underground aquifers at a much faster rate than had been assumed. Between December 2004 and November 2013, the Colorado Basin surrendered almost 53 million acre-feet of underground water—roughly equal to about 1.5 full Lake Meads, siphoned away in just nine years.

“Quite honestly, we are alarmed and concerned about the implications of our findings,” study coauthor Jay Famiglietti, a senior water scientist at NASA and a professor of at the University of California-Irvine, wrote in a blog post. “From a group that studies groundwater depletion in the hottest of the hot spots of water stress around the world—in India, the Middle East, and in California’s Central Valley—that says something.”

Famiglietti’s alarm stems from the fact that in the West, groundwater is essentially a nonrenewable resource. “When we use it, it’s gone,” he writes. No one knows how much is left, but it’s pretty clear that the region can’t keep draining its aquifers at the rate of 1.5 Lake Meads worth every nine years. But because of climate change, the region can expect more frequent droughts and less overall water from the Colorado. In short, Famiglietti writes, “The American West is running out of water.”

Which means it’s probably time to reconsider the region’s Wild West style of regulating groundwater. “If you own the property, the vagueries of groundwater law often mean that you can dig the wells and pump to your heart’s content,” Famiglietti writes. “Multiply that by millions of private wells and you get the picture.”","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_204949054.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['drying', 'million', 'depend', 'west', 'groundwater', 'drought', 'basin', '40', 'writes', 'jones', 'lake', 'colorado', 'water', 'mother', 'wells', 'river']",drought
21,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate change will widen the social and health gap - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/climate-change-will-widen-social-and-health-gap/,"Climate projections suggest that, thanks to human activity, we will likely see an increase in extreme weather events, disruptions to agriculture, loss of livelihoods and displacement of people.

While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status.

Recently there’s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists, led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda.

My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices. I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health.

Inequities of man-made natural disasters

Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones. These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems.

Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage.

At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people. 6,069 people were reported dead while 4.1 million people were displaced, with 1.1 million houses damaged or destroyed. While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions.

Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild. The ﬂooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities. Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport.

We see similar issues with heatwaves. Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat. This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths.

Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods.

Impacts on agriculture

“ In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

Our agricultural systems are also under threat. Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production. This will affect people’s income, stress levels and sense of hope.

In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle. But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities. Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away.

This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities. These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts.

Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity. Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33 per cent increase in the price of vegetables and a 43 per cent increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events.

Rising food prices most affect the poor — as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19 per cent. But, with 12 per cent of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face.

Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories. Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt.

Where does inequality come from?

Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities.

Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers.

Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes. The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average.

Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people. In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems.

The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality. This might include: fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas.

This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment.

22,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Champagne the Next Target for Investors | Wine-Searcher News & Features - Wine-Searcher,https://www.wine-searcher.com/m/2014/08/champagne-the-next-target-for-investors,"© Wine-Searcher

With prices for top Bordeaux and Burgundy becoming prohibitive, investors should cast their eyes a little further north.

Investors looking for a more affordable way to get into wine should be looking at Champagne rather than Bordeaux or Burgundy, according to a London-based wine merchant.

Woolf Sung founder Sebastian Woolf says vintage Champagne currently presents the best value for money in the fine wine investment market, with a further 10 percent growth expected over the next 12 months.

""The world's top Champagne vintages, 1988, 1996, and 2002 have consistently shown great appreciation and continued steady growth over the years. Over a two year period to August 2014, these vintages have collectively risen 10.2 percent,"" he said.

With the investment market looking for alternatives to Bordeaux and increasingly unaffordable Burgundy, vintage Champagne offers volume production, worldwide distribution and prestige. According to fine wine exchange Liv-Ex, the Champagne index increased 11.9 percent between 2011 and 2013 and its share of trade increase from 1 percent to 2.3 percent.

Champagne is relatively affordable when compared to equivalent quality Bordeaux or Burgundy, with the average case price of top vintage Champagnes costing $2500 compared with Bordeaux First Growths and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti reaching $10,000 and $165,000 respectively.

""Champagne offers first time investors a lower entry point and seasoned investors value for money when diversifying their portfolios,"" Woolf said.

""Champagne is released when it is ready for drinking and is therefore rarely stored for long in cellars, vintages then become scarce and prices rise.""

He said Woolf Sung is focusing on sourcing and procuring these old, scarce vintages which present a 3-5 year investment; these bottles are being drunk now, so scarcity and – in turn – prices are ever increasing.

""1999 Pommery Cuvée Louise Brut Millésime, 2002 Salon Cuvée 'S' Le Mesnil Blanc de Blancs, 2002 Dom Pérignon Rosé, 2006 Louis Roederer Cristal Brut are our top suggestions to look out for. A six-bottle case of the 2002 Salon is currently worth $2750, a low investment threshold, and we are predicting a 10 percent growth in the next 12 months.""

The Champagne market is quickly expanding beyond the traditional favorites, he added, and as the growing Asian markets increase their education in fine wine and look for further prestige, Champagne's appeal will broaden eastwards.

""With restricted production and increased consumption from growing markets, Champagne's consistent returns will continue and are likely to increase. We are focusing our efforts on sourcing rare and scarce bottles for our customers; these bottles are almost impossible to source directly from the houses or in perfect condition. The increasing interest in Champagne will ensure these bottles are more sought-after, inevitably increasing their value.""","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/43/78/champagne-10004378.jpg,"['investors', 'burgundy', 'woolf', 'vintage', 'bordeaux', '2002', 'champagne', 'investment', 'bottles', 'wine', 'vintages', 'target']",none

24,DR-2014-000109-CHN,New energy-rich sorghum offers ethanol without the corn - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/12/biofuels-energy-efficient-sorghum-nexsteppe,"As scientists around the world research biomass feedstocks — trees, shrubs and grasses that are designed to produce energy — a California startup called NexSteppe is betting that fast-growing, drought-resistant sorghum will emerge as a crop to sustainably fuel cars, trucks and power plants.

Sorghum, a millenia-old cereal grain, today feeds animals and people. It is turned into flour, syrups and beer, and used in gluten-free products. In Asia, sorghum is made into couscous, and across Africa, it’s consumed as a porridge.

Last year, though, NexSteppe introduced two new brands of sorghum seeds, dubbed Palo Alto and Malibu, that were bred expressly to be energy crops. They grow on marginal land and in a variety of climates, and they climb to a height of 20 feet after only four months of growth.

“Sorghum is naturally very heat and drought tolerant,” says Anna Rath, NexSteppe’s founder, president and CEO. “It originated in Africa. It’s a camel of a crop, if you will.”

Although NexSteppe has done almost no marketing outside of Brazil, its biggest market, the company’s sorghum is now being grown by farmers in 15 countries, including China, India, South Africa, Germany, Canada and the US.

“We identified a market need that wasn’t being met,” Rath told me, when we met at NexSteppe’s office in South San Francisco, across the bay from San Francisco International Airport. “Until now, crops have always been developed for animal feed and food—with the exception of cotton and tobacco. But there’s a growing need for energy that wasn’t being addressed.”

Rath, who is 38, is a former McKinsey consultant with degrees in biology and genetics, as well a doctorate from Yale Law School. She started NexSteppe with about $1m from friends and family in 2010. Since then, the company has raised about $40m from venture capitalists and from DuPont, which has major investments in biofuels, including a cellulosic ethanol plant under construction in Iowa.

NexSteppe isn’t the only company developing dedicated energy crops. Ceres, a small public company where Rath previously worked, breeds sorghum, switchgrass and miscanthus, but its products have been slow to reach the market. Meantime, the US government and university scientists backed by a 10-year, $500m grant from BP are extensively researching energy crops and biofuels production.

Why do we need dedicated energy crops? First of all, environmentalists say, reducing carbon pollution from the transportation sector will require widespread uptake of biofuels; vast, existing fleets of cars, trucks, buses and planes will need liquid fuels (but not gasoline or diesel oil) for decades to come. Second, most of the world’s biofuels today come from two feedstocks: corn in the US and sugarcane in Brazil. Neither is an ideal energy crop, experts say.

“We don’t view using food crops for fuel as a generally good idea,” says Heather Youngs, a senior fellow at the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a BP-funded research project at UC Berkeley. EBI is doing basic research on an array of crops with appealing sustainability profiles, including perennial grasses like miscanthus. Since 2006, the US energy and agriculture departments have also funded basic research into the genomics of plant feedstocks for bioenergy.

Brian Siu, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says biofuels ideally should be made out of organic waste or crops that don’t require much water or chemical use. “We have a lot of concerns with corn ethanol,” he says. “Corn is currently produced with a chemical-intensive process. It uses lots of fertilizers. It uses lots of pesticides.” Biofuels made from corn also cost more than fossil fuels, so they require government mandates or subsidies, which are controversial.

While sorghum is also grown for food, Rath says, it “needs a lot fewer carbon inputs than corn or sugarcane”. It also produces more biomass per acre per year than corn or sugarcane. NexSteppe has commissioned an independent analysis of sorghum’s sustainability profile, but it’s not yet available.

That said, unlike corn or sugarcane, NexSteppe’s crops have been bred to optimize energy production. Its Malibu sweet sorghum is designed to produce easily accessible fermentable sugars for fuels, while its Palo Alto high-biomass sorghum aims to deliver a low-moisture feedstock for cellulosic biofuels and biomass boilers that produce heat and electricity. The company, which employs about 35 people, half of them scientists, uses conventional breeding methods, and does’t use genetic modification.

Brazil is “our first, largest and most important market”, Rath says, because demand there is growing for both transportation fuels and electricity. Brazil also has dozens of ethanol plants and biomass boilers that are hungry for feedstocks to supplement local sugarcane. She sees opportunities for growth in China as well as in the US, where a half dozen or so cellulosic ethanol plants are expected to begin commercial production this year.

Over time, a variety of feedstocks are likely to emerge, depending on local conditions as well as government policy. Says Heather Youngs of EBI: “There’s a saying that ‘all biomass is local’ and it’s really true.” The NRDC’s Brian Siu agrees, saying that the sustainability profile of a biofuel is “highly determined by the feedstock and how and where we choose to grow it”. “The ‘how’ and ‘where’ are very important,” he says.

25,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Onion Powder Prices Jump, Bad News for Potato Chip Lovers - Spend Matters",https://spendmatters.com/2014/08/04/onion-powder-prices-jump/,"Spend Matters welcomes a guest post from Jo Allen of Mintec.

Flavourings are expensive by weight. They tend to be the most expensive ingredient of many food products. Onion powder is just one of those costly ingredients. Major potato chips brands like Pringles and Lay’s rely on onion powder to create some of our favourite flavours like sour cream and onion, cheese and onion, and onion rings.

Although the dehydrated onions equate to only 2 percent of the size of the onion market in volume. They are worth up to six times the value of the fresh onion market. Global onion powder prices have been increasing year-on-year since 2012 – all in all a 20-percent price increase.

The US is the major producer of onion powder, producing over 100,000 tons annually, which accounts for around 50 percent of total global production. This is followed by India, who produces around 40,000 to 50,000 tons annually. China and Egypt each produces around 13,000 to 15,000 tons.

Last year global onion production fell in all major dehydrated onion producing countries due to drought conditions. The reduced output drove prices up in early 2013 but they were also influenced by increased input costs driven by a need for further irrigation. In the US, warm weather in March and April of 2013 led to reduced yields. So by season’s end, the US onion industry had processed 9 percent less than was estimated. This tightened supply was on top of the already low carry-over stocks left from 2012.

This year, the drought has continued causing concerns that the 2014 crop will be lower than estimated for the second year running. California, a major dehydrated onion growing state, officially declared drought conditions in mid-January. Unfortunately, the US is not the only country to be suffering with increased prices due to restricted supply. In India the new crop is expected to fall short of forecasts by 20 percent, and Egypt’s ongoing political turmoil is causing uncertainty of supply to the global market. Since current (and future) supplies of dehydrated onion product around the world are tight, there's little doubt that onion prices are going to leave us with a not-so-sweet taste in the near future.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",,"['major', 'bad', 'supply', 'jump', 'drought', 'powder', 'onion', 'chip', 'tons', 'dehydrated', 'global', 'prices', 'lovers', 'market', 'potato']",drought

Many are among the 400 million Indians who lack access to electricity.

In recent years, however, a strong push for hydroelectric power development has started to change that. Since Uttarakhand’s rise to statehood in 2000, the expansion of hydropower in the region has mirrored the region’s robust economic growth. Many of the dams that have been built are small hydropower projects that harness the force of a river without trapping large reservoirs of water.

But hydropower’s benefits have come at a cost. In June 2013, early and extraordinarily heavy monsoon rains fell for two days, streaming off Uttarakhand’s mountainsides, overflowing its rivers, and overwhelming scores of new dams. The flooding eventually killed almost 6,000 people, tore up 1,300 roads, took out nearly 150 bridges, and destroyed 25 small hydropower projects. The disaster seemed an act of God, but a government-commissioned said much of the blame lay elsewhere — on the new hydroelectric power infrastructure, which included nearly 100 dams, many of them smaller than 25 megawatts in capacity.

A panel of experts said the huge number of dams and associated construction debris were spaced so closely together that they had changed the river courses and flow of sedimentation, exacerbating the flooding. Tunneling through mountains and deforestation also contributed to the disastrous flooding, the panel said. As the floodwaters roared through narrow gorges where small dams had been built, the torrent swept up uncounted tons of dam construction spoils and carried them downstream, swamping villages, according to a report commissioned by the Indian Supreme Court.

Run-of-the-river projects can provide cheap, off-grid power, allowing rural areas easy access to electricity.

It turned out that one or two of the state’s largest hydroelectric dams — an energy source that for decades has been blamed for serious environmental damage around the world — may actually have held back some of the worst flooding.

Uttarakhand may have been a worst-case scenario for small hydro, but there is nevertheless an increasing understanding that a global push to downsize this renewable energy source carries risks. Small hydro has great potential to bring power to some of the 1.2 billion people around the world who lack electricity, and groups like the World Bank and United Nations are increasingly backing small hydropower projects. But it is not environmentally benign, with impacts ranging from the fragmentation of river habitat to the potential for cascading dam failures during the kind of flooding experienced in Uttarakhand.

Small hydro, which includes so-called mini- and micro-hydro projects on small rivers and creeks, is most often defined as dams with a capacity up to 10 megawatts, though some countries define it as including dams of up to 25 or 30 megawatts. (The world’s biggest dam, the Three Gorges Dam in China, has a 22,500-megawatt capacity). Although designs differ and sometimes rivers do get diverted, small hydro dams are often built as “run-of-river” projects, meaning the flow of the river turns some turbines in the dam to produce electricity without the need to create a reservoir behind those turbines. This can provide cheap, off-grid power, allowing rural areas access to electricity.

So far, about 75 gigawatts of small hydro have been installed worldwide, the bulk of it in China (37 gigawatts), Europe (about 17 gigawatts), and North America (about 8 gigawatts). So how much small hydro potential remains? According to one assessment from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the total remaining global potential is just under 100 gigawatts of projects of 10 megawatts or less. That’s equal to 100 nuclear reactors or big coal power plants.

A glance at the specifics of small hydro’s potential sharpens the focus on developing countries even further. East Africa has only 208 megawatts of installed small hydro, with another 6,000 megawatts (6 gigawatts) that could be added; Kenya alone, with less than 2,000 megawatts of installed electricity from any source, could add 3,000 megawatts of small hydropower, according to UNIDO. Southeast Asia also has 6,000 megawatts of untapped potential. (The U.S. and Canada have tapped more than 85 percent of their small hydro potential already, with about another 1,000 megawatts that could still be developed, UNIDO says.)

Although there is still plenty of focus on major dams in certain parts of the world — including scores of large projects in China and numerous megadams in the Amazon — many countries, developers, and financing groups are now more strongly focused on downsizing hydropower. Pierre Audinet, the program team leader for clean energy at the World Bank’s Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, said that the majority of the bank’s current hydropower projects are small. Since 2003, the World Bank reports that 61 percent of its projects were run-of-river or other small-scale or micro-hydro development.

The World Bank is trying to convince developing nations that pushing too fast with small hydro carries risks.

Still, the World Bank is trying to convince developing countries that pushing too fast with small hydro carries risks.

“This whole discussion on accumulating impacts, it is something we pay a lot of attention to, and we have been pressing our client countries to mitigate and prevent the negative impacts that can happen when there are too many dams on a single basin,” Audinet said. In Vietnam, a $202 million commitment from the World Bank is helping finance the construction of nine new small hydro plants — maxing out at 30 megawatts each — with six already completed. The project includes an exhaustive environmental framework that requires numerous safeguards before a project is eligible for funding. These range from assessing impacts on fisheries, water quality, and sedimentation, to consideration of downstream effects.

These precautions are in place for a reason, as the risks of building too many small dams in a single river basin aren’t yet fully understood.

“It’s really tricky because these smaller dams, they don’t have the measurable impacts that you have with the bigger dams,” said Martin Doyle, director of the Water Policy Program at Duke University. “You don’t get the same sediment-starving effect downstream, and a lot of species can actually get by them during floods. But what they do is — we always called it death by a thousand cuts. Instead of having one big Hoover dam, you have thousands of little dams. They add up.”

David Strayer, a freshwater ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York, said fragmentation by hydropower is a serious threat to ecosystems. In the U.S., Strayer said that studies have shown small dams mark the boundaries of various freshwater species, such as mussels, with potential long-term consequences. Put a small power project in today, and mussels will likely still live on both sides of the dam tomorrow. But over time, a drought or a flood might kill off the group on one side or the other, and the dam will block the rest of the species from spreading out to fill the void.

“It’s not something that is yet regarded as a primary factor affecting freshwater biodiversity, but we have enough hints of this now that I personally would put this on the short list of major endangering factors over the longer term,” Strayer said.

One study found the cumulative impacts of small hydropower can actually outweigh those of larger dams.

Another study in the Nu River area in China found that the cumulative impacts of small hydropower can actually outweigh those of larger dams. Flow modification of streams, for example, was “3 to 4 orders of magnitude greater” for the numerous small dams than for dams as big as 4,200 megawatts and 300 meters in height. Downstream of small hydro projects — which in some cases actually do divert rivers for large portions of the year — the rivers were “dewatered” an average of 74 percent of days studied, which aside from the obvious problems also can negatively affect water quality. Water quality was also more strongly affected by small hydro than large, the Nu study said.

Two studies — one by a group at Kansas State University and one by scientists at the University of New Mexico — found that some fish species, such as the family that includes carp and minnows, need as much as 100 kilometers of unbroken stream in order to survive and thrive. Many existing and proposed mall hydro projects are spaced much more closely together.

The Uttarakhand disaster represents an extreme scenario. In the report on the floods submitted to the Indian Ministry of Environment & Forests, the expert panel concluded that “bumper-to-bumper” development of run-of-river hydro projects is dangerous, and that changes to sedimentation of rivers caused much of the flooding damage. Even smaller dams hold back sediment and other materials that would naturally flow downstream, which can increase erosion below the dam and make the impacts of flooding worse if dams give way during a deluge, as they did in Uttarakhand.

The report recommended that because of the threat of a “cascading chain of catastrophes,” planners needed to examine the basin-wide impacts of building numerous dams on a single river system. The existing guidelines in the region require only one kilometer of separation between two projects. The report called for a halt to almost all hydropower development until studies could determine optimal distances between dams.

With the help of the UN, the World Bank, and others who increasingly focus on the impacts of small hydro, progress is being made. A survey of professionals working on small hydro around the world, from a database run by the International Energy Agency, suggests most think the industry is beginning to be regulated properly.

“Environmental impact studies are done even here for any sizeable hydro project, but there is room for improvement,” said Terry Gray, a consultant on hydro projects based in Mbabane, the capital of Swaziland. Others in Uganda, Vietnam, India, and elsewhere said that increasingly regulations are being adopted to match a growing demand for small hydro.

“Of course there are benefits to small hydropower, and I’m not saying we should stop doing any hydropower development,” Strayer of the Cary Institute said. “But if you’re really balancing costs and benefits, you ought to be doing so with your eyes open.”

Dutch cheese, German bratwurst and Russian vodka. Iconic cultural favourites not to be missed when visiting the country. But what about fresh produce? Although we think we do know most of the greens out there, there are still certain tasty products that are very popular elsewhere. This has much to do with the availability of the product, but also history can play an important role.



Strawberries in the United Kingdom

Whoever thinks of the summer in the UK, thinks of strawberries with whipped cream. The Wimbledon Tennis Championship in particular is strongly linked with strawberries. During the tournament, about 28,000 kilos of the fruit is consumed. The United Kingdom has for years been the largest buyers of Dutch and Belgian strawberries. Exports in recent years have significantly declined though, due to increased domestic production.



Sweetcorn in the United States

Sweet corn is one of the most important vegetables in the United States. The US cultivates the vegetables almost year-round. Annual consumption of sweet corn in the United States is about 10 kilo per person. That is much more than the 60/70 grams by European consumers. The bi-colour variant has now gained a major share in the United States.



Asparagus in Germany

Germany is fond of asparagus. Almost a third of Germans will eat asparagus at least once a week during the season. In the past year, they ate an average of about 1.1 kilos of asparagus per person. In other European countries, the vegetable is relatively unknown. German asparagus is largely domestic, grown on approximately 20,000 hectares.



Potatoes in India

India has a large potato market. The country consumes more than 40 million tons of potatoes per year, an amount that increases annually by 6 percent. More than 80 percent of the potatoes in the country is destined for the fresh market. The majority is sold in small markets and through roadside venues. The Indian potato production has grown in recent years. It is expected that the harvest in 2020 will surpass 49 million tons.



Tomatoes in Italy

Although the consumption of tomatoes has dropped slightly in recent years, the vegetable is still among the most important in Italy. Italian cuisine simply can’t do without tomatoes. In the mid-18th century, there was a real tomato culture in Italy, while the vegetables didn’t reach European tables until the 20th century. Production in the country amounts to almost one million tons, most of which is destined for domestic consumption. The Italian consumption of tomatoes per capita last year was 16 kg, while still at 21 kilos in 2011. In comparison: In Belgium, consumption is at 10.4 kilograms per capita.



Coconuts in Thailand

In Thailand, you'll come across fresh coconuts anywhere you go. On the beach there are lots of coconut trees, but there are also many plantations where coconuts are grown professionally. In Thailand, the coconuts are sold on the street. The coconut is very versatile. It’s used to make coconut oil and coconut milk, widely used in Thai cooking. Coconut oil is becoming increasingly popular, because it is a saturated fat and therefore the only vegetable oil suitable for heating because it remains stable at high temperatures.



Chicory in Belgium

Belgium is the birthplace of chicory. Consumption in the Netherlands is about three kilos per capita, though twice as high in Belgium. In Germany, for example, only 400 grams per capita is consumed. Belgium is one of the most important chicory producers in the world. In recent years, chicory acreage declined, and it is expected that cultivation will continue to drop.



Garlic in China

China is the land of garlic. The country is the largest exporter of garlic worldwide, and domestic consumption is high. On average, the Chinese eat ten cloves of garlic a day. When the Summer Olympics were held in China in 2008, an MP complained of the odour of taxis in Beijing. Taxi drivers were explicitly asked not to eat any more garlic. The unpleasant smell of garlic in the taxis is in fact a common complaint of tourists. Chinese garlic also contains less Allicine, a type of antibiotic that causes bad breath.

31,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Economic Milestone: Devaluation Of The Rupee (1966) - Forbes India,https://www.forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-devaluation-of-the-rupee-(1966)/38407/1,"Image: Getty Images Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s move became very unpopular

On June 6, 1966, in one fell swoop, the Indira Gandhi government devalued the Indian rupee by 57 percent, from Rs 4.76 to Rs 7.50 to a dollar, triggering bitter criticism in the Parliament and media. The people, too, joined in claiming that this was the ultimate “sell-out to America and the World Bank”.



The move, however, was in the offing for some time. Since Independence, India had held the dollar constant at Rs 4.76 in spite of increased trade deficits and a reliance on foreign aid to maintain a constant valuation. The final straw was the wars India fought (with China and Pakistan) and the shock of a major drought in 1965-1966. Each instance increased deficit spending, further accelerating the already severe inflation. Besides, the World Bank, largely funded by the US, fell short of its promised aid inflows to India.



Even though PM Indira Gandhi took all the flak for the move, her predecessor Lal Bahadur Shastri (who died of a cardiac arrest during his trip to Tashkent in early 1966) had set the stage for it. According to former diplomat BK Nehru’s account (in his book Nice Guys Finish Second), Shastri is also said to have “eased out” his finance minister the previous year for opposing this devaluation.



The Indian government took the step to counter soaring inflation, but it turned out to be very unpopular and laid the foundation for distrust between the people and the government. The devaluation had its ramifications abroad as well; Oman, Qatar and the UAE, countries which used the Gulf Rupee (issued by the RBI), were forced to come up with their own currencies.



According to Rohit Lamba, post-doctoral fellow at Cambridge-INET at the faculty of economics, University of Cambridge, “Strictly speaking, public perception/reception should not matter for macroeconomic policy. History remembers politicians and policymakers who do the unpopular but economically sound. However, no policy decision is or should be devoid of the politics of it, especially in a democracy. With the state of affairs as they were in 1966, the devaluation was unavoidable. We can argue how we got into that state but that is another debate.”

32,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Himalayas Strike Again: Deadly Landslide in Nepal - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2014/world/nepal-landslide-hydropower/,"Sun Koshi River is blocked, 156 people are dead, and 10 percent of Nepal’s hydropower capacity is cut off.

By Brett Walton, Circle of Blue

The deadliest landslide in Nepal in a decade is raising fresh questions about the country’s ability to use the rivers of the Himalayan range to electrify South Asia.

The disaster on August 2 buried 156 people, covered the main highway to China in mud and debris 20 meters deep, and blocked the Sun Koshi River roughly 80 kilometers east of Kathmandu. Water quickly pooled behind the rubble forming a lake that submerged a small hydropower station three kilometers upstream. The lake poses a flood risk for at least 400,000 people in two countries.

The landslide also damaged a hydropower station downstream and cut electrical transmission lines along the valley. In all, nearly 10 percent of the nation’s hydropower capacity, some 67 megawatts, was severed by the landslide, leading to power cuts in the capital and elsewhere in the country of 27 million people.

It is the second time in a year that a mammoth disaster ripped the region’s high mountain passes, causing deaths, vast damage to roads and other infrastructure, and ravaging hydropower installations. In June 2013 wicked flooding in Uttarakhand, an Indian state that lies across Nepal’s western border, killed at least 6,000 people and seriously damaged at least 10 big hydropower projects in operation and under construction. Another 19 small hydropower projects that generate under 25 megawatts were destroyed.

“I’ve been a hydropower skeptic for a long time…This idea that we will become like Arab sheikhs lolling in hydro-dollars is absolute nonsense.” –Dipak Gyawali,

Nepal’s minister of water resources, 2002-03

Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has not yet determined the cause of the landslide. The region, with its young geology, seismic activity, steep slopes, and intense cloudbursts, has a thick history of earth-moving events. Factors being investigated include seasonal rainfall, road construction in the area, and a slope weakened by previous slides.

Land and water experts, and former government officials, said that the Nepal landslide was a warning to the landlocked country squeezed between the soft slope of the Ganges plain and the spiky pinnacles of the Himalayas. The disaster, they said, should prompt Nepal to reassess its push for large Himalayan hydropower dams.

Optimistic projections estimate that Nepal’s undeveloped hydropower potential is second highest in the world, behind Brazil. Both China and India have cast a hopeful glance at their neighbor’s deep, dammable canyons. Nepal’s energy ministry set a goal in 2010 of building 37,000 megawatts of new hydropower capacity within 20 years, a goal that now looks impossible to achieve after a slow start and just 705 megawatts operating today.

But calamities such as the Sun Koshi landslide could undo these hydropower plans, Dave Petley, a landslide expert at Durham University, told Circle of Blue. Landslides in the Himalayas are growing more frequent and severe as the globe warms and intense rainfall increases, he said, adding that human interventions – such as building roads, tearing down forests, and stripping the soil – magnify the natural hazards.

Others surveying the damage do not see a hydropower kingdom rising in the Himalayan foothills.

“I’ve been a hydropower skeptic for a long time,” Dipak Gyawali, Nepal’s minister of water resources from 2002 to 2003, told Circle of Blue. “Nepal is not rich in hydropower. I don’t know where the hype came in, perhaps from developers. This idea that we will become like Arab sheikhs lolling in hydro-dollars is absolute nonsense.”

A Mountain Falls into a River

Nepal’s unstable terrain and steep river valleys that shudder from earth-moving forces are risky locations for hydropower projects, experts say. These projects could fail in any number of disasters common to this region – earthquakes, landslides, or torrential floods.

Some of those risks were revealed just after sunrise on August 2 when nearly two kilometers of hillside collapsed above the Araniko highway, Nepal’s main road link with China.u on August 5, 2014. In the foreground is the Sun Koshi hydropower station, which was damaged in the landslide.

An engineer for the Bhote Koshi hydropower station, located just upstream, who witnessed the slide, tweeted that “a whole mountain has fallen into the river.”

Dozens of homes were buried. By Wednesday morning 33 bodies had been recovered and 123 people were still missing but assumed dead, according to local news reports.

Scientists with the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a research group based in Kathmandu, are helping Nepal’s Department of Hydrology and Meteorology assess the causes of the landslide.

However, access to the site is difficult and a detailed investigation right now is not likely, said Arun Shrestha, manager of ICIMOD’s river basin program.

Shrestha told Circle of Blue that three main questions must be answered in the next few days: Will the hillside collapse again? What can be done to stabilize the slope? How stable is the landslide dam across the Sun Koshi River?

The nature of the dam, comprised of rock, mud, and sediment, is the greatest concern, Shrestha said.

The Nepali Army is blasting holes in the dam to drain the water. If the dam were to break, the resulting flood, called a bishyari in Nepali, would put as many as 400,000 people at risk. The threat extends beyond national borders. Authorities in India’s Bihar state, more than 200 kilometers downstream on the Kosi River, have evacuated at least 65,000 people.

Landslide Points to Long-term Problems

Landslides are common in Nepal. Shrestha counts 14 major events since 1967. But what is unusual about the Sun Koshi landslide is that it happened in an area with major infrastructure: the Araniko highway and five hydropower stations.

The hydropower stations along the river do not use large dams. Rather, they are small facilities, no more than 45 megawatts, that divert a portion of the river’s flow to generate electricity before returning it to the channel downstream. Still, one station’s diversion pipes were damaged, another was inundated, and the rest are inoperable because of downed transmission lines.

“This is an eye-opener for hydropower,” Shrestha said. “Development has to happen more systematically. Now there is not so much consideration for natural hazards.”

Shrestha mentioned the catastrophic June 2013 floods in Uttarakhand as another example of natural hazards limiting national hydropower plans. But cautious development in Nepal will be easier wished than accomplished, asserted Gyawali, the former water resources minister.

When asked which authorities were responsible for approving hydropower permits, Gyawali scoffed at the question.

“I am afraid these questions arise in your mind conflating Nepal with Norway,” he wrote in an email. “We have a dominating informal sector where policies are made and decisions are taken at the household level. Yes, government has policies. Can they effectively implement it? Well, more easily on the moon than in next-to-inaccessible Nepali hinterlands.”

If the authorities want, the Sun Koshi example can serve as a guide for hydropower development, said Gyawali, who is now research director of the Nepal Water Conservation Foundation.

“These bishyaris keep happening all the time,” Gyawali said, referring to the floods from landslide dams. “Nepal is better off developing small hydropower plants across the country. If we try to build one single plant, we’re putting a larger risk on the table. Many smaller ones cannot all be knocked out.”

Petley, the Durham University landslide expert, said that more research on natural hazards in the Himalayas is needed.

“The Himalayan landscape needs to be managed very carefully,” Petley said. “There is too much indiscriminate development.”","Wed, 06 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i2.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2015-12-31-at-1.07.10-PM.png?fit=331%2C271&ssl=1,"['himalayas', 'development', 'hydropower', 'koshi', 'megawatts', 'nepals', 'strike', 'landslide', 'nepal', 'water', 'deadly', 'river', 'gyawali']",flood

In our Kitchen Garden column of July 16, we featured the Chinese Market Garden at the Museum of Sydney. Readers responded.

Canberran Myra Dowling recalls, as a small child in the 1950s in Rockhampton Queensland, Georgie the Chinaman would come to her grandmother’s side gate with his horse and cart and sell her vegetables from his market garden. Sometimes her grandmother (a Scandinavian) would exchange her spare eggs for his vegetables. They were great friends but she would tell Myra what a lonely life it was for Georgie, far from family and home.

Melbourne reader Pamela Robinson says her dad grew vegetables and he was half Chinese. Their family history is on the web, The Lew Shing Family. She remembers old men called Ah Bah in Cantonese walking in Little Bourke Street (China Town in Melbourne) with a stick across their shoulders with two big cans on each side. They had hot coals in the bottom of the cans and layers of the best dim sims. She can still recall the smoke coming out of windows where they had opium dens.

Expanding: Hee poultry farm in Murrumburrah (1953 or 1954).

Robyn and Paul Atherton live in Harden. In their back yard there is an old loquat tree that fruits well every year. Younger fruit trees that are growing well include plum, peach, apricot and olive and, this year, Robyn has '‘put down a few jars of olives’' with garlic, peppercorn and rosemary. In winter they grow spinach, beetroot, herbs and spring onions.

Robyn is president and research officer of Harden-Murrumburrah Historical Society (HMHS). When she was a member of Advancing Harden Murrumburrah and looking at promoting their history and the town, she enquired about the Chinese portion of the town’s cemetery and how it could be repaired/restored. That led to her researching the topic and, in 2010, the publication by HMHS of her book They were more than just gold diggers – the Chinese of Murrumburrah and surrounding districts 1860s to 1960s.

Market gardening by the Chinese, from the gold days to the 1950s, extended from the goldfields to Murrumburrah’s creeks. Hawkers from this district travelled to Galong and Boorowa to the east and to Temora to the west.

Atherton says the Chinese were fairly established as market gardeners. They were the main supplier of fresh vegetables to the Burrangong Hospital (Burrangong Argus 1876). That year, at the hospital’s monthly meeting, payment was approved for payments to be made to ''Sun Kum Hang for sundries’' and to ‘'a Chinaman for vegetables’'.

Potatoes were being grown at Wombat on ground leased from John Kildea by Ah Fook and Ah Goy. ‘'The Chinamen had been his tenants for three or four years, they lived in two huts about 250 yards apart. One hut was in a cultivation paddock which was fenced from an adjoining paddock where Mr Kildea ran his cattle.” (Burrangong Argus 1881).

Atherton says Willie Sing was bucking the trend by extending his vegetable garden enterprise on Currawong Creek to opening a store in the heart Harden. In 1911 an ad in the Murrumburrah Signal reported that Sing could supply the best of fresh fruit and good vegetables, confectionery, hot pies and coffee.

In 1912 it was reported that eight bags of green peas were sent to Sydney that had been “grown at the Chinaman’s garden at Black’s old dairy on the Currawong Creek and were of prime quality. This shows that it can be done with adequate water supply.”

Andrew Hee wrote some histories for Atherton’s book including Albert Gee, a vegetable hawker and poultry farmer who went to Murrumburrah in 1943. Gee sold from door-to-door from his T-Model Ford that he bought from an Aboriginal family.

Also included in the book is the history of Jow Hee, market gardener and poultry farmer, who was the father of Andrew Hee. Jow Hee owned and operated a fruit and vegetable shop in Randwick but moved to Murrumburrah in 1942.

Jow Hee hawked vegetables door-to-door, from a ute converted from a 1927 Chevrolet tourer, calling on customers once a week. On weekends, his son, Andrew, then aged about nine, went with him to open and close the many gates from Wallendbeen to Nubba. By 1946 he had built up his flock of laying hens to 4000. He bought a rotary hoe and, when the drought broke in 1947 and the wealth of the district grew, the demand for eggs and vegetables increased and he sold these wholesale to local shops. The main crops were cauliflowers and lettuce.

The remainder of the story is fascinating but you will have to read the book, which is available from Robyn Atherton, Harden-Murrumburrah Historical Society, PO Box 237, Harden NSW 2587 ($20 + postage approx. $9).

35,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"Column: Mia Lehrer on what makes a successful park, and how L.A. can build them - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-morrison-lehrer-20140806-column.html,"Landscape architect Mia Lehrer has designed some lavish private gardens in Los Angeles, but she has also made her mark with “guerrilla planning,” creating and blue-skying plans for parks and public spaces, from the harbor to Silver Lake. She’s Salvadoran by birth, and alert to analyzing how open-space needs and use by newcomers may teach L.A. how to enhance its footprint. Now that the drought is dictating terms, it’s also making new ones possible, and Lehrer doesn’t intend to miss the opportunity that scarce water provides to get Angelenos to regard the natural world in a way that makes sense here and now.

Out your office window, I see a lawn with a copse of pine trees in front of an office building. Size up that space for me.

It’s a simple park. There are people doing yoga, kids throwing balls, people with their dogs. It’s designed by Peter Walker, who was a professor and partner of mine. He did the World Trade Center. It’s used so much, and it speaks to the kind of spaces we need. You could use lawn varieties that use less water, also gray water from the building. You could drip-irrigate the pines once a week, the lawn could be a native meadow — and the doggies will be playing, people will still be doing yoga, but you would [cut] 75% of the water used now. Getting rid of 100% of lawns is not necessarily realistic for a city that needs these little oases. The issue is that about 70% of our lawns are in backyards, an enormous amount of water is used for them, and they’re more visual than functional. We can educate people about options.

What makes a successful park?

Advertisement

It relates to scale, who’s going to be there, what reflects the culture and interests of the community. People’s first notion about a park is Central Park — big, grassy, lush. So adjusting expectations about that aesthetic, we have a hard row to hoe in L.A. This is the era for our city to think about parks and the river and the urban forest as all one thing.

Why are you a landscape architect?

I like to call myself an urbanist. What designers bring to the table is visualization. We can help people understand the solutions.

Is L.A.'s need for park space different from other places’?

From the advent of the car through the 1980s, Los Angeles was this aspiration: having your own little oasis. The private outweighed the public realm. The city was alienating; you didn’t have a sense of the common good. The private-public gardens like Descanso, the Arboretum, the Huntington are wonderful assets, but you couldn’t just walk down the street [to them]. Things changed dramatically in part because of the leadership, and as public transit began to be layered into the city.

The norm being aspired to across the country is a 15-minute-maximum walk to your closest park. We just don’t have that. We did a lot of great planning — beautiful highways and streets, [but] look how many parks we cut in half to do that: Hollenbeck and Echo Park and MacArthur Park. Environmental justice-wise, wow.

Your Vista Hermosa Park was the first new public park in downtown in more than 100 years. It isn’t just grass and a couple of trees, or just open space. It’s about what a live bird looks like, and seeing running water.

There’s a movement of what we call urban ecology. At Vista Hermosa, there’s a terrace of decomposed granite surrounded by flowering plants from the chaparral, there’s the city in the distance, sycamore trees, a playground, water, boulders; at another level you’re in a grotto. One time I was there, a young family was having a picnic. I said, “How do you like it?” The father says: “I wish we had swings. All the rich people’s parks have swings.” I said: “This is a different kind of park.” As we talked, his kid had gone 30 feet up on the boulders and was playing with sticks and he came down all happy.

Is there a way to reverse-engineer existing parks for the drought?

Yes. The decision might be made for us: If we ration, older parks are going to have to live completely differently. We overwater no matter what, two-thirds more than we need. It’s watering, watering, watering.

We need our urban forest — for shade, for air purification, for humanity and pedestrian comfort, to make the city better. We need to think about how we save our tree canopy, making sure we choose the right trees, and where we have trees, how we care for them.

There’s a lot of incredible collaboration between the county and the cities in L.A., this big sea change as we start to understand water. It makes us realize we’re connected, that it’s one water, and we have to think of it as a whole.

You asked Mayor Garcetti to appoint a design czar. What would that position do?

We now have a tech czar, somebody for economic development, somebody for sustainability. In New York, the mayor’s office and planning department and design folks make sure developers and [city officials] all have a vision of what they want to accomplish with good design. L.A. needs somebody really strong who cares about design.

What are you planning for the former Hollywood Park in Inglewood?

There’s a residential community that’s moving forward with a retail center. It’s a lovely neighborhood, apartments to single-family residences and an arroyo that brings water to a lake. Developers who hold water on the site [will] pay less for connections to the [city water] system. You want the developer to be willing to [set aside] 25 acres. We’ve learned that communities with parks, the land value goes up dramatically.

You designed the new gardens at the county Natural History Museum.

The idea was to do an urban ecological laboratory. The scientists are excited to be able to do research in their own backyard, and people are realizing that having nice gardens in these institutions brings people there, brings birds and bees. There’s a dry stream — in California we don’t have water all the time, but we still have sycamores and willows.

You’ve been working for years on reviving the L.A. River.

I can’t tell you how excited we are that our mayor was able to strike a deal with the president and the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s the beginning of a big change. When we started, immigrant families were already using the river to fish and commute on foot. Now it’s a given [for] biking, hiking. It is being included in the 2024 Olympic bid — that’s where the athletes’ village would be.

What do you think of the new Grand Park in Los Angeles’ civic center?

The amount of programming has been amazing. Of course the programming is also expensive. The community benefits tremendously, [but] it’s not necessarily viable for many city parks given the city budget. It speaks to the multicultural community, and I’m looking forward to seeing how it grows.

The more parks, the better, let’s put it that way, but I do think there’s such a thing as too many efforts at the same time. Like Park 101 [a plan to cover the 101 Freeway with a park, from the river to the cathedral]. A park between Olvera Street and downtown makes sense. But however many blocks they were planning? For $800 million? And the river needs love? That’s what I’m saying about [needing] an uber-urban guru.

What about park prospects at a rather desolate place like LAX?

Advertisement

We’re working at LAX. LAX is a complicated property, and I can’t imagine park space there, but there’s hope in [other] ways. LAX is investigating how to make more sense of the property they own, [like] the rental car lots. Do they consolidate the parking? What do they do with the balance of the land? Do they create housing? Hotel/offices? What does the area become?

You mentioned educating people about landscape options — like what?

I have this idea of having a series of native plant nurseries at public properties — state parks, the Arroyo Seco, Ballona — as a way of educating people on what these plants do. We’re doing a workbook with 10 friends of their gardens before and after the big drought. I want trucks like food trucks to go around neighborhoods on Saturday or Sunday with young people who are knowledgeable about plants saying: “Bring me a picture of your garden. Let’s do a scale drawing and help you figure out drought-tolerant plantings.”

There’s a bit of a backlash against palm trees as nonnative and trite. Your gut reaction?

Advertisement

I love palm trees! I will be on a brigade to save palm trees any day. They’re culturally important for Los Angeles. The birds have learned to perch on them, they grow in, they live forever — leave them alone.

One person is found dead after floodwater sweeps a car off the road and into a creek

Thousands were stranded in Southern California town

As many as 500 children and adults are being safely evacuated Monday after torrential rain and mudslides trapped them at a Southern California church camp, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department told CNN.

The Forest Home camp had been trapped behind a mudflow in Forest Falls -- some 80 miles east of Los Angeles -- stranding staff and middle and high school students.

""We've been able to punch through that last wall of mud so that people on the other side can start making their way out of town,"" fire department spokesman Ryan Beckers said.

Sudden rainfall Sunday had rendered most roads ""impassable due to mudflows"" in Forest Falls, San Bernardino Fire Capt. Kyle Hauducoeur said earlier. Thousands were stranded. Even a local fire station had to be evacuated.

So far, there have been no reports of injuries or missing residents in Forest Falls, population 2,000. Hauducoeur said the damage to homes due to flooding has not been severe.

But elsewhere in San Bernardino County, one person was found dead inside a vehicle that was swept off the road and into a creek by floodwater, county fire department spokesman Chris Prater said.

And 1,500 people in the nearby community of Glen Oak were stranded due to flash flooding, said Dennis Mathisen of Cal Fire

The downpour combined with the terrain made conditions especially daunting.

""Try to imagine the bands of rains from a hurricane -- that's what we're getting,"" Hauducoeur said. ""The difference (is) it's hitting mountains. What was a dry riverbed could become a river 6 feet deep, 20 feet wide.""

He said some roads are now covered with 6 to 8 feet of rock, and ""we have a lot of mud to deal with.""

Officials are asking residents to stay inside their homes and to call 911 if they need to be rescued. Hauducoeur said two swift-water rescue crews are in the area.

Hauducoeur said firefighters expect to be working the Forest Falls area for the next three to four days. But with ongoing wildfires in Northern California, resources will already be stretched thin.

The deluge in San Bernadino County came during one of the worst droughts in California history.

Much the state is grappling with ""exceptional drought,"" according to U.S. Drought Monitor . San Bernardino County has been dealing with ""severe"" or ""extreme"" drought.

38,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Climate Change: Another hurdle for poverty eradication - SKNVibes.com,http://www.sknvibes.com/news/newsdetails.cfm/88359,"August 1st, 2014 -- Today, most persons consider climate change to be a reality and not a myth. A result of this phenomenon, natural hazards have been identified as having crippling effects on many countries, particularly those already vulnerable; Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS). However, the disasters created in these countries as a result of natural hazards are only one aspect of the detrimental effects of climate change. The gradual changes in the environment, on the other hand, such as increased rainfall, extreme drought and rising sea level heighten the problems faced by those countries already vulnerable to climate change as these significant changes impact on agriculture and tourism, both of which are important to the Greater Caribbean and Sustainable Development.



While agriculture is the major economic land-use activity in the Caribbean, it accounts for a small portion of most islands' GDP.

Notwithstanding this however it still holds great importance. The Caribbean Community Secretariat states that in 2005 agriculture accounted for 35% of total GDP in Guyana, 18% in Dominica, 15% in Belize and 8% in Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Lucia, the agriculture sector’s contribution to GDP varied between 3% and 6%. In addition to its contribution to GDP, this sector also plays an increasingly important role in food security in a region typically characterised by increasing importation of food. Agriculture therefore becomes vulnerable to climate change as changes in weather pattern will affect the sector and by extension, those who rely on it.





While the links between climate change and rainfall occurrence are still being debated, the reality is that most countries, particularly those in the hurricane belt, are seeing an increased number of storms, which themselves have increased intensity. The effect of this on countries which dedicate large areas of land to agricultural production for export can be particularly devastating. Recent storms have wiped out the entire sugar cane production of Cuba, banana plantations in Jamaica, St Lucia and Dominica, and decimated nutmeg exports from Grenada. This coupled with the fact that the devastation wreaked on infrastructure curtails the country’s ability to respond. In fact the effects of storms in the region on some island economies have resulted in damages exceeding 200% of country GDP in some cases.





The impact of climate change is also seen in the extreme drought experienced by countries in and out of the traditional dry seasons. The decrease in rainfall has reduced the water available for farming and in some cases has caused the destruction of entire food crops. Rural farming which in some cases is characterised as subsistence farming stand to be affected, causing further hardships on groups already considered vulnerable. In rural Jamaica, 25% of the population lives in poverty and this is where agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Despite the 7% contribution made to GDP by agriculture in Jamaica, it employs over 220,000 of the 1,239,000 people employed. Thus, those already vulnerable to changes in the agriculture sector are even more at a disadvantage with the changes brought on by climate change.

Caribbean SIDS in the Greater Caribbean region also stands to face challenges in the traditional tourism sector as a result of climate change. Traditional tourism (sun, sand and sea tourism) relies on the natural assets of the region; beaches, coral reefs and favourable weather conditions and is a key contributor to regional GDP. Rise in sea level and ocean acidification present real threats to these types of economies. While a lot of attention has been placed on sea level rise, ocean acidification may present even a greater risk to island economies when placed in the context of decreased agricultural production and increased storm intensity. Most Caribbean islands have expansive reef systems which support both the fisheries industry as well as tourism.

Oceans absorb a key climate change gas, carbon dioxide, and as a result become more acidic on a relative scale, because some of the carbon reacts within the water to form carbonic acid. This reduces the amount of dissolved carbonate available for calcium carbonate shell and skeleton formation – important to corals, plankton and shellfish. Corals reefs, already under threat in the region, are likely to have a tough time. The invertebrate species secretes calcium carbonate to make the rocky coastal reefs that form the basis of some of the most productive ecosystems in the oceans. Coupled with bleaching due to warming of the waters it is believed that the reefs could die as corals could become virtually extinct by the end of the century.

Most Caribbean tourism is coastal, with hotels dotting sandy beaches in most countries. Unfortunately the reefs, which are now at risk, provide significant protection from the immense power due to hydro meteorological events such as hurricanes. Without the protection of the reef, the forces caused by the storms damage beaches, thereby reducing the viability of tourism investments. The Inter-American Development Bank states that almost one-third of Caribbean tourism resorts are at flooding risks from sea level rise and increased sea surface temperatures are expected to result in severe bleaching stress to the reefs of the Caribbean as early as the 2030s, surpassing the ability of many areas to recover.

With the impact of climate change on agriculture and tourism being so severe, it is a constant threat to the reduction of poverty in already economically fragile areas. Adaptation strategies need to be employed in order to mitigate the effects and assure the sustainable development of the region. It is thus important that the link between climate change and disaster risk reduction be strengthened





The Association of Caribbean States, through its initiative SHOCS - Strengthening Hydro-Meteorological Operations and Services in the Caribbean SIDS is helping Caribbean countries to be better prepared for such changes arising out of climate change.

In 2004, Paul Martin's Liberals chose to drop Jean Chrétien's policy and tack in a more pro-Israel direction. The change became public when Canada voted alongside the U.S. against a motion at the United Nations that affirmed the right of Palestinians ""to mobilize support for their cause."" Although Stephen Harper and his Conservatives would continue to claim to be better friends of Israel, it was clear from 2004 on that the differences between the parties amounted to only a matter of degree. Differences shrank further in 2012 when Tom Mulcair, a self-described ""ardent supporter of Israel in all instances and circumstances,"" won the leadership of the New Democratic Party. That consensus of party leaderships began to dissolve with Jagmeet Singh's election as NDP leader in October 2017. The latest Gaza war has shaken things up again. ""I don't think Canadian politics on this particular issue is the same as it was a month ago,"" said Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. ""And I don't know that it ever will be the same."" Today, Paul Manly represents Nanaimo-Ladysmith for the Greens, but until 2014, he was a New Democrat. ""I was one of 14 candidates that were rejected by the NDP for having said anything about Israel and Palestine,"" he told CBC News. Former New Democrat MP Jim Manly makes a statement in a pre-recorded video released on YouTube on Oct. 20, 2012, after the ship Estelle was commandeered by Israeli troops.(Canadian Press) In 2012 Manly's father, Jim, himself a former NDP MP and United Church minister, was detained by Israeli commandos who boarded a vessel that was attempting to break Israel's naval blockade and deliver supplies to Gaza. ""When my father was in detention in Israel, no NDP MP would speak out for him, and my own member of Parliament was told that she couldn't speak about the issue,"" Manly said. ""So to not be able to speak up for a constituent stuck in an international situation when other countries are speaking for their citizens really lays bare the hard line that was taken by Tom Mulcair at the time."" Greens divided But Manly's new party has also experienced friction in the wake of recent events. A statement by Green Party Leader Annamie Paul calling for a ceasefire and condemning both Palestinian rocket attacks and excessive Israeli military force appeared to be an attempt to put forward a moderate position close to that of the Trudeau government. Green MP Jenica Atwin responded on Twitter: ""It is a totally inadequate statement.... End Apartheid."" Green MP Jenica Atwin blasted her own leader's statement on Gaza as ""totally inadequate.""(Twitter) Paul, who converted to Judaism 20 years ago, has spoken in Israeli media about the prejudice she faced when running for the Green Party leadership. ""It started out as innuendo, with veiled suggestions and attacks against me as a Zionist,"" she said. ""And then because neither we nor others responded to it, people became more emboldened and more explicit. ""I was accused of the usual tropes, including being in the pocket of foreign agents, being embedded in a political party to further the goals of those foreign agents, and the usual things related to money."" Green Leader Annamie Paul, a convert to Judaism, says she's faced prejudice in politics.(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) The recriminations fly This month, as tensions in the Middle East flared, it was Paul's senior adviser, Noah Zatzman, who charged that ""a range of political actors"" were disseminating ""appalling antisemitism and discrimination ... beginning with Jagmeet Singh and [former Green leadership candidate] Dimitri Lascaris and many Liberal, NDP and sadly, Green MPs."" (The entire Green caucus has only three members.) Zatzman told CBC News he wanted to be clear that his comments about Green MPs did not refer to Elizabeth May, whom he called ""a great friend of the Jewish community."" He said he has suffered ongoing harassment as a result of the position he took within the party, to the extent that his parents felt compelled to delist their address. A Facebook post by Noah Zatzman, senior adviser to Green Party leader Annamie Paul, accused the party's own MPs of antisemitic behaviour.(Facebook) ""I think using accusations of antisemitism to shut down legitimate criticism of human rights abuses is offensive and dangerous, and it dilutes the weight that word carries when it's used to identify real antisemitism,"" Manly told CBC News. Manly responded to Zatzman's claims by publishing an article by his friend and chief of staff, former Israeli soldier Ilan Goldenblatt, entitled ""Criticizing Human Rights Abuses Is Not Anti-Semitism."" NDP position shifting Paul Manly would not be disqualified from today's NDP. Singh hasn't moved the party as far or as fast as his critics on the left would like. But the party has moved beneath his feet. Delegates to the NDP's April convention supported motions calling for ""an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian land"" and an end to ""all trade and economic cooperation with illegal settlements in Israel-Palestine."" When similar motions were proposed at the NDP convention in 2018, they failed even to come to a vote. The NDP's approach to Middle East policy seems to be shifting under leader Jagmeet Singh.(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) The motions led the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) to accuse the NDP of harbouring ""a toxic obsession with Israel."" It said Singh's comments on the recent conflict — by focusing on Palestinian victims while overlooking deaths and injuries from Hamas rockets — were ""cold-hearted, morally reprehensible and inconsistent with his previous statements on the matter."" But Singh has continued to recalibrate his position. ""If we want to achieve peace, we need to apply pressure to achieve it,"" he said this week, making it clear that pressure should be on Israel. Trudeau: Harper-era policy on autopilot Conservative Foreign Affairs critic Michael Chong gave CBC News a restrained statement just before the ceasefire: ""Canada's Conservatives have been clear that Israel is one of Canada's closest allies and we support Israel's right to defend itself. Dialogue and peaceful negotiation are the only path forward towards a settlement between Israelis and Palestinians and an eventual two-state solution. We urge calm and sincerely hope that hostilities cease."" While the Conservatives haven't changed their position on the topic, they have dialed back the volume. Support for Israel is no longer a staple of party fundraisers and the foreign policy focus has clearly shifted to China. The Conservative Party isn't really seeking to highlight differences with Trudeau's Liberals on the conflict — partly because there really aren't any big ones. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau maintained, without fanfare, Stephen Harper's pro-Israel voting record at the UN and, a few months after becoming prime minister, voted in Parliament to condemn BDS (the movement to boycott Israel) ""both here at home and abroad."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has largely maintained the Harper government policy on UN votes related to Israel.(Amr Alfiky/Reuters) When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trudeau to intercede to discourage the International Criminal Court at The Hague from investigating the 2014 Israel-Gaza War, Trudeau wrote to the court that Palestinians, as stateless people, had no right to bring cases for war crimes. But some in his party no longer seem willing to go along with that approach. Splits in Liberal ranks Liberal MP Erskine-Smith said the government is too tolerant of Israeli settlements. ""For as long as I've followed politics, we haven't seen Canadian governments that have acted vocally consistent with Canadian foreign policy, which is that settlement expansion is contrary to international law,"" he said. In April, Erskine-Smith presented a petition calling on Canada to oppose the pending evictions of Palestinian families from homes in the Sheikh Jarrah district of East Jerusalem, an issue that helped trigger the recent deadly conflict. Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith says his government should take a harder line on Israeli settlement expansion.(CBC) ""There's an asymmetry to the conflict between Palestine and Israel,"" he told CBC News. ""And pressure needs to be brought to bear upon Israel to ensure that we don't see continued settlement expansion and we do see greater concern around human rights."" The Trudeau government has voted against dozens of UN resolutions that affirm existing tenets of Canadian policy — such as UN resolution 17/96, guaranteeing the protections of the Geneva Convention to Palestinian civilians. Like the Harper government, it says it does that to protest what it calls the singling out of Israel. Friendly criticism Erksine-Smith said he agrees that ""there are many other countries deserving of criticism on human rights bases as well. And so the singling out of Israel, I think, can be problematic. ""My overall view, though, is that for the very reason that we hold up Israel as an ally, as a democracy with an independent judiciary that shares our values in relation to human rights, it's on those grounds that we ought to criticize as a friend."" Both Liberal MP Erskine-Smith and Green MP Manly said they have been deluged with mail about events in Gaza, and both say they believe that strong reaction was conditioned by a year of protests over racial justice in North America. Changing times Erskine-Smith described a recent friendly conversation with an Israeli diplomat. ""My message to him was: I've not seen this level of correspondence from people who don't follow politics and aren't seized with this really complex issue,"" he said. ""And I think those who represent the Israeli government and Canada need to know that."" The MP said he told the diplomat that current Israeli policies are ""undermining Canadian support for our continued friendship."" If currents are shifting in Canada, Israeli politics are in turmoil. There is a strong chance that the Netanyahu era is drawing to an end. For those whose task it is to argue Israel's cause in Canada, a new Israeli government could make life easier.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.(Sebastian Scheiner/The Associated Press) While the NDP says it wants to halt Canada's arms sales to Israel (which are negligible anyway), what really matters to Israel is Canada's diplomatic support. Without it, Israel's guaranteed votes at the UN could shrink to only the U.S. and the handful of small Pacific Island states that vote with U.S. foreign policy. And even Washington's support — the cornerstone of Israel's security, along with its nuclear deterrent — is looking much less certain in these changed times.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6NVFCpLibBzQDkWtC7Asiw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwMDA7aD0xMzMx/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C1lMCtA78ndRFRDBxD5V_w--~B/aD0yMzI5O3c9MzUwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-05-08T185946Z_1513265598_GM1EA5907JF01_RTRMADP_3_CALIFORNIA-DROUGHT.JPG,"['ancient', 'civilizations', 'israel', 'long', 'battled', 'shows', 'study', 'minister', 'cars', 'policy', 'green', 'israeli', 'paul', 'ndp', 'change', 'mp', 'party', 'climate', 'factories', 'trudeau']",none
40,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Eight reasons why New Yorkers should stop complaining about how hard life is in New York - Quartz,https://qz.com/245847/eight-reasons-why-new-york-is-the-unhappiest-city-in-the-us/,"If you have ever been to New York, read anything about it, or listened to Frank Sinatra, you know the two most important things about the Big Apple are that it’s the best city on earth and an incredibly tough place to live.

Busy, expensive, dirty, too hot or too cold, New York is a giant rat race—and full of actual rats—with a challenging scarcity of real estate, eligible bachelors, and large sodas (no, just kidding, the soda ban was banned). New York is so tough that a recent study found it to be America’s unhappiest city.

Detroit went bankrupt; Toledo, Ohio has an ongoing drinking-water emergency; Santa Cruz, California was hit by a drought—but New York is unhappier?

New Yorkers have elevated grousing to an art form, so of course a study that takes into account their self-assessment of happiness will find them miserable.

In an attempt to make New Yorkers feel better about themselves, here is some context to their commonest complaints.

1. The rent is too damn high

True. The rent is high. The rent in most of Manhattan (and some of Brooklyn) is offensively high.

Perhaps New Yorkers would be happier in Monte Carlo, where renting a 1,300 sq ft (120 sq m) apartment costs $10,099 (versus New York’s $6,553), or in Willston, North Dakota, where the shale oil boom means the average rent is about $800 more than New York’s (and people can’t even line up downstairs to get a cronut).

Also, what about the price to income ratio?

2. Apartments are too small

It’s not just the price of homes that makes New Yorkers unhappy. It’s the size.

The city’s minimum size for a unit of living space is 400 sq ft (41 sq m), although there are plans to begin building 300 sq feet micro-units at the end of the year. Now that’s small—as in, a small building in Hong Kong.

3. It’s too competitive

A study was published by the Economist Intelligence Unit last year labeling New York “the world’s most competitive city.” Promptly, publications including the New York Times chimed in to prove New Yorkers right, noting that “anyone who has tried to park a car on a Manhattan street may already have deemed New York the world’s most competitive city.”

The study actually looked at how competitive New York is compared to other cities, not at the city’s own competitiveness.

But it sure is hard to make it. For instance, trying to get a job:

4. Winters are too cold

New York winters are rather brutal. But have you ever spent a winter in Montreal? And when’s the last time you heard someone from Ulan Bator (where the temperature gets to -49°C) go on a rant about the freezing weather?

5. Summers? Too hot

Unless you compare them with the high temperatures of places where it actually is too hot.

6. Traffic’s terrible

Most New Yorkers don’t drive. But they take taxis and sometimes those taxis get stuck in traffic. It’s awful, which is why New Yorkers always know what route the taxi should take to avoid ending up in a jam. Such routes also often fail because—see?—traffic is everywhere.

And while traffic is everywhere—parking? None in sight. Except for the 4.4 million free parking spaces (and 81,875 metered ones) around town.

7. It’s too crowded

If you had to pick only one word about New York to carry with you on a desert island, “busy” would be it. People are busy. Places are busy. Train cars are busy.

Because there are just too many people in New York.

no-caption

8. And tourists are everywhere

In 2012, 52.7 million tourists (both domestic and international) visited New York. That’s about 6.5 tourists a year for every New Yorker.

But it could be a lot worse. It could be Venice, where there are 50,000 residents and 22 million tourists a year.

That’s 440 tourists per person.","Fri, 08 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ap563790248213.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['hard', 'complaining', 'million', 'busy', 'reasons', 'life', 'sq', 'study', 'rent', 'tourists', 'competitive', 'yorkers', 'yorks', 'york', 'stop']",none

42,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Does lack of black models on cover of British Vogue amount to racism? - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/black-model-british-vogue-naomi-campbell-racism,"Landing the front cover of British Vogue catapults a model to supermodel status, it is an integral part of being booked for the biggest catwalks and advertising campaigns. It is a gateway to stardom, a pinnacle of fashion modelling. It has also become resolutely white-only.

The August 2002 edition of British Vogue featured Naomi Campbell as the cover star – smiling and relaxed in boot cut jeans and a white vest. Since then, 12 years and 146 covers have been shot, edited and distributed to newsstands and not one has featured an individual black model.

In September 2013 Naomi Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison wrote an open letter calling on designers to diversify their catwalks. ""No matter the intention, the result is racism. Not accepting another based on the colour of their skin is clearly beyond aesthetic.""

As well as designers, there is increasing anger at the attitudes of major fashion magazines such as British Vogue.

Modelling agencies are keen for the industry to move forward and are openly vying for the top spot. Carole White, founder of Premier Model Management and outspoken critic of the lack of diversity in the fashion industry, says: ""I'm surprised that there has not been a black model on the cover of British Vogue for this amount of time as we are such a diverse country, but perhaps British Vogue think the calibre of black models are not out there?""

""Back when Premier Model Management looked after Naomi Campbell, she was the first and only black model to front the Prada campaign in 1994 then went onto do the British Vogue cover in 2002. Our Premier Model Malaika is the first girl since Naomi to front a Prada campaign (the 2014 campaign), so logic would dictate that Malaika would be the next black model to appear on the cover soon.""

Jody Furlong, founder of The Eye Casting, believes the decision to exclude black models from the cover is deliberate. ""Let's talk about British models for a start, because that would be one excuse – 'oh there's no British girls'. There is Naomi Campbell, probably the biggest British model of all time other than Kate Moss; Malaika Firth a really massive model at the moment; Betty Adewole a Tom Ford model; and of course Jourdan Dunn – one of the biggest models in the world.""

I asked British Vogue whether they had an explanation for their editorial policy and how they responded to allegations that their actions amount to racism. In particular could they explain why industry favourite Dunn has not been given her own cover (she was in a group cover six years ago). As Furlong points out: ""Jourdan Dunn is a Burberry girl, a Givenchy girl, a Prada girl. There is no debate about whether she is beautiful enough or elegant enough or the right kind of person to be on Vogue – she ticks every single box.""

The reply from the Vogue press office, accredited to editor Alexandra Shulman states: ""We have put Beyoncé and Rihanna on the cover of Vogue and at least half our covers do not feature models. We love Jourdan Dunn and she was the cover star of the last Miss Vogue which previously had featured Cara Delevingne.""

Anna Wintour's US edition of Vogue is almost entirely dominated by celebrity covers, with white actresses making up the overwhelming majority. When a celebrity appears on the cover of a magazine she is not there purely as a symbol of beauty but because of other accolades.

Is it truly the case then that black models are just kept off British Vogue by celebrities? The online archive of all British Vogue covers since 1916 shows that since Naomi Campbell in August 2002, 95 covers have featured models compared to just 58 featuring celebrities (Beyonce and Rihanna being just two). So far in 2014 there have been two celebrities used, compared to seven white models.

The chosen models do multiple covers – Kate Moss had three covers in 2006 alone, Cara Delevingne is on her second this year. But there are also numerous appearances by models who are unknown beyond the confines of fashion, like Daria Werbowy and Natalia Vodianova.

As well as 'there aren't any black models' or 'it's because of celebrity culture', there is another excuse for racism floating around the fashion industry: ""There is this fallacy that 'black covers don't sell'"" explains Furlong. ""But how do you know? There hasn't been one for twelve years! You can't say people don't buy it when they're not given the chance to buy it.""

As well as being deeply offensive to black women, being used as an excuse for racism is insulting to consumers of fashion magazines. The last 12 years of side-lining black models reflects the attitudes of those at the top of the fashion industry, not those of fashion fans. The fashion industry has a problem with race which goes far beyond just fashion magazine covers, however ending years of cover discrimination would be an important step. Based in London, one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world, British Vogue could be spearheading change.

""Treat black models the same as you would treat any other kind of model,"" states Furlong. ""Jourdan Dunn is a household name, there has to have been a specific and conscious decision not to use her. If she was white, at her level, she would have had multiple Vogue covers by now – no doubt about it.""

43,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"New Flying Reptile Found in ""Unprecedented"" Pterosaur Boneyard - National Geographic",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/140813-pterosaur-dinosaurs-science-animals-new-species,"Nearly 50 skeletons of a new species of ancient flying reptile have been unearthed in southern Brazil, an ""absolutely unprecedented"" discovery, one expert says.

Varying ages of the newfound species, dubbed Caiuajara dobruskii, fill the rare boneyard, which was once part of a desert lake in the late Cretaceous period, about 100 million to 66 million years ago. With a wingspan of up to 7.7 feet (2.35 meters) C. dobruskii had a head that was shaped differently from those of other pterosaurs, including a bony protrusion in front of its eyes. (See ""New Golden Age for Pterosaurs, Flying Reptiles of the Dinosaur Era."")

The discovery offers the ""best evidence ever uncovered"" that the extinct dinosaur-era animals, called pterosaurs, may have lived in colonies, said study author Alexander Kellner, a paleontologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

It also offers a new window into how the animals—the first vertebrates to fly—developed into adults.

Finding such an intact fossil site is unusual—though pterosaurs were found on every continent, their fragile wing bones do not preserve well. What's more, most pterosaur remains have been found near what was once oceans or lagoons, not desert.

""To be honest with you, when they first told me they had pterosaur bones, I was going, 'Yeah, sure,'"" Kellner said. But once he confirmed the bones, he was thrilled. (See ""Toothy Texas Pterosaur Discovered; Soared Over Dallas."")

""To find part of what could be part of a [pterosaur] population is really splendid,"" he said.

Flamingo-Like Reptiles?

Caiuajara dobruskii gets the second half of its name from Alexandre Dobruski and João Dobruski, the local father and son who first noticed odd bones poking out of the ground near Cruzeiro do Oeste (map) in 1971. But it wasn't until a few years ago that paleontologists began excavating the site and found the incredible jumble of skeletons.

It's unknown why or how the 47 pterosaurs died, but it's possible a desert storm or a drought caused their untimely ends, Kellner said.

To Mark Witton, author of the 2013 book Pterosaurs, the ""gem"" of the new research is finding so many pterosaurs in one place from the same species.

For instance, the number of animals found together suggests that C. dobruskii lived in groups, like flamingos, which may have flocked to the inland lake as an oasis in the otherwise dry landscape, said Witton, who was not involved in the research.

What's more, the new research, published August 13 in the journal PLOS ONE, allows scientists to chart the development of a pterosaur from youth to adulthood, providing ""a really detailed, step-by-step representation of actual fossils and how it changes,"" Witton said. (See ""Pterosaur 'Runway' Found; Shows Birdlike Landing Style."")

Historically, scientists have only been able to piece together how pterosaurs developed and lived based on skeleton fragments.

Independent Youth

Already, the new study hints that young pterosaurs were not highly dependent on their parents.

That's because juvenile pterosaurs found in the boneyard seemed to be miniature versions of adults—for instance, the young sported the adult signature crests on their heads.

Being so well developed, this means the young could also probably fly from birth, noted James Clark, a biologist at George Washington University's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences in Washington, D.C., who was also not involved in the new study.

It's ""really rare to get that kind of assemblage and growth series—you don't see that in that same extent in other collections"" of pterosaur fossils, Clark said.

Such independence is typical of some modern reptiles, such as crocodiles, which are born looking like tiny grown-ups, Witton added. (See ""Meet Kryptodrakon: Oldest Known Pterodactyl Found in China."")

""This is really going to give us so much information about how these animals grow, what their population structures were like—so much data for us to look at,"" Witton said.

And experts seem confident more fossils await. Said Witton: ""I'm sure this is not the last we've heard of this site.""

The team’s algorithm adjusts 40 different attributes in photos that the researchers determined are connected to our perception of weather. The resulting software can easily alter a lush green landscape to make it appear covered in snow or subjected to drought.

“Programs like Photoshop are really powerful, but you basically need to be an artist to use them. We want anybody to be able to manipulate photographs as easily as you’d manipulate text.” said James Hays, Manning Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Brown.

To identify the attributes that enable us to identify weather in photos, the scientists commissioned Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing engine to rate photos based on perceptual and subjective qualities. Does a certain photo show a sunset or a sunrise? Is it gloomy or clear? You can explore an interactive version of the team’s data set at their project website, or use weather attributes to search the catalog of images that went into the development of the algorithm.

The software will be presented in a paper at next week’s SIGRAPH 2014, an international conference on interactive and computer graphics.","Fri, 08 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2014/08/teaser400ppi.jpg,"['launch', 'manipulate', 'identify', 'software', 'weather', 'technology', 'interactive', 'scientists', 'computer', 'attributes', 'teams', 'change', 'photos']",none
45,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Population explosion - The Economist,https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/08/14/population-explosion,"HAOWA was already struggling to feed five children before she gave birth to triplets in the Gabi region of southern Niger 19 months ago. Now, when her babies scream for food she often finds herself helpless. “If they cry and I have nothing to give them, then I must let them cry,” she says, cradling two infants who bear the hallmarks of malnutrition. Their hair is yellowing, their bellies are distended and their expressions glazed. They lack the energy to shake the flies from their faces. It is a dismal but depressingly common picture in west Africa’s largest country.

Niger is, by the reckoning of the UN’s Human Development Index, the poorest place on earth. Most of its inhabitants eke out a living growing subsistence crops on small plots of dusty, infertile land. Despite this agricultural bias, the drought-stricken country cannot feed itself, even in good years. An estimated 2.5m people out of a total of 17m have no secure source of food. When harvests fail, which they do almost annually, that number shoots up. In 2012, when the worst of the recent food crises ravaged the Sahel region, almost a quarter of Niger’s population was said to be going hungry, prompting desperate relief campaigns by international donors.

This perpetual food crisis is compounded by doggedly high fertility rates. With an average of 7.6 children per woman, Niger has the world’s highest rates. Poverty, ignorance and poor access to contraception are contributing factors, as are cultural issues like competition between wives. Men in Niger tend to be polygamous, and local doctors note that their spouses often try to prove their value by outdoing each other in child births. This contributes to Niger having the highest population growth rate on earth. At current projections, the number of inhabitants will more than triple between now and 2050 to 55m.

In such circumstances, demographers mostly agree, family planning is key. Two years ago, only 12% of women in Niger professed to use modern contraceptive methods. That is a reasonable increase on rates of 5% in 2005 but dismally low by global standards. About 50% of women of child-bearing age use modern contraceptives in Rwanda and Zimbabwe.

The improvements that have been registered are, in large part, the work of donors. Across the country, foreign-funded health centres are promoting long-term options like contraceptive implants; local health workers are being trained to distribute other prophylactics. At present the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the only importer of contraceptives, flying in millions of dollars’ worth this year. It runs a “school for husbands” which teaches men, who traditionally tended to obstruct women seeking birth control, about family planning. The schools hope to dispel wild rumours about contraception. One woman living outside of Zinder, the country’s second-biggest city, used to believe the pill would cause haemorrhages or make her unborn child anaemic. “I was scared for the first two months,” she says.

The political will to improve things is weak: the government professes support but allocates only a tiny proportion of its budget to family planning. And the appetite for change among the population is limited. Only about a quarter of women express any desire to space out their births, let alone reduce their number. More than 20 years ago Niger identified population control as a priority in the fight against poverty. But birth rates are still rising.","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.economist.com/img/b/595/335/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140816_MAP006_1.jpg,"['rates', 'ago', 'niger', 'planning', 'number', 'birth', 'family', 'women', 'population', 'explosion', 'food']",none

""Yeah, we're desperate,"" said Romo with a smile. ""No, that's a joke. I think you don't have that feeling of desperation ever, I think the feeling that comes across is more you're upset. Not happy with the outcome.""

There may not be desperation, but there is pressure. The Cowboys have failed to make the playoffs for 4 consecutive seasons. The longest playoff drought of the Jerry Jones era, dating back to 1989.

""It doesn't sit well with anybody,"" said Romo. ""Everyone was disappointed. We had a chance last year but we didn't get the job done.""

Dez Bryant wears No. 88, but he's tired of 8 and 8. Bryant has never experience the playoffs.

""That bothers me a lot,"" said Bryant. ""I think the work we put in this off season will give us the results to see if we can be there at the end of the year.""

Hoping to get over the hump, the Cowboys have made major changes to their roster. Letting go of veteran leaders, the Cowboys have gone younger in 2014. Jerry Jones says it's not a rebuilding project.

""It is not about next year,"" said Jones. ""We've gone from possibly being one of the older teams to one of the younger teams. But I think we have the fundamentals to be able to compete and compete right now.""

""We're trying to redeem ourselves from last year and not be that same 8 and 8 team,"" said cornerback Morris Claiborne. ""That's fire under each player, coach out here to go out and get the job done.""

China Conference Highlights Food Safety and Sustainable Agriculture

The deleterious effects of GE foods and their related pesticides were aired at the Food Safety & Sustainable Agriculture Forum 2014, held in Beijing on July 25-26.

""China is taking a lead in assessing agricultural methods for local and imported foods, and GMOs are under intense scrutiny as to their safety,” said GE Free NZ president Claire Bleakley who attended the forum.

“China with over a billion people is taking safe food production very seriously and cleaning up its supply chain. There is a strong move toward sustainable agro-ecological methods of food production and processing, with significant implications for New Zealand producers and exporters.""

A particular concern for food safety discussed in Beijing is the rising level of pesticides related to GMOs entering the food chain. [1]

The international conference included genetic researchers, university professors, medical doctors, veterinarians, livestock farmers, arable farmers, agricultural consultants, leaders and community groups from China, Taiwan, U.S.A, Russia, U.K., France, Denmark, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and Peru. [2]

Dr. Vandana Shiva and Dr. Hans Herren talked about examples of existing food production systems for agro-ecological sustainability, with an emphasis on non-pesticide land use methods. The importance for seed diversity and the ability of such systems to provide long-term resilience in times of drought and flood was highlighted.

Agro-ecological methods increase yields and nutrition for those who are living in areas of weather extremes and where food can be scarce. It is also important for farmers to be able to retain sovereignty over their food systems by saving seeds that have acclimatised to specific growing conditions.

Dr. Shiva showed how successfully protecting seed diversity and organic systems provides resilience for farmers and communities. In India, GE crops have been a disaster for farmers especially those who embraced GE cotton in areas reliant on direct rainfall. Crop failure has led to disproportionate levels of farmer suicide.

Pig farmer, Mr. Ib Pedersen, fed his animals GM soy and found that the adverse effects heavily impacted his ability to farm economically. Animal health deteriorated to the extent that the animals were suffering from constant diarrhoea, irritability, and reproductive disorders leading to severe defects, congenital malformations, and death.

Mr. Gloeckner, dairy farmer, who was initially happy to trial GE corn on his stock, was shocked to find his animals died after eating the corn. He had to sell his farm and has been devastated economically and emotionally by this experience. Chinese investigative journalists reported similar stories from farmers in China.

Scientists from France and Australia and the USA reported on their animal research with GE foods with results showing severe gut inflammation, liver and kidney problems and tumour development.

The clinical report by Dr. Vazquez, paediatrician from Argentina, was chilling; his practice has seen a tripling in cancer rates, deformities, abortions and children born with tumours, Downs syndrome, and Spina bifida, all in areas where herbicide-tolerant GE crops are grown.

Zen Honeycutt, Moms across America, tested the levels of RoundUp residues (RoundUp’s active ingredient Glyphosate is a registered antibiotic), in the urine of mothers and children. She spoke of concern for the health of children and adults because of constant exposure to the antibiotic properties of RoundUp herbicides in GE food.

Dr. Stephanie Seneff presented her research into the link between glyphosate and autism, as well as increases in allergies, gut disorders and mineral deficiencies. [3]

“This growing body of scientific evidence of harm is shocking. The very seeds that have sustained people's health for millennia are now, because of GE foods, causing a lifetime of deformities and chronic disease,"" said Claire Bleakley.

“The deleterious effects of GE DNA may be worse than a nuclear catastrophe due to the long term persistence of the engineered genes in the environment causing intergenerational adverse effects on complex living systems.""

Evidence discussed at the conference constitutes a direct warning for New Zealand.

The government, agricultural producers and exporters must heed the rising rejection of GE foods in markets such as China, and support New Zealand’s current GE-Free status by investing in agro-ecological, sustainable methods that support a safe food system.

49,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Column: President Obama's troubling dinner party - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmanus-column-africa-summit-human-rights-20140806-column.html,"The Obama administration erred on the side of inclusion in deciding which leaders to invite to its ambitious U.S.-Africa summit this week — at least in the view of human rights advocates.

The guest list featured some of Africa’s nastiest tyrants, including autocrats such as Angola’s Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Equatorial Guinea’s Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who traveled to Washington for the summit, which included an official dinner at the White House.

Usually, leaders with such dismal records on democracy and human rights aren’t welcomed at White House galas. This time, however, Obama excluded only four of the continent’s leaders (Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe along with the leaders of Eritrea, Sudan and the Central African Republic).

That left some of Africa’s most admirable democratic presidents, such as Ghana’s John Dramani Mahama and Tanzania’s Jakaya Kikwete, having to compete for attention with some of its most authoritarian. Obiang, for example, who recently celebrated the 35th anniversary of the military coup that brought him to power in 1979, has jailed or killed virtually all of his political opponents.

But the three-day summit wasn’t primarily about democracy and human rights. It was about ways the U.S. government and private enterprise can form partnerships in Africa to promote the continent’s promising economies.

To be sure, the challenges of building the institutions of “civil society” were on the agenda too, but only as a sideshow. “It’s not possible to succeed for your people unless they have a chance to shape the policies of their government,” Vice President Joe Biden told an audience of African civic leaders Monday. “Democracy has taken root, and now it’s trying to grow; it’s trying to flourish in places where it’s very difficult.”

But few of the African leaders were in the room at the time. And if there was any blunt talk about human rights in places such as Angola and Equatorial Guinea, it happened in private.

The theory, U.S. officials say, is that lecturing African countries about the virtues of democracy — or even helping them build civil institutions such as an independent judiciary — isn’t always an effective way to nudge them toward more open political systems.

Instead, the underlying theme of the summit was that security against terrorism and economic development must come first, and that — if all goes well — political progress will naturally follow.

But that message has dismayed traditional advocates of human rights.

“It’s been enormously disappointing,” Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch told me. “Promotion of human rights and democracy is very important to this administration, but only after it gets done promoting security issues and business.”

In Egypt, Ethiopia and Nigeria, he charged, the United States has gone easy on human rights violations because it counts those governments as allies in the struggle against Islamist extremists. And throughout Africa, U.S. government funding for democracy promotion has been cut while economic aid has grown.

Administration officials bristle at the suggestion they’ve relegated human rights to second place. “We’re committed to supporting strong democratic institutions in Africa,” Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security advisor, told reporters before the summit.

But other officials acknowledge that human rights can’t always come first. “Let’s be honest: At times … we do business with governments that do not respect the rights we hold most dear,” national security advisor Susan Rice said last year. “Still, over time, we know that our core interests are inseparable from our core values, that our commitment to democracy and human rights roundly reinforces our national security.”

In Africa, the picture has been complicated by a new factor: the rapidly growing economic presence of China. China’s trade with Africa has far outpaced U.S. commerce there in recent years, and China’s investment in the continent has been growing fast.

The problem, officials say, is that Chinese investment flows into African countries without pressure for democratic governance or demands that countries crack down on corruption.

Obama’s announcement Tuesday of $14 billion in new investments by U.S. companies — many of them in a program called Power Africa aimed at bringing electricity to the continent’s underdeveloped interior — was intended to help close the U.S.-China investment gap.

“These projects are a way we can compete with the Chinese for influence,” one official said. “We need to be on the playing field, even if we don’t play the same way.”

Obama was even more pointed in an interview with the Economist last week. “My advice to African leaders is to make sure that if, in fact, China is putting in roads and bridges, number one, that they’re hiring African workers; number two, that the roads don’t just lead from the mine to the port to Shanghai.”

For autocratic leaders in Africa, dealing with Beijing may be easier. But the administration will have work to do to ensure that U.S. economic investments also contribute to progress for human rights and democratic values.

The advocates of civil society in Africa have a good product to sell. Power Africa and other U.S. investments should be used to help them get that necessary foot in the door.

8/4/2014 Update:Toledo City Government Declares Water Safe

Residents of Toledo can safely use their tap water for drinking, according to a government release lifting the “Do Not Drink” advisory.

“Effective immediately, customers of the City of Toledo Public Water system may now safely drink tap water. Consistent test results have shown Microcystin no longer exceeds the recommended drinking water warning of 1 microgram per liter standard set by the World Health Organization in testing done by the City of Toledo, the Ohio EPA and the US EPA,” the release says.

Residents who used no water for any purpose over the weekend were advised to flush their household lines. Residents who used water for toilets, showering, and other non-consumptive uses were not required to flush their lines. The city also asked all residents to conserve water “to help our water treatment plant as it returns to full operation.”

The City of Toledo has issued a “Do Not Drink” advisory for residents served by Toledo Water after chemical tests confirmed the presence of unsafe levels of the algal toxin Microcystin in the drinking water plant’s finished water. The advisory, spanning three counties in Ohio and one in Michigan, leaves more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without drinking water.

“Do not drink the water,” Melanie Amato, public information officer for the Ohio Department of Health,” told Circle of Blue. “You can shower in it, bathe in it, but do not try to ingest it. That means no washing dishes; you can brush your teeth with it as long as you don’t swallow any water, but we recommend using bottled water for that as well.”

“Do not drink the water.” –Melani Amato

Ohio Department of Health

The Toledo advisory was posted at 2:00 Saturday morning. Ohio governor John Kasich soon announced a state of emergency to mobilize more resources for the city.

Other emergency measures also became apparent across northwest Ohio:

Stores sold out of bottled water, sending residents into neighboring cities and Michigan to find supplies.

Local restaurants, universities and public libraries closed.

Several nearby municipalities that have not been affected by the toxin are offering water to Toledo residents free of charge.

The National Guard is charged with delivering 300 cases of bottled water from Akron, Ohio, as well as Meals Ready to Eat (MRE’s) for distribution to homeless shelters and other vulnerable populations who are unable to cook with their water.

Humanitarian organizations like the American Red Cross are responding, manning water distribution centers and providing water delivery assistance to homebound residents.

“[The bloom] is surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.” –Justin Chaffin

Stone Laboratory

Microcystin is a toxin produced by blooms of freshwater algae, which are a vast and growing problem in Lake Erie—Toledo’s drinking water source. Microcystin can cause nausea, vomiting, and liver damage if ingested, and it has been known to kill dogs and livestock that drink contaminated water. Skin contact with the toxin can also cause irritation and rashes, though levels in treated water are not high enough at this time to warrant a complete ban on water use, Amato said.

Microcystin appears to be a growing public health problem in the western portions of Lake Erie. Almost a year ago, in September 2013, Carroll Township near Toledo detected dangerous levels of Microcystin in its water supply, shut down its water treatment plant, and simultaneously alerted the community’s 2,000 residents not to drink the water.

Toledo is the first major city in the Great Lakes region to fall victim to Microcystin contamination, despite testing and treatment for the toxin. The city allocated $US 4 million for water treatment chemicals last year—double what it spent in 2010. The spending increase is largely due to concerns about algal toxins. City water managers were especially worried after the Carroll Township crisis, which was alleviated by the township’s ability to connect to an outside water supply while it flushed the toxin from its own system. It is unclear if Toledo has similar options available. The city’s Facebook page states:

“It is understandable that there is a huge degree of public concern, but we would advise everyone to remain calm, an alternative water supply and a distribution system will be announced as quickly as possible.”

Algal Bloom Small, But Concentrated

The culprit behind Toledo’s drinking water problems is a toxic algal bloom in Lake Erie’s Maumee Bay. The bloom is not very large compared to past blooms, and Microcystin levels, though high, are not out of the range of those previously seen on the lake.

Toledo’s Water Treatment Process In an interview with Circle of Blue last October, David Leffler, commissioner of water plant operations for Toledo Public Utilites, described the city’s water treatment process: “Initially our intake sits three miles out into the lake, and we add potassium permanganate at the intake crib,” he said. “It takes about three hours to get to shore, so it’s got 3 hours of mixing time. The water tumbles through the pipe and gets into our low service system out in Jerusalem Township where a series of pumps picks the water up and puts it under pressure into two pipes to send it to the treatment plant. Now the treatment plant is 9 miles away. Once you pick it up at low service, we add activated carbon, so now it’s got permanganate and activated carbon in it. The permanganate does a couple things. It treats for taste and odor—that’s why we do it—but it also breaks down the algae and the toxin. To [travel] that 9 miles can take anywhere between three-and-a-half to nine hours to get to the plant, so a lot of that is absorbed onto the carbon.” “Then it gets into the treatment plant and once it’s into the treatment plant, we add limes for softening, we add alum to create a flock to gather up the fine particles and make them into large particles that drop out and the water gets clear so you get rid of all the suspended solids. Then it goes through a whole series of filters—sand filters and things to purify it—then we add chlorine at the end. From there it goes into two 35 million gallon storage tanks, and from that point is where we pick it up with our high service pumps and put it out into the system. “We test all along that route to see where we’re at, what we need to do, what we need to adjust, and it’s really not just a matter of throwing a bunch of chemicals at it. I have a staff of extremely talented, highly trained certified chemists that are constantly doing bench tests, jar tests, with the various concentrations [of chemicals] that we’re using to see what it does to the actual water, because we bring in samples of that water all along the process and they can visually see, ok if we go to this many parts per million it will do this, so they are constantly doing magic to it. They’re good. They do over 4,000 tests a month on the water.”

“The bloom right now isn’t big in terms of spatial coverage, but it is pretty dense in Maumee bay and that area of western Lake Erie,” Justin Chaffin, a senior researcher at The Ohio State University’s Stone Laboratory in Put-in-Bay, Ohio, told Circle of Blue. “It is pretty much surrounding where the Toledo water intake pipes are.”

The bloom in that area is very concentrated and thick, he added.

“I’m not sure what levels they were seeing coming in through their pipes, but we were out there sampling on Wednesday and we got Microcystin levels around 10 to 20 parts per billion.”

The acceptable level of Microcystin in drinking water is 1 part per billion, according to the World Health Organization. Typically, the city of Toledo is able to chemically treat their drinking water to bring Microcystin levels below that threshold, even if the intakes receive high levels of the toxin. Chaffin said that there was likely a mixing event—such as a storm or strong wind—that forced the toxic algae, which normally floats on top of the water, down to the bottom where the intakes are located.

The city is now hurrying to test water samples drawn from throughout the treatment and distribution system to track the Microcystin concentrations. Testing a batch of samples takes approximately three to four hours once the test is started, according to Chaffin.

“They are running water samples from hospitals, really from all over Toledo,” he said. “Everyone that does Microcystin sampling in the Toledo area is either sending their [test] kits to the Oregon [Ohio] treatment plant or the city of Toledo’s treatment plant. They are just swamped with samples and they were running out of kits.”

Toledo is also sending water samples to labs in Cincinnati to undergo a more complete analysis. There are approximately 80 different kinds of Microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, Chaffin said. Although all are toxic, their level of toxicity varies. The more extensive tests will help to determine a more accurate level of the toxin in the water.

Algal Blooms a Growing Problem

“Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs.” –Adam Rissien

Ohio Environmental Council

Commonplace in Lake Erie in the 1960s, toxic algal blooms disappeared from the lake following international, national and state efforts to reduce the phosphorus pollution that drives them. The federal Clean Water Act of 1972 was especially important for reducing phosphorus from city sewage plants and other “point” sources that discharged pollutants from a pipe. The CWA, however, did little to address phosphorus runoff from farms and lawns, known as “nonpoint” sources. Researchers have shown that a rise in phosphorus levels—particularly a form of the nutrient that is readily available to promote algae growth—has coincided with renewed blooms in Lake Erie, and international agencies have called for a reduction in phosphorus to alleviate problematic blooms in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. The largest bloom ever recorded on the lake occurred in 2011. Scientists and environmental groups say addressing agriculture is particularly important for reducing the blooms.

“I have every confidence in the water treatment plant to figure out how to make the drinking water safe,” Adam Rissien, director of agricultural and water policy at the Ohio Environmental Council, told Circle of Blue.“Unfortunately, the options available to them are costly and that means a rate increase—there’s no way around it. Until we reduce phosphorus and address harmful algal blooms, I’m afraid it’s going to come on the ratepayers’ backs. And that’s not fair.”

Governments in the United States and Canada are working to create new targets for phosphorus loading in Lake Erie to better address the changing drivers of toxic algal blooms in the lake. Draft numbers for the new targets could be released as early as this fall.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, a binational pact to protect the Great Lakes first signed in 1972, limits the amount of phosphorus that can be discharged into the lake to 11,000 metric tons per year. Despite meeting this target for all but five years since 1984, harmful algal blooms have reemerged in Lake Erie, prompting a call for new targets in 2012 when the GLWQA was last renewed.

The development of the new targets—and measures to implement them—gained more urgency last week after a harmful algal bloom contaminated the water supply for more than 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio.

“When they set the 11,000 metric tons [target], it was about total phosphorus,” Raj Bejankiwar, a physical scientist for the International Joint Commission—the governing body of the GLWQA—told Circle of Blue. “In the 1970s and 80s, of the entire phosphorus loads coming into Lake Erie, 70 percent of that total phosphorus was not available to the algae. Only about 30 percent was bioavailable. In recent years, about the last 14 to 15 years of data, most of the phosphorus getting into the lake has been dissolved phosphorus, which is very bioavailable.”

“We are asking the governments to look into the timing of the loadings as well as the nature of the phosphorus.” –Raj Bejankiwar

International Joint Commission

In addition, that phosphorus has been coming into the lake in big pulses, with much of it being released between March and June, Bejankiwar said.

“The [phosphorus] targets are typically for one year, but we can’t look at it in terms of annual loads—we have to look at spring loading,” he said. “The big issue is, under climate change, we are seeing more severe rainfall and more frequent rainfall in the springtime. That’s why we think the current 11,000 metric tons [target] is not working. We are asking the governments to look into the timing of the loadings as well as the nature of the phosphorus.”

Voluntary Measures Not Enough

Once the new targets are approved, the respective state and provincial governments will be assigned to find ways to meet them by reducing phosphorus output. Under the original GLWQA, this took the form of banning phosphorus from detergents and regulating phosphorus discharge from municipal wastewater treatment plants and factories, as well as working with farmers to reduce erosion. Before the GLWQA, the total amount of phosphorus entering Lake Erie each year was upwards of 20,000 metric tons, meaning the countries cut their discharges approximately by half to meet the targets.

Recommendations in the most recent IJC report on Lake Erie, released in February, and in studies released by researchers at the University of Michigan, found that similar cuts will be needed to clean up the lake this time. As Circle of Blue reported in February, the studies suggest that total phosphorus coming into Lake Erie’s western and central basins will need to be reduced by 46 percent, and phosphorus coming from the Maumee River should be reduced by 39 percent.

The IJC is limited to a research and advisory role, and its recommendations do not have the force of law. Toledo’s drinking water scare, however, has the IJC and many other groups calling for meaningful action.

“We believe that this incident is saying we need to have stronger actions in terms of regulations,” Bejankiwar said. “It is always good to have voluntary actions, but in these days it is highly likely we should also take strong regulatory actions.”

“[The problem] is not going to go away. It needs focused attention and a lot of important conversations need to happen.” –Jennifer Caddick

Alliance for the Great Lakes

Ideas for regulations—such as banning fertilizer application on frozen ground—have been introduced by a coalition of conservation organizations and Lake Erie business associations. Regulatory bills have not yet been introduced by state or federal legislators.

“Our recommendations are specifically talking about calling on the governors and the premier of Ontario to implement measurable [phosphorus] reductions on a specific timetable,” Jennifer Caddick, engagement director for Alliance for the Great Lakes, told Circle of Blue. “We haven’t seen any movement on that, but it has not even been a week. I’m sure there are lots of conversations happening on that.”

Caddick added that the IJC’s report was an important starting point for these discussions, providing solid numbers about needed reductions.

“We really hope in the next couple weeks people will continue to focus on this,” she said. “It is not going to go away. It needs focused attention and a lot of important conversations need to happen. We and our partners are continuing those conversations, and we urge the governors and senators to engage in those conversations quickly as well.”

Diplomats, bankers and finance ministers professed to be more than a little impressed with the free wireless internet access on the conference buses. One delegate glanced at the state-of-the-art submachine guns carried by the omnipresent and unsmiling Rwandan army guards, complete with bulging night-vision scopes, and confessed: “I don’t even know what that model is.

Shenzhen was an experiment for China’s reform and opening

The AfDB succession guessing game – But the real show in town was the game of guess the next AfDB president. With incumbent Donald Kaberuka heading for the exit at the Côte d’Ivoire summit in 2015, it was also time to reflect on his two terms. Some insiders grumbled of political battles, nepotism and a looming budget problem. However, the majority saluted the manner in which Kaberuka helped Africa weather a financial crisis and the dynamic refocusing of the bank on infrastructure and the private sector.

African policy-makers on a manufacturing mission – Hannibal also noticed the emphasis on structural transformation of the continent’s economy, away from the export of raw materials and towards the development of a functioning manufacturing sector. To this effect, the AfDB brought over experts from Shenzhen University. Shenzhen was one of the sites of China’s post-1980s export miracle. Professor Tao Yitao, who is the director of the China Center for Special Economic Zone Research, told attendees: “Shenzhen was an experiment for China’s reform and opening, which convinced the leadership of the possibility of the socialist/market system.” it was no doubt music to the ears of certain Bretton Woods devotees in attendance.

Lopes calls for fight against theft and laziness – One of the key themes running through the conference was the need for African countries to hold onto their wealth, both by preventing money from being lost through corruption and capital flight, and also by better utilising the cash that they have accumulated through the sale of oil and minerals. Others suggested that Africa need not look far away to meet its financing needs. “If you add up our pension funds, our lazy banks, the stealing happening through multinational transfer pricing […] there are around a trillion dollars in funds that could be mobilised for development,” opined United Nations Economic Commission for Africa executive secretary Carlos Lopes. ●","Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2019/03/cropped-theafricareport-icon-square.png,"['africa', 'development', 'shenzhen', 'guess', 'manufacturing', 'chinas', 'bank', 'model', 'afdb', 'game', 'hannibal', 'reform', 'need']",none

57,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Hazelnuts shortfall forces buyers to shell out 60% more for supplies - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/13/hazelnuts-shortfall-price-rise-harvest-turkey,"Chocolate makers already choking on the rising price of cocoa face another price crunch in commodity markets after warnings of a global shortage of hazelnuts.

The price of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60% this year to a 10-year high after bad weather devastated crops in Turkey, the world's biggest producer.

One Scottish manufacturer that sells bags of mixed nuts has already decided to take hazelnuts out of the pack, according to an industry source.

About 70% of the world's hazelnuts are grown on steep slopes near Turkey's Black Sea coast, but this year's harvest is likely to be sharply down after hail storms and frost in late March destroyed hazel flowers at a critical moment in the growing season.

The price of the nuts has reached $10,500 (£6,300) per tonne, compared with $6,500 (£3,900) per tonne in February, according to Michael Stevens, a trader at Edinburgh-based Freeworld Trading.

The full extent of the damage is not yet clear, but the Turkish industry is braced for a harvest that could be down to 540,000 tonnes, against pre-frost expectations of up to 800,000 tonnes.

It comes as food companies also face rocketing prices for almonds, cocoa and coffee – a potential nightmare for those who enjoy a Ferrero Rocher with their after-dinner coffee.

The hazelnut price rise will be particularly tough for buyers at some of the world's biggest confectionery companies, such as Cadbury, whose Whole Nut bar – made with hazelnuts – is one of its bestsellers.

A spokesman for the American conglomerate Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, declined to comment on whether it would increase the price of its chocolate bars. Mondelez is the name of the snack company spun off by America's Kraft, which completed a controversial takeover of the British chocolate maker in 2010.

Ferrero, the Piedmont-based company that makes Ferrero Rocher and Nutella, the cocoa and hazelnut spread, will also be watching the market closely. Ferrero is the world's biggest buyer of hazelnuts, using 25% of the world's supply and making 180m kg of the spread every year, according to the Italian Trade Agency.

But the company could be insulated from the latest price moves following its recent purchase of Turkey's largest hazelnut processor, Oltan.

The deal to purchase Oltan, which has eight factories shelling, chopping and roasting nuts, is reported to have unsettled other confectioners, which are uncomfortable that one of their suppliers has fallen into the hands of a rival.

Meanwhile, almond prices are at a nine-year high, because of drought in California, the world's biggest grower, while a prolonged dry spell in Brazil in January and February reduced the coffee harvest, pushing up prices.

Not all the current price moves in food commodities are due to unseasonal weather. The price of cocoa has been driven to a three-year high with consumers in China and India getting a taste for chocolate.

The hazelnut price surge has left market players reeling. ""Buyers are living hand to mouth,"" said Stevens. ""Some people had contracts already [pre-dating the frost] and they are not going to get them. A lot of people are still uncovered in the market and people that thought they were covered are now in the market again.""","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Content_Distribution/General_images/2014/8/13/1407953417172/Hazelnuts-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fe54ecce1c518012dacad7c1e64e88ea,"['forces', 'hazelnuts', 'nuts', 'supplies', 'shortfall', 'buyers', 'biggest', 'market', 'shell', 'worlds', 'price', 'harvest', 'high', '60', 'cocoa', 'hazelnut']",none
58,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Will L.A. fall for giant Rubber Duck? It will lead tall ships parade - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-trb-tall-ships-rubber-duck-20140807-story.html,"When tall ships parade into L.A. Harbor in San Pedro this month, expect to see an enormous, inflatable Rubber Duck in the lead. The piece by artist Florentijn Hofman will visit the West Coast for the first time to kick off the Tallships Festival LA 2014.

The sculpture has been a cultural hit since it debuted as the world’s largest rubber duck in 2007. Hofman has created several of them in various sizes and they have sailed the world, visiting China, Hong Kong, New Zealand and even Pittsburgh, Pa.

Its creator says this duck comes in peace. “The Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn’t discriminate people and doesn’t have a political connotation,” Hofman says of his inflatable artwork.

Each location builds its own duck, a tall ships festival spokesman said via email. The one in San Pedro will be about six stories high. And let’s hope it’ll be smooth sailing.

Last month the Rubber Duck touring China was swept away by rains and floods, and another famously burst during a visit to Taiwan earlier this year.

L.A.'s duck will lead the Parade of Sail at 2 p.m. Aug. 20. After they arrive in L.A. Harbor, more than a dozen tall ships will be on display to visitors through Aug. 24. Tickets are available to go on daylong sails too. And there will be food, entertainment and performances along the waterfront during the five-day festival.

The battleships USS Iowa and the SS Lane Victory also will be open for tours as part of the festival. A five-day pass to step on board the ships costs $19 per person; day sail trips cost $85 per person.

Trout has several problems with the song, but writes, in part:

What could be a positive message comes out as a backhanded compliment. Sure, every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top, but only grudgingly.

60,DR-2014-000109-CHN,KCON a mini-Coachella for Korean pop music - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-kcon-20140808-story.html,"Despite the growing popularity of South Korean pop music in the U.S., the genre has always faced one particular challenge. Very few American fans can see K-pop acts perform live.

Some popular South Korean bands like Girls’ Generation or 2NE1 have played showcases in major U.S. cities, and the girl group Crayon Pop just toured with Lady Gaga. Yet for most such acts, it’s never made logistical or financial sense to play the States, despite a fervent fan subculture here.

This year’s KCON, the third installment of the annual K-pop festival in downtown L.A., might be changing that line of thinking.

Four rising and established South Korean pop acts — Bangtan Boys, IU, Jung Joon Young and SPICA — are making their American live debuts this year. KCON isn’t just a sprawling fan convention anymore — it’s becoming a hub for Korean acts to make their first steps into the U.S. touring market.

“A lot of [K-pop] acts have met with the top U.S. booking agents, but they couldn’t afford the cost of giving up tour dates in Asia,” said Angela Killoren, co-project manager of KCON. “But festivals like KCON are a great way for them to meet fans and perform without committing to the infrastructure of a full tour.”

Last year, the event moved from Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine to the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena downtown and dramatically expanded its scope. An estimated 20,000 fans attended two days’ worth of concerts, workshops, panel discussions and Korean pop-culture exhibitions. The festival has become a kind of K-pop Coachella or South by Southwest.

“The reputation for the stateside KCON festival back in Korea is big news,” SPICA’s members said in a jointly answered email interview. “Many K-pop artists and companies see this as an important portal into the American marketplace, as the festival has been growing every year.”

Last year’s headlining concert, featuring the likes of G-Dragon, and Teen Top, capped the weekend (with American MC Missy Elliott hopping onstage with G-Dragon). The sets finally scratched the live itch of many U.S. fans.

“Our fans know way more about this music than even we do, but we always try to bring new artists to them,” Killoren said. “Last year, Dynamic Duo and 2AM weren’t as well known over here, but fans went crazy for them.”

Since last year, the genre’s crossover has ramped up in America. 2NE1 released “Crush,” a dark and modern dance-pop album that debuted at No. 61 on the Billboard 200 chart in March and, at 5,000 copies sold, earned the biggest first-week sales for a K-pop album in the U.S. G-Dragon appeared on EDM producer Skrillex’s debut major-label LP and collaborated with well-known U.S. producers like Diplo and Baauer on his album “Coup d’Etat.”

In K-pop culture, each of these groups is an established act in America. But now that K-pop (or hallyu, as it’s known) culture has grown past the novelty factor here, there’s a question of how to introduce new generations of artists in America.

Internet exposure is no problem. Videos like Girls’ Generation’s “I Got a Boy” can rack up a hundred million YouTube views, and there’s a rich ecosystem of hallyu-centric online media to document its stars’ comings and goings.

Yet for U.S. audiences outside New York and L.A., digital fandom might not be enough.

“So much fan interaction in K-pop is virtual. Fans are crazy about it, but they never get a chance to touch it,” Killoren said. Without in-person ways to connect, American fans could lose enthusiasm.

KCON’s increasing focus on U.S. debut performances gives fans something more to see, and crowds are willing to travel for that experience. Killoren estimates that 40% of ticket sales this year have been to fans outside California — from Texas and New York but also from Mexico and Sweden.

For South Korean stars without a big American audience, the fest isn’t just a way to make a splashy U.S. debut. It can bolster their reputations back home too.

“It’s big news back in Asia when K-pop artists play in the States,” SPICA said. “It helps their reputation back home. I think K-pop artists are very careful and selective about what they do in the States. They want to develop fan bases over time and build the confidence to play live here.”

SPICA will perform its first English-language single, “I Did It,” at the fest as part of a rollout to capture more such markets.

Outside of Psy, the viral sensation behind “Gangnam Style,” K-pop hasn’t yet made a big dent in U.S. top 40, but it’s not necessarily KCON’s job to crack that ceiling. It’s to keep the K-pop faithful and newly curious fans feeling like they have a stake in the music.

As Killoren put it, “This is a way to recharge your K-pop fandom.”

64,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Warming threatens to cut crop yields | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/warming-threatens-cut-crop-yields/,"Projecting the impact of climate change on global food production is no easy task. A warming climate might result in better crop yields in one region, but cause drought and crop failure in another.

A new US study, published in the journal Environmental Letters, assesses the odds of a major slowdown in global food production over the next 20 years.

Overall, the study’s authors say, the likelihood of a sharp drop in yields of crops vital to food supply, such as wheat and maize, is “not very high” − but global warming does markedly increase the chance of such events happening. The risk to global food supplies is about 20 times greater when man-made climate change is taken into account.

“Climate change has substantially increased the prospect that crop production will fail to keep up with rising demand in the next 20 years,” says Claudia Tebaldi, a research scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a co-author of the study.

“ The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds David Lobell, associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environmentat California’s Stanford University

Climate trends

Tebaldi, together with David Lobell, an associate director of the Center on Food Security and the Environment at California’s Stanford University, used computer models of global climate trends, together with data on weather patterns and crops, to calculate the odds of a major downturn in food supplies.

“I’m often asked whether climate change will threaten food supply, as if it’s a simple yes or no answer,” Lobell says.

“The truth is that, over a period of 10 or 20 years, it depends largely on how fast the Earth warms, and we can’t predict the pace of warming very precisely. So the best we can do is try to determine the odds.”

Yields of crops such as maize and wheat have typically increased by between one and two per cent a year over recent decades. This trend, says the study, needs to be maintained to cope with population growth, greater per capita food consumption, and the increased use of crops for biofuels.

The authors of the study – which was funded by the US government’s National Science Foundation and the US Department of Energy − found that under what they term natural climate shifts, the odds on that trend slowing up to 2030 were only 1 in 200.

Global food supplies

However, when human-induced global warming is taken into account, the odds shorten to one in 10 for a slowing in yields of maize and one in 20 for wheat production. Such cutbacks, says the study, would have a major impact on global food supplies at a time when demand is growing sharply.

Tebaldi and Lobell say an increase of 1˚C in temperature is capable of slowing maize yields by 7% and wheat yields by 6 per cent, although there are regional variations to these figures.

The study says a slowdown in yields of maize and wheat could, in theory, be offset by shifting planting to cooler regions, but there is little sign that such shifts are happening – at least not quickly enough to take account of warmer temperatures.

“We can’t predict whether a major slowdown in crop growth will actually happen, and the odds are still fairly low,” says Tebaldi.

“But climate change has increased the odds to the point that organisations concerned with food security or global stability need to be aware of this risk.”","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/shutterstock_48384775_wheat_field.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['threatens', 'climate', 'cut', 'study', 'warming', 'yields', 'odds', 'global', '20', 'maize', 'crop', 'wheat', 'food']",none

The National Hurricane Center in Miami issued advisories Tuesday for Hurricane Iselle and Tropical Storm Julio.

Iselle could be hitting Hawaii by Friday and Julio two or three days after that, said James Franklin, the chief of hurricane specialists.

“There’s enough uncertainty in the track that it’s too soon to talk specific impacts,” Franklin said.

Iselle is expected to weaken.

“Right now it’s a major hurricane but it will not be able to maintain that strength,” he said. “But it still could be at or near hurricane strength.”

The outlook for Julio is more uncertain.

The Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu is taking over responsibility and would issue any hurricane watches or warnings.

Two big storms so close together in the eastern Pacific are rare but not unexpected in years with a developing El Nino, a change in ocean temperature that affects weather around the world.

“It’s certainly pretty rare,” Franklin said. “The central Pacific doesn’t see nearly the activity that the Atlantic sees.”

When an El Nino develops, “those are the kinds of years you see more activity,” he said.

“You get more activity so the risk of impact goes up in El Nino years,” Franklin said.","Tue, 05 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/5/1407251715081/86d5d80f-2797-4ee8-b96f-bc611ddefc82-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bc017f340d1d85b79dd0e6c2e177a0df,"['rare', 'pair', 'hurricanes', 'activity', 'el', 'hurricane', 'franklin', 'storms', 'weather', 'pacific', 'nino', 'pattern', 'national', 'braced', 'hawaii']",none

The 28-year-old’s extension to his current deal will run to the summer of 2019 and makes Silva the third player to agree an improved offer after Samir Nasri and Aleksander Kolarov.

“From the moment I joined the club four years ago it has felt like a second home to me,” the Spain midfielder said. “On and off the pitch, I feel incredibly content and fulfilled professionally and personally, so why wouldn’t I want to stay and keep winning trophies with this fantastic team?”

He played in all three of Spain’s World Cup group games in Brazil and now has his sights set on the Premier League season.

Silva said: “Over the last four years, we have achieved so much together, establishing City as a dominating force in England and now, when I look around this dressing room, I can see no reason why we won’t become one of the top teams in the world.

It is less of a rapture prediction than a reminder that resources are finite, there are greater forces than ourselves in the universe, and that we as a civilization trend on the self-destructive side of things.

Just this week specific studies about climate change, solar flares and the dinosaurs have been published. The common thread? Past, nearly missed, or future earthly destruction. Each one holds a lesson about Earth's fragility.

The following list is not intended as a scare-tactic lecture, but rather a look at how both we and the universe could shape humanity -- and its potential end.

1) Climate change

A new study published by Nature Climate Change has concluded that due to pollution, a shift to resource-intensive Western diets, and anthropogenic climate change, the Earth will need 50 percent more food by 2050 to feed the population. The problem? Our supply may not be able to meet the demand. As CBS explains, ""as our need for food rises, our ability to produce that food may be lowered by climate and air quality changes.""

The researchers found that global warming could reduce food production by 10 percent. Crop yields won't just be affected by global warming but also by the ozone layer. MIT associate professor and the study's author, Colette Heald, told CBS that crop production is ""very sensitive to ozone pollution."" Using a model that examined four major crops and air-quality projections, the researchers found that malnutrition in developing countries could rise to 27 percent, up from the current 18 percent.

Climate change could, of course, have other dire effects on our food production, including flooding and other extreme weather, like the current drought in California. ""Overall, climate change could make it more difficult to grow crops, raise animals and catch fish in the same ways and same places as we have done in the past,"" the EPA explains. ""The effects of climate change also need to be considered along with other evolving factors that affect agricultural production, such as changes in farming practices and technology.""

Climate change might not fully eradicate humanity, but crunch the numbers and the seriousness of the threat comes into view: Take a massive food shortage and combine that with unpredictable and violent weather patterns, mix in some geopolitical conflict (read: the possibility of all-out war) and you have an all-too-real recipe for global disaster of unprecedented proportions.

2) Pandemic

The most catastrophic pandemic on record was 1918's Spanish influenza. The virus, which at the time could only travel by ship or land, still killed 50 million people. Since then the global population has been hit with a series of contagions that have spread faster than ever before. The most recent was the H1N1 swine flu outbreak of 2009, and while it wasn't the pandemic to end all pandemics that some predicted, it was a wake-up call nonetheless.

Just this year, MERS has killed hundreds in Saudi Arabia, and Ebola has infected thousands across Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and killed more than 600, including top Ebola doctors.

How and why do diseases, particularly viruses, spread? The Guardian reported last year:

Viruses and other pathogens continually flow between species, often with no effects, sometimes mutating, once in a while causing illness. This mixing is known as 'viral chatter' and the more different species come into regular close contact, the higher the chances of a spillover event occurring. 'This is how viruses have always worked, the big change is us,' says Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh. 'The big change happened probably several thousands of years ago when we became a crowd species and that gave these viruses new opportunities which they hadn't had before in humans. Ever since then, from time to time a new virus has come along to take advantage of this new, very densely populated, crowded species – humans – that it can now spread between much more easily. That process is still happening; the viruses are still discovering us. We like to think we discover viruses, but it's also the viruses discovering us.""

3) Nuclear war

The days of Cold War-era ""mutually assured destruction"" might be long gone, but nuclear weapons still pose a grave threat to civilization. In 2012 the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and Physicians for Social Responsibility, who won a Nobel Peace Prize, released a study stating that famine caused by nuclear disaster could kill more than 1 billion people. The group subsequently updated this study a year later, because it underestimated the damage it would unleash on China.

""A billion people dead in the developing world is obviously a catastrophe unparalleled in human history,"" Ira Helfand, the report's author, told the Telegraph. ""But then if you add to that the possibility of another 1.3 billion people in China being at risk, we are entering something that is clearly the end of civilization.""

The above study focused mainly on nuclear war between Pakistan and India, where conflict, tension and nuclear weapons abound. However, Helfand tells the Telegraph that the result could be similar in any nuclear conflict. For example, nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia, he says, ""we are talking about the possible -- not certain, but possible -- extinction of the human race.""

The study found that particles kicked into the atmosphere from the weapons would reduce China's output of rice (10 percent over six years) and wheat (50 percent in the first year), and the U.S. output of corn and soybeans (10 percent in the first decade).

4) Solar flares

It was recently revealed that in 2012, humanity may have had a close brush with doom, all due to solar flares. On July 23, 2012, the sun belched one of the most massive plasma clouds ever detected with a speed of 3,000 km per second, according to the Guardian. That is four times as fast as a typical solar flare. The flare could have caused a massive blackout of satellite communications, power grids and electronic devices. And if the solar storm had occurred a week earlier it would have.

""If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,"" University of Colorado's Daniel Baker told the Guardian. Baker is part of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics. ""I have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did,"" he continued. ""If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire.""

5) The ""Deep Impact"" scenario

According to the American Museum of Natural History, there are around 1 million ""near-Earth"" asteroids that could do serious damage to the planet if they hit. (Just ask the dinosaurs.) Neil deGrasse Tyson explains the threat and deflection of such a space rock below:

You can read about the threat of space debris in depth at NASA's Asteroid Watch.

6) The robots take over

At first glance the words ""robot apocalypse"" seem far more rooted in sci-fi than reality. However, as technology lurches forward, and artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated -- to the point of actually becoming self-aware and surpassing humans in terms of raw intelligence -- who knows what could happen.

The robot apocalypse might not look like a scene from ""Terminator,"" according to experts interviewed for a recent Business Insider. But they did caution that artificial intelligence was possible, and that we ought to have a plan in place for when it does. As Northwestern University professor John O. McGinnis stated:

Even a non-anthropomorphic human intelligence still could pose threats to mankind, but they are probably manageable threats. The greatest problem is that such artificial intelligence may be indifferent to human welfare. Thus, for instance, unless otherwise programmed, it could solve problems in ways that could lead to harm against humans. But indifference, rather than innate malevolence, is much more easily cured. Artificial intelligence can be programmed to weigh human values in its decision making. The key will be to assure such programming.

7) The ""false vacuum"" theory

Now we're really getting into wacky territory. Imagine a chunk of space that is totally empty, hence a vacuum. There are absolutely no particles, no matter, nothing at all occupying this particular piece of extraterrestrial real estate. You might reasonably assume that it is therefore at what physicists call a ""ground state"" (because there is no energy to disturb it) and that this space is totally stable as a result.

Well, according to one interpretation of quantum theory, this vacuum isn't at a ground state at all. It just seems like it is. Therefore, it is a ""false vacuum."" And the fear is that someday we might find that out the hard way -- with grave repercussions for our universe.

As the website Ask a Mathematician explains:

The “danger” of living in a false vacuum is that, under the proper circumstances the false vacuum can drop into the true vacuum ... If the difference in energy between the false vacuum and true vacuum is large enough, then the surrounding space can likewise be tipped into the lower state. In theory, a “false vacuum collapse” would expand at light speed (or about light speed) from the originating event, and destroy the heck out of everything in the affected, and ever-expanding, region.

Or, to put it another way, imagine you're living inside a bubble (like, a really big bubble) that seems like it's basically in a stable, ground state -- except the air pressure on the outside of the bubble (which you can't see or detect; the bubble is all that you know) is actually much lower than the air pressure within. If the bubble were to pop, you'd quickly find that the new physical conditions you now experience are dramatically different from the ones you had enjoyed within the bubble. Apply that same idea to our universe, and imagine how much it would change if something as fundamental as energy now acted completely different. Life, the universe and everything might just suddenly cease to be.

(It bears mentioning, as Ask a Mathematician does, that ""the idea of a false vacuum is wild speculation and that there is no indication, not even a little, that the vacuum of the universe is a false vacuum and not the true ground state."")

8) The ""gray goo"" theory

This theory is so supremely loopy -- it involves tiny, malevolent robots that assimilate everything in their path -- that we might as well just refer you to the loopy video embedded below:

9) The laws of physics play out exactly as planned

The fact of the matter is this: Someday our sun will burn out and take the Earth with it, effectively ending life as we now know it. Even if we've managed to keep ourselves alive long enough to achieve interstellar travel, and find a new home in the safety of some other solar system, that hypothetical star will also eventually burn out -- as will every other star in our universe.

If prevailing theories are correct, then the cosmos has in store for them a long, protracted demise -- known as ""the heat death of the universe"" -- in which the natural, overwhelming tendency of energy and matter toward greater entropy (i.e., disorder) proceeds to the point where even the atoms that make up matter will eventually break down into basically nothing.

The good news is that this (super-depressing) outcome won't transpire for something like 10^100 years. (That's 10 with 100 zeroes behind it, in case you were wondering, and it's an impossibly long stretch of time.) Plus, if we look even further into the future -- what would feel like actual infinity if there were anyone around at that point to feel anything anymore -- it remains possible that an entirely new universe could still spontaneously pop into existence.","Sun, 03 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.salon.com/2014/07/doomsday.jpg,"['universe', 'space', 'viruses', 'theories', 'endoftheworld', 'false', 'climate', 'solar', 'nuclear', 'dreams', 'intelligence', 'vacuum', 'pick', 'haunt', 'doomsday', 'change']",none

72,DR-2014-000109-CHN,'Coke didn't treat Nestea like tea!' Nestle Waters boss suggests soda giant had half-hearted approach - BeverageDaily.com,https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2014/08/07/Coke-didn-t-treat-Nestea-like-tea!-Nestle-Waters-CEO-on-brand-rebirth,"Euromonitor senior beverages analyst Hope Lee wrote in a company blog post Monday that despite Nestea’s global status, “it appears to be a neglected brand, lost in Nestle’s vast portfolio”.​

The brand was withdrawn from China in May this year and was subject to a further US sales decline in 2013 – where it faces tough competition from Lipton and Arizona.

Although Nestle took back production and distribution from Coca-Cola this year, Lee warned that “when an FMCG brand does not shine in both the US and China, it is at risk of losing its important to its parent company”.​

“From an overall soft drinks perspective, Nestle has no specific plan as to how to revitalise Nestea although its Nestea Zero variant appears to be doing well in Canada, its largest market,”​ she said.

‘We can compete aggressively against Coke and Pepsi’​

However, at a June 4 investor seminar not previously reported, Nestle Waters USA boss Tim Brown (below) described tea as a form of flavored water and insisted: “Tea is our great opportunity in flavored water”.​

“The first thing we’re going to do that Coke didn’t do is treat Nestea like tea,”​ he said. “Coke managed Nestea as a line extension of soft drinks. And if you look at the taste profiles, calories, etc., it really wasn’t much of a tea drink.""​

“We reformulated this year and took 40% of the calories out, and we have taste preference of 70:30 versus our closest competitor. We’ve also changed the packaging, graphics, and advertising,”​ Brown added.

“Traditionally, as we drove water against both Coke and Pepsi, we think we can bring tea with our route to market and compete aggressively against them. I don’t think that Coke in the US had a lot of heart for the brand, and the results showed in the past few years. We’re going to put a lot into it and we’re very optimistic.”​

Brown said Nestle was seeing “extremely strong growth in Nestea this year”​ and has big plans to grow it in the future, ""given the brands synergies with its system from a production and route to market standpoint”.​

Nestle H1 2014 results see profits down​

More broadly, Brown said Nestle Waters plans to premiumise its high volume, low-margin waters business, building a single-serve portfolio with RTD teas (Nestea), sparkling fruit beverages (Poland Spring) and imported waters (San Pellegrino, Perrier).

Today the world’s largest food company reported sales of CHF 42.981bn ($47.33bn) up 4.7% in organic terms, but net profit fell from CHF 5.1bn to CHF 4.6bn. CEO Paul Bulcke hailed “solid, broad-based organic growth and pricing in what is still a very volatile pricing environment”.​

Nestle reported sales of CHF €3.7bn for Nestle Waters business alone with 6.1% organic growth and a 10.4% operating profit margin (+0.8%) due to ‘leveraging growth’ and cost cuts.

No.1 global bottled water brand Nestle Pure Life drove growth in emerging markets such as China, Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan, while in developed markets regional brands grew – Levissima in Italy, Buxton in the UK, Hepar in France and US mega brand Poland Spring and Deer Park in the US.

“Specifically in North America we saw an acceleration of our growth versus last year – it was driven mainly by strong volume across US retail thanks to our regional spring waters and our international brands Perrier and San Pellegrino,”​ Nestle CFO Wan Ling Martello told analysts this morning.","Fri, 08 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/9/9/0/6/3266099-5-eng-GB/Coke-didn-t-treat-Nestea-like-tea!-Nestle-Waters-CEO-on-brand-rebirth.jpg,"['spring', 'waters', 'halfhearted', 'nestea', 'growth', 'didnt', 'giant', 'brand', 'suggests', 'treat', 'chf', 'water', 'coke', 'soda', 'nestle', 'tea']",none
73,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Responses to “Should Obama Quit His Job?” - The Globalist,https://www.theglobalist.com/should-obama-quit-his-job/,"Does this happen in other countries? The President of the United States gets to take a four-day family vacation — and the opposition party attacks?

It probably does happen in other countries. Even so, while watching the news, I decided that — if I were Barack Obama — I would resign.

Why would I do that? The simple reality is: “President of the United States” is a lousy job to have these days.

As President, you face an opposition party that is fueled by populism, but never even considers the consequences of all the often wholly contradictory initiatives it suggests.

This includes cries for stronger American intervention on behalf of potentially unreliable partners in Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Libya and South Sudan. In all these crisis zones, the American right wants to position the United States squarely on one side or the other of centuries-old – sometimes millennia-old — ethnic and sectarian strife.

As President, one would have to wonder if anyone in the opposition had really thought these policies through in terms of their impact on the way they would stretch the country’s already stretched military, on the way they would undermine the country’s fiscal soundness and on how they would extract a potentially disastrous human toll at home and abroad?

Domestic and international expectations – at loggerheads

Balancing this, you, as President, must also face a world that expects the United States to play a central role in sustaining global stability, but at the same time expects America to adhere to certain limits on the use of its power.

The world does not want to be ruled by America. It wants America to lead it into a more optimistic future, where the Four Freedoms of Franklin Roosevelt provide the North Star, the guiding light toward the realization of pluralistic, multicultural dreams and ambitions.

These two views are diametrically opposed. They are polar opposites In the United States and around the world.

The President of the United States must nonetheless manage U.S. foreign policy through these two prisms.

As if that weren’t enough of a practical challenge, the list of global hot spots that a U.S. President is expected to “fix” is long. Currently, it includes

■ The most recent eruption of the Israel-Palestine conflict

■ The emergence of China as a global power

■ Iran’s nuclear ambitions

■ Regional territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea

■ The handover of Afghanistan

■ Global weather anomalies that are raising environmental red flags

■ A potentially catastrophic drought drawing near in the Western US

■ An Ebola outbreak in West Central Africa — and

■ Desperate children under arrest at United States’ southern border.

Of course, the opposition party mercilessly finds a way to attack the President on each and every one of these issues, while always keeping their eyes on the important stuff, like Benghazi.

Some might suggest that dealing with all of these complex issues and being second-guessed every step of the way by an often irrational domestic opposition is asking too much of any President. But then, just when you were getting fed up with dealing with all of this, they say you can’t take a vacation!

Mr. President, I would just quit if I were you. But while you consider this, you have my permission to take a few days off.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theglobalist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/obama-alone-400.jpg,"['party', 'quit', 'job', 'opposition', 'does', 'united', 'obama', 'potentially', 'president', 'way', 'global', 'america', 'states']",none
74,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Haiti’s former President Aristide faces corruption probe - Tico Times,https://ticotimes.net/2014/08/07/haitis-former-president-aristide-faces-corruption-probe,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti – Former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is facing a money laundering, corruption and drug trafficking probe, officials said Thursday.

Port-au-Prince civil court judge Raymond Jean Michel said the matter dated back to 2006 and 2007 and had been handed over to a judge of inquiry.

“There are two cases concerning former president Aristide at the court related to money laundering, corruption and the illicit drug trafficking,” he told AFP.

Haitian media said Aristide was banned from leaving Haiti due to the probe, reports that the judge in charge of the inquiry, Lamarre Belizaire, refused to confirm.

Belizaire had summoned a dozen people for questioning Thursday — including several Aristide associates, as well as former dignitaries of his regime, the judges said.

Aristide — Haiti’s first democratically elected leader — was voted president twice, in 1990 and in 2000. However, his first mandate was interrupted between 1991 and 1994 by a coup that saw him take refuge in the United States.

When another coup ousted him in 2004, he left aboard a U.S. Air Force plane into exile in South Africa, fleeing political turmoil. He returned to his homeland in March 2011.

An investigation launched in 2005 into the management of Aristide’s government concluded that millions of dollars worth of public funds had been misappropriated.

Earlier this year, a Haitian judge indicted several people with close ties to Aristide in the 2000 murder of a prominent journalist.

Aristide testified but was not indicted.

Known as a champion of Haiti’s poor and reviled by the elite, Aristide — a former Roman Catholic priest — is still popular in the impoverished country.","Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/140807HaitiAristide.jpg,"['judge', 'money', 'corruption', 'faces', 'aristide', 'trafficking', 'probe', 'haitis', 'president', 'haiti', 'laundering', 'haitian']",none

Right now the Senate has 24 Republicans, 2 Democrats who caucus with the Republicans and 23 other Democrats. Mr. Steyer has not said what he will spend in the districts, but his previous pattern indicates it will be hundreds of thousands of dollars for each candidate — a huge amount for a Washington State race.

In 2013, Mr. Steyer’s group spent $275,000 in Washington to help ensure the election of four pro-environment candidates to the local council in Whatcom County, where candidates normally spend less than $25,000 for a single race. As a result, prospects are now dim for council approval of a proposed $600 million port in Whatcom near the border with British Columbia, which, if constructed, would facilitate the shipment of 48 million tons of coal annually to Asia from Montana and Wyoming.

The port would be a lifeline for the states’ coal producers, who anticipate the shutdown of American coal-fired power plants because of emissions limits proposed by the Obama administration and hope to send their coal via rail to the proposed Washington port. But Mr. Inslee and Mr. Steyer see them as a climate disaster in the making.

Mr. Steyer’s money has not always bought results. In 2013 his group also spent $250,000 in a special election to try to oust Jan Angel, a Republican House member who opposes Mr. Inslee’s climate plans, and was running for a state Senate seat last fall. But Ms. Angel raised money throughout the state and won the election.

“Thank God that the people of my district were smart enough not to be purchased,” Ms. Angel said. “When you have people with deep pockets like Tom Steyer coming in and trying to trash candidates, spending this kind of money, it’s a sad day for our democracy.”

Others are equally outraged. “It’s ridiculous that money coming from outside the state is trying to influence our votes,” said Rick Tjoelker, an auto mechanic in Lynden, Wash., who bristled at Mr. Inslee’s climate campaign.","Sun, 03 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/04/us/JP-INSLEE1/JP-INSLEE1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=8beaaf6815f90a9209ac19eb8bb05352e45fc5b28efa405bc2a819d95f494e9d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['policy', 'die', 'climate', 'money', 'senate', 'candidates', 'mr', 'port', 'goes', 'inslees', 'steyer', 'oysters', 'washington', 'proposed', 'state', 'stump']",none

“There will be a way for our department to get the vehicles out well before it’s safe for the public to get in,” Renée Fortier, director of UCLA Events and Transportation, said in a statement Thursday. “A lot of people think they should be able to go back into the structures immediately. With flooding, we have to make sure the structure is safe.”

The standing water inside the structure has been mixing with the gasoline and oils from the vehicles since Tuesday, creating a potentially toxic mix. Of the stranded cars, about 400 were “deemed to be inoperable due to the water damage,” UCLA spokesman Tod M. Tamberg told The Times.

Once owners return to their vehicles, the longer process of assessing the damage and seeking compensation will begin.

The water main break occurred on a 30-inch riveted steel trunk line underneath Sunset Boulevard owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, sending more than 20 million gallons of water coursing across the Westwood campus for hours.

Along with the flooded parking structures, the floor of Pauley Pavilion -- the school’s storied basketball arena -- was warped by several inches of standing water.

Chancellor Gene Block could not provide an exact estimate of the damage Wednesday, but said it likely was in the millions of dollars.

The DWP, which hired an inspector to appraise the damaged vehicles, has directed affected owners to its website to file a claim for damages.

People have until Jan. 29, 2015, to file a claim for damages.

UCLA, meanwhile, has launched a fundraising campaign that officials hope will raise $1 million in the next 60 days. The UCLA Spark crowdfunding page calls the flood “one of the largest emergencies we’ve ever faced” and sets a goal of having damaged facilities open and restored by the time the fall quarter begins in late September.

Meanwhile, DWP said it is preparing to replace the ruptured line Friday. The break occurred at a Y-connection with a 36-inch water main, which made the repairs all the more complicated, officials said. Crews had to dig a 56-by-41 foot excavation pit to work on the repairs, closing a large stretch of Sunset Boulevard north of the campus for most of the week.

The repairs are expected to be completed early Saturday, after which DWP is expected to refill the street and prepare it for repavement.

The utility initially endured heavy criticism from residents and city officials for its response. Even after the main leak was stopped, the lines continued leaking 1,000 gallons of water a minute for a day.

The utility was contrite on its Twitter page.

“Our tireless crews are working around the clock to safely and swiftly repair this main so the famous Sunset Blvd can be open for commuters,” DWP tweeted. “Westsiders, UCLA community and area commuters: thank you for bearing with us! We are working to get out of here & give you your street back.”

77,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Economic Milestone: Second Five Year Plan (1956) - Forbes India,https://www.forbesindia.com/article/independence-day-special/economic-milestone-second-five-year-plan-(1956)/38393/1,"Image: Getty Images The first Five Year Plan was penned in 1951

While India’s first Five Year Plan in 1951 was largely penned in response to shocks such as Partition and World War II, its second was all about industrialisation. The young nation needed building and industry was on the agenda of the second Five Year Plan, which was announced by the Planning Commission on May 14, 1956.



Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was influenced by the industrialisation that had swept the then USSR. In fact, the 2nd plan was nicknamed the ‘Mahalanobis Plan’, after one of its architects, renowned statistician Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, who used resource allocation ideas from Soviet economist GA Feldman. Nehru outlined the central role of government when he said, “The public sector must grow not only absolutely but also relatively to the private sector.”



Later, in the same speech, he said, “Private enterprise, free pricing, private management are all devices to further what are truly social ends; they can only be justified in terms of social results.”



The second Five Year Plan centred on a shift towards developing capital goods and heavy industry for long-term economic benefit. Of the Rs 4,672 crore in public spending, there was a significant shift in allocation from agriculture to industry between the first and second Five Year Plans. During that period, agriculture spending fell from 37 percent of public spending to 20.9 percent, while industry allocation increased from 4.9 to 24.1 percent.



About 70 percent of the funds allocated for industry were allotted to large- and medium-sized businesses, while the rest lay with mineral development and village and small industries. There was a marked emphasis on boosting public sector activity; setting up steel plants in Rourkela, Bhilai and Durgapur is an example of this. India’s coal production also increased.



Ashima Goyal, professor of Economics at the Indira Gandhi Institute for Development Research, says that a ‘big push’ model adopted in the plan was based on coordinated investments in centralised and public sector industries. “Eminent economists like CN Vakil and PR Brahmananda of the Bombay school of economic thought criticised the plan because it neglected grassroots investment and agriculture and didn’t use India’s competitive advantage of cheap, labour-intensive production,” says Goyal.



The bold plan targeted annual national income growth of 4.5 percent; actual growth for the period was 4 percent per annum. However, lack of investment in agriculture and a period marked by food shortages and drought led to inflation. The wholesale price index rose at 6.2 percent per annum between 1956 and 1961.

“We’re conducting a giant experiment without even collecting the important data on the water, air, land or wildlife impacts,” said Sara Souther, an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin, one of the co-authors of the peer-reviewed research examining the environmental impacts of shale gas development in the US and Canada.

Although the technique of hydraulic fracturing shale has been used for at least 20 years, there is “surprisingly little research” on impacts, found the study, published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

“We do know chemical contamination of ground and surface water is happening all the time but no one knows what the impacts are because the data isn’t being collected,” Souther said.

Spills, accidents, leaks from well casings and the dumping of toxic wastewater into streams are regular occurrences but no one knows the extent, she said. Often the data is not being compiled, while some US states do not even ask the the industry to report “minor” spills or accidents. In nearly all cases it is up to companies to “self-report”.



The industry has long claimed there is no proof of water contamination. Souther accepted this until she learned that baseline studies had not been done before an area was fracked.



Water contamination tops a long list of environmental impacts including air and noise pollution and habitat fragmentation – but in all cases there is little information, making it impossible to get a big picture of these multiple stressors on wildlife and the environment, she said.



“It’s crazy. How can we know what the real risks are without any basic information?”



The fracking industry also enjoys an exemption from the US Safe Drinking Water Act. That means the US Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate the injection of chemicals into shale gas wells. Two-thirds of the 150 wells researchers investigated used at least one undisclosed chemical - some used 20 or more.

Fracking sites operate with lots of noise, lights, flaring of gas and heavy vehicle traffic operating 24/7. The very few studies on wildlife impacts show that rare species like the sage grouse are being driven from their nest areas. Large parts of the Marcellus shale gas region is in the poor but heavily forested regions of Appalachia.



“These are the most biodiverse temperate forests in the world,” said Souther.

Fracking has exploded in the US since 2007. Hundreds of thousands of wells have now been fracked, which involves the deep underground injection of millions of litres of water and chemicals. Nine out 10 of the 11,000 to 12,000 new gas and oil wells drilled every year now use the technique.



Shale gas accounted for 39% of all natural gas produced last year in the United States and about 15% in Canada.



While gas wells are next door to schools and homes, and in the middle of farm fields, most are in remote areas.



“Forests or grasslands that were once continuous are now islands fragmented by a dense web of roads, pipelines and well pads. At what point does the canvas fall apart?” said co-author Viorel Popescu, an ecologist at Canada’s Simon Fraser University.



The UK and any other country should conduct careful scientific studies on impacts with some pilot projects before plunging into full-scale shale gas development, she said.

“Bottom line: Shale gas has not been proven safe for freshwater or the environment.”

I had an uncle who studied dendrochronology – tree rings, basically. It wasn't until years after he died that it occurred to me how much his perspective on living, and on dying, seemed to have been shaped by years of handling such palpable evidence of time passing. Not the spectacle of canyons carved by glaciers or the eye-popping surprise of fossilized bones, but the way each tree out of millions had been marked by each year out of millions. You could look at the rings and tell when the climate was good, when there was a drought, when there was a fire. Even if the outside of a tree was unremarkable, inside was its whole life, constructed bit by bit.

Richard Linklater's Boyhood persuasively argues that we're pretty much the same way. We are not built in a series of climactic and closely attended spectacles, but layer by layer, bit by bit, each year or even each day wrapping around the last one.

Despite its simplicity, it's an extraordinarily difficult idea for film to capture, because by its nature, film is compressed. Individual scenes often stand for more than themselves, but films tend to find people at inflection points, so that they tell stories in the manner of following the path of a stream by hopping from stone to stone. Linklater's film is more like walking right through water up to your knees. People eat, talk, take pictures, laugh, get angry, screw up. They change, they don't change, they start things, they end things. People come and go, gain and lose weight, grow and cut their hair.

Boyhood has gotten a lot of attention for how it was filmed: over 12 years, with the same actors – including Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke, and the remarkable Ellar Coltrane – returning each year to film a piece of the story of Mason (Coltrane), who grows up from 5 to 18 with his steady but struggling single mother (Arquette), his flaky and sometimes present father (Hawke), and an older sister (Lorelai Linklater). While it's certainly fun to watch over the film's nearly three-hour running time as Mason grows from a big-eyed little boy to a shaggy kid to a skinny adolescent to a magnetic college student, if that were the point of the movie, it would be selling a sensation that television has offered for decades. You can see children grow into adults on an all-day marathon of Little House On The Prairie, or by looking up the right clips from General Hospital.

It's not the method itself, but the purpose to which it's being put, that matters. There is no turn in the movie, no sudden tragedy or massive surprise that abruptly assigns meaning to the small moments that came before. It's not a sealed system where every setup has a payoff. These pieces of this family's life are there for their own sake, specifically because as Mason finally steps into adulthood, it is as the sum of all those small things, which in the aggregate take up more space on film and in his life than the few outbreaks of overt drama. In fact, the film opens with a shot of Mason lying on his back and looking up at the sky, and later, there's a shot of another boy his age lying in almost exactly the same pose. It's a jarring reminder that this story is not being told because there is only one that is anything like it. It is being told because it's one story out of millions, and all these kids are growing, bit by bit.

The film is far from unplotted or aimless; Linklater is constructing this narrative to get at elusive aspects of the one story that just about everyone experiences, albeit in hugely different ways. This is how we, as children, grow up. This is how we, as adults, help build kids: layer by layer, each day over the next, leaving them with marks of good years and bad years, droughts and fires. That's its purpose: to represent on film the basic mechanism of constructing new humans.

Linklater has always had a curiosity about the parts of life that happen in between the scenes that often show up in movies – he's always been a mortar guy more than a brick guy. While the Before Sunrise/Sunset/Midnight movies, for example, eventually became a long story about a real relationship, Before Sunrise itself was literally about what happens on the way from one place to another.

The same is true of his approach to looking at childhood. There are moments in Boyhood in which you know that the adults in Mason's life aren't paying all that much attention to what's happening, when perhaps they don't think there's much going on at all. But you look at him, and he is slowing everything down in his mind. He's studying, being taught at the moments when they're not trying to teach him.

And even when they are trying to teach him – as in a charming and funny scene when Mason's dad tries to give a self-consciously un-self-conscious lesson in birth control – his eyes are bright and focused, sizing up his father, learning something, but not necessarily what's meant. We know intellectually that this happens, and it's been repeated in proverbs and by Stephen Sondheim, but kids really do pay attention to everything — that's the terrifying and awe-inspiring thing about them. Mason's attention animates his entire story: more often than not, the big changes in his life are signaled not by their actual arrival but by a shot of him at the moment when he sees them approaching.

It's a movie that gets so many tiny things right: the way Olivia's frustration with her kids' unreliable dad gives way over time to a patient, resigned sense that he could be worse, the way patterns repeat even for people consciously straining to break out of them, the way the kids forgive and forgive and forgive the shortcomings of their parents and only get angry when they forget to anticipate disappointment and it finds them anyway. People you'd like to be able to help, you can't. People you promise to see again, you don't. And those seemingly petty veracities are what make the big things matter. Most of the major life events in the story – breakups, births, hookups – happen offscreen. Mason's mom, Olivia, is having a remarkable and complex life over these 12 years that we only see in bits, and Arquette's performance often has to suggest her exhaustion over breakfast or convey the pain she feels in the moments when she's most trying to skip over it with her kids.

There's a stubborn and fair ambiguity to the portrayal of these parents whose life's work, in a sense, makes up the bulk of the film. They are neither great parents nor disastrous parents, but they are parents who successfully produce a couple of functional, thoughtful adults. Mason is, in the end, the sum of all that work, plus his own tendency to grow in unexpected directions, plus the influences his parents couldn't control. He's not a new person and not a completed person; he's a person who carries evidence of a childhood not graded on performance but marked with growth by the day and year in changing climates. And in the film's last shot, he's still wrapping new days around the old ones.","Mon, 04 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/08/04/mason_wide-181343b305449403d7173d647b0bf4b7d4274162.jpg?s=1400,"['rings', 'tree', 'things', 'life', 'shot', 'way', 'boyhood', 'parents', 'mason', 'kids', 'film', 'hes']",none
82,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"AM4U in Rancho Cucamonga makes clothes without water, pollution - San Gabriel Valley Tribune",https://www.sgvtribune.com/2014/08/10/am4u-in-rancho-cucamonga-makes-clothes-without-water-pollution/,"RANCHO CUCAMONGA >> Bill Grier says the apparel industry is on the cusp of returning to Los Angeles and it is all due to a process he invented called infusion.

Bombarding polyester or nylon with photons releases tunnels of energy deep within the material that draw in the dye from an ink-jet design matched to the back of the fabric. Almost like magic, the material and the design merge and the shirt is ready for the cutter and the sewing machine.

No water. No chemicals. No pollution.

Grier, 67, said he has demonstrated his active-tunnel infusion process to Chinese investors. He has made swimwear, leggings and tops for American Apparel in Los Angeles. And he’s taking orders from apparel companies who want to build his factory as an add-on to their traditional business, or as a new line of on-demand clothing shops that can increase profits while shrinking one’s environmental footprint.

During a hot day in the Inland Empire, Grier invited the press to his prototype factory located in an industrial area of Rancho Cucamonga. The drought, entering a fourth straight year in California, was a topic of conversation. Normally, it takes 80 to 200 gallons of water to dye a shirt, he said. “A shirt like this,” he points to the black golf shirt he’s wearing, “takes 200 gallons of water and 73 cancer-causing chemicals. We use no chemicals and no water. All we use is the frequency of the fiber.”

The waterless, shirt-making process, a critical component of Grier’s AM4U company, received a key endorsement from Cal Poly Pomona’s Apparel Merchandising & Management Department. Peter Kilduff, department chair, showed up along with Los Angeles County Supervisor-Elect Hilda Solis for a tour of his Rancho Cucamonga test factory in July.

By eliminating many steps, Grier says his process can increase profits by as much as 400 percent. And it’s the right time for a sea change in apparel making.

“Smaller dye houses use a million gallons a day of water and they are suffering because of the water shortage. We’ve got to move on this enabling technology,” Grier said.

Solis, who soon will represent the First District which includes East L.A, Boyle Heights and downtown Los Angeles, sees active infusion as a way to create better-paying garment-worker jobs.

Grier starts his employees at $12 an hour with full benefits, he said. The infusion process cuts down on the number of steps used to make garments. He can make a shirt or a pair of jeans in 30 minutes under one roof because he doesn’t have to send out to dye the material, then send designs for assembling to shops in Pakistan or China, then wait for the final product to be shipped back to the United States. Also, since the process makes garments on-demand, it eliminates waste inherent in the clothing business.

“They dump about 30 percent into the landfill,” he said, adding that his process could usher in a new business model for the industry.

“Our process is much more efficient. It allows us to provide high paying jobs,” he said. It only takes 24 people to run each factory, from order, design to manufacturing, assembly and shipping.”

He sees a market both in the United States and overseas.

The potential for clean, non-polluting factories in China is strong, he said. In many industrial cities, waste water laced with chemicals from apparel factories pollute the country’s rivers and drinking water supply.

“They can take all that water they save and use it for agriculture,” he added.","Sun, 10 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sgvtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/201408/NEWS_140809441_AR_0_TABWLBPUDXQN.jpg?w=1024&h=670,"['grier', 'cucamonga', 'angeles', 'process', 'am4u', 'apparel', 'makes', 'dye', 'shirt', 'factory', 'pollution', 'chemicals', 'water', 'rancho', 'clothes', 'los']",none
83,DR-2014-000109-CHN,SWOT analysis Dutch onion sector - FreshPlaza,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/2125195/swot-analysis-dutch-onion-sector/,"The Dutch onion chain is in good shape. Thanks to the combination of the highest yield per hectare in the world and the lowest cultivation, processing and transport costs, the Netherlands is a leader when it comes to export. Furthermore, the sector, which is often cyclical in terms of production and price development, seems a bit more stable than before. The onion acreage is bigger than ever this year, with over 30,000 hectares. The acreage went up last year as well, while prices for growers remained at a higher level this past season than in the previous season. The cultivated area for seed and planted onions has gone up in the 2014/2015 season, which just started, by 20%, the area for sown onions grew by 2%. While the number of agriculture companies is going down fast, and arable farming is also seeing a downward trend, the number of companies cultivating onions is increasing. The new season, thanks to favourable growing conditions, seems to start with high volumes of good quality. For this reason, price volatility is looming. Prices will normally be lower than in the past two years, because of supplies. This could put returns under pressure, but does offer a further stimulus for export growth to more and more markets. 90% of the Dutch onion production is already being exported. There are other opportunities for the onion chain in the area of technological innovation and quality guarantees.





Currently, there are 3,590 onion companies: 2,870 are dealing with sown onions, 950 with seed and planted onions. A part of the agricultural companies is active in both sown and planted onions. The number of sown onion growers increased by 1% compared to 2013, that of planted onion growers by no less than 15%. That brings the number of planted onion growers back to 2003 levels. These companies hope to take advantage of the early end of the 2013/24 trade season (running from July until June), and the favourable growing weather in spring. Because of this, the first planted onions could be harvested extra early. The number of agriculture companies has gone down by 47% since 2000, the number of seed onion companies by only 3%. The number of seed and planted onion growers has gone down by 15% in this period. The scale of agricultural companies saw a huge increase, of more than 50%. The average onion acreage per company even increased by 66%: from 5.3 hectares per company in 2000 to 7.8 ha now. Of the total onion acreage of 30,240 hectares, 22,390 hectares consists of sown onions, and 7,440 hectares of seed and planted onions (and 420 hectares of pearl onions). Both acreages are seeing a growing trend (figure 1 and 2).



Below charts in Dutch:







There are limits to the growth of the onion acreage, however: a responsible agricultural enterprise is allowed to grow onions on 1/8th of its acreage maximum. The necessity of crop rotation in the cultivation plan (optimum land use is essential) is an important natural reason for this. On the other hand, the farmer will spread out (financial) risks through variation in the cultivated area for onions. By switching between contract cultivation with fixed prices or a free, more speculative cultivation, an onion grower can also adjust their own measure of risk appetite.



Netherlands global player on onion market

The most important onion production countries are China (share of over 30%) and India. The Netherlands, with a production of around 1.3 billion kilogram (average of the past five years) and a share of around 2%, falls just outside the top ten. Production has seen a growing trend: in 1980, production was 300 million kilos. The production growth completely benefited the export.





Now, around 90% of production is exported in the Netherlands, worldwide that's 10% at most. With an export share of around 20%, the Netherlands is, after India, the biggest onion exporter in the world, and for yellow onions the country has even been the number 1 for over forty years. India has overtaken it thanks to the strong position in red onions and shallots. China, the United States, Mexico and Spain follow on the export ranking, on places three to six.



Below, the most important strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the onion grower are named.



Strength of the sector: Highest yield plus lowest cultivation, processing and transport costs in the world



That the Netherlands is still, despite a small production share, a dominant player in the global market is - apart from the thoroughbred entrepreneurship and being a notoriously reliable trade partner - a consequence of the advantages the country has when it comes to the chain, logistics and strategic position.



High product yields An onion is the vegetable that uses the most water. There is more than enough of that in the Netherlands. Partly for that reason, the annual yield per hectare is the highest in the world, and, moreover, structurally increasing: in good years, 60 to 80, and in some acreages, even over 100 tonnes gross per hectare. This is partly because of the ideal day length in the growing season. In addition, the onions can be grown and conserved year-round. When it comes to the breeding of onions, the Netherlands is also a leader.

Efficient chain The onion sector is known as an efficient chain. There are over 3,500 growers, 50 packagers/sorters at most, and around 200 exporters. In some cases, there's a commission agent between grower and packager. Only in the Netherlands, growers and sorting companies are separated. Abroad, there are no free onion growers. Dutch growers are too small to invest in sorting and packing machines on their own. That's done by the packing plants. For that reason, nowhere in the world are sorters so specialized and cheap.

Port logistics For both onion growth and onion trade, the Netherlands has the right strategical location by nature. Nowhere are costs for transport logistics of onions - packing costs excluded - so low as in the Netherlands: from grower to packing plant and from packager to port, both are € 0.01 per kg. Global market leader Wiskerke Onions drives the onions from the packing plant in Kruiningen in Zeeland, to the Maersk depot in Vlissingen. From there, each day three feeders with containers sail for the port of Rotterdam. The ports of Antwerp and Bergen op Zoom are also nearby for the packing plants in Zeeland and Flevoland. To compare: Pasco Onions from Texas in the US has to go to Seattle first for transport by sea (800 km round trip). From Rotterdam, the onions are transported by container ship to, for instance, export destination Senegal, where they can be preserved and eaten for up to two months. Transport by ship from Rotterdam to Dakar, Brazil or Asia is cheaper than road transport to Paris, for instance. With sea transport to Asia, onion exporters fill up the containers that sailed with onions from China and the like to Rotterdam. This way, they won't have to return empty, and transport costs are kept relatively low: about a third of the cost from East to West.

Weakness of the sector: imbalance in chain and weather and seasonal dependence

Imbalances in the chain The chain power lies mostly with the (agency) exporters and retail. In addition, around 20 of the, at most, 50 wholesalers and sorters, control the market. The heavily competing onion growers are largely dependent on them. Apart from that, they're largely dependent on price developments determined by weather and seasonal influences. Due to the already wafer thin margins, that makes onion growers extra vulnerable. They can choose to store onions longer, and so speculate on higher prices with later delivery in the season, or otherwise for the certainty of fixed prices in contract cultivation.

Large price differences per season A quantitatively and qualitatively good or bad harvest is a big factor in yields for the onion grower. Figure 3 shows that bigger harvests lead to lower prices. The record harvest in 2011 led to very bad prices in the 2011/2012 trade season. However, the severe winter of 2013 caused a smaller harvest that year, leading to lower yields in the past season (figure 3). Positive, however, is that the production and yields show a growing trend (figure 4). 2011/2012 was a negative outlier for trade prices, and more bad years will undoubtedly follow, but four of the five last years were above average when it comes to yields. In addition, export prospects remain positive.





Also for onion traders, revenue can strongly vary due to price fluctuations during the season and between the various years. For them, risk spreading is a must, for instance through planned purchasing. All sorts of combinations are possible: purchases can be made at a fixed price, partly at minimum price or even under the cost price or at bale prices (including tare), for instance with an amount of small (very early), medium and large onions. The WUR is currently researching opportunities for a futures market for onions, given the importance of risk spreading.

Opportunities mainly by reaching new markets and technological innovation



The Dutch market is saturated, so the opportunities are mainly found abroad. The world population is growing by nearly 200 million people per year, various sales markets in Asia and Africa are becoming wealthier, and the average human being eats 7.5 to 8 kilos of onions per year. These are favourable factors for the Dutch onion sector, a sector which is already heavily focused on export, and which saw the export volume increase by around 75% during the past 15 years.



The trend toward more extreme weather conditions, appears to lead to more failed harvests or even a definitive end to onion cultivation elsewhere in the world. The Netherlands is well able to 'fill such gaps' and benefit from sales prices, which are going up as a result. An example from the past is the food riots regarding onions, which occurred in Latin America, or the fact that onion cultivation has stopped in Israel, due to the water problem (shortage and salinity) there. The Dutch onion chain benefits from this, because Israel is now importing its onions from the Netherlands.







Continuing to develop new markets worldwide

In the 2012/13 onion season, for the first time over 1 million tonnes of onions were exported. In the 2013/14 season, the export was 959,00 tonnes because of a lower harvest. Onion growers are successful in expanding the number of markets worldwide. Russia and the rest of Eastern Europe, the Far East (Malaysia, Indonesia), Latin America (Brazil and recently Panama and Costa Rica) and the Caribbean are proving to be growth markets. Since 2008, however, mainly Africa is a booming market (figure 5). The average yearly volume growth to Africa has been 18% since then, while sales within the European Union stagnated. Because of this, the European market share went down from 48% to 32%, and the African share increased from 29% to 44%. The past years, Senegal has been the most important export country, with Ivory Coast and Sierra Leone taking 3rd and 4th spot in 2013. The UK is the 2nd export market.



Technological innovation

More important than the introduced innovation regarding a digital trade platform (uienhandel.com) are the technological innovations that growers and sorters can still undertake. These entrepreneurs would do well to focus even more on quality and food safety (100% control). Growers are still focusing too much on maximizing the number of kilos, rather than quality. Packing plants are focusing on investments in new sorting machines, including cameras (assessment of onions is often still done by hand). Wiskerke has the first computerized sorting machine with infrared laser and optical cameras. Such investments are only profitable, however, at a low cost price per product, and hence high export volumes. There's still a technological challenge ahead when it comes to measuring and then lowering the nitrogen level of onions, which is often still too high.



Threats due to increasing competition, currency risks and danger of quality loss



Increasing competition leads to price pressure Due to high onion prices in the past two years, not only the Netherlands, but also surrounding countries will see more cultivation. When harvests are good, this will result in lower prices. Subsistence, for instance in African markets, will also increase then. In Senegal, import often stops in January, in order to sell their own onions first. When they're out of these, the borders are opened up again. If the current local production - at a sufficient quality - can be increased, Dutch onion sales will go down, and new markets will have to be found.

In China, for instance, although there's a growth in export of onions and a higher production quality, their export focus will remain on industrial goods, because of higher added value. In addition, China needs their own onions because of the continuing population growth and migration from the countryside to the cities.



Dependence on exchange fluctuations

Onion export mainly takes place to countries outside the Euro zone. Because of this, trade is highly dependent on currency fluctuations. When Dutch prices are high, Asian countries will move to import from India or China. Export flourishes with a cheaper Euro, to Africa, Asia, Latin America, but also to the United Kingdom. So it's good news that the ING Economic Bureau is expecting a weakening of the Euro against both the British pound and the American dollar.

Neck rot risk asks for focus on quality and innovation

More extreme weather also means more rain, and too much humidity is bad for production quality. Neck rot is often already a big problem in the sector, especially during a wet and warm growth season. For the image of the Netherlands as an onion country, but also for company costs and revenue, this can have negative consequences. There are also always risks of soil fertility decreasing. Such quality problems in cultivation and storage of onions not only lead to lower production volumes, but also to dissatisfaction with buyers. Minimizing neck rot risk is a big challenge for the entire onion chain, from breeding to export country. So an even bigger focus on innovations, in order to increase quality, is a must.

In 2014, onions took up nearly 6% of the agriculture acreage. Grains (circa 37%), potatoes (30%), and sugar beets (15%) cover a much larger part of the acreage. Onion, as the fourth most important agricultural product, is the only one that saw the number of hectares go up since 2000, with about 50% in total (seedbed sown onions 60%, seed and planted onions 40%). The total acreage decreased by 18%. Also, for the first time in history, the onion acreage (30,240 hectares) is larger than that of barley (27,640 for spring and winter barley in total).","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.freshplaza.com/favicon.png,"['dutch', 'season', 'quality', 'onion', 'prices', 'onions', 'production', 'growers', 'analysis', 'sector', 'price', 'swot', 'export', 'netherlands']",none
84,DR-2014-000109-CHN,The Most Violent Era In America Was Before Europeans Arrived - Science 2.0,https://www.science20.com/news_articles/the_most_violent_era_in_america_was_before_europeans_arrived-141847,"There's a mythology about the native Americans, that they were all peaceful and in harmony with nature - it's easy to create narratives when there is no written record.

But archeology keeps its own history and a new paper finds that the 20th century, with its hundreds of millions dead in wars and, in the case of Germany, China, Russia and other dictatorships, genocide, was not the most violent - on a per-capita basis that honor may belong to the central Mesa Verde of southwest Colorado and the Pueblo Indians.

Writing in the journal American Antiquity, Washington State University archaeologist Tim Kohler and colleagues document how nearly 90 percent of human remains from that period had trauma from blows to either their heads or parts of their arms.

""If we're identifying that much trauma, many were dying a violent death,"" said Kohler. The study also offers new clues to the mysterious depopulation of the northern Southwest, from a population of about 40,000 people in the mid-1200s to 0 in 30 years.

From the days they first arrived in the Southwest in the 1800s, most anthropologists and archaeologists have downplayed evidence of violent conflict among native Americans.

""Archaeologists with one or two exceptions have not tried to develop an objective metric of levels of violence through time,"" said Kohler. ""They've looked at a mix of various things like burned structures, defensive site locations and so forth, but it's very difficult to distill an estimate of levels of violence from such things. We've concentrated on one thing, and that is trauma, especially to the head and portions of the arms. That's allowed us to look at levels of violence through time in a comparative way.""

It wasn't just violent deaths that poke holes in the harmony with the land and each other myth. A paper in June in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that the Southwest also had a baby boom between 500 and 1300 that likely exceeded any population spurt on earth today. The northern Rio Grande also experienced population booms but the central Mesa Verde got more violent while the northern Rio Grande was less so.

Kohler has conjectures on why. Social structures among people in the northern Rio Grande changed so that they identified less with their kin and more with the larger pueblo and specific organizations that span many pueblos, such as medicine societies. The Rio Grande also had more commercial exchanges where craft specialists provided people both in the pueblo, and outsiders, specific things they needed, such as obsidian arrow points.

But in the central Mesa Verde, there was less specialization.

""When you don't have specialization in societies, there's a sense in which everybody is a competitor because everybody is doing the same thing,"" said Kohler. But with specialization, people are more dependent on each other and more reluctant to do harm.

If that sounds like rationalization based on Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, it is.

""Pinker thought that what he called 'gentle commerce' was very important in the pacification of the world over the last 5,000 years,"" said Kohler. ""That seems to work pretty well in our record as well.""

The episode of conflict in Southwest Colorado seems to have begun when people in the Chaco culture, halfway between central Mesa Verde and northern Rio Grande, attempted to spread into Southwest Colorado.

From 1080 to 1130, the Chaco-influenced people in Southwest Colorado did well. In the mid-1100s, there was a severe drought and the core of Chaco culture fell apart. Much of the area around Chaco lost population, and in 1160, violence in the central Mesa Verde peaked. Slightly more than a century later, everyone left that area, too.

""In the Mesa Verde there could be a haves-versus-have-nots dynamic towards the very end,"" said Kohler. ""The people who stayed the longest were probably the people who were located in the very best spots. But those pueblos too were likely losing population. And it might have been the older folks who stuck around, who weren't so anxious to move as the young folks who thought, 'We could make a better living elsewhere.'"" Older, or with too few people to marshal a good defense, the remaining people in the Mesa Verde pueblos were particularly vulnerable to raids.

At least two of the last-surviving large pueblos in the central Mesa Verde were attacked as the region was being abandoned. Some of their inhabitants probably made it out alive, but, says Kohler, ""Many did not.""","Sun, 03 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.science20.com/files/TrailofTears.jpg,"['central', 'verde', 'violent', 'era', 'europeans', 'kohler', 'rio', 'northern', 'america', 'arrived', 'violence', 'southwest', 'population', 'mesa']",drought

ASIAN STARS: Vikas Shive Gowda won the discus with 63.64m to end India’s 56-year gold medal drought in men’s athletics, while two India wrestlers also won gold

AFP, GLASGOW, Scotland





Olympic champion and world record holder David Rudisha was beaten by Nijel Amos in the Commonwealth Games 800m final on Thursday, while Nigeria’s Blessing Okagbare claimed a women’s sprint double.

Rasheed Dwyer led a Jamaican clean sweep of the men’s 200m to emulate teammate Kemar Bailey-Cole’s victory in the 100m, the two sprint golds going some way to make up for the absence of Usain Bolt, who was only to compete in the 4x100m relay.

Kenya’s Rudisha, who set a blistering world record when winning Olympic gold in London, had finished ahead of silver medalist Amos in the British capital in 2012.

However, there was revenge in the wet Glasgow air, with Amos producing a sublime, fast-paced finish to outdo his Kenyan nemesis, clocking 1 minute, 45.18 seconds, with Rudisha at 0.30 seconds. South Africa’s Andre Olivier took bronze in 1:46.03.

“The race was good, but the last 100m was difficult. I didn’t have good preparations,” Rudisha said in reference to a calf injury that only saw him make his track comeback in May.

Botswana’s Amos was quick to heap praise on Rudisha, saying: “This gentleman will always be the hero of the 800m.”

Okagbare kept her bid for a Commonwealth treble on course as she added the 200m crown to her 100m title, the US-based 25-year-old still to run in the 4x100m relay.

She timed 22.25 seconds for gold, beating unrelated English duo Jodie Williams (22.50 seconds) and Bianca Williams (22.58 seconds) to top the podium.

In the men’s 200m, Dwyer outshone world silver medalist Warren Weir, the only sprinter in Glasgow to have clocked a sub-20 seconds 200m, timing 20.14 seconds for victory ahead of Weir (20.26 seconds) and Jason Livermore (20.32 seconds).

South Africa’s Cornel Fredericks won the men’s 400m hurdles, while Jamaica’s Kaliese Spencer claimed the women’s event.

Vikas Shive Gowda won the discus with 63.64m to end India’s 56-year gold medal drought in men’s athletics at the Games, the last winner being Milkha Singh over 440 yards (402.3m) at the 1958 edition in Cardiff.

Australia’s Olympic champion Sally Pearson showed no fallout from the suspension of head coach Eric Hollingsworth for his outspoken criticism of the star hurdler for missing a pre-Games team training camp.

Pearson scorched into yesterday’s final of the 100m hurdles with a time of 12.69 seconds, tellingly punching the air as she came through the line.

Alex Dowsett, second to David Millar four years ago in the men’s road cycling time trial, claimed Commonwealth gold for England in a closely contested race through the streets and suburbs of Glasgow.

He timed 47:41.78, with Australian rider Rohan Dennis crossing the line 9 seconds slower to take silver and Geraint Thomas grabbing third to claim the bronze for Wales.

Millar, in his final season, was in eighth position.

It was England’s first gold medal in road cycling in 28 years and the winner said that being dumped by his team for the Tour de France was extra motivation.

“The Commonwealth Games was a big target for me anyway, but it suddenly became a huge target because I really wanted to do something big after the disappointment of the Tour de France,” he said.

New Zealand’s Linda Villumsen, also a silver medalist in New Delhi, produced a storming finish to clock 42:25.46 seconds and pip England’s Emma Pooley in the women’s road cycling time trial.

Pooley, who is to retire after the Games, had to settle for silver, while Australia’s Katrin Garfoot took the bronze.

Canada moved up into third place in the medals table with two golds in wrestling, courtesy of Danielle Lappage in the women’s under-63kg division and Tamerlan Tagziev in men’s under-86kg.

George Kobaladze won the final weightlifting gold for Canada by taking the over-105kg title with a new Games record combined weight of 400kg in the snatch, and the clean and jerk.

In gymnastics, England won three of the five golds on offer through Max Whitlock in the men’s floor event, Claudia Fragapane in women’s vault — her third title of the Games — and Rebecca Downie on the uneven bars.

At just 22, Downie still ranks as the oldest gold medalist in the event.

India took two wrestling golds thanks to Babita Kumari in the women’s under-55kg and Yogeshwar Dutt in the men’s under-65kg.

Canada were the most successful wrestling nation with seven golds, while India won five.","Sat, 02 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.taipeitimes.com/assets/images/TaipeiTimesLogo-1200X1200px_new.jpg,"['golds', 'womens', 'seconds', 'final', 'defeats', 'silver', 'rudisha', 'gold', 'won', 'amos', 'games', '800m', 'mens']",none

Though European steel demand has started reviving, primarily due to an improved show by the automobile and appliances sector, Tata Steel Europe is not out of the woods yet, despite some major restructuring and permanent resting of capacity.

ArcelorMittal remains an exception in the global steel sector, as ahead of the recession, it had emerged as a global steel behemoth, with significant presence in Europe, thanks to the company's chief Lakshmi Mittal successfully fighting an epic battle to acquire the Luxembourg headquartered Arcelor, highly rich in capacity and technology. ArcelorMittal continues to acquire and build new capacity, but with more discretion than in the past. Demand recession and low prices saw Mittal, till recently, engaging in shutting unviable plants, braving opposition from unions and host governments. The market left him with no alternative but to cut the size of group operation in line with the changing demand. The spirited restructuring, including restarting select steel projects, has improved the profitability of the company's steel business. As it is the only steel group with major global presence, including in China through a joint venture, it is the bellwether for the global steel sector, as Alcoa of the US is for aluminium or BHP Billiton is for mining. Therefore, the announcement of ArcelorMittal's results and estimates are awaited with much interest by steelmakers everywhere.

But have Mittal's initiatives such as scaling back capacity, focusing on innovative solutions with steel products for sectors such as automotive and energy and staying on a relentless drive to cut production costs, on occasions ruffling union feathers, started paying results? Yes, going by the group's results for the quarter ended June this year. For the first time since 2012, the company had a profitable quarter, with net income at $52 million, compared with a $780-million loss in the corresponding period last year. The improvement, which an analyst with Macquarie appropriately describes as ""baby steps, rather than leaps"", is due to the group benefiting from a rise in demand in the developed of Europe and North America. These two regions account for two-thirds of ArcelorMittal's steel shipments. The group's iron ore business, both in terms of production and shipments at market prices, continues to make progress, as expected. Market-price ore shipments rose to 10.5 million tonnes (mt) in the June quarter from 8.2 mt a year earlier. But benefits that should have accrued from increased shipments were offset by the lower than anticipated iron ore prices. Earlier, credit was taken for an annual average iron ore price of $120 a tonne for ore with 62 per cent iron content. As this has now been revised to $105 a tonne, with realisation for the second half of this year pegged at $100 a tonne, ArcelorMittal has scaled down the estimate for 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) from $8 billion to $7 billion.

The mined ore is usually sold at market prices and also used by ArcelorMittal mills. The Mount Nimba project is a smart acquisition, as it leverages the company's existing presence in the region. More, capital and operational cost in Guinea will be low, as the Liberian rail road and port will be used to evacuate Mount Nimba ore. Iron ore prices may have tumbled on supply pressure, but mining powerhouses such as Rio Tinto and Billiton remain committed to ramping up production of steel-making ingredient, as this still generates 30 per cent profit margins. The question is whether ArcelorMittal is part of the lowest cost quartile of ore diggers.

What is inspiring for ArcelorMittal is the $7-a-tonne improvement in steel Ebitda in the June 2014 quarter compared to the corresponding period last year, owing to demand and price increases, particularly in Europe and North America, where Ebitda rises were $19 and $11 a tonne, respectively. Profitability in the steel business in developed is improving. Global steel demand, on which China has an overbearing influence, is set to increase 3-3.5 per cent. What is helping ArcelorMittal is the expected six per cent rise in demand in the US and four per cent in Europe. All indications point to a further improvement in the steel market. That should make it possible for ArcelorMittal to pare its debt to $15 billion from $17.4 billion at the end of June.","Mon, 11 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/misc/2014-05/09/full/arcelormittal-1399619989-0982810.jpg,"['rise', 'benefits', 'cent', 'iron', 'arcelormittal', 'restructuring', 'ore', 'global', 'steel', 'prices', 'tonne', 'europe', 'demand']",none
88,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Ugly sight awaits flooded cars' owners at UCLA stadium lot - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ucla-cars-20140806-story.html,"They came in all makes and models — old and new, red, black and phantom gray.

They had names: “Zippy,” “the Philly Mobile.”

And they carried memories — of trips to Disneyland, the beach and big moves to Los Angeles.

But on Tuesday, in an obscure baseball stadium parking lot just west of the 405 Freeway, almost all of the 340 mud-covered cars lined up next to one another had at least one thing in common.

“It’s pretty clear that these cars are not going to be drivable ever again,” UCLA spokesman Tod Tamberg said. “These cars are finished.”

In sharp contrast to the jubilant relief Friday at UCLA Lot 36, Tuesday’s scene was one of disappointment and anxiety. Rather than driving triumphantly off the lot in unharmed cars, the students, staff and campus visitors assembled at Jackie Robinson Stadium could only stare, smell and wait.

University and insurance officials said they expected almost all of the cars — flooded by last week’s catastrophic DWP water pipeline break — to be deemed total losses. Owners had their first chance to see their property in person Tuesday, and what they saw as they pulled onto Constitution Avenue wasn’t pretty.

Most cars were caked with dirt and debris over the hood and up to the windows. Some vehicles had a white layer of paint from the garage ceiling plastered onto their roofs. A few had their windows down and their trunks popped open.

“It feels like Costa Rica,” Kyle Hasenstab, 27, said as he cracked open the door to his Toyota Yaris.

“Oh, it smells!” his wife, Susan, said, before asking, “You want your sunglasses?”

The cars towed to the baseball field were deemed the most damaged of the more than 900 that officials estimate were parked in lots 4 and 7. The two parking structures were flooded when a trunk line ruptured on Sunset Boulevard, sending more than 20 million gallons of water cascading onto UCLA’s campus and nearby streets.

After a lengthy closure, the stretch of Sunset near the university was reopened Monday. On Tuesday, Department of Water and Power Senior Assistant General Manager Jim McDaniel told the board overseeing the department that the pipe that had ruptured showed extensive corrosion both inside and out and had been welded with a technique no longer in use.

Spokesman Joe Ramallo said “the LADWP has accepted responsibility for the event and ... will evaluate claims for damages and will pay for documented, necessary and reasonable losses.”

Adjusters from the department and multiple insurance agencies were on scene assisting vehicle owners with claims.

A claims adjuster inspected Eugene Acosta’s Honda Pilot as the 39-year-old UCLA staffer gingerly slipped on plastic gloves and placed damp jumper cables, a CD case, a stroller and an anti-theft device onto the asphalt.

Acosta came armed with a camera and a spreadsheet listing dozens of his personal effects and their costs.

“You spend hard-earned money for your stuff,” he said. “For a freak accident like this you want to make sure everything is properly replaced.”

The father of two said that immediately after the flood started, he tried to retrieve his SUV from Parking Lot 4 but was knee-deep in water about 15 feet from the vehicle when fire personnel shooed him away. That night, he said, he saw a photo showing a nearby car submerged in window-high water and told a friend: “I just want to cry.”

But by Tuesday, Acosta was busy detailing the damage, stewing over whether he’d get fair market value for his family’s trusty vehicle.

When it was all over, the adjuster told Acosta he was being transferred to a different representative with the total-loss unit. And he could say goodbye to the car: It would be towed away for the last time soon.

“I actually got a day off so today I need another distraction,” Acosta said as his boys squirmed at his side. “We’re going to the zoo.”

89,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Origami robotics: Here's how to fold your own 'metamaterial' at home - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-origami-robot-miura-ori-metamaterial-20140808-story.html,"Origami: It’s not just art anymore. Engineers are harnessing the Japanese art of paper-folding to build in smarter, more efficient ways.

A team of researchers designed a self-folding robot that can assemble itself and crawl away in four minutes, described in the journal Science. But in the same issue, a second team shows how origami can be used to actually create materials with novel properties – and they show how you can create a ‘metamaterial’ of your own, right at home.

The study led by Jesse Silverberg of Cornell University applied origami-like principles of folding not to machines, but to the very materials they’re built from. After all, once you’ve produced a material – a rod of iron, a sheet of paper – it’s typically difficult to adjust its mechanical properties. But if your material is organized in a particular folding pattern, it could potentially be reconfigured at a moment’s notice.

So the scientists studied the Miura-ori – a pattern that basically looks like a 3D tessellation of parallelograms and is used to efficiently stack solar panels for space – to see how it responded to changes.

When the researchers folded paper into a Miura-ori pattern, it gave the paper an unusual springiness: When squeezed in the middle, it contracts evenly, instead of bulging out of the sides the way a sponge would. That’s a very useful property in a building material, from an engineering perspective.

They also found that they could adjust the stiffness – how much it resisted being squeezed – by introducing a defect in the pattern. All they had to do was take a finger and push out certain folds, creating what they called “pop-through defects,” and it would make the sheet stiffer. If they introduced more than one defect, they interacted in interesting ways, even canceling each other out.

On top of that, the defects were reversible – the folds could be popped back into place.

The scientists think this means that just about any thin sheet – whether paper, or different types of metal – can be converted into a metamaterial. And these kinds of origami-inspired materials, featuring ‘tunable’ properties, could be very useful for future soft robotics and other devices.

“Such structures would be self-folding and single or multifunctional, with applications for such capabilities as yet scarcely imagined,” Zhong You of Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, wrote in a commentary.

91,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Proposed Arizona copper mine threatens ocelot and jaguar - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-ocelot-copper-mine-20140811-story.html,"A lone male ocelot has become a symbol of the conflict between conservationists and federal officials over a proposal to build an open-pit copper mine in the Santa Rita Mountains, just south of Tucson.

The discovery of the ocelot in April prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reexamine its 2013 biological opinion that the Rosemont Copper mine would not unduly harm habitat for endangered species in the area, including the only known jaguar in the United States.

The ocelot, photographed with a remote-sensor camera operated by the University of Arizona, is among a handful of the secretive, highly territorial and federally endangered cats that are the first in half a century to prowl so far north of Mexico, scientists say.

There were no ocelots documented in the Santa Ritas when the agency issued its biological opinion on the mine project, proposed by Canadian firm Augusta Resource Corp. The project is to include a 955-acre open pit, a processing plant, transmission lines, new roads and tailings facilities.

Now the agency is weighing whether to anticipate an “incidental take” of an ocelot if the mine is built and trying to determine the company’s potential liability in the event the facility is linked to the death of one of the cats.

To answer those questions, the agency must first determine if the ocelot is a vagrant or a resident and if there are females in the thorny desert region, where federal protections and cattle ranchers are credited with protecting habitat for jaguars and ocelots.

The agency is also reconsidering the potential impacts of groundwater pumping by the mine on critical habitat for the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog and two fish, the Gila chub and Gila topminnow.

Conservationists led by the Center for Biological Diversity, which is based in Tucson, about 25 miles north of the Santa Ritas, have their minds made up.

“The science is clear,” said Randy Serraglio, a spokesman for the center. “The Rosemont mine cannot coexist with jaguars, ocelots and other endangered wildlife whose survival is on the line.

“Beyond that, we may be witnessing the results of the good work the USFWS has done by making it illegal to kill jaguars and ocelots,” he said. “Why would we want to turn our backs on that?”

The project was controversial even before the ocelot showed up.

In earlier drafts of the 2013 biological opinion, agency biologists concluded that the proposed mine would destroy thousands of acres of critical habitat for the jaguar on public land and sever access to the species’ range in northern Mexico.

Steve Spangle, manager of Fish and Wildlife’s ecological services field office in Arizona, rejected his scientists’ conclusion on the grounds that the adverse impacts they predicted were “too speculative” and not “highly probable” to result from the operation.

“The ‘incidental take permit’ we gave the company was based on our conclusion that the jaguar may simply shift its home range elsewhere,” Spangle said in an interview. “We never granted permission to physically harm or kill a jaguar.

“I’m as excited as anyone else that these animals are showing up out there,” he said.

In 2009, the Arizona Game and Fish Department euthanized the last then-known jaguar in the United States after capturing and outfitting him with a radio collar. An independent investigation later determined that the jaguar’s death was due in part to mismanagement by state officials.

92,DR-2014-000109-CHN,UPDATED: Keeping Filler Ingredients Out of Your Cup of Coffee - Newswise,https://www.newswise.com/articles/keeping-filler-ingredients-out-of-your-cup-of-coffee,"Clarification: The research discussed in this press release focused only on ground, roasted coffee available in Brazil. The use of commercial coffee from Brazil allowed the researchers to develop and perfect chromatographic methodologies for detecting several filler ingredients common to tested coffee. The resulting methodologies will allow for testing of coffee from any market. Until such testing is done, the results of this research cannot be extrapolated to the U.S. or any other country. The National Coffee Association, USA has issued a statement regarding its efforts to ensure that coffee is not adulterated.

EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: Monday, Aug. 11, 2014, 5 a.m. Eastern time Note to journalists: Please report that this research will be presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.

Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 11, 2014 — Coffee drinkers beware: Surprise ingredients that are neither sweet nor flavorful may be hiding in your coffee, and growing coffee shortages may increase the chance of having these fillers in your cup of joe in the future. The good news is that a highly accurate test is in the works to quickly find coffee containing unwanted fillers before the beverage reaches stores and restaurants.

These extra ingredients, though not harmful, make ground coffee go farther and increase profits for producers, according to researchers. Their report will be part of the 248th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world’s largest scientific society. The meeting features nearly 12,000 reports and is being held here through Thursday.

A test to detect counterfeit coffees is becoming more important in light of growing shortages in regions, such as Brazil, where droughts and plant diseases have dramatically cut back coffee supplies. “With a lower supply of coffee in the market, prices rise, and that favors fraud because of the economic gain,” says research team leader Suzana Lucy Nixdorf, Ph.D.

In 2012, a study from the U.K.’s Royal Botanic Gardens and the Environment stated that 70 percent of the world’s coffee supply might disappear by 2080 because of conditions caused by climate change. But shortages due to more immediate issues already are occurring. The coffee-rich country of Brazil typically produces 55 million bags of coffee each year. But according to some reports, the projected amount for 2014 will likely only reach 45 million bags after this January’s extensive drought. That’s about 42 billion fewer cups of coffee for this year.

Now, however, Nixdorf and her team at State University of Londrina in Brazil have developed a way to nip coffee counterfeiting in the bud.

“With our test, it is now possible to know with 95 percent accuracy if coffee is pure or has been tampered with, either with corn, barley, wheat, soybeans, rice, beans, acai seed, brown sugar or starch syrup,” she says. The problem, she explains, is that “after roasting and grinding the raw material, it becomes impossible to see any difference between grains of lower cost incorporated into the coffee, especially because of the dark color and oily texture of coffee.”

In new research, the team is now analyzing several fillers that are considered impurities rather than adulterants. These impurities can even be parts of the coffee plants, introduced at harvest, that are not really supposed to be in the final product. Wood, twigs, sticks, parchment, husks, whole coffee berries or even clumps of earth that are almost the same color as coffee have been found. Identifying them is essential because if there is a large amount of impurities, they were probably added purposefully — not by accident, as some producers claim, says Nixdorf.

Currently, tests to detect these unwanted additives require scientists to check the coffee, and those tests are subjective –– not quantitative, she says. With these tests, the scientists look at the coffee under a microscope or identify various additives by simply tasting the coffee. In contrast, the new test uses liquid chromatography and statistical tools. This gives her team a much closer look at the ingredients in an unbiased way, according to Nixdorf. Chromatography is a powerful analytical technique that is very sensitive and highly selective.

Because much of the coffee is composed of carbohydrates, researchers could develop a “characteristic fingerprint” when using chromatography that separates out the real coffee compounds, says Nixdorf. The added, unwanted grain fillers generate different levels of sugars than the natural ingredients, so they are easy to identify, she explains.

Nixdorf acknowledges funding from the Government of Brazil’s Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos and Fundação Araucária- Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico do Paraná Productivity Scholarship.

Title Strategy to detect adulterations in ground roasted coffee: An association of carbohydrates content and profiles with chemometric tools

Abstract Coffee is one of the most popular drinks, consumed for its refreshing, stimulating taste and health benefits; and ranked as second-traded worldwide commodity. Its high-price combined with certain ground roasted coffee characteristics, like brown color, particle size and oily texture, attracts fraudulent adulteration, allowing cheapest admixture of roasted and grinded fillers. As a matter of economic order, husks, sticks, corn, cocoa seeds, barley, wheat middling, chicory, soybean, triticale and acai seeds are commonly added. Since simple visual inspection enables to differentiate genuine ground roasted coffee from adulterated one; microscopy is conventionally applied. However, this technique is limited to semi-quantitative assays, requiring trained and skilled analysts. So, it remains great challenge to develop a non-subjective method, selective for distinct markers and quantitative reproducible for industrial quality control. Beside, carbohydrates as major grains macronutrient stand as tracer by its profile and content to assess coffee authenticity. Despite efforts from studies, food matrices complexity and variability still requires strategies to uncover adulteration. Thus, this approach uses HPLC analyses associated with chemometric tools on new analytical resources for detection of ground roasted coffee adulterations. A validated high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection method was investigated to determine total carbohydrates content profiles of pure roasted coffee beans and adulterants. The influence of each matrix was evaluated employing a simplex-centroid design for experiments with mixtures, relating mixing ratio with each monosaccharide by its response surfaces. Proposed models were effective in recognition and prediction of mixtures concentration, thereby allowing distinction of genuine coffee by principal component analysis. Predominantly, pure roasted coffee presented higher levels of galactose and mannose. Profile of diverse roasted grains as sources of fraud will be shown. All results correspond to polysaccharides from pure raw grains, confirming this approach as a feasible analytical tool for detect adulteration of ground roasted coffee.","Thu, 14 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2014/07/16/image620609.png&width=100&height=100,"['filler', 'research', 'fillers', 'ground', 'keeping', 'updated', 'ingredients', 'cup', 'team', 'coffee', 'roasted', 'test', 'society', 'brazil']",none
93,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Debal Deb | The barefoot conservator - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/bmr5i8vBw06RDiNFms2swK/Debal-Deb--The-barefoot-conservator.html,"The Sunday morning in July marked the fifth straight day of rain in the fecund foothills of the Niyamgiri range in western Odisha’s Rayagada district. The delayed showers heralded the year’s busiest period for ecologist Debal Deb and his right-hand man Dulal as they prepared Basudha—a 2-acre farm unlike any other in India—for an intricately planned growing season.

Wrap your mind around this: Over the coming days, the farm would see the planting of 1,020 indigenous varieties of rice—part of a remarkable effort under way since 1996 to rescue a sliver of India’s genetic diversity from extinction.

This wouldn’t just mean planting 1,000 varieties of rice saplings on a plot one-tenth the size of Mumbai’s Oval Maidan, and watching them grow. Maintaining the genetic purity of each of these heirloom varieties, year on year, necessitates an intricate sowing plan crafted by Deb, 53, and his colleagues, so that no two neighbouring varieties flower at the same time, thus guarding against cross-pollination. Deb published his methodology in the Current Science journal in July 2006, after field-testing it for six years. The constant addition of vanishing varieties to Deb’s growing collection—last year, it numbered 960—means the plan needs seasonal redesigning.

Rice—daily sustenance for a majority of Indians—is a grass species, believed to have been domesticated over 7,000 years ago in a broad region extending from the north-eastern Himalayan foothills to southern China and South-East Asia. Over the centuries, human hands selected thousands of different strains, evolved in response to specific ecological niches. The undulating region of western Odisha, called the Jeypore tract, was one of the world’s leading areas of diversification, where a great number of rice varieties, also called landraces, were developed by cultivators—“the unnamed, unknown, and greatly talented scientists of the past,"" as Deb describes them.

In the 1960s, when Deb was growing up in Kolkata, India was estimated to have over 70,000 such rice landraces. According to a 1991 National Geographic essay, just 20 years later, with scientists and policymakers chasing high yields through aggressively pushed modern, input-intensive hybrids, over 75% of India’s rice production was coming from less than 10 varieties.

This devastating and irreversible genetic erosion from India’s farms continues: For example, rice varieties from West Bengal that Deb collected just five years ago are no longer being cultivated. The disappearance is insidious. “It can result from something as innocuous as a farmer dying, and his son dropping the variety,"" says Deb. “I witnessed this on a farm in Birbhum, with a rare two-grained variety called Jugal.""

An Indian Institute of Science alumnus and a former Fulbright Scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, US, Deb abandoned his job at the World Wildlife Fund in the mid-1990s after struggling to convince colleagues to fund documentation of Bengal’s vanishing rice varieties. “Conservation organizations suffer from what I call mega-fauna species syndrome,"" he says, acerbically. “Tigers—yes. Rhinos—yes. But if some earthworms or beetles are going extinct because of chemical pollutants on a farm, who cares?""

Deb headed out to villages in search of indigenous rice, often travelling on bus rooftops or by foot; an iconoclast by temperament, the small, wiry man still abjures institutional links, relying on teaching assignments in European and American universities and donations from friends to sustain Basudha. He particularly sought out areas that were remote, un-irrigated, and had marginal farmers who could not afford chemical inputs and seeds from the market. “The places Indian elites like to call ‘backward’, such as tribal areas, were those with the greatest chances of having retained these varieties over time,"" says Deb. “When I would find such a variety, I would ask the farmer’s family for a handful, explain why I wanted it, thank them for preserving a vital part of our heritage, and urge them to not give up cultivating it.""

Deb has collected 1,020 desi rice varieties over the past 18 years. They come from 13 states across north-eastern, eastern and southern India. Kashmir, with two indigenous varieties, is the latest entrant to the seed bank, which Deb has named Vrihi, Sanskrit for rice. There are seeds that will grow in soils with high salinity, or conditions of submergence; others are drought- or flood-tolerant; yet others are resistant to attacks from varying pathogens; some are suited to dryland cultivation. There are medicinal varieties as well as 88 aromatic varieties.

These landraces—embodying centuries of accumulated knowledge—and farmers who can work with them are crucial for sustainable ecological agriculture, argues Deb. Annual seed conservation training and a distribution effort centred on the small farmer complement his in-situ conservation project, resulting in an informal personal network of about 3,000 cultivators.

Farmers who approach Basudha for seeds get them free of cost, with a plea to grow them and in turn become distributors to other farmers, to help reduce the chances of the variety becoming extinct.

Last December, having heard of the seed bank, 40 Malkangiri farmers travelled over 200km to Basudha’s doorstep and demanded indigenous seeds for their farms. “Not one asked about yield or market price,"" says Deb. “It was a very moving moment for us."" Deb is also proud that the farm stands on common land in Rayagada’s Adivasi village of Kerandiguda: its residents invited Deb after taking seeds from his bank, and hearing that he was in search of a place to house his project.

The communitarian ethos defining Deb’s work contrasts sharply with agricultural policymaking, where the voices of the small farmer—the largest group of Indians—are often impossible to detect. Take, for example, a gene bank built in recent years by the Odisha government. Located in a government building in Bhubaneswar, 900 varieties from across the state are sealed in aluminium foil packets, and preserved at zero degrees in an impressive facility. It is a laudable effort. Only, how does an average farmer access it?

Officials watching over the collection say they cannot give farmers seed samples to cultivate since these might fall into the wrong hands (seed companies that might exploit the genes for developing new proprietary seed lines). Never mind that the entire collection was built with farmer contributions from across the state. Why does the state not officially release these desi varieties in the market to encourage use and, thereby, survival? The release process, admit bureaucrats, is skewed towards modern, commercial varieties developed by breeders in government labs or private seed companies.

Besides being inaccessible to the average farmer, says Deb, official gene banks neglect the process of life’s co-evolution by freezing seeds in time. “Bring out seeds of a pest-resistant variety after 30-40 years. They will have lost some major traits of defence since in the meantime the pest has evolved,"" he says. “They might be useful for research but are not geared towards our farmers in the field.""

Deb counters the official argument that indigenous varieties result in inferior yields: “I have several varieties which outperform the so-called high-yielding varieties."" High yields do not ensure food security, he reminds, pointing out that India is home to record stockpiles of rice and wheat, as well as a quarter of the world’s undernourished.

Over lunch—greens, vegetables, dal and rice combining eight different varieties from the farm—Deb asks if we can evaluate our heirlooms in money. “Imagine a unique painting, a sari...an ornament which has been in your family for 200 years—would you sell it off to make money?"" he asks. “That’s how these indigenous rice varieties are—they are our culture.""

94,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Hunter pleads not guilty to starting massive California wildfire - Yahoo News,https://news.yahoo.com/hunter-pleads-not-guilty-starting-massive-california-wildfire-004848917--spt.html,"By Jennifer Chaussee (Reuters) - A California hunter pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges that he started a massive wildfire on the edge of Yosemite National Park last summer after building an illegal campfire. Keith Matthew Emerald, 32, entered his plea in U.S. District Court in Fresno almost exactly a year after prosecutors say he sparked the Rim Fire, which scorched 260,000 acres on public and private land in and near the park. Emerald, who lives near the area burned by the fire, is charged with setting timber afire, leaving a fire unattended, violating campfire restrictions and giving a false statement to a government agency. He is expected to be released from custody after his $60,000 bail is posted. Federal prosecutors say Emerald built a fire in the remote dry brush of Stanislaus National Forest, where temporary campfire restrictions were in effect because of drought, while on a bow-and-arrow hunting trip last August. Embers from the campfire reached parched branches overhead and sparked the devastating wildfire named after the Rim of the World lookout spot nearby. The flames scorched 402 square miles, destroyed nearly 100 structures and cost more than $127 million. ""The Rim Fire was one of the largest in California history and caused tremendous economic and environmental harm,"" said Scott Harris, a U.S. Forest Service special agent in charge of the area where the Rim Fire took place. ""While those harms cannot be undone, today we have brought criminal charges relating to the cause of that fire."" Rescuers airlifted Emerald from the burning forest about an hour after the wildfire began, according to court documents. Emerald initially told investigators that he did not set fire to anything during his trip. Federal prosecutors say that Emerald lit a campfire and then lied about it to investigators. If convicted of all four counts, he faces a maximum sentence of six years in prison and $510,000 in fines. He is scheduled to appear in court again on Oct. 14. Emerald's attorneys were not immediately available for comment.

The sun’s reflection illuminates the great Okavango delta in the Kalahari desert. The bright line of the river shows the annual summer flood advancing from the well-watered Angolan Highlands (upper image margin). The flood water slowly seeps across the 100-mile delta—supplying forests and wetlands—and finally reaches the fault-bounded lower margin of the delta in the middle of winter. The wetlands support a variety of plant and animal species in the semiarid Kalahari, making the Okavango delta one of the most famous tourist sites in Africa. Most of the water from the Okavango is consumed by forests or evaporates. Only 2% exits the delta.

The Dasht-e Kevir, or great salt desert, above, is the largest desert in Iran. It is primarily uninhabited wasteland, composed of mud and salt marshes covered with crusts of salt that protect the meager moisture from completely evaporating.

In the Danakil depression in northern Ethiopia, Earth is tearing itself apart. Three tectonic plates—the Arabian, Nubian, and Somalian—are sliding away from each other at a rate of a few centimeters per year. As they diverge, they leave a widening rift valley that will eventually become ocean floor. For now, eastern Africa is one of the few places where it’s possible to see a spreading ridge—a feature normally found in the ocean—on dry land. Danakil is also a good place to see lava fields extending across barren desert. Sedimentary deposits of sand and evaporites appear tan; lava fields and flows are black or grey. The chemical composition of the lava, as well as how long it has been exposed to weathering, can affect its colour.

A long stream of dust and sand crossed the Atlantic Ocean in late June bringing a tan haze to parts of South America and the United States. The dust blows from the northeast to the southwest in this image. The densest layer of dust obscures the blue water from view, but it is not confined to the dark central stream. A broad tan veil of varying hues can be seen throughout the image, hanging in the atmosphere under the white clouds. The coast of South America lies in the southwest corner of the image. From late spring to early fall, strong winds in west Africa frequently kick up massive dust storms which sometimes travel over the northern Atlantic Ocean via the Saharan Air Layer – a layer of warm, dry air from the desert which rises high over the cooler, moister air sitting over the water. The layers don’t mix, allowing the dust and sand to catch the ‘express train’ ride to South America and the United States.

On 23 June, a lengthy river of dust from western Africa began to push across the Atlantic Ocean on easterly winds. A week later, the influx of dust was affecting air quality as far away as the southeastern United States. The dust flowed roughly parallel to a line of clouds in the intertropical convergence zone, an area near the equator where the trade winds come together and rain and clouds are common. In the image above, the dust appears to be streaming from Mauritania, Senegal, and western Sahara. Each year, 40m tons of dust from the Sahara is carried over and dumped into the Amazon river basin. The minerals in the dust replenish nutrients in rainforest soils, which are continually depleted by drenching, tropical rains.

This is a true colour image of the formation of a super typhoon over Guam, US overseas territory in the western Pacific Ocean. It spared the island and veered towards the Philippines, where it reached a wind speed of 120 mph before making a landfall and killing 94 people and wrecking property and infrastructure worth $17m. The typhoon also made two landfalls in China, hitting Wenchang city in Hainan and Zhanjiang city in Guangdong, killing 17 people and damaging buildings, farmlands and infrastructure worth $4.32bn.

Canada’s Northwest Territories are home to many natural wonders and resources, but are being mined for diamonds in recent years. One area of highly visible development has been the Lac de Gras kimberlite field, about 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Kimberlites mean diamonds. Named for deposits first found in Kimberly, South Africa, kimberlites are forged deep within Earth’s mantle. Under intense pressure and heat, carbon is squeezed into diamonds and then erupted to the surface in kimberlite pipes. In the Lac de Gras kimberlite field diamonds have been pushed towards the surface. The region has been developed extensively over the past decade to harvest them. One such development is the Diavik diamond mine (right, down), which opened in 2003. It employs 700 people, produces 1,500 kg of diamonds each year, and grosses $91m in annual sales. The nearby Ekati diamond mine (left, up) opened in 1998 and has production similar to Diavik.

Crete and the Aegean Islands: Vegetated land appears green, sparsely vegetated soils appear greenish-tan, arid desert is seen as light tan, and the basic colour of water is blue. What is unusual about this image, however, is the presence of milky silver tones – a result of sunglint, sunlight reflected from the ocean surface directly back at the satellite imager. If the ocean water were perfectly smooth, like a mirror, the reflection of the sun could be viewed very brightly. The surface of even the most peaceful oceans is textured by small waves, so the light is not perfectly reflected. Where the surface is the smoothest, it appears the brightest; rougher water reflects less light and is dark. The movement of water around islands causes turbulent flow as it passes the obstruction and can roil the surface of the ocean. Winds moving over obstructions also create turbulence. In sunglint areas, the play of moving wind and water changes the surface reflectivity, much like streaks on a mirror. The view that results can reveal much about the surface of the ocean that is not normally visible.

In mid-July, a combination of lightning, parched forests, and hot temperatures fueled dozens of wildfires in Canada and the northwestern United States. By 17 July, 102 fires were burning in British Columbia and 13 more in Alberta. Across the border, 33 fires raged in Washington and Oregon. Dense plumes of smoke billowed from many of the blazes. Actively burning areas are outlined in red. Forests appear dark green. The snow-capped peaks of the Canadian Rockies are visible in the center of the image. Large banks of white clouds hover over the Pacific Ocean, northern Alberta, and Wyoming.

A thick plume of dust blows out from Sudan across hundreds of kilometers of the Red Sea, with smaller plumes also visible over Saudi Arabia and Eritrea. Prevailing northwest winds over the water blew the plumes to the southeast. Though they are not as concentrated or intense as in other parts of the Middle East, airborne dust events occur with greater frequency in Sudan than anywhere else in the region. Dry lake beds and ephemeral rivers provide ample dry sand and clay that are picked up by winds blowing from interior Africa out to sea.

Turkmenistan is a desert country that lies east of the Caspian Sea and borders Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. In this natural-colour image, the Hanhowuz (Khauzkhan) reservoir jumps out as a splash of turquoise amid desert browns. The reservoir was constructed in a natural depression to capture winter runoff and overflow from the Garagum canal for use later during the driest periods of summer. In the image, the canal is the brown ribbon dropping down from the upper right corner and heading south and east from the reservoir. But the canal that started as an engineering wonder for arid lands has also turned out to be an environmental tragedy. It has starved the Aral Sea, which has lost about 90% of its water since the canal’s creation in 1988.

The effects of California’s severe multiyear drought can be clearly seen in this pair of images showing an area northeast of Madera, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains between Yosemite national park and the San Joaquin Valley. On 5 April 2011 (right ), the winter rainfall was at a normal level and HV Eastman and Hensley Lakes are full, and green vegetation carpets the landscape. Three years later, on 15 May 2014 (left), the drying up of the reservoirs is apparent, as is the browning of the grass- and shrub-lands.

Typhoon Neoguri pounded Okinawa and other western Pacific islands with torrential rain and damaging winds in mid-July, en route to a likely landfall in Japan. At the time, Neoguri was a category 2 typhoon moving through the East China Sea. The storm was imaged by a special ‘day-night band’ that detects light in a range of wavelengths from green to near-infrared and uses light intensification to detect dim signals. The instrument can sense light as much as 100,000 times fainter than conventional visible-light sensors, making it very sensitive to moonlight and city lights. Here cloud tops are lit by the nearly full moon.

96,DR-2014-000109-CHN,"The swimming pool, symbol of Southern California, takes a dip - Los Angeles Times",https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-social-pool-southern-california-20140731-column.html,"A couple of weeks ago, I hiked into a remote patch of the Mojave Desert hoping to experience a newly installed piece of experimental art.

Instead, I met a pool guy named Robert.

To be fair, I’d been warned that Robert might be there. (And the hike was very short.) My destination was “Social Pool,” an installation in the form of a white, covered swimming pool by an artist named Alfredo Barsuglia. Sunk into the desert floor in the southern Mojave, it’s 5 feet deep and measures a modest 11 feet by 5 feet.

Reaching “Social Pool” requires some of the map-tending detective work that is central to much of the land art that inspired it, including influential (and remote) pieces from the 1970s by Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt and Walter de Maria.

First, you visit the MAK Center in West Hollywood, which sponsored the piece. There you pick up both a key to the pool’s cover and instructions, complete with GPS coordinates, about how to find it.

Officially, there is only one key in circulation at any time, and it can be checked out for a maximum of 24 hours. Since I was headed with some friends and family on a road trip that would take me through the Mojave (and ultimately to Heizer’s “Double Negative,” outside Las Vegas, and Smithson’s “Spiral Jetty,” on the northern lip of the Great Salt Lake, on the way to Wyoming), I asked the MAK staff if there were any way we could visit “Social Pool” even though I wouldn’t be able to return the key right away.

In the end they kindly lent me one of their spare keys, along with a caveat: On the morning I hoped to visit and swim in the pool, there was a chance somebody from a local pool-supply company would be there draining and refilling it.

I thanked them for the extra key, and I said I’d take my chances.

The ripples of a dream

For every family a house, with every house a garden, and in every garden a swimming pool: This was the postwar L.A. Dream reduced to its essence. What made the pool so powerful in the iconography of modern L.A. architecture is that it somehow managed to be both ubiquitous and exotic.

Think of the pool that Pierre Koenig hung from the hillside edge of the 1960 Stahl House, otherwise known as Case Study #22. Or the one Richard Neutra designed for his 1946 Kaufmann House in Palm Springs. Or pools behind ranch houses set into gardens designed by Thomas Church.

Often charismatically photographed by Maynard Parker or Julius Shulman, these pools were perfectly designed as aspirational features — glamorous but attainable — of Southern California domestic life.

Like the pools in paintings of Los Angeles by David Hockney, they belonged neither to plutocrats (like Julia Morgan’s ornate pools for William Randolph Hearst on the hill at San Simeon) nor to the city as a whole (like the images of Sutro Baths, the huge San Francisco public pool that burned to the ground in 1966, that hung in so many Bay Area houses of my childhood). They belonged to homeowners who were pretty much like you, except maybe a bit more stylish or luckier in career or real estate.

Still, the optimism inherent in that imagery has always been undercut by a different kind of L.A. pool. There is, of course, the life-size rubber horse, designed to look dead and bloated, that Tod Hackett sees submerged in a pool in the Nathanael West novel “The Day of the Locust.” (Instead of the elephant in the room, L.A. has the horse in the swimming pool.) And fetid or drained pools behind foreclosed houses. And the unpeopled blue ovals in Ed Ruscha’s “Nine Swimming Pools” from 1968. And the dead body in the pool at the start of Billy Wilder’s “Sunset Boulevard” (1950).

This darker, noirish view of the pool is ascendant again, helped along by worries about the environmental costs of private swimming pools in an era of drought and climate change.

The average L.A. pool, if left uncovered, loses roughly 20,000 gallons of water a year to evaporation; on an annual basis that’s far, far less than Angelenos spend watering their lawns, but hardly negligible either. As UC Santa Barbara media studies professor Dick Hebdige puts it in the catalog for “Backyard Oasis,” a 2012 photography show at the Palm Springs Art Museum, the swimming pool’s bright symbolism has dramatically faded thanks to “a growing awareness of the finite nature of water as a natural resource.”

“The private pool,” he writes, “is well on its way to outré.”

The California pools that have the most cultural power now are the ones that recapture some sense of public space or shared resources, like the restored Morgan pool at architect Frederick Fisher’s Annenberg Community Beach House in Santa Monica.

All of which leaves us to wonder: If we’ve run out of room, money or inclination to build new houses with pools out back, what becomes of the pools we already have? What’s the relationship between the backyard pool and the larger issue of how we use, waste, move or store water in Southern California?

Those questions help animate a sharp pair of shows organized by the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design and running through Sunday at WUHO Gallery on Hollywood Boulevard.

On one side of the long, narrow gallery are aerial photographs by Lane Barden of the Los Angeles River, the port and the full length of Wilshire Boulevard, collected under the title “Linear City.” The surprisingly intimate pictures of the river, in particular, suggest just how much our attitude toward it and toward the private pool have in common.

We wrapped the river in concrete in the 1930s. The backyard swimming pool, especially in a city facing the Pacific, is a similarly brash 20th century effort to cleave the metropolis tidily from the natural world, though at a domestic scale instead of an infrastructural one.

Increasingly that brashness looks misplaced or antique; instead we seem at the mercy of forces beyond our control when it comes to water, whether the result is prolonged drought or — as happened last week at UCLA — Pauley Pavilion flooded and looking quite a bit like a giant indoor pool.

On the opposite wall is “The Big Atlas of L.A. Pools,” a project by Benedikt Gross, a graphic designer, and Joseph K. Lee, a geographer, who decided a couple of years ago they wanted to document every pool in the L.A. Basin. They began by sending satellite photos of the area to an outfit in India, which for $300 mapped more than 43,000 L.A. County pools.

The strongest curatorial gesture in the “Big Atlas” is among the subtlest. Running along the wall are books filled with aerial photographs of pools: One book for each city. The cities with the most pools (Long Beach, Beverly Hills) are at the end farthest from the door, and as you move toward the front of the gallery the books get progressively slimmer. By the end they are more like pamphlets.

The way the books threaten to disappear matches the way that the swimming pool — like the surface parking lot, the freeway, the lawn and the single-family house — is rapidly fading as a symbolic and cultural marker of Los Angeles.

A pool runs dry

Robert was wearing a baseball cap, T-shirt, jeans, boots and sunglasses. He was standing right at the edge of Barsuglia’s “Social Pool,” next to an admonition in red letters reading, “Please respect and preserve the artwork.”

I introduced myself and the three people I was traveling with to Wyoming: my 10-year-old daughter, my friend Bill and his 9-year-old son. Robert’s presence, of course, meant that we wouldn’t be able to take a dip, which is the central attraction of this suburban pool in desert exile.

The kids were disappointed — they’d just changed into their bathing suits, and the temperature, at 9 in the morning, was nearing 90 — but contented themselves splashing in the inch or two of water that was left in the bottom of the pool.

Robert, good-natured about this interruption, explained that he worked for a pool-supply company in Joshua Tree, about an hour’s drive away. He said he came out once a week or so to clean “Social Pool,” which will be open through the end of September.

He was a perfect advertisement for the installation’s guiding themes, a walking symbol of the labor and energy required to keep pools full of pristine water in a climate like ours — and of the lengths we’ll go to swim in solitude.

Barsuglia asks each group of visitors to “Social Pool” to bring a gallon of water, to replace roughly what’s lost to evaporation while the pool is uncovered. I had that gallon jug in my hand when I met Robert.

Since he was working when we arrived I didn’t get to pour it in, a gesture, in this summer of severe drought, that must feel to other visitors to “Social Pool” like some kind of ceremonial apology to the watershed on behalf of 20 million Southern Californians.

But I did think, later on, of the famous lines from “Sunset Boulevard” about Joe Gillis, the screenwriter played by William Holden seen floating face-down in the opening scene: “The poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end he got himself a pool. Only the price turned out to be a little high.”

98,DR-2014-000109-CHN,Excess sodium intake linked to 1.65 million deaths annually - Los Angeles Times,https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-excess-sodium-intake-20140813-story.html,"Across the world, the excessive consumption of sodium--hiding in breads, soups and snack foods and beckoning from salt shakers everywhere--is the cause of some 1.65 million deaths by heart disease and strokes yearly, including roughly 667,000 “premature” deaths--those before the age of 70--says a comprehensive new study.

Globally, new research concludes that one in 10 cardiovascular deaths can be attributed to excessive sodium consumption, and one in five of those among people younger than 70.

The study, conducted by an international team led by Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian of Harvard University’s School of Public Health, was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

An invited editorial touted the study as a “herculean effort” to glean the effects of excess salt consumption in a broad population. But citing the findings of two studies published alongside the global assessment, University of Alabama vascular expert Dr. Suzanne Oparil declared it too early for public health officials to take up the cudgels against dietary sodium.

Daily sodium intake averaged 3.95 grams per day across the globe, and ranged upward to 5.15 grams, Mozaffarian’s team found. That level of consumption is well above the range that experts for the Institute of Medicine have concluded is ideal--as little as 1.5 grams per day for those with high blood pressure (as well as diabetics, African Americans and those 50 and older) and as much as 2.3 grams for all others.

Diets high in sodium claimed their highest tolls in a band stretching from the countries of Georgia and the Ukraine and across Central Asia to Russia, Mongolia and China, with slightly lower death rates throughout Asia, the study found. It was lowest in Central America and the Horn of Africa.

The United States, Canada and Europe, where public health campaigns aimed at reducing sodium in foods are already underway, lay roughly at the global midpoint, with just more than 300 deaths per million attributed to high sodium intake.

The study’s seemingly dramatic findings, however, belie continuing controversy over the value of efforts to reduce sodium intake across whole populations.

Among the points of contention is whether diets high in salt cause healthy people to develop high blood pressure or merely exacerbate the condition in those who have it. In contemplating measures to reduce the sodium content in everyday foods, public health officials are also wary of causing harm to patients, including those with heart failure, diabetes or chronic kidney disease, for whom a diet very low in sodium can cause complications and lead to death.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that subjects who reduced their sodium intake lowered their blood pressure. But despite extensive research, debate and efforts at expert consensus, the value of broad sodium-reduction campaigns--as well as the targets such campaigns should aim to reach--remain controversial.

A pair of studies published alongside the global assessment underscore the suspicion that, in broad populations, the relationship between sodium intake, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and death may be quite complicated.

One study published Wednesday found a tenuous connection between sodium intake and hypertension. A second study found that over a roughly 3 1/2 year period, those ingesting between 3 and 6 grams of sodium daily--a span that reflects the global range of sodium intake--were less likely to die or suffer a heart attack or stroke than were those who consumed diets higher or lower in sodium.

In addition, both studies suggested that for some, dietary intake of the mineral potassium may play a role in reducing excessive sodium’s ill effects.

The two studies appearing alongside the global assessment were conducted by researchers at McMaster University’s Population Health Research Institute in Ontario, Canada. Both measured, by indirect means, the sodium-intake levels of more than 100,000 people from at least 17 countries.

In the first of those studies, the link between levels of sodium intake and hypertension was most evident in older subjects, in those who had the highest sodium intake, and in subjects who had hypertension. But in people who fell outside of these groups, researchers found little discernible pattern: a diet that was moderately high in salt--just under 3 grams a day--was not clearly linked to high blood pressure in this study. And those consuming between 3 and 5 grams of sodium daily were only slightly more likely to have hypertension.

Those findings led Dr. Oparil, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, to conclude that more study is needed before public health campaigns aimed specifically at reducing sodium intake can be safely launched.

The three articles “highlight the need to collect high-quality evidence on both the risks and the benefits of low-sodium diets,” Oparil wrote in an editorial published by NEJM Wednesday. Until clinical trials better flesh out the relationship among dietary sodium, potassium, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, she wrote, “the results argue against a reduction of dietary sodium as an isolated public health recommendation.”

That conclusion drew criticism from one public health expert who has worked with food manufacturing giants to reduce sodium content in widely-consumed processed foods.

“Given the very clear relation between sodium intake and higher blood pressure, and evidence that reducing intakes reduces risk of cardiovascular disease, I think the new findings do not change the basic conclusion that we should be moving toward lower sodium intakes,” said Dr. Walter Willett of Harvard University’s School of Public Health, who was not involved in any of the newly-published studies.

“The exact optimal intake is not clear. There is no question that some sodium is essential,” Willet added. As a result, he said, “while we move toward lower intakes, we should be conducting additional research to better define the optimal level.”","Wed, 13 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a7cac7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+138/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F55%2Fb817c66d29418871ab4d98490c1e%2Flat-sci-salt-mkb-la0004913859-20110927,"['deaths', 'health', 'million', 'intake', 'linked', 'study', 'grams', 'published', '165', 'studies', 'annually', 'public', 'high', 'sodium', 'pressure', 'excess']",none

FAIRFIELD—

Police arrested a Fairfield resident for allegedly sexually assaulting a child under the age of 14.

During the month of March, the Fairfield Police Department investigated a report of a suspected sexual assault on a child. The Fairfield Police Department conducted the initial investigation, but then brought up their Major Crimes Unit for a follow-up.

In addition to the sexual assault investigation, detectives determined the man was also a suspect in a kidnapping that was originally investigated by the California Highway Patrol.

Police identified the suspect as Scott Jones, 35, from Fairfield.

Around 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Fairfield police took Jones into custody in the Waterman Plaza parking lot. Jones was booked into Solano County Jail for Committing Lewd Acts on a Child under the age of 14, oral copulation, and kidnapping.

Jones is a convicted felon and has prior law enforcement related contacts for Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Vandalism, Obstructing Law Enforcement and Cruelty to Animals.

There is no additional information at this time.

Anyone with information regarding this crime is asked to call the Fairfield Police Department Major Crimes Unit at (707) 428-7600, the 24-hour Tip Line at (707) 428-7345 or Crime Stoppers at (707) 644-7867. Callers can remain anonymous.
