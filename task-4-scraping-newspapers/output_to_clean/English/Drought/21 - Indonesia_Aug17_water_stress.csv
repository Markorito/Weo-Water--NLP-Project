EU's Water Footprint ©iStock/danymages The EU uses 668 km3​ of water for all of the goods it produces, consumes and exports annually. Roughly 38% is water from outside the EU with 98% of foreign water use coming for agricultural commodities mainly from: Brazil (20%); Argentina (11%); Indonesia (8%); Ivory Coast (8%); Ghana (4%); the US (4%); Ukraine (3%); Malaysia (3%) and India (3%).

The study titled ‘Dependencies of Europe’s economy on other parts of the world in terms of water resources’​​ was carried out as part of EU-funded project IMPREX​​ (Improving Predictions and Management of Hydrological Extremes).

It measured water availability in countries for which the EU is reliant upon for agricultural commodities and compared with EU consumption of each commodity.

The report expects sugarcane, almonds and pistachios will be vulnerable in the near future due to current water scarcity.

Water scarcity is not affecting cocoa and coffee at present, but longer-term climate change may alter rainfall and weather patterns in origin countries ultimately harming these crops, it says.

‘They don’t see how vulnerable they are’​

Dr. Ertug Ercin, project manager of the Water Footprint Network and co-author of the report told ConfectioneryNews water scarcity was “underestimated”​ by Europe’s confectionery industry.

“Multinationals are aware that there can be problems related to water scarcity, but they don't see how vulnerable they are in the case of a drought, or climate change....and the destruction it means for their production.""​

""This is a big issue...The current and future drought situations may affect businesses, including through an increase in commodity prices.""​

He added some agricultural commodities grow only in certain countries or climates, making it harder to source elsewhere.

""If the rainfall is not there, you have two choices: Either you have to irrigate or you have to find somewhere else.​

""For example for cocoa, if you look at the chocolate industry, there's only certain places where it's grown. You don't have many choices - you can’t go to the Netherlands or Germany,"" ​he said.

Irrigation systems are not widely used in cocoa. Around 95% of cocoa​​ is grown by smallholder farmers on small land plots of one to three hectares, typically by West African farmers often living in poverty.

Dr. Ercin said confectioners might only be able to offset higher input costs via price increases so much before upsetting retailers and consumers.

""[Companies] realize there is a risk with climate change, but they are looking at climate from the perspective of global warming. They underestimate the water issues,”​ said Dr. Ercin.

""When there's a lack of water, competition for water increases, scarcity increases,”​ he said, adding this will ultimately lead to commodity price hikes.

Almonds ‘highly vulnerable’​

Almonds are predicted to be the worst affected agri-commodity with 91% of EU almonds classified as “highly vulnerable,”​ according to the report

Almost all crops imported to the EU from India and Pakistan are in areas with high water scarcity, it adds.

Around 56% of EU sugarcane imports are vulnerable, the report says.

According to Dr. Ercin, most EU businesses will opt for locally sourced beet sugar. However, he said once the sugarcane supply from outside the EU declines – for example in India - there will be increased demand for EU beet sugar causing a spike in prices.

Drought is already harming hazelnut production in Turkey this year, he added.

""Next year, the chocolate industry will suffer and it will affect their prices if they are producing hazelnut chocolate,”​ said the report author.

Cocoa vulnerable if rainfall patterns change​

Current water scarcity is creating immediate risks for these crops. However, any future disruption in rainfall patterns driven by climate change could impact other crops, such as cocoa, says the Water Footprint Network’s paper.

""At the moment they are not vulnerable,” said Dr. Ercin. ​

“But rainfall patterns will change and areas [such as West Africa] can be negatively affected…that's the worry there. These are ‘rain fat’ commodities - they mostly grow by rainfall,” ​he said.

South America – particularly Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia – are the most vulnerable cocoa origins, according to the report’s maps.

""West Africa, Indonesia and Malaysia are the least impacted,"" ​said Dr. Ercin.

What can companies do?​

Dr. Ercin suggested companies map where water scarcity and drought may affect their business most and look at adaptation measures, such as increasing water productivity.

Climate change and cocoa forecasts Source: CIAT A​nalysis​​ published last year by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) predicts a 57% reduction in high climatic suitability areas in top cocoa producing nation Côte D’Iviore from present day to 2050.

The report author urged companies to take a holistic approach, looking beyond solely where they source their agri-commodities.

""Most of the time they look at [their direct supply], which is not enough, they have to look at the situation of the whole water resources in the area because ultimately if anything goes wrong it will affect them,” ​said Dr. Ercin.

He advised companies to support vulnerable regions by promoting good agricultural practices, infrastructure and irrigation systems.

""The most important thing is to build the capacity of the growers at every level,” ​he said.

The report was the first phase of the Water Footprint Network’s project.

It will further explore how climate change and weather extremes may alter the vulnerability levels of different economic sectors in the EU and will assess the economic consequences.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/4/7/4/8/7198474-1-eng-GB/Water-scarcity-and-climate-change-Impact-on-sugar-cocoa-and-nuts.jpg,"['eu', 'confectionery', 'change', 'vulnerable', 'cocoa', 'rainfall', 'water', 'footprint', 'hit', 'report', 'market', 'underestimated', 'climate', 'scarcity']", ,drought

2,2,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Are we running out of fresh water? - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/are-we-running-out-of-fresh-water/a-40241057,"Two-thirds of the world is covered in water, containing over a billion trillion liters of water. So how could we have water shortages?

The vast majority of water on earth is saltwater and therefore not fit for human consumption. Only 2.5 percent of all water is freshwater. But more than two-thirds of that is locked away in ice caps and glaciers.

That leaves us with a very tiny fraction of water to drink, cook with, irrigate crops and feed livestock.

But water is a renewable resource that moves in a cycle. The amount of H2O on our planet will always remain the same, and won't run out as such.

The question is whether we will have enough clean water available for all citizens at all times.

Local water scarcity

According to a 2016 study by the University of Twente in the Netherlands, 4 billion people could face severe water shortages for at least a month every year.

In some regions, people are already severely affected by droughts and water scarcity. Millions of people in the Horn of Africa face hunger and illness after years of recurring drought. And Pakistan could run dry by 2025, a UN report suggests.

""Locally, the problem is very acute,"" Johannes Schmiester, a water expert at WWF Germany, told DW. ""And all available numbers and observations suggest that the situation will become more severe.""

Climate change is expected to intensify the situation. It alters weather patterns and water cycles around the world, causing shortages and droughts in some areas, and floods in others.

Extreme temperatures are also to blame for physical water scarcity. But in many cases experts as well point out ""economic"" water scarcity, due to how we manage our water supplies.

Water scarcity in India: People fill up their plastic canisters from water tanks

Groundwater is over-extracted; rivers and lakes are drying up or becoming too polluted to use.

To combat economic water scarcity, governments have to invest more in infrastructure for water supply and water storage, says Vincent Casey, a water expert at WaterAid.

""A big challenge is that water isn't always where you need it and when you need it most. So investment has to go into water storage and distribution, to ensure people always have access to safe water,"" he told DW.

Agriculture's thirst

One of the biggest water consumers is agriculture. Around 70 percent of all freshwater on the planet goes into irrigation of fields and feeding of livestock.

Farmers in some regions are already seeking to water their fields more efficiently. But researchers say this is not enough.

In Spain's tomato-growing region, farmers using the latest technology have managed to decrease their water consumption over the years. But in the industry as a whole - which produces a quarter of Europe's tomatoes - still needs more water than local water resources can supply.

As a result, the region faces water scarcity.

Researchers say the solution is to consider the entire geographical area and think in units of river basins. Can the local ecosystem sustain agricultural production?

""It's important to change perspective and consider whether local fresh water supplies can support certain industries,"" says Schmiester from WWF.

Growing demand

An additional strain on water management is our ever-growing consumption.

According to the World Health Organization, human beings need at least 20 liters (5.3 gallons) of freshwater per day to prepare meals and for basic personal hygiene. Laundry and bathing are not included.

Water consumption is much higher in industrialized countries, though - for example, the average person in Germany uses 140 liters per day. Flushing the toilet alone uses 30 liters.

To conserve water, irrigation can be made more efficient

Our indirect water footprint is even higher: 840 liters of water are required to produce one pot of coffee. And more than 8,000 liters go into a single pair of jeans.

Growing consumption calls for better reuse of water and more efficient production. The theme of this year's World Water Week addresses ""water and waste,"" and how to reduce use and recycle water.

More than 3,000 experts will exchange ideas and develop solutions for waste water treatment and poor water management.

But Casey warns that technical solutions won't be a silver bullet for the global water crisis.

""It ultimately comes down to political decisions over allocations and effective governance of the resource. Solutions have to be devised in the countries where the problems are - and only then can water scarcity be solved,"" he concluded.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19200293_6.jpg,"['liters', 'need', 'running', 'local', 'wont', 'freshwater', 'water', 'solutions', 'consumption', 'fresh', 'world', 'scarcity']", ,none
3,3,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Is your drinking water safe? Here's how you can find out - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/is-your-drinking-water-safe-heres-how-you-can-find-out-77543,"America’s drinking water infrastructure is aging and in serious need of modernization. Pipes are overdue for replacement, and water and wastewater treatment systems need upgrades to deal with new classes of pollutants. Changing a drinking water standard or adding a new substance to the list of contaminants regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency is time-consuming. Some water systems are having problems meeting current standards, much less upgrading to meet new requirements.

A 2017 Gallup poll found that 63 percent of Americans worry a great deal about drinking water pollution. And a recent report from the Natural Resources Defense Council, Threats on Tap, suggests that they have good reason. According to the report, community water systems – public systems that serve cities and towns year-round – registered more than 80,000 reported violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act in 2015.

As water resource educators with Penn State University’s Extension service, our role is to educate the public using research-based information. Most of our work is focused on private water systems – mainly wells and springs, which are used by over 15 million U.S. households. These private systems share many of the critical concerns about public systems addressed in NRDC’s national report.

Clean water and proper sanitation have greatly improved life expectancy in the United States over the past 150 years. Now, however, we see an urgent need to upgrade water infrastructure, and to update regulations, enforcement and public education about drinking water safety. With many public and private water systems across the nation aging and under stress, it is important for everyone to understand the risks associated with drinking water contamination, and to know how to take simple steps such as having their water tested if they suspect there may be a problem.

Land use and source water protection

Delivering clean drinking water starts with protecting sources, including groundwater and surface rivers and lakes. Many water quality problems that we see in Pennsylvania are based on local land uses. Nitrates from agriculture and development are a particular problem in water wells in the southeast and south-central parts of the state. Exposure to nitrates in drinking water can cause health effects, especially in infants, inhibiting their blood’s ability to carry oxygen.

Fertilizer from farm fields, lawns and gardens contributes large amounts of nitrogen to surface and groundwater. Nitrates are very water-soluble and readily move across the land and into groundwater. Pesticides and herbicides do the same if they are not properly applied. Homes in rural areas that use septic systems can also release nitrates if the systems aren’t working properly.

In western Pennsylvania, unconventional shale gas drilling has become a major industry since 2009. In late 2016 EPA published a report on how these operations can affect drinking water. Many homeowners near drilling operations are proactively testing their water supplies to get a baseline reading of their well water quality.

When land uses change – for example, energy operations move in, or a farm is sold and developed – nearby residents frequently take a closer look at their source water and watch for impacts within the watershed supply area. Households that use well water face some unique challenges. EPA does not regulate private water supplies. Pennsylvania does not have statewide well construction standards, and only a few municipalities regulate water testing or construction. In general, homeowners with private water systems are solely responsible for testing their water and installing any necessary treatment equipment to correct problems.

We always tell well owners not to apply or dump anything within 100 feet of their well that they don’t want to drink, since this area supplies most of the water to their well. On a larger scale, the same advice holds true for public water supplies.

Some communities are creating source water collaboratives to monitor drinking water supplies and address problems. For example, the River Alert Information Network is a regional sourcewater protection program in the Ohio River basin in southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia. This network of public water systems has set up a real-time monitoring network that can notify drinking water supply intakes downstream of contamination that may be flowing in their direction.

Critical contaminants

Bacterial contamination threatens public and private water supplies. It can happen at the source, during water treatment – especially as systems age – or in the piping systems that deliver water to customers.

Public water systems are required to disinfect water and maintain a secondary level of disinfectant throughout the system to ensure that water delivered to homes is safe. Leaky supply lines cause several types of problems. First, they waste treated water. Second, they can lower water pressure in the system. When this happens, untreated water can seep in, contaminating water that has already been treated.

High-quality construction and maintenance are crucial for private water systems too. We have seen systems that lacked a watertight well cap, allowing insects or surface water to enter the well. Some wells have cracked casings enclosing the well bore hole, or no casing at all, which can allow polluted runoff to contaminate water in the well. When private septic systems fail to properly treat wastewater, bacteria from the wastewater can contaminate the landowner’s private well, and may reach aquifers serving other nearby wells and municipal systems.

The water supply crisis in Flint, Michigan has brought new attention to lead contamination and other impacts associated with corrosive water. Similar problems exist in other private and public systems. Most lead contamination comes from supply lines to the home or lead solder in pipes and fixtures within the home.

We receive calls from homeowners concerned about lead in both public and private water supplies. If their home was built before lead solder was banned from plumbing systems in 1991, we recommend testing their water.

Monitoring and testing are crucial

We can treat only what we monitor. Over the years, Penn State Extension’s research has found that fewer than 50 percent of private water system owners have ever had their water tested. Although we work to educate private water system owners about their responsibility to monitor their water, and recommend testing it annually, many owners only do so when they are concerned about their water’s appearance or taste.

Monitoring is just as critical for public water systems, on a much larger scale. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has proposed new fees, at EPA’s urging, to pay for hiring more inspectors for public water systems that serve more than 10 million residents. This is a step in the right direction but a drop in the bucket compared to current needs.

Protecting source waters and preventing contamination in the first place is even more cost-effective than hiring new inspectors. Pollution is much easier to contain at the source than when it is detected downstream or has already contaminated drinking water supplies.

Safe drinking water is a critical resource. The United States needs to invest in infrastructure, public education, source water protection, regulation and monitoring for new contaminants to keep water flowing to a thirsty nation.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/179071/original/file-20170720-8687-mwegya.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=5%2C150%2C3678%2C1786&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['heres', 'supply', 'public', 'source', 'water', 'safe', 'supplies', 'systems', 'contamination', 'testing', 'drinking', 'private']", ,none
4,4,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Identifying time scales for violation/preservation of Stokes-Einstein relation in supercooled water - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700399,"The violation of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation D ~ (η/T) −1 between the shear viscosity η and the translational diffusion constant D at temperature T is of great importance for characterizing anomalous dynamics of supercooled water. Determining which time scales play key roles in the SE violation remains elusive without the measurement of η. We provide comprehensive simulation results of the dynamic properties involving η and D in the TIP4P/2005 supercooled water. This enabled the thorough identification of the appropriate time scales for the SE relation Dη/T. In particular, it is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of various time scales associated with structural relaxation, hydrogen bond breakage, stress relaxation, and dynamic heterogeneities can be definitely classified into only two classes. That is, we propose the generalized SE relations that exhibit “violation” or “preservation.” The classification depends on the examined time scales that are coupled or decoupled with the diffusion. On the basis of the classification, we explain the physical origins of the violation in terms of the increase in the plateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of stress relaxation. This implies that the mechanism of SE violation is attributed to the attained solidity upon supercooling, which is in accord with the growth of non-Gaussianity and spatially heterogeneous dynamics.

Third, the origin of the observed SE violation [that is, the decoupling between the diffusion constant D(~τ HB −1 ) and the α-relaxation time τ α ] is elucidated. For this, non-Gaussian parameters and four-point dynamic correlations are examined to probe the degree of dynamic heterogeneities in supercooled water. Here, the SE violation/preservation is additionally demonstrated in terms of other significant time scales, such as the stress relaxation and the mobile/immobile contributions of the dynamic heterogeneities. From these classifications of various time scales, the degree of the SE violation is explained by the increase in the plateau modulus and the nonexponentiality of the stress correlation function upon supercooling. This elucidation for the SE violation is also correlated with the growing of non-Gaussianity and dynamic heterogeneities.

Second, the role of the time scale associated with hydrogen bond (HB) dynamics in the SE relation is investigated. The rearrangement of the HB network in water is expected to play a critical role in determining its dynamical properties ( 32 – 35 ). In addition, the tetrahedrality due to the HB network increases considerably with decreasing temperature ( 21 , 36 , 37 ). This highly structured tetrahedral network is associated with the hypothesized liquid-liquid transition between a high-density liquid and a low-density liquid ( 14 , 38 – 44 ), although this scenario is currently controversial ( 45 – 47 ). Thus, these facts necessitate an investigation of the role of HB dynamics in the SE relation. We show that the SE relation is preserved (SE preservation) when we use the HB breakage time scales instead of τ α , that is, the strong coupling between the diffusion constant D and the HB lifetime τ HB at any temperature. This preservation is attributed to the activated jumps of mobile molecules that characterize the translational diffusion.

The outline of the present study is as follows. First, the SE violation in supercooled liquid water is examined using molecular dynamics simulations of the TIP4P/2005 model ( 26 , 27 ). In particular, comprehensive numerical calculations with respect to shear viscosity are performed on the basis of the shear stress correlation function, which are comparable with recent studies for supercooled water using SPC/E (simple point charge/extended) ( 28 ) and TIP4P/2005f ( 29 ). Our results provide a more systematic examination of the SE violation in supercooled water. The justification of the scenario η/T ~ τ α is demonstrated, which is consistent with the previous studies in simple liquids ( 7 , 8 , 30 , 31 ).

For liquid water, various anomalies in both its thermodynamics and dynamics have been observed upon supercooling ( 12 – 16 ). The SE violation is one of the important anomalies that has been widely reported for supercooled water ( 17 – 25 ). In the previous studies on supercooled water, either Dτ α or Dτ α /T was tested for SE violation. However, the original SE relation Dη/T has not been widely studied because of the high computational costs for calculating η, particularly at low temperatures. Therefore, to determine the origin of the SE violation, obtaining η is important. Hence, the central aims of the present study are to obtain η and to identify the time scales associated with η and D to reveal the origin of the SE violation in supercooled water.

Generally, transport coefficients such as D and η are mostly coupled at high temperatures. The characteristic time scale is associated with the structural α-relaxation time τ α . By contrast, at supercooled states, the SE violation implies that D and η are determined by different time scales. Structural relaxations in supercooled liquids become spatially heterogeneous, which is a different behavior than the homogeneous dynamics observed in normal liquids ( 6 , 10 , 11 ). Thus, the physical implication of SE violation is relevant to the question regarding which time scales determine the transport coefficients in glass-forming liquids. Alternative types of the SE relation D ~ τ α or D ~ τ α /T have been controversially tested by assuming that τ α is proportional to η/T (analogous to the Gaussian approximation) or η (analogous to the Maxwell model), respectively ( 7 , 8 ).

For simple liquids, the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation between the shear viscosity η and the translational diffusion constant D is an important characteristic of their transport properties ( 1 ). Specifically, this relation implies that D ~ (η/T) −1 , where T is the temperature. However, when liquids are supercooled below their melting temperatures, the SE relation is remarkably violated (SE violation), particularly near the glass transition temperature ( 2 – 9 ). Despite extensive efforts, the origins of the SE violation in supercooled liquids remain elusive.

RESULTS

SE violation The translational mean square displacement (MSD) was calculated at different temperatures (see Materials and Methods). The results are shown in fig. S1A. The diffusion constant was quantified from the long-time behavior of the MSD (see Materials and Methods). In Fig. 1A, we plot the temperature dependence of D. The overall behavior is in good agreement with the previously reported result of the TIP4P/2005 model (48). The shear viscosity η in the TIP4P/2005 supercooled water was investigated from the stress correlation function G η (t) (see Materials and Methods and fig. S1B). The shear viscosity η was determined from the Green-Kubo formula (see Materials and Methods). The temperature dependence of the viscosity η is plotted in Fig. 1A along with that of D. At T = 300 K, the estimated value is η ≈ 0.78 centipoise (cP), which is approximately the same as the reported value for TIP4P/2005 (49–52). Furthermore, the structural relaxation of supercooled water is identified by the incoherent intermediate scattering function F s (k,t) (see Materials and Methods). The time evolution of F s (k,t) at various temperatures is illustrated in fig. S1C. As outlined in previous simulation studies (53–57), the behavior of F s (k,t) of supercooled water is characterized by a two-step and nonexponential relaxation below the onset temperature T A ≈ 260 K. Figure 1B shows the temperature dependence of the α-relaxation time τ α (see the definition of τ α in Materials and Methods). In our calculations, the fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) weakly occurs at approximately T L ≈ 220 K. Around this crossover temperature T L , the temperature dependence of η and τ α changes from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius behavior, as shown in Fig. 1 (A and B). The FSC is expected as a sign of the compressibility maximum locus (“Widom line”) originating from the liquid-liquid transition (58, 59). The observed T L ≈ 220 K is in accord with the crossing temperature at 1 g cm−3 of the Widom line determined in recent TIP4P/2005 simulations (44, 60, 61). Fig. 1 Dynamical properties in the TIP4P/2005 supercooled water. (A) Temperature dependence of viscosity η and translational diffusion constant D. The blue dashed curve is the fitting of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law η ∝ exp [(BT 0 /(T − T 0 )] with T 0 = 170 K and B = 1. 79. The blue dotted line is the Arrhenius law for η ∝ exp (E A /T) at lower temperatures with an activation energy of E A = 52. 1 kJ/mol. Arrhenius behaviors D−1 ∝ exp (E A /T) in both the high and the low temperature ranges are also shown as two red dotted lines, with activation energies of E A = 19. 0 and 38. 6 kJ/mol, respectively. (B) Temperature dependence of the α-relaxation time τ α and the HB lifetime τ HB . The blue dashed curve is the fitting of the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann law τ α ∝ exp [BT 0 /(T − T 0 )] with T 0 = 175 K and B = 1. 87. The blue dotted line is the Arrhenius law for τ α ∝ exp (E A /T) at lower temperatures with an activation energy of E A = 47. 9 kJ/mol. Arrhenius behaviors τ HB ∝ exp (E A /T) in both the high and the low temperature ranges are also shown as two red dotted lines, with activation energies E A = 26. 1 and 41. 2 kJ/mol, respectively. (C) Relationship between η/T and τ α . The direct proportional relation η/T ∝ τ α is obtained. The dashed line is a guide to the eye. The relationship between η/T and D is presented in Fig. 2A. The SE relation D ~ (η/T)−1 holds at high T but obeys the fractional formula of the SE relation D ~ (η/T)−ζ with ζ ≈ 0.8 below T X ≈ 240 K. The crossover from ζ = 1 to ζ = 0.8 in the fractional SE relation is similar to the recent experimental result (25). This onset temperature appears to be above the FSC T L ≈ 220 K. As noted in Introduction, the alternative expressions for the SE relation are conventionally examined via D ~ τ α −1 or D ~ (τ α /T)−1. The former formula uses the Gaussian approximation F s (k,t) = exp(−Dk2t). If τ α is characterized by η/T, then Dτ α can play the role of the SE relation. Figure 1C shows the proportional relationship η/T ~ τ α , which is consistent with the previous results in simple liquids (7, 8, 30, 31). The temperature dependence of Dτ α is illustrated together with Dη/T in Fig. 2B. This shows that Dτ α is a good indicator of the SE violation Dη/T below its onset temperature T X ≈ 240 K. Fig. 2 SE violation and preservation. (A) Translational diffusion constant D versus viscosity scaled by the temperature η/T. Dashed and dotted lines present the fractional SE relation D ∝ (η/T)−ζ. As T decreases, the crossover of the power law exponent from ζ ≈ 1. 0 (satisfying the SE relation) to 0.8 (SE violation) is obtained by the fitting of the data. (B) Inverse temperature dependence of the SE ratios Dη/T, Dτ α , , Dτ γ , and G p Γ(1/β)/Tβ scaled by their values at T A = 260 K. All SE ratios exhibit the SE violation in the lower-T regime. Note that the data of and G p Γ(1/β)/Tβ above T A = 260 K are omitted. (C) Inverse temperature dependence of the SE ratios Dτ HB , Dτ η , Dτ NG , and scaled by their values at T A = 260 K. All SE ratios satisfy the SE preservation even at lower T. Note that the data of Dτ η above T A = 260 K are omitted.

SE preservation We introduce the generalized SE ratio Dτ with other significant time scales in supercooled water. First, we focus on the dynamics of HB breakage. The number of the nonbroken HBs for all molecules N HB (t) was calculated in the time interval t, and then the average number fraction C HB (t) was calculated. The results are shown in fig. S1D [see the detailed definitions of the HB and C HB (t) in Materials and Methods]. The HB lifetime τ HB was then determined from C HB (t) (see the definition of τ HB in Materials and Methods). Its temperature dependence is displayed in Fig. 1B along with that of τ α . Remarkably, both D−1 and τ HB exhibit a similar Arrhenius temperature dependence, which is different from that of η or τ α exhibiting the FSC. Thus, we obtain a marked preservation of the SE relation (SE preservation) D ~ τ HB −1 at any temperature, as evident in Fig. 2C. This SE preservation D ~ τ HB −1 implies that the appropriate time scale associated with the translational diffusion D is not τ α but should instead be the HB lifetime τ HB . The HB breakage is commonly speculated to occur intermittently, inducing a markedly large number of jumping water molecules, particularly in supercooled states. Exploring how the HB dynamics are related to the translational diffusion via the jumping molecules is worthwhile. This issue will be discussed later in the paper. Next, we examine the stress relaxation time τ η . The long-time behavior of G η (t) is well fitted by the stretched exponential function G p exp [−(t/τ η )β] (see fig. S1B). G p and τ η denote the plateau modulus and the stress relaxation time, respectively. The exponent β (< 1) is the degree of nonexponentiality. The temperature dependence of G p and β is illustrated in fig. S2A. Note that the stress relaxation time τ η differs from the relaxation time of the Maxwell model τ M = η/G ∞ with the instantaneous shear modulus G ∞ = G η (t = 0). If the temperature dependence of G ∞ is negligible, then the viscosity η is identified by τ M . Furthermore, provided that τ M equals τ α , the linear relationship η ~ τ α is obtained. However, as seen in fig. S1B, G ∞ and G p increase slightly with decreasing temperature. Instead of the Maxwell model, the viscosity η is determined not only by the stress relaxation time τ η but also by the plateau modulus G p . This relationship will be clarified later. We additionally obtained another preservation of the SE relation, at any temperature, as evident in Fig. 2C. This observation implies that the HB breakage is correlated with the relaxation process of the local stress. As mentioned in Introduction, the SE violation is possibly attributed to the heterogeneous dynamics, that is, the coexistence of correlated mobile and immobile motions. In this case, the distribution of the single-molecular displacement becomes non-Gaussian at supercooled states. When F s (k,t) is described by the Gaussian approximation using the MSD , the relation τ α = (Dk2)−1 at the diffusive regime is obtained (1). Therefore, the non-Gaussian behavior is directly linked with the SE violation. Analogous to the previous study (54), the degree of the non-Gaussianity is plotted in fig. S1C. We introduce the peak time of ΔF s (k,t) as τ NG , which characterizes the time scale of the maximum deviation from the Gaussian behavior. As shown in Fig. 2C, the ratio Dτ NG represents the SE preservation at any temperature. We also calculated the conventional non-Gaussian parameter α 2 (t) and determined the peak time of α 2 (t) as [see the definition of α 2 (t) in Materials and Methods and fig. S3A]. As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, the time scale is coupled with D even at supercooled states. From the definition, the first correction of cumulant expansion of ΔF s (k,t) is given by α 2 (t). Thus, τ NG and exhibit similar temperature dependence. A similar observation has been reported in Lennard-Jones supercooled liquids (62); however, the SE ratio was used, contrary to our results. The relationship between the non-Gaussianity and the HB breakage is discussed next. The physical implication of the SE preservation is also given. Furthermore, the effects of characteristic time scales of dynamic heterogeneities on the SE violation/preservation are examined.

Relationship between translational diffusion and HB breakage Let us examine how HB breakages are coupled with diffusion. To this end, we introduce the jumping (jp) molecules with large displacements. Here, the jp molecules undergoing jumping motions are defined as those O atoms that moved farther than an arbitrary cutoff length , during the time interval t. We calculate the MSD due to the jp O atoms, 〈Δr jp (t)2〉 = (1/N)∑ i∈jp 〈Δr i (t)2〉. The summation is over the jp molecule number N jp (t) at time t. In Fig. 3A, the jp component of the MSD, 〈Δr jp (t)2〉, is plotted at several temperatures. Because of the jp molecules, this restricted MSD exhibits the diffusive behavior 6Dt even at short time regimes (t ≳ 1 ps). After a longer time, the jp contributions to the MSD asymptotically reach the full MSD curves at each temperature because all O atoms eventually move a distance greater than . In practice, the value of is adjusted to the long-time regimes of the full MSD at each temperature. For the temperature T = 190 K, Å is chosen corresponding to the position at the first shoulder of the van Hove function with r = |r|, which represents the distribution of single-molecular displacement (see fig. S4, A to C). At the time scale of τ NG ≈ 1 ns, G s (r,t) is largely deviated from the Gaussian form . This deviation implies that the spatial distribution of single-molecular displacement becomes heterogeneous. In particular, a double-peaked structure for G s (r,t) indicates two distinct contributions due to jumping and nonjumping molecules. This non-Gaussianity can be clarified by the decomposition of G s (r,t) due to the number of HBs broken, during the time t for the molecule i [see the definition of in Materials and Methods]. The molecules having more than three broken HBs [ ], which destroy the molecules’ local tetrahedral structures, are entirely subjected to the jumping motions. The displacements of these molecules exceed the cutoff length Å at 1 ns. As demonstrated in the study by Kawasaki and Onuki (63), this cutoff length enables the selection of irreversible jumps as a result of an activation process analogous to nucleation (64). The average number fraction of the jp molecules, ϕ jp (t) ≡ 〈N jp (t)〉/N, exhibiting activation jumps increases linearly over time. The jump rate is approximately given by τ HB −1, that is, ϕ jp (t) ≃ t/τ HB , which is demonstrated in Fig. 3B. If the mean jump length is assumed, then the jp component of the MSD 〈Δr jp (t)2〉 increases linearly with time as from short time intervals. As demonstrated in Fig. 3A, 〈Δr jp (t)2〉 exhibits 6Dt. Thus, these results clarify the correlation between translational diffusion and HB breakage and agree with the demonstrated SE preservation D ~ τ HB −1 (see again Fig. 2C). Furthermore, the mean jump length can be estimated by Å. Fig. 3 Diffusive properties of jump molecules.

Here, D is determined by the long-time asymptotic value of 〈Δr(t)2〉/6t at each temperature. For temperatures T = 190, 200, 220, 240, and 260 K, is adjusted to 1.9, 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, and 1.4 Å, respectively. (B) Average number fraction of the jp molecules ϕ jp (t).

5,5,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,New Jersey-Size 'Dead Zone' Is Largest Ever in Gulf of Mexico - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/gulf-mexico-hypoxia-water-quality-dead-zone,"A record-breaking, New Jersey-sized dead zone was measured by scientists in the Gulf of Mexico this week—a sign that water quality in U.S. waterways is worse than expected.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced today that this summer’s dead zone is the largest ever recorded, measuring 8,776 miles. This is more expansive than the nearly 8,200 square-mile area that was forecast in July. Since monitoring began 32 years ago, the average size of the Gulf’s dead zone measured in at 5,309 square miles.

The Gulf of Mexico hypoxic or low-oxygen zone, also called a dead zone, is an area of low to no oxygen that can kill fish and other marine life. It’s primarily caused by an excess of agricultural nutrients that flow downstream and into surface waters, stimulating harmful algae.

To record the new measurements and assess the severity of low oxygen levels in the Gulf, scientists from the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) embarked on their 31st mid-summer hypoxia research cruise in July. Even with reported numbers as large as they are, the team of scientists said the entire area of the dead zone couldn't be mapped due to an insufficient number of workable days on the ship. There was more hypoxia to the west, and the measured size would have been larger if there was more time for researchers to work.

""The results from this year reflect the nitrate flux into the Gulf, which was high,"" says Nancy Rabalais, a research professor at LUMCON who helped lead the cruise. ""It's a matter of addressing the sources of the nitrate—where they first start—which is in a field of agricultural crops.""

3:33

This year’s large size is mainly due to heavy stream flows in May, Rabalais continued, which were about 34 percent above the long-term average and carried higher-than-average amounts of nutrients through Midwest waterways and into the Gulf. (Read “Heavier Rainfall Will Increase Water Pollution in the Future”)

Preliminary reports from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) align with the observation, estimating that 165,000 metric tons of nitrate–about 2,800 train cars of fertilizer—and 22,600 metric tons of phosphorus flowed down the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers into the Gulf of Mexico in May.

There are many alternative ways to farm using sustainable agriculture, Rabalais added. Those types of practices can reduce the flux of nitrogen, and they can be economical and beneficial to farming communities.

""It's a small-scale effort right now that needs to be addressed more formally by the agricultural community,"" she says. ""I don't want to see the dead zone get any larger—it's large enough, and it's way higher than the target size we want to see.""

What’s Flowing Downstream

The Gulf’s hypoxic zones are caused by excess nutrient pollution, primarily from human activities such as agriculture and wastewater treatment.

Farmland runoff containing fertilizers and livestock waste is the main source of the nitrogen and phosphorus, which stimulate an overgrowth of algae that sinks and decomposes in the water. The resulting low oxygen levels are insufficient to support most marine life and habitats in near-bottom waters, posing a serious threat to the Gulf’s fisheries.

The Gulf dead zone can slow shrimp growth, leading to fewer large shrimp, according to a study led by Duke University. Additionally, the total catch of shrimp could suffer, meaning higher costs at the marketplace and loss of jobs for fishermen, equating to an economic ripple effect on fisheries.

“The Gulf’s summer hypoxic zone continues to put important habitats and valuable fisheries under intense stress,” says Rob Magnien, director of NOAA’s Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research. “Although there is some progress in reducing nutrients, the effects of the dead zone may further threaten the region’s coastal economies if current levels remain.”

Runoff nutrient pollution has also been linked to drinking water contamination throughout other parts of the country. A recent report by Environmental Working Group found that in 2015, water systems serving 7 million Americans across the continental U.S. contained unhealthy levels of nitrates. The subsequent consumption of nitrates has been linked to an increased risk of contracting certain cancers, and agriculture is named as a leading source of the pollution. (Watch ""Why Care About Water"")

The cause for much of this fertilizer pollution is related to a high demand for meat in the U.S., according to a new report by Mighty Earth, an environmental group. The report blames a small number of businesses for practices that are “contaminating our water and destroying our landscape,” citing areas of native grassland in the Midwest being converted into soy and corn fields to feed livestock.

""It's very difficult to see how a nitrogen molecule from the upper part of the United States can affect the Upper Gulf of Mexico, I admit that"" Rabalais said. ""But those same nitrogen concentrations affect the water quality within the watershed elsewhere—in the treatment plants and the well water—and that can cause human health problems and toxic algal blooms, things we definitely don't want.""

Making A Fix

In its action plan for the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone, the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force recently extended the deadline until 2035 for achieving the goal of a 1,950-square-mile dead zone, which would be roughly the size of Delaware.

The task force also agreed on an interim target of a 20 percent reduction in the amount of nitrogen flowing into the Gulf of Mexico by 2025.

Shrinking the annual Gulf of Mexico dead zone down to that size, however, will require a much higher 59 percent reduction in the amount of nitrogen runoff that flows down the Mississippi River, according to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Using computer models, researchers analyzed what it would take to reach the longstanding goal of cutting the size of the Gulf hypoxic zone by about two-thirds, concluding that while the goal is still attainable, reaching it will require “bold new approaches” applied on a large scale in upstream agricultural areas.

""The bottom line is that we will never reach the action plan's goal of 1,950 square miles until more serious actions are taken to reduce the loss of Midwest fertilizers into the Mississippi River system,"" says University of Michigan aquatic ecologist Don Scavia, lead author of the paper.

The study reveals that hardly any progress has been made to reduce the amount of nitrogen runoff. Concentrations of the nitrogen compound nitrate found in rivers are the same today as in the 1980s, and despite more than $28 billion in government spending to reduce nitrogen runoff, there hasn’t been a significant reduction in the amount of nitrate washing into the Gulf of Mexico.

“Clearly something more or something different is needed,” Scavia said. “It matters little if the load-reduction target is 30 percent, 45 percent, or 59 percent if insufficient resources are in place to make even modest reductions.”

Although nitrogen has historically been considered the main nutrient driver of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico, a ""dual-nutrient strategy"" of reducing both nitrogen and phosphorus appears to be the most prudent management approach, Scavia and his co-authors reported.

Potential paths toward reducing levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus include altering fertilizer application rates, using cover crops (fast-growing crops planted to prevent soil erosion), improving overall nutrient management, and pursuing alternatives to corn-based biofuels, researchers said: “It’s time to ask what’s preventing more extensive implementation of some or all of these strategies.”

6,6,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Carrots and sticks are not enough | THE Opinion - Times Higher Education (THE),https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/carrots-and-sticks-are-not-enough-indonesia,"Of all the countries in the world, Indonesia saw the quality of its research decline by the greatest amount between 2011 and 2015, according to citation analysis published in Times Higher Education in February. While the nation’s output of papers in Scopus-indexed journals grew by 137 per cent during that period, those papers’ average field-weighted citation impact – their citation counts adjusted for disciplinary norms – decreased by 15 per cent.

That huge increase in output is partly down to government policy. For many years, the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education’s regulations governing academic promotion, by which all Indonesian universities must abide, have awarded extra points for publication in international journals. Previously, these journals were defined as, among other things, being in English and having editorial boards drawn from multiple countries. Then, in 2014, the definition was tightened up to take in certain quality thresholds, such as being indexed by Scopus (the main focus) or the Web of Science, having an impact factor of at least 0.1, or being in at least the third quartile of journals in the Scimago Journal and Country Rank.

The ministry also incentivises researchers to aim high by offering direct cash bonuses for higher-quality publications. Papers published in journals with certain impact factors, and that garner a certain number of citations, can yield the researcher a reward of Rp100 million (£6,000). In 2016, more than 500 Indonesian researchers received such amounts. Several universities also provide similar incentives.

Meanwhile, in January, the ministry issued a new regulation governing the salary top-up – known as the “professional allowance” – that it provides to academics who pass its regular “faculty certification” assessment. Historically, this monthly allowance has been provided to all academics from lecturers upward, at both public and private institutions. However, the new regulation imposes additional publication criteria for associate and full professors. If they fail to meet these targets, the intention is that their allowances will be cut.

For associate professors, the threshold is a minimum of three publications in accredited national journals or one in an international journal every three years. Professors must have at least three publications accepted by international journals in the same period, or one paper accepted by a journal that scores highest in the promotion criteria mentioned above.

The regulation is aimed at further increasing Indonesian academics’ output, in the hope of developing a sound research and publication culture. Once it becomes embedded, the ministry may focus its target more closely on quality, requiring everyone to publish in international journals defined by the new, more rigorous criteria.

Despite the ministry’s recent clarification that failure to meet the new targets will see professional allowances reduced by only 25 per cent, rather than being cut entirely, the Indonesian parliament remains uneasy about the burden that the move will impose on professors in particular. It is not uncommon for some to publish no research papers at all once they achieve that rank.

Some members of parliament also point to the limited amount of research funding on offer to Indonesian researchers – particularly given the high publication fees that some international open access journals charge. This is a very serious point. The ministry offers competitive grants, but only about 15,000 were given out in 2016 – worth a total of about £80 million. As a comparison, consider that there were approximately 120,000 Indonesian academics in 2015. So, every year, one grant is given out for every 13 academics.

Nor are universities able to provide much in the way of research funding from their own coffers, so most Indonesian faculty are left to try to conduct international-standard research with no funding at all.

Parliamentarians have urged the ministry to engage in further consultation before it starts cutting allowances on the basis of the new regulation, so it is unclear when the mechanism will come into effect. A pause does seem wise. Targets and incentives, carrots and sticks are all very well, but if they are not realistically achievable, they are merely a source of angst – and, potentially, a driver of research misconduct.

7,7,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,How tranquil spaces can help people feel calm and relaxed in cities - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/how-tranquil-spaces-can-help-people-feel-calm-and-relaxed-in-cities-82358,"When you think about somewhere that is tranquil, what do you imagine? Whether it’s a wide open meadow, a deserted beach, or a river as it lazily flows along on a warm summer’s afternoon, research shows tranquillity is mainly found in natural outdoor environments.

These tend to be places where man-made noise is at a low level, but where natural sounds – such as bird song – can be relatively high. Such studies have also shown a link between these types of environments and levels of relaxation, stress reduction and even longevity and pain relief.

It’s clear then that tranquil spaces are good for your health – and yet the world’s population is becoming increasingly urban. There are more trucks, cars, and motorcycles on the roads than ever before resulting in higher levels of noise, pollution and litter. If you live in a busy city, finding tranquillity in your daily life can be a challenge.

Maximum tranquillity

To find out what actually makes somewhere tranquil, we developed the Tranquillity Rating Prediction Tool. The tool measures two factors, the level of man-made noise – usually traffic – as well as the percentage of natural and contextual features in view. This includes things like if a place has a water feature, and lots of greenery. or if a place gives you a view of a religious or historic building – all of which our research shows help to boost the tranquillity of a place.

Based on these factors, the tool can predict the tranquillity of a place on a scale of 0-10. This is based on laboratory studies where people were asked to rate video clips of a range of environments for tranquillity levels. These clips included diverse settings, from a busy market place to natural coastal locations far from any development. Using this method we can not only identify existing (and sometimes overlooked) tranquil spaces, but also offer advice on how urban areas can be made more tranquil.

Our research shows that green spaces on side roads, which are often hidden from view, tend to have high levels of tranquillity due to the screening effects of buildings from the noise of busy streets. Pedestrianised squares in towns and cities were also shown to be acceptably tranquil because of the distance from traffic – some of these squares also featured grass and trees.

Similarly, well-maintained side streets – especially with avenues of trees – or heritage buildings can also score highly due to good visual attributes combined with low traffic noise. Close proximity to water was also shown to be good for tranquillity because it is naturally nice to look at and is relaxing to listen to.

Creating tranquil spaces

To boost the tranquillity of an area, the first step is to reduce man-made noise. Obviously on a city scale this could be done by things like rerouting traffic, lorry bans and low-noise road surfacing, as well as noise barriers. But in terms of your own surroundings, anything you can do to reduce unnatural noise the better. Higher and longer fences and walls next to the road can help here. As can creating a small quiet area with perhaps a natural-sounding water feature close by.

Increasing the percentage of natural features through “greening” can also help to boost the tranquillity of an area. Introducing more trees, shrubs, or trellising to “hide” building facades, makes people feel less stressed and calmer in their surroundings – so go wild with the greenery.

Author provided

Having “natural” sounds can also help to make a place feel more tranquil. This could be done by installing a water feature or pond. This which will not only help in terms of relaxation but it will also encourage water fowl and birds.

What all this shows is that creating a refuge from the din of city life doesn’t have to be a huge task. And it is often neglected green spaces that can be re-imagined as havens of tranquillity.

So next time you’re feeling stressed out, try and find a tranquil space, or even better make one of your own – that way your can get your little bit of calm anytime you want.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/182225/original/file-20170816-32661-1u6lzxd.jpeg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['help', 'natural', 'calm', 'water', 'spaces', 'tranquillity', 'traffic', 'relaxed', 'feel', 'noise', 'shows', 'cities', 'place', 'tranquil']", ,none
8,8,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Global warming could cause yield of sorghum crops to drop 'substantially' - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/global-warming-could-cause-yield-of-sorghum-crops-to-drop-substantially/,"Sorghum is the fifth most economically important cereal in the world and is grown in some of the most arid parts of Africa and South Asia, where it is a staple food for half a billion people.

The new research finds that for every degree of warming above a 1985 to 2014 average, sorghum crop yields could drop by around 10 per cent. This suggests the hardy cereal may be more vulnerable to heat stress caused by climate change than previously thought, the authors tell Carbon Brief.

However, the indirect impacts of temperature might actually be a larger driver of future sorghum yield declines, another scientist tells Carbon Brief. It is likely that environmental factors, such as humidity, will have significant role in crop productivity, he says.

“ While I do not doubt the ultimate importance of tolerance to direct effects of high temperature, this is a consequence of “shock effects” of high temperature at specific development stages. Graeme Hammer, director of plant science, University of Queensland

Why is sorghum so hardy?

Sorghum is a tall cereal grain that is grown for food in arid parts of Africa and South Asia, and for animal fodder (and sometimes biofuel) in many developed and developing countries.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the US is the world’s largest producer of sorghum, followed by Mexico, Nigeria, Sudan and India.

Farmers started growing sorghum in north-eastern Africa around 8,000 years ago. Through thousands of years of selective breeding, the crop has evolved to be more resilient to harsh environmental conditions than other cereals, such as maize and wheat.

Sorghum is particularly hardy in dry conditions because it has large fibrous roots which can reach far down into the earth to extract water. It has also adjusted its reproductive system to withstand high temperatures.

As a result, sorghum has even been suggested as an alternative crop for wheat and maize farmers facing falling yields due to climate change.

However, the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that sorghum yields will be severely dented by rises in temperature.

The researchers find that sorghum yields will decline “substantially” at temperatures higher than 33C. Lead authors Jesse Tack and Krishna Jagadish from Kansas State University explain to Carbon Brief in a joint interview:

“We studied 30 years of sorghum production in Kansas and found that the crop is vulnerable to additional heat stress should average temperatures rise. Our results indicate that climatic change will likely produce an average yield loss of 10 per cent for each degree Celsius of warming.”

The graph below shows how exposure to temperatures causes negative changes to sorghum yield. The red line shows the results for managed field trials at 11 locations across Kansas, while the orange line shows results for data taken from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).

Growing problems

Using data from 9,000 observations collected over the course of the 11 trials and 30 years, the researchers developed a model to simulate how rises in temperature could affect sorghum yields.

The chart below shows the projected drop in yield for each degree of temperature rise above a 1985-2014 average. So, for example, 2C of warming (roughly equivalent to 2.6C above pre-industrial) could cause sorghum crop yields to drop by 17 per cent. Losses increase to 57 per cent for the highest scenario of 5C.

Warming affects the productivity of sorghum by causing heat stress at key points in its reproductive cycle, say Tack and Jagadish:

“We show that pre-flowering [when reproductive parts are developed] and post flowering stages [when seeds are produced] to be equally impacted by stress. We can do this because we observe planting and flowering dates for every single observation, another valuable aspect of our data.”

However, falling crop yields may also be impacted by temperature-dependent factors other than heat stress, says Prof Graeme Hammer, director of plant science at the University of Queensland, who was not involved in the research.

In his research, he has shown that rising temperature can have a number of indirect effects on the growth and development of cereal plants.

For example, unusually warm temperatures can affect the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) – this is the difference between the water vapour contained in the leaf’s interior and in the air surrounding it.

Hot weather causes increases in VPD (pdf), upping the rate of transpiration – the process by which plant moisture is released into the atmosphere.

In order to readjust this balance and prevent moisture escaping, a plant will close its pores. This restricts how much CO2 the plant can absorb and use to grow through photosynthesis.

Hammer believes that this indirect effect of temperature on plant growth has a larger impact on crop yield than heat stress:

“While I do not doubt the ultimate importance of tolerance to direct effects of high temperature, this is a consequence of “shock effects” of high temperature at specific development stages. The gradual effects of “heat stress” reside in consequences they bring on the dynamic of crop growth and development over the season.”

Finding a solution

Whether the impacts of temperature rise on sorghum yields are predominantly direct or indirect, the need to help farmers adapt is still there.

One solution for US farmers might be to grow sorghum in cooler environments, such as the US corn belt, researchers say.

However, similar options are not necessarily available in hotter, drier countries, such as Chad, where sorghum is a staple food for thousands of subsistence farmers.

Instead, scientists will need to hunt for new genes that promote resistance to heat extremes and incorporate them into sorghum breeding programmes, say Tack and Jagadish:

“Our particular focus was on the potential to adapt using currently available seed varieties. We find limited scope in this regard. However, breeding programmes can likely introduce new genetic material from sorghum plants existing in nature in order to boost heat resilience.”

In addition to developing new heat-resistant breeds, researchers will also have to develop new crop management strategies that address how warming affects the VPD, says Hammer:

“Some attention to adaptation of phenology (time to flowering) of cultivars [plant breeds] and adjustment of crop management (to deal with changes in water balance) would likely moderate much of the effect observed.”

9,9,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Ventilation in the poultry house makes a world of difference - Poultry World,https://www.poultryworld.net/Meat/Articles/2017/8/Ventilation-in-the-poultry-house-makes-a-world-of-difference-173187E/,"In West Java Indonesia, many broiler farmers grow their birds in traditional open poultry houses. With a constant 30ºC and high humidity the challenges are huge. Heat stress casts a shadow over the performance and profitability of small and medium size independent farms.

About 60% of the poultry meat sector in Indonesia is integrated and in the hands of large players like CP Foods and Japfa Comfeed. In modern poultry facilities with good farm managers these companies are able to compete with producers all over the world. The other 40% of broilers are produced on small and medium sized independent farms, mainly in open house systems, without too much technology involved. The Indonesian government stimulates these smaller enterprises, but a lack of knowledge, together with difficulties in financing new investments results in only a slow improvement of production results. That is the main reason why the local government, together with the Dutch department of foreign affairs started a development programme.

The houses are of the semi closed type, the side walls are made of plastic curtain material. Ventilation is mechanical, there is a pad cooling system and the whole climate is monitored by a Sommen climate computer. One house has tunnel ventilation, the other cross ventilation, to test and learn from both systems. Photo: Fabian Brockötter

The DIFS-Live project

DIFS-live stands for Dutch – Indonesian programme on Food Security in Livestock, has the goal to develop practical solutions to guarantee a safe and sustainable food production and –at the same time- make sure independent farms are able to compete with the integrated operations. The project really comes to life at a demo farm, the Modern Broiler Learning Centre (MBLC). This farm shows that with a relative low level of investments, major improvements are within reach. Challenges such as heat stress, disease pressure and management conditions can be improved, with immediate positive consequences for profitability, animal- and farm performance. Poultry World decided to have a look for itself in the town of Bandung, together with senior researcher of Wageningen University, Rick van Emous.

Challenges of poultry production in Indonesia

Raising broilers in traditional open houses has many challenges. The houses are built with materials at hand, like bamboo and some tarps, and are all naturally ventilated.

Feeding is done manually from bagged feed and in the first week the young broilers are kept warm during the night with charcoal stoves and/or gas heaters. The quality of the day-old chick isn’t optimal, the feed is of inferior quality, disease pressure is high, water has a high bacterial count and management is often suboptimal.

For the economic evaluation, calculations were made for the investment on a farm with only open housing (pictured) and on a farm with only closed housing. Photo: Rick van Emous

Up to 20% mortality

On top of that, the chicks are constantly subjected to heat stress, every day. This together leads to a mortality of up to 20%. The one proven remedy to keeping the birds alive is through the use of antibiotics. In feed antibiotics are still a standard in Indonesia. On top of that the chicks get regular extra treatments, starting immediately upon arrival, followed by a shuffle programme until a week prior to slaughter. Mr van Emous: “The inventory of the medicine cabinet tells you the whole story. This is a nightmare scenario when it comes to over-usage of antibiotics in relation to the possible negative side effects for human health and antibiotic resistance.”

Housing construction

The contrast between the traditional poultry houses and the MBLC is huge. In the rolling hills outside of the city of Bandung local project partner PT Medion has built 2 brand new houses. They used steel instead of bamboo as the main building material, constructed a 2 story system, with 2 pens per floor.

Poultry house ventilation at MBLC

With 15 chicks per square meter, the facility as a capacity of 16,000 birds. The houses are of the semi-closed type, the side walls are made of plastic curtain material. Ventilation is mechanical, there is a pad cooling system and the whole climate is monitored by a Sommen climate computer. One house has tunnel ventilation, the other cross ventilation, to test and learn from both systems. “The use of tarps for the side walls gives us the possibility to switch back to natural ventilation in case of power outages. There is a generator installed, but there is no guarantee that diesel fuel is available all the time. We experience power outages on an average of once or twice a week” said Mr van Emous.

Biosecurity

On the complex there is a lot of attention paid on biosecurity, with cleaning and disinfection zones for both personnel and vehicles. Although, it is not always easy to work within standard procedures. During catching, which can stretch over a period of more than a week, several small trucks enter the facility. Besides movement and stress for the birds, the overall cleanliness of the vehicles and crates are far from ideal.

First flock

The evaluation of the first flock of Cobb 500 birds showed that although there were some start up issues, the overall performance was good. The chicks were loaded on an average live weight of 1.97 kilogrammes on day 32, with a feed conversion of 1,50. Mortality was just 3.9%, less than could be expected with the suboptimal day-old chicks that were supplied. During the first week the chicks performed exactly according the growth curve of Cobb and from day 14 onwards they outperformed by 5-8%. At the end of the flock the birds outperformed by 6%. “They could have done even better, but we had some software issues with the climate computer and we lacked frequency modulators on the fans. In the third week of production the chicks were too cold due to a high airspeed in the house. We temporarily fixed the problem by opening the side walls some 10cm.”

Further improvement

With the experience of the first flock Mr van Emous firmly believes that a step from 15 to 18 birds per square meter is feasible. “The fact that we are able to ventilate makes a world of difference. The birds in traditional houses do suffer immensely due to heat stress, that is something we prevent. To keep birds on a farm as the MBLC, with a management philosophy which incorporates all facets of poultry keeping, I am convinced that we can produce on or above breed standards, with a 70% reduction on antibiotic usage,” he stated. The intention of the project is not to promote a closed housing system, but to offer a total package solution that leads to a more profitable poultry operation. The experiences of the MBLC will be shared in courses and training sessions with local farmers.

Trend towards closed housing

Local project partner PT Medion sees a slow but irreversible transformation taking place in the Indonesian poultry meat production sector, from traditional to more modern housing systems. Manager Yirhan Sim: “10 years ago only 10% of the poultry houses were of the closed housing type. Nowadays that is 30%. Unfortunately it isn’t easy to invest in new houses at this moment in time. Banks are reluctant to finance more than 70% of the needed investments. The other 30% the farmers have to bring in, which is problematic because currently the farms are hardly making any money. Our project will prove that a modern poultry sector is profitable.” Mr Sim continues: “We want to take our poultry farms on a journey into the future. Profitability is key, but also trends in the reduction of antibiotics usage and animal health have a role to play. These themes aren’t exclusive to poultry farmers in more developed countries.”","Sat, 19 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.poultryworld.net/Resizes/mainarticleimage/PageFiles/79/20/42079/001_970_IMG_IMG_1697-web.jpg,"['makes', 'houses', 'chicks', 'traditional', 'project', 'van', 'difference', 'birds', 'week', 'ventilation', 'world', 'poultry', 'house', 'farm']", ,none
10,10,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Problems brewing in Tugu coffee grounds - News - Jakarta Post,https://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/08/24/problems-brewing-in-tugu-coffee-grounds.html,"When the Tugu Hotel in Malang changed hands around 20 years ago, the manager suddenly died and the new owner had to take over.

“I didn’t know anything,” said Wedya Julianti.



“I had been trained as a doctor. I had to learn management very fast. It was a stressful time.”



Whizz ahead to present time and the boutique hotel is now one of the most prestigious in the East Java city.



The Tugu Group led by Wedya’s husband, Anhar Setjadibrata, has expanded into hotels in other cities and a restaurant-art gallery in Menteng, Jakarta’s Embassy Row.



Recently added to the company portfolio is a coffee plantation. History then recycled; the manager died and Wedya was again tossed into a business she knew little about.



“I questioned the people who’ve been working here for years but whose opinions were never sought,” she said.



“They were politely waiting to be told what to do though they’re experienced. They became my teachers.”



The 850-hectare estate was started in 1870 as the Babah Coffee Plantation. Now known as Kawisari, it’s in wild country west of Malang, above Wlingi and close to Mount Kawi.



This is the mysterious mountain famed as an alternative route to happiness, a weird mix of gravesites and temples, theme parks and crass commercialism. It is the Lotto Land where good fortune comes — so they say — to the pious and patient.



The location seems to have been propitious for Wedya, who claims she has the only estate in the area not making a loss. That did not come from passive prayer because the boss lady is no absentee landlord, but a hands-on innovator and inquirer.



Neighbor plantations have been abandoned or bankrupted by high costs and low returns, the bushes unfertilized, the ground untilled.



Her bleak observation was endorsed by Zaenudin, former director of the Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Center based in Jember, and now an independent consultant.

“Sadly most government-funded research goes into crops like rice and corn,” Zaenudin said.



“Yet coffee is still an important part of the economy.”



Indonesia produces just over half a billion tons of beans a year. A third is consumed in the archipelago.



Coffee in all its forms is a staple of lifestyle magazines featuring photos of designer cups topped by decorated froth, the fashion for sophisticates with time and money in abundance.



The idea is to link coffee with elites and so ramp prices, but in reality most is drunk at roadside stalls by everyday workers sipping kopi tubruk (instant coffee) in chipped glasses; the first part of the ritual isn’t debating aroma but scraping grounds off the lip. The cost is usually around Rp 5,000 (US$0.40).



Even the nation’s thirst can’t keep the industry blooming for this labor-intensive business resists mechanization — though Wedya has introduced powered string-trimmers to replace sickles for weed control.



Inventors seeking a challenge more complex than driverless cars should consider a bean harvester able to stride up and down slopes that would defy goats while carrying 35 kilograms of crop. That is largely done by skilled pickers who can feel which berries are ripe; the women’s strength and cheerful resilience has impressed Wedya, who like most urbanites had little idea of the back pains involved in getting their daily heart-jolters.

Local produce: A well maintained bush at the Kawisari plantation. (JP/Erlinawati Graham)

She is a one cup woman with no time for the heavily advertised pre-mix sachets — only 8 percent coffee in some brands — plus sugar, milk powder, “thickeners” and even salt.



Wedya no longer practices medicine. Once she worked in public neurology wards where every patient’s needs were different and watchfulness vital.



It is an approach useful in handling coffee bushes which are also susceptible to stress and disease, particularly leaf rot. The fungus attacks Arabica favored for high-end coffees so the more resistant — but less desired — Robusta has been widely planted. Now Arabica, originally from Ethiopia, is being reintroduced.



Kawisari is no place for picnickers. Though the views are a visual knockout, physical concussion is a risk along the tortuous tracks shredded by artillery barrages of rain. The old buildings are plain Dutch functional. This is a work zone selling between 800 and 1,500 tons of beans a year, depending on the weather.



Japfa, the giant Singapore-based food conglomerate is building a monster dairy farm above the plantation, beheading hills and re-shaping the topography with scores of diggers and bulldozers. Clearly the investors see future profits in white drinks, not black.

The company plans to start milking 4,000 cows in March 2018 — generating 200 tons of waste daily, much of it liquid. Wedya said the developers have assured her water quality downstream will not be affected but she still worries.

Apart from the environment and economics her main concern is management.



“Change has to come slowly,” she said.



“I now know that handling human relations is the most complicated part of business. We have to work together. If you look after your workers they’ll look after you.



“In the past the manager here was king. The staff were just told what to do; all the under managers were men,”



“I’m gradually changing that hierarchy. Now we are quietly promoting competent women and paying wages twice monthly to help with home budgeting,”



“Fortunately I like learning. I want to know so I ask. And I get told because women find it easier to talk to a woman. I’m very blessed.”","Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2017/08/24/2017_08_24_31431_1503539302._large.jpg,"['coffee', 'tugu', 'grounds', 'problems', 'tons', 'kawisari', 'told', 'manager', 'business', 'plantation', 'brewing', 'wedya', 'jperlinawati', 'know']", ,none
11,11,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Indonesian Cave Reveals Nearly 5000 Years of Tsunamis - Eos,https://eos.org/articles/indonesian-cave-reveals-nearly-5000-years-of-tsunamis,"The cave didn’t look that promising from the outside, Charlie Rubin remembers. But when the earthquake geologist and his colleagues walked in and started digging, “our jaws dropped,” he said. The researchers noticed that a depression in the floor of the cave—near Banda Aceh, Indonesia—contained distinct stratigraphy: dark layers of organic material separated by clearly defined layers of lighter-colored sand.

“We looked at each other and wondered if the sand was tsunami sand,” Rubin said. After closer examination, the team members realized they had found a natural record of tsunamis sweeping sand repeatedly into the cave over thousands of years. By radiocarbon dating the sandy layers, the researchers were able to achieve what’s often thought of as a holy grail in tsunami science: a reconstruction of when previous tsunamis occurred thousands of years in the past.

The massive waves were not regular in time: Periods of calm ranged from millennia to merely decades. Rubin and his colleagues showed that at least 11 tsunamis had swept over the region over a span of about 5,000 years. But the massive waves were not regular in time: Periods of calm ranged from millennia to merely decades. This finding—that tsunami recurrence intervals are highly variable—is proof that regional hazard mitigation plans should be based on the high likelihood of future destructive tsunamis rather than estimates of recurrence intervals, the team suggests. That’s particularly important in the Indian Ocean, a region that’s prone to megathrust earthquakes and, accordingly, large tsunamis. Those massive waves include the deadliest tsunami in history, which was unleashed in 2004 not far offshore from where the cave is located and which killed more than 200,000 people.

The geological record contained within the Banda Aceh cave is “extraordinary,” said Brian McAdoo, a tsunami scientist at Yale-NUS College in Singapore. This study also represents the first time that cave data have been used to measure tsunami recurrence intervals, McAdoo said.

A Layer Cake

In 2011 and 2012, Rubin and his colleagues excavated six trenches at the rear of the 120-meter-long coastal cave. Beneath a crust of sand topped with bat guano they dug into alternating layers of sand and organic material that reached depths of 2 meters in some places. The scientists carefully collected tiny pieces of charcoal and shells from the layers and radiocarbon dated the material in the laboratory. Using these radiocarbon measurements, the team calculated the most likely age of each of the 11 buried layers of sand and therefore the approximate date of each tsunami.

Powerful waves from the 2004 tsunami triggered by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake may have swept into the cave, literally erasing the geological record laid down after 900 BCE. The researchers found that the 11 sand layers spanned roughly 4,500 years, from about 7,400 to 2,900 years ago. However, the guano-encrusted 12th and uppermost sand layer—which contained shreds of clothing, suggesting it was deposited very recently—differed from the stack of alternating deposits beneath it: Its bottom face was jagged and irregular, unlike the smooth boundaries between the deeper layers.

The scientists suspect that this irregularity resulted from powerful waves from the 2004 tsunami triggered by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake sweeping into the cave, scraping away previously deposited material, and literally erasing the geological record laid down after 900 BCE. The older layers of sand were probably never disrupted in a similar way because they’re located in a natural depression in the cave, Rubin said. “They’re packed down and they’re protected.”

The research team reported its findings last month in Nature Communications.

Far from Constant

Rubin and his team showed that the time span between successive tsunamis is far from constant: Although 10 intervals within 4,500 years breaks down to an average of 450 years between the events, the researchers found evidence of one 2,000-year period free of tsunamis and also a single century that saw four tsunamis. “This study provides new evidence that tsunami recurrence can be highly variable,” said Katrin Monecke, a geoscientist at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass.

The researchers, who included experts in earthquake science, hypothesized that the thickness of each sand layer reflects the magnitude of the tsunami-causing earthquake because a larger earthquake would produce a larger tsunami and therefore plausibly transport more sand into the cave. According to this theory, the thickest sand layer, measuring roughly 25 centimeters, should correspond to the strongest earthquake that occurred within the nearly 5,000 years of history recorded in the cave.

“The only way to get at tsunami older than historical records is with geology.” The scientists inferred that no tsunamis occurred for more than 2,100 years after this thickest layer of sand was laid down. This extremely long interseismic gap is consistent with a period of reduced stress along faults—and therefore of a lower probability of another quake—after a massive temblor released a large amount of energy, the team suggests. Conversely, the researchers found that the four sand layers corresponding to the four tsunamis that occurred within 100 years of each other were all thin (fewer than 10 centimeters), which makes sense, they argued in their paper, because short interseismic periods are consistent with weaker earthquakes.

Rubin said he and his colleagues hope to find additional caves containing evidence of past subduction zone earthquakes. Although other complementary techniques exist for determining that tsunamis occurred in the past, for example, oral histories and chemical analysis, Rubin and his team are excited to literally dig into the past. “The only way to get at tsunami older than historical records is with geology,” Rubin said.

The “bioindicator” responds to pollution or drought-stress by changing shape, density or disappearing, allowing scientists to calculate atmospheric alterations, said Yoshitaka Oishi, associate professor at Fukui Prefectural University.

“This method is very cost effective and important for getting information about atmospheric conditions,” Oishi told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

“Mosses are a common plant in all cities so we can use this method in many countries … they have a big potential to be bioindicators,” said Oishi, who analysed nearly 50 types of moss for the study.

“ If the air pollution is severe, the purity is also evaluated by moss … the change of the moss is very diverse according to the environmental problem. Yoshitaka Oishi, associate professor, Fukui Prefectural University

Oishi said humid cities where moss thrives could benefit most from using bryophytes - a collective term for mosses, hornworts and liverworts - as bioindicators, adding moss could be monitored in its natural environment or cultivated for analysis.

In a research paper published in the Landscape and Urban Planning journal, Oishi and a colleague described how they studied the effect of nitrogen pollution, air quality and drought-stress on moss found over a 3km square (1.9 mile) area in Hachioji City in northwestern Tokyo.

The study showed severe drought-stress tended to occur in areas with high levels of nitrogen pollution, which it said raised concerns over the impact on health and biodiversity.

However, the scientists could not effectively measure air purity which affects the number of moss types as pollution levels in the sample area were not high enough, said Oishi.

“If the air pollution is severe, the purity is also evaluated by moss … the change of the moss is very diverse according to the environmental problem,” said Oishi.

Bioindicators such as mosses - which generally absorb water and nutrients from their immediate environments - were often cheaper to use than other methods of environmental evaluation, and can also reflect changes to ecosystems, said the scientists.

The World Health Organization says 88 per cent of city dwellers are exposed to annual pollution levels that exceed its air quality guidelines.

Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean have the worst air quality, followed by countries in Latin America and Africa.

“We believe this method can contribute to the evaluation of atmospheric pollution in other areas,” said Oishi.

14,14,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Middle Eastern environmental startups get on the right side of the green line - Wamda,https://www.wamda.com/2017/08/middle-eastern-environmental-startups-right-green-line,"In recent years, the tech sector around the world has come to recognize the importance, the urgent necessity even, of going green.

The Middle East is no stranger to such initiatives, with governments, business leaders, and startups adopting more environmentally friendly solutions by the day, and correspondingly switching to clean energy sources. Just last year, the region collectively tripled its renewable investments, and this past spring, the UAE launched the Middle East’s first green bond, raising over $500 million.

As desertification claims more arable land, countries in the Middle East and North Africa are increasingly likely to face water shortages. Today, nearly half of the world’s most water-stressed countries are located in MENA.

Investing in alternative solutions now is essential for the region as the rich oil reserves that have served as economic engines are dwindling, with many estimates projecting that they will run out in the next 50 or so years. To tackle these two pressing matters, green companies are both lightening their ecological footprint and generating successful new businesses that can help propel the region into the cleantech leaderboards.

Cleantech and environment startups will be a main focus during the upcoming GITEX Future Stars event this October, running from the 8th to the 12th in Dubai. The event is being held in collaboration with Wamda, applications are still open.

We’ve cobbled together a list of startups from across the Middle East that are true trailblazers when it comes to green initiatives:

Blink My Car (Lebanon): This young company circumvents water shortages by offering an on-demand car wash service that requires just one cup of water. Using its app, one can request a car wash at any location; the company then sends a staff member by bike to do the job with eco-friendly products and minimal use of water. After receiving $1.2 million in investments (largely from Phoenician Funds) at the beginning of June 2017, the startup is eyeing expansion.

Eco-dôme Maroc (Morocco): This startup relies on traditional materials to create new/old housing solutions. Using a mixture that is 90 percent earth and 10 percent cement, the company builds environmentally friendly and natural disaster-resistant domes. The thermally insulated domes are gaining traction, as they offer a cost reduction of almost 50 percent as well as decreased construction times.

Recyclobekia (Egypt): This enterprise seeks to revolutionize electronic waste disposal in its home country. Back in 2011, the startup comprised a group of Egyptian students seemingly lacking everything but motivation. Today, it provides one of the few services of its kind in the region. Depending on its partner arrangements, Recylobekia either purchases or collects e-waste for free from companies and individuals. It sells what it refurbishes locally, while the remainder is packaged and sold to recycling factories abroad.

Saphon Energy (Tunisia): This Tunisian enterprise conquers the air; it harnesses wind power. Inspired by ancient Carthaginian ships, its machine, called the Saphonian, is a bladeless wind turbine twice as efficient and half as expensive as traditional models. The Saphonian does not create noise pollution and, as it has no blades, which reduces the risk to avian wildlife posed by its competitors. Additionally, it comes in a pretty sleek design.

Taka Solutions (UAE): This company was launched by two American engineers in Dubai in late 2014, and has already made its mark. Taka Solutions retrofits Dubai’s buildings with the aim of reducing energy waste. To do so, the startup uses energy performance contract models, essentially underwriting the service it provides and then receiving as payment a portion of the savings it enables.

Zero Mass Water (Jordan): With climate change well underway, water stress has become a dire issue in the Middle East. This Jordanian startup has devised a truly inventive solution; Zero Mass Water’s solar panel extracts, condenses, and purifies water from thin air. Bolstered by grants from organizations such as USAID, Zero Mass Water is forging ahead, and its panels are bound to start popping up across the region.

15,15,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Investment in broiler houses in West Java: Makes good sense - Poultry World,https://www.poultryworld.net/Meat/Articles/2017/8/Investment-in-broiler-houses-in-West-Java-Makes-good-sense-173245E/,"Wageningen Economic Research Institute did a case study into the economics of closed versus open broiler houses in West Java. Better production performance leads to 11% lower production costs per kg final live weight, resulting in a payback period of the whole investment in a closed house of 4.5 years or less.

The traditional open house is based on a simple broiler house with a high roof, natural ventilation, manual feeding/water, open side walls and a slatted floor. The closed house has two floors with a low ceiling, mechanical tunnel ventilation, automatic feeding/water, (semi) closed side walls (with plastic curtains) and closed floors with litter.

For the economic evaluation, calculations were made for the investment on a farm with only open housing (pictured) and on a farm with only closed housing. Photo: Rick van Emous

Basic production performance data were measured at two broiler farms in West Java (Table 1). Both farms had a traditional house and a closed house for broilers. The closed houses were built in 2016. Production performance data of the open and closed houses were collected and analysed by Mr van Emous (DIFS-Live annual report 2016). On both farms, the broilers had a similar growing period in both systems. However, in the closed housing system on both farms the final live weight was higher, and feed conversion and mortality lower. Mr van Emous concluded that production results differ between the housing systems for these farms.

Investments

For the economic evaluation, calculations were made for the investment on a farm with only open housing and on a farm with only closed housing. We assume that on both farms 40.320 broilers are kept. On the farm with open housing, these broilers are kept in seven houses of eight meter wide and 80 meter long. The total ground surface area of the open house is 4.480 m2. The average density is nine broilers per m2 poultry house. The empty period is 28 days. On the farm with closed housing, the broilers are housed on 2 levels in a house of 12 meter wide and 105 meter long. The total ground surface area of the house is 1260 m2. The total surface available for the broilers is 2.520 m2, because they are kept on 2 levels. The average density is 16 broilers per m2 living area. The empty period is 28 days.

Table 2 gives the investment in the poultry houses and equipment for a farm with the open and a farm with the closed housing system. The total investment on a farm with closed housing is almost nine times higher than that on a farm with open housing. With closed housing, higher investments per m2 are needed for the electricity installation (mechanical ventilation and automatic feeding). Furthermore, the investment for equipment per m2 with closed housing is higher as a result of the higher density and a higher level of automatisation. Finally, with closed housing an extra investment is needed in a generator as a backup for a situation with a electricity power cut.

Production costs

Production costs were calculated for the farms with an open and closed broiler house assuming a price of 4,500 IDR (€0.30) per day-old chick and a feed price of 7,000 IDR (€0.47) per kg. For the open housing, the depreciation period was ten years for the house and eight years for the equipment. For the closed housing, the depreciation period was 15 years for the house and 8 years for the equipment. The total production costs per broiler houses were almost equal in both housing systems (Table 3).

For closed housing, the variable costs for feed and electricity were higher and variable costs for heating and animal health lower. Fixed costs for housing and equipment were clearly higher for closed housing. This was partly compensated by lower labour costs for the closed housing.

Although the total production costs in the two systems are quite similar per bird, the production costs per kg broiler meat produced per broiler housed are different. This is because the technical production data differs between the two systems. The amount of meat per broiler housed produced in the closed house system is higher than in the open housing system, because of a higher final live weight and a lower mortality. For the open housing, the total production per broiler housed is 1.41kg and this results in production costs of 17,190 IDR (€ 1.12) per kg final live weight. For the closed housing, the total production per broiler housed is 1.61 kg and this results in production costs of 15,276 IDR (€ 0.99) per kg final live weight. Production costs per kg final live weight are thus about 11% lower on a farm with a closed housing system compared to a farm with an open housing system. The payback period is calculated taking the total investment for the closed house divided by the annual cash flow. To estimate annual cash flow, a farm gate price of 16,000 IDR (€ 1.04) per kg live weight was used. For the basic situation the payback period is 4,5 years (Table 4).

Sensitivity analysis

Many factors influence the payback period, of which the most important are the production results, revenue prices, and costs of feed and day-old chick. Table 4 also provides an overview of the impact of changes in these factors. When production performance in the closed housing was above average (production performance of farm A), the payback period was reduced to 3.6 years. At lower than average production results (farm B), the payback period was longer: 6.1 years. Slightly lower revenue prices (from 16.000 to 15.750 IDR (€1.04 – €1.02) per kg live weight) resulted in a longer payback period of 6.0 years. A lower feed price resulted in a shorter payback period, whereas a higher price of day-old chicks in a longer payback period. It can be concluded that good production results are an important condition for a short payback period and the payback period is highly dependent on input and output prices.","Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.poultryworld.net/Resizes/mainarticleimage/PageFiles/78/20/42078/001_830_IMG_P1430886-2x3a.jpg,"['sense', 'makes', 'houses', 'housing', 'closed', 'open', 'west', 'production', 'java', 'investment', 'costs', 'period', 'payback', 'house', 'higher', 'good', 'farm', 'broiler']", ,none
16,16,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Deadly heat waves projected in the densely populated agricultural regions of South Asia - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603322,"Abstract The risk associated with any climate change impact reflects intensity of natural hazard and level of human vulnerability. Previous work has shown that a wet-bulb temperature of 35°C can be considered an upper limit on human survivability. On the basis of an ensemble of high-resolution climate change simulations, we project that extremes of wet-bulb temperature in South Asia are likely to approach and, in a few locations, exceed this critical threshold by the late 21st century under the business-as-usual scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions. The most intense hazard from extreme future heat waves is concentrated around densely populated agricultural regions of the Ganges and Indus river basins. Climate change, without mitigation, presents a serious and unique risk in South Asia, a region inhabited by about one-fifth of the global human population, due to an unprecedented combination of severe natural hazard and acute vulnerability.

INTRODUCTION The risk of human illness and mortality increases in hot and humid weather associated with heat waves. Sherwood and Huber (1) proposed the concept of a human survivability threshold based on wet-bulb temperature (TW). TW is defined as the temperature that an air parcel would attain if cooled at constant pressure by evaporating water within it until saturation. It is a combined measure of temperature [that is, dry-bulb temperature (T)] and humidity (Q) that is always less than or equal to T. High values of TW imply hot and humid conditions and vice versa. The increase in TW reduces the differential between human body skin temperature and the inner temperature of the human body, which reduces the human body’s ability to cool itself (2). Because normal human body temperature is maintained within a very narrow limit of ±1°C (3), disruption of the body’s ability to regulate temperature can immediately impair physical and cognitive functions (4). If ambient air TW exceeds 35°C (typical human body skin temperature under warm conditions), metabolic heat can no longer be dissipated. Human exposure to TW of around 35°C for even a few hours will result in death even for the fittest of humans under shaded, well-ventilated conditions (1). While TW well below 35°C can pose dangerous conditions for most humans, 35°C can be considered an upper limit on human survivability in a natural (not air-conditioned) environment. Here, we consider maximum daily TW values averaged over a 6-hour window (TW max ), which is considered the maximum duration fit humans can survive at 35°C.

HISTORICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MAXIMUM WET-BULB TEMPERATURE According to the global historical reanalysis for modern record (1979–2015) (5), the largest TW max rarely exceeds 31°C in the current climate. However, three extensive regions, where values exceed 28°C, are observed: southwest Asia around the Persian/Arabian Gulf and Red Sea, South Asia in the Indus and Ganges river valleys, and eastern China (Fig. 1). To identify the precise reasons for high TW, individual studies need to be performed because of each region’s unique geography and climate. The underlying reasons why southwest Asia stands out are discussed by Pal and Eltahir (6), who concluded that future TW max around the Persian/Arabian Gulf region is likely to exceed the TW threshold for human survivability by the end of the century under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. In summer 2015, TW in the Bandar Mahshahr, Iran Persian/Arabian Gulf, reached nearly 35°C, suggesting that the threshold may be breached sooner than projected (7). In this study, we shift our attention to the region of South Asia, here defined as Pakistan, Nepal, India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The northern part of this region is the second hottest after southwest Asia but is more expansive when considering the land area affected. Fig. 1 Spatial distribution of highest daily maximum wet-bulb temperature, TW max (°C), in modern record (1979–2015). Global distribution of TW max is computed using ERA-Interim 3-hourly data with 0.75° × 0.75° horizontal resolution. The enlarged domain highlights three distinguishable regions with higher TW max : southwest Asia around the Persian/Arabian Gulf and Red Sea, South Asia in the Indus and Ganges river valleys, and eastern China. TW max values below 27°C are not shown. Heat waves and their impacts on human health are combined consequences of high dry-bulb temperatures and humidity (that is, high TW) and the vulnerability of the population. Many previous studies have investigated the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on heat waves and human health (8, 9). However, it is not until more recently that the combined effects of temperature and humidity have been more commonly considered. For example, the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (10) when making projections about future heat waves only considers T. However, the latest IPCC report (11) does consider the combined effects of T and Q when considering working conditions, which are projected to worsen considerably in many regions (12, 13). In addition, studies that include the combined effects at a global scale are largely based on output from climate models with resolutions on the order of 100 to 200 km (1, 14). Studies that are based on higher-resolution simulations are generally focused on North America and Europe (15, 16). However, the most detrimental human impacts of climate change on heat waves could potentially be those in developing nations because of the vulnerability of their populations. In much of India and Pakistan, an apparent rising trend in the frequency of deadly heat waves has been observed (17–19). For example, severe heat waves resulting in thousands of deaths to humans and livestock were reported around Odisha (eastern India) in 1998, Andhra Pradesh in 2003, and Ahmadabad and other parts of Gujarat (western India) in 2010 (20). In particular, the fifth deadliest heat wave in recorded history (21) affected large parts of India and Pakistan, claiming around 3500 lives in 2015 (22). We note that the large positive departure of maximum temperature from the climatology during the heat wave periods largely coincides with the areas (particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha) where TW is projected to approach or exceed the survivability threshold under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario (see Fig. 2) (23).

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE To study the potential impacts of climate change on human health due to extreme TW in South Asia, we apply the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Regional Climate Model (MRCM) (24) forced at the lateral and sea surface boundaries by output from three simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) coupled Atmosphere-Ocean Global Climate Model (AOGCM) experiments (25). By conducting high-resolution simulations, we include detailed representations of topography and coastlines as well as detailed physical processes related to the land surface and atmospheric physics, which are lacking in coarser-resolution AOGCM simulations (26). On the basis of our comparison of MRCM simulations driven by three AOGCMs for the historical period 1976–2005 (HIST) against reanalysis and in situ observational data, MRCM shows reasonable performance in capturing the climatological and geographical features of mean and extreme TW over South Asia. Furthermore, the mean biases of MRCM simulations are statistically corrected at the daily time scale to enhance the reliability of future projections (see Materials and Methods). We project the potential impacts of future climate change toward the end of century (2071–2100), assuming two GHG concentration scenarios based on the RCP trajectories (27): RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. RCP8.5 represents a BAU scenario resulting in a global CMIP5 ensemble average surface temperature increase of approximately 4.5°C. RCP4.5 includes moderate mitigation resulting in approximately 2.25°C average warming, slightly higher than what has been pledged by the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP21). On the basis of the simulation results, TW max is projected to exceed the survivability threshold at a few locations in the Chota Nagpur Plateau, northeastern India, and Bangladesh and projected to approach the 35°C threshold under the RCP8.5 scenario by the end of the century over most of South Asia, including the Ganges river valley, northeastern India, Bangladesh, the eastern coast of India, Chota Nagpur Plateau, northern Sri Lanka, and the Indus valley of Pakistan (Fig. 2). Under the RCP4.5 scenario, no regions are projected to exceed 35°C; however, vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience episodes exceeding 31°C, which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans (see the Supplementary Materials). Less severe conditions, in general, are projected for the Deccan Plateau in India, the Himalayas, and western mountain ranges in Pakistan. Many urban population centers in South Asia are projected to experience heat waves characterized by TW max well beyond 31°C under RCP8.5 (Fig. 2). For example, in Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) and Patna (Bihar), which have respective current metro populations of 2.9 and 2.2 million, TW reaches and exceeds the survivability threshold. In most locations, the 25-year annual TW max event in the present climate, for instance, is projected to become approximately an every year occurrence under RCP8.5 and a 2-year event under RCP4.5 (Fig. 2 and fig. S1). In addition to the increase in TW max under global warming, the urban heat island effect may increase the risk level of extreme heat, measured in terms of temperature, for high-density urban population exposure to poor living conditions. However, Shastri et al. (28) found that urban heat island intensity over many Indian urban centers is lower than in non-urban regions along the urban boundary during daytime in the pre-monsoon summer because of the relatively low vegetation cover in non-urban areas.

VULNERABILITY The geographical locations of the most extreme projected heat waves in the Indus and Ganges river valleys coincide largely with locations of highly vulnerable human populations in terms of population density, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and agricultural intensity (Fig. 3). Agricultural workers in these regions spend significant time working outdoors during the seasons with the highest TW (boreal spring, summer, and autumn; fig. S2). Under RCP8.5, a small fraction of the South Asian population (~4%) is projected to experience TW max exceeding 35°C by 2100. However, approximately 75% of the population is projected to experience TW max exceeding 31°C, considered dangerous levels for most humans (6), compared to 15% in the current climate and 55% under RCP4.5 (Fig. 3). Similarly, the fractional population exposed to the median daily maximum TW max of 31°C is projected to increase from essentially zero in the present day to ~30% under RCP8.5 and only 2% under RCP4.5. In terms of fractional agricultural area affected, the numbers are similar to those of fractional population because most of the populations in these regions live in rural areas. The difference between the projections for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 suggests that the region stands to benefit from significant mitigation efforts, such as those pledged by COP21. Fig. 3 Vulnerability due to population density, poverty, and outdoor working conditions. (A to C) Maps of population density in people/km2 (A), GDP in U.S. dollars per capita (B), and agricultural land fraction (C). (D to F) Population fraction exposed at least once in the simulations to TW max (D) and exposed to median of annual maxima of TW max (E), and agricultural land fraction (crop and pasture) exposed at least once in the simulations to TW max (F). Blue, green, and red lines represent the HIST (1976–2005), RCP4.5 (2071–2100), and RCP8.5 (2071–2100) scenarios, respectively. Data for 2000 population density (43), 2014 GDP (Indian Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation), and 2000 agricultural intensity (44) are regridded onto the MRCM grid. To examine the robustness of our estimates of the characteristics of heat stress, we also investigate the frequency and intensity of severe heat waves based on the criteria used by the India Meteorological Department, which do not consider the effects of humidity (figs. S3 and S4). Heat waves characterized by solely maximum temperatures are projected to significantly increase in both frequency and intensity, with maximum severity in northwest India and the desert region of Pakistan. Combining our analysis based on TW max and severe heat wave defined by T max , we find that a sizable part of the Indian subcontinent is likely to experience more frequent and intensified heat waves and associated physical stress during the extended period covering the pre-monsoon to monsoon seasons.

POTENTIAL MECHANISMS The fertile valleys of the Indus and the Ganges, where human population is currently in the hundreds of millions, will likely experience some of the most severe projected hazard from heat waves. Three independent mechanisms are offered to explain this projection. First, the monsoon system transports warm and humid air masses into the Indus and Ganges valleys from the surrounding warm Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. Second, surface elevations in these valleys are generally lower than 100 m above sea level, and hence, surface air is generally warmer than surrounding higher-elevation areas. Third, much of the valleys are irrigated, which tends to enhance TW over irrigated areas because of modifications in the surface energy balance (29). These three factors add together to favor higher TW conditions in the valleys compared to the surrounding regions. Furthermore, large-scale modes of climate variability indirectly affect the characteristics of heat waves through teleconnections. The possible linkage between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and heat wave variability has been previously investigated (30). El Niño delays the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon, which, in turn, induces more severe and longer-lasting heat waves in India. Furthermore, most years with abnormal heat waves in terms of intensity and spatial extent correspond to a year following an El Niño event (31, 32). We note that the regions identified with severe heat waves associated with El Niño coincide with the locations of higher TW in our analysis.

RAMIFICATIONS Studies of detection and attribution of recent climate change have found compelling evidence of human influence on regional heat waves (33), surface specific humidity (34), and temperature- and moisture-related heat stress (35). These detection/attribution results lend further credibility to the projected late 21st century increases in the frequency and magnitude of heat extremes and related heat stress due to anthropogenic GHGs, which will likely impose significant risk and negative impact on human health (11). In this regard, our findings have significant implications to the ongoing considerations regarding climate change policy. In the absence of serious mitigation, some of the most severe hazards associated with climate change will fall on some of the most vulnerable populations. In poorer regions, such as South Asia, air conditioning is not currently available as a safe haven to most of the population, increasing the risk of illness and death related to extreme heat conditions. This disparity raises important environmental justice questions beyond the scope of this study. At the regional scale, India’s GHG emissions have been increasing rapidly in recent decades because of rapid economic and population growth and high dependence on coal used for energy generation. Despite their relatively low GHG per capita emissions, India (and more so China) is responsible for much of the recent rise in global emissions. The findings from this study may present a significant dilemma for India because the continuation of this current trajectory of rising emissions will likely impose significant added human health risks to some of its most vulnerable populations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Experimental design To investigate the future changes in TW in response to anthropogenic GHG forcing over South Asia, we produced high-resolution regional projections using the MRCM (24). MRCM is based on the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics Regional Climate Model Version 3 (RegCM3) (36) but with several important improvements (26). In particular, the irrigation module implemented within the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) land surface scheme takes into account the impact of large-scale irrigation practiced in the agricultural sector in South Asia (fig. S5). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the irrigation module of MRCM is suited for climate simulations representing how irrigation enhances evapotranspiration and affects the surface energy balance (29, 37). The simulation domain covers the entire Indian subcontinent and adjacent Indian Ocean, including the five targeted countries of this study: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It is centered at 79°E and 20.5°N with a 25-km grid spacing on a Lambert conformal projection. The 25-km grid spacing is fine enough to represent the general geographical setting. In particular, it reasonably captures the complex topography characterized by the sharp gradient of the Himalaya between the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Tibetan Plateau (fig. S5), which is a key factor in accurately simulating the South Asian monsoon and hence TW. The surface and lateral boundary conditions used to force MRCM were taken from three AOGCMs participating in CMIP5 (25): Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) (38), Max-Planck-Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) (39), and Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS) (table S1) (40). The AOGCM horizontal resolution ranges from approximately 100 to 200 km for the atmosphere and 30 to 100 km for the ocean. The AOGCMs were selected based on a rigorous evaluation of performance in simulating T and TW over South Asia. More specifically, the bias and root mean square error of the seasonal mean climatology and the probability density function of daily time scale data were compared with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data (5). For each selected AOGCM, the present-day climate is represented with historical GHG concentrations for the period 1975–2005 (HIST), whereas future climate is projected under the RCP trajectories (27) for the period 2070–2100. To quantify the effect of a range of GHG concentrations, two different RCP scenarios, namely, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, were adopted. RCP8.5 is a rising concentration pathway leading to 8.5 W m−2 of radiative forcing by 2100 and can be considered a BAU scenario. RCP4.5 is a stabilization scenario after about 2060, leading to 4.5 W m−2 of radiative forcing by 2100. It represents moderate mitigation effort. In summary, South Asian regional climate was simulated using MRCM forced by three AOGCMs under three GHG concentration scenarios for a total of nine 31-year simulations. The first year of each simulation was excluded as a spin-up period, and the analysis was performed based on the remaining 30 years of simulation. Extreme TW and T computations with bias correction For impact studies, it is often desirable to bias correct climate model simulation results by assuming that the bias in the historical simulation remains constant in the future projections (41). Doing so reduces the likelihood that impact assessments are biased by model deficiencies. Here, we applied the same methodology for bias correction of simulated TW developed by Pal and Eltahir (6) for the climate change projections in southwest Asia. TW is computed by the formulation developed by Davies-Jones (42) using instantaneous values surface temperature, humidity, and pressure. Because TW does not consider the variation of solar radiation assuming moderately high radiation, it neglects the effects of direct sunlight on heat stress. It can result in a slight overestimation of heat stress in cloudy days or during nighttime but underestimation during periods of full sun (14). The ERA-Interim reanalysis data are considered the best available combined spatial and temporal representation of observations for the region and are therefore used for the following bias correction procedure: (i) The maximum 6-hour average TW and T for each day are computed for both the MRCM hourly output and the ERA-Interim reanalysis 3-hourly 0.75° × 0.75° data, denoted by TW max and T max , respectively. (ii) The ERA-Interim TW max and T max data are interpolated from the 0.75° × 0.75° horizontal grid to the 25-km MRCM grid. (iii) Consistent MRCM and ERA-Interim climatologies of TW max and T max are computed for each day of the year on the MRCM 25-km grid. (iv) The magnitude of the bias for each day of the year is estimated by the difference between 30-day running means of the two climatologies. (v) The daily bias is then applied to the MRCM daily values of TW max and T max for the present-day and future climates. The corrections for T max are on the order of 1° to 2°C, which is in line with the mean TW bias (fig. S6). The adjusted values were, in turn, used to compute annual TW max and T max maxima and TW max and T max histograms at each grid point. To describe the statistical likelihood of extreme TW max and T max occurrence, we also computed the return period using an empirical Weibull ranking. By comparing the levels of TW max and T max corresponding to the same return period, we were able to project the future changes in the intensity and frequency of TW max and T max with respect to the present climate. The comparison between the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios is meaningful for addressing the potential impact of mitigating GHG emissions.

17,17,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Water polo: End of 'the streak'? Not on their watch - The Straits Times,https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/not-on-their-watch,"Put the national men's water polo team and the SEA Games in the same conversation and one would be hard-pressed to avoid mentioning ""the streak"". It will be on the minds and shoulders of the team the moment they walk into Kuala Lumpur's National Aquatic Centre on Aug 16 for their first match of the 29th SEA Games.

""The streak"" refers to Singapore's record of winning men's water polo gold at every Games since 1965 (then known as the Seap - South-east Asian Peninsular - Games). It can also include wins in all their round-robin matches at the biennial event.

A 52-year legacy, proudly built over 26 Games editions. No wonder goalkeeper Lee Kai Yang says: ""Everyone in the team knows about the streak and wants to be a part of it.""

The 22-year-old added: ""The most important thing about the streak is that no single person or team can call ownership to that streak, so it's something that is bigger than any individual.""

But ask the players whether they feel the pressure of maintaining this legacy, and the answers vary.

Left-driver Koh Jian Ying, the most experienced member of this year's squad, having featured in the past three editions, said: ""I think (outsiders believe) we have more pressure than we actually do.","Mon, 14 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/media-brightcove/5538402179001.jpg,"['sea', 'pressure', 'national', 'water', 'games', 'watch', 'team', 'mens', 'end', 'streak', 'legacy', 'polo']", ,none

19,19,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Carryover effects of larval exposure to different environmental bacteria drive adult trait variation in a mosquito vector - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700585,"Conditions experienced during larval development of holometabolous insects can affect adult traits, but whether differences in the bacterial communities of larval development sites contribute to variation in the ability of insect vectors to transmit human pathogens is unknown. We addressed this question in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a major arbovirus vector breeding in both sylvatic and domestic habitats in Sub-Saharan Africa. Targeted metagenomics revealed differing bacterial communities in the water of natural breeding sites in Gabon. Experimental exposure to different native bacterial isolates during larval development resulted in significant differences in pupation rate and adult body size but not life span. Larval exposure to an Enterobacteriaceae isolate resulted in decreased antibacterial activity in adult hemolymph and reduced dengue virus dissemination titer. Together, these data provide the proof of concept that larval exposure to different bacteria can drive variation in adult traits underlying vectorial capacity. Our study establishes a functional link between larval ecology, environmental microbes, and adult phenotypic variation in a holometabolous insect vector.

First, we characterized the differences in the bacterial community composition between domestic and sylvatic A. aegypti larval development sites in Gabon and in the midguts of A. aegypti emerging from these sites. This initial description was used to justify our hypothesis that these differences may be functionally relevant at the adult stage. Second, we measured the variation in several adult traits related to vectorial capacity using gnotobiotic larvae (that is, sterile larvae subsequently exposed to a single bacterial isolate) made with native bacterial isolates from the same breeding sites in Gabon. In contrast with previous studies on bacteria-mosquito interactions that focused on the effect of a single bacterial isolate at the adult stage, our primary interest was to determine whether different bacteria-mosquito interactions at the larval stage could explain natural variation in adult traits. Dissecting the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in natural phenotypic variation is central to understand the evolutionary potential and mechanistic basis of a trait. Our study provides the proof of concept that exposure to different bacterial isolates during larval development results in variation in pupation rate and several adult phenotypes such as life-history traits and antimicrobial phenotypes.

Because the mosquito gut microbiota composition is dynamic and susceptible to environmental changes ( 20 , 34 – 36 ), we hypothesized that habitat-related differences in bacterial communities in larval development sites could mediate environmental variation in vector-borne pathogen transmission. We addressed this question in the mosquito Aedes aegypti, an important worldwide vector of medically significant arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. In Sub-Saharan Africa, A. aegypti exist in the form of two ecotypes: a “sylvatic” ecotype of A. aegypti found in forested habitats, ecologically similar to the ancestral form of the species, and a human-adapted “domestic” ecotype that thrives in urbanized environments ( 37 , 38 ). Whereas domestic A. aegypti larvae develop in artificial containers (cans, tires, jars, and flower pots) within or in close proximity to human habitation, the larvae of the sylvatic ecotype are typically found in natural breeding sites (rock pools, tree holes, and fruit husks).

Host-associated microbes, collectively known as the host microbiota, have manifold effects on host biology. Like other animals, insects establish symbiotic relationships with microbial communities that shape their physiological functions ( 20 , 21 ). In recent years, it has become clear that the symbiotic microbiota of insect vectors play an important role in their vectorial capacity ( 20 , 22 ). The native bacterial microbiota of mosquitoes can modulate their immune response and vector competence for human pathogens ( 23 – 26 ). The relationship between mosquitoes and the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia has been well documented, but the interactions between mosquitoes and their gut bacterial microbiota have not been described in such depth. Furthermore, our current understanding of how bacteria–insect vector interactions affect pathogen transmission is limited to adults. Little is known about whether the bacterial microbiota of larvae affect adult traits related to pathogen transmission. Our knowledge of bacterial communities in larval sites and between life stages is mainly descriptive ( 27 – 30 ), although it was recently shown that mosquito larvae rely on bacteria to develop ( 31 – 33 ).

For many holometabolous insects (that is, with complete metamorphosis), the ecological niche of larval stages differs greatly from that of adults. For example, mosquito larvae develop in aquatic habitats, whereas the adults live in terrestrial habitats. Holometabolism allows larvae and adults of the same species to exploit different resources and avoid intraspecific competition ( 1 ). However, larval and adult stages of holometabolous insects are not independent from each other, because the biotic and abiotic larval environment can influence adult life-history traits ( 2 , 3 ). In mosquito vectors of human pathogens, for example, it has been well documented that conditions such as temperature ( 4 – 7 ), diet ( 8 – 11 ), competition ( 12 – 15 ), soil substrate ( 16 , 17 ), and predator exposure ( 18 ) experienced during larval development can carry over and affect adult traits related to vectorial capacity. Vectorial capacity is a measure of vector-borne pathogen transmission potential that encapsulates the dynamics of vector-pathogen and vector-vertebrate host interactions ( 19 ), including vector life span and vector competence (that is, the intrinsic ability to acquire and subsequently transmit a pathogen).

Next, we examined whether the effect of Esp_ivi exposure during larval development only affected adult antibacterial immunity or was also involved in carryover effects on susceptibility to virus infection at the adult stage. We measured the variation in susceptibility to dengue virus (serotype 1) in adult A. aegypti females who had been exposed to different bacterial isolates during larval development. In two separate experiments, we measured the proportion of mosquitoes that became infected, the proportion of infected mosquitoes that developed a disseminated (that is, systemic) dengue virus infection, and the infectious titer of disseminated dengue virus in the head tissues 14 days after an infectious blood meal. Infection prevalence could be analyzed only in the first experiment because 94.5% of mosquitoes became infected in the second experiment. In the first experiment, 63.2% of mosquitoes were infected overall, and infection prevalence was not significantly affected by the gnotobiotic treatment (P = 0.3256; fig. S4). For the same reason as above, we only analyzed the dissemination prevalence in the second experiment because 95.8% of infected mosquitoes had a disseminated infection in the first experiment. Differences in infection and dissemination rates were the result of different infectious doses used in the two experiments (see Materials and Methods for details). In the second experiment, 70.2% of mosquitoes had a disseminated infection overall, and dissemination prevalence was not significantly affected by the gnotobiotic treatment (P = 0.8579; fig. S4). Among mosquitoes with a disseminated virus infection, we found modest but statistically significant differences in the infectious titer measured in the head tissues of adults exposed to the Esp_ivi and Ssp_ivi isolates as larvae ( Table 1 ). Specifically, females exposed to the Esp_ivi isolate during larval development had fewer viral particles in the head than those exposed to Ssp_ivi ( Fig. 5B ). Lack of a significant experiment-by-isolate interaction with regard to virus titer indicated that the effect of the isolate on virus titer was consistent across both experiments ( Table 1 ).

Bars show the percentage of individual adult mosquitoes whose hemolymph was able to inhibit M. luteus growth on an agar plate in two replicate experiments of 10 females each. Vertical bars indicate 95% confidence intervals of the percentages. Statistical significance of pairwise differences was determined with a χ 2 test. ( B ) Infectious titer of dengue virus disseminated to the head tissues. The boxplot represents the concentration of infectious dengue virus particles expressed as the log 10 -transformed number of focus-forming units (FFU) in the head of adult females 14 days after oral exposure. Statistical significance of pairwise differences was determined with a t test. Prevalence of midgut infection and systemic viral dissemination in both experiments is shown in fig. S4. Letters above the graphs indicate statistical significance in which treatments with a letter in common are not significantly different from each other.

To determine whether exposure to different bacterial isolates during larval development results in variation in susceptibility to microbes as adults, we measured the antibacterial activity of the hemolymph and the susceptibility to dengue virus of adult females emerging from gnotobiotic larvae. In mosquitoes, the hemolymph displays a strong immune response and is involved in immune priming and immune memory ( 39 – 41 ). To test for differences in the immune system of adult A. aegypti that had been exposed to different bacteria during larval development, we measured the antibacterial activity of the hemolymph based on its ability to clear Micrococcus luteus on an agar plate (see Materials and Methods for details), as previously described ( 42 , 43 ). In individual mosquitoes whose hemolymph resulted in detectable clearance of M. luteus, there was no significant difference (P = 0.207) in the intensity of M. luteus clearance among the three gnotobiotic treatments. However, there was a significant difference (P = 0.025) in the proportion of individuals whose hemolymph demonstrated detectable M. luteus clearance. Hemolymph collected from adult females who had been exposed to the Esp_ivi isolate as larvae showed significantly fewer individuals who were able to clear M. luteus ( Fig. 5A and Table 1 ).

Wing length was compared with an analysis of variance. The proportion of hemolymph extracts with detectable antibacterial activity were analyzed with a logistic regression and analysis of deviance. FFU counts in head tissues were log 10 -transformed and compared with an analysis of variance. With the exception of wing length, the model includes the effect of the isolate (Ssp_ivi, Esp_ivi, Rsp_ivi, and nonaxenic), the experiment (two repetitions), and their interaction. Df, degrees of freedom; LR, likelihood ratio. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

To assess the fitness of adult mosquitoes after being exposed to different bacterial isolates during larval development, we measured their life span and wing length (a proxy for body size). The life span of adult females did not significantly differ (P = 0.593) between gnotobiotic treatments ( Fig. 4B ), but there were significant differences (P = 8.6 × 10 −6 ) in their wing length ( Fig. 4C and Table 1 ). The larvae that were exposed to the Ssp_ivi isolate grew into adults with the largest wings, the Esp_ivi and nonaxenic treatments resulted in the smallest wing length, and the Rsp_ivi treatment resulted in an intermediate wing length.

( A ) Pupation rate was determined by counting the number of pupae each day in three replicate flasks of gnotobiotic and nonaxenic larvae in three independent experiments. Axenic larvae (gray line) were included as negative controls. Statistical significance of pairwise differences in pupation rate between treatments was determined by using a three-parameter model to compare the slope of the exponential phase and the day when 50% of larvae pupated. Statistical significance for each pairwise comparison is indicated by a star in the inset table. The shaded ribbon around each curve represents SEM. ( B ) Adult female life span was determined by counting the number of dead females in triplicate cages. No statistical difference in life span was detected between the different treatments (P = 0.54). ( C ) Boxplots represent the wing length of adult females from different gnotobiotic treatments. Statistical significance of pairwise differences between treatments was determined by t test. Letters above the graph indicate statistical significance in which treatments with a letter in common are not significantly different from each other.

To assess the functional relevance of differences in bacterial communities in larval development sites, we generated gnotobiotic A. aegypti larvae by exposing axenic (that is, bacteria-free) larvae to a single bacterial isolate during their development ( Fig. 1 ; see Materials and Methods for details). We collected 168 bacterial isolates from the same larval development sites in Gabon in which we collected water for 16S targeted metagenomics. Of the 168 bacterial isolates, three were arbitrarily chosen for functional assays based on genetic dissimilarity, differences in the pupation rate of gnotobiotic larvae, and differences in the identity and proportion of midgut bacteria in adults emerging from gnotobiotic larvae (see Materials and Methods for complete description of the isolate screen). Two of the three isolates were isolated from domestic breeding sites, and on the basis of their full-length 16S sequence, they were assigned to Salmonella (Ssp_ivi) and Rhizobium (Rsp_ivi) genera. The third isolate (Esp_ivi) was isolated from a sylvatic breeding site and belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family; however, classification at the genus level was inconsistent among databases (alternatively Salmonella, Escherichia, or Shigella). In the 16S data set, the Enterobacteriaceae and Rhizobium taxonomical groups were present in both domestic and sylvatic breeding sites, whereas the Salmonella taxonomical group was only found in domestic breeding sites. Note that the isolates were not chosen to reflect the dominant taxa identified by the targeted metagenomics approach. To minimize the potential confounding effects of specific interactions between mosquito genotypes and sympatric bacterial isolates, gnotobiotic mosquitoes were created using a wild-type mosquito genetic background from Thailand. We measured pupation rates in gnotobiotic larvae to determine whether the interaction with different bacteria present in the water alters larval development. As previously reported ( 31 , 32 ), when larvae were maintained as axenic, the larvae did not develop past the first instar stage ( Fig. 4A ). To assess the differences in the pupation rate of the different gnotobiotic treatments, we compared the growth rate (that is, slope of the exponential phase) and the time it took for 50% of the larvae to pupate using a three-parameter model of pupation dynamics ( Fig. 4A ). The nonaxenic larvae had a significantly faster growth rate than the gnotobiotic larvae, but no significant differences in growth rate were observed among the gnotobiotic larvae (file S3). This is in contrast to the initial screen of bacterial isolates, which is likely a result of greater statistical power in this data set; the initial screen consisted of three replicate flasks of larvae per treatment, whereas this data set included three replicate flasks per treatment from three independent experiments. Although the larval growth rate during the exponential phase was similar among gnotobiotic treatments, the time it took to reach 50% pupation significantly differed among treatments (file S3). The lag phase was shorter for larvae exposed to the Ssp_ivi isolate than for those exposed to the Esp_ivi or Rsp_ivi isolate, whereas there was no difference between larvae exposed to the Esp_ivi or Rsp_ivi isolate ( Fig. 4A ). The pupation rate at day 5, 9, or 12 of larval development was not dependent on the amount of bacteria in the flask on the corresponding day, nor was the pupation rate at day 9 dependent on the amount of bacteria inoculated into individual flasks upon egg hatching (file S4).

Structure of bacterial communities was determined by deep sequencing the V5-V6 region of the bacterial 16S gene among individual samples and sample types, including domestic and sylvatic water samples, domestic and sylvatic midguts, and midguts dissected following emergence and collected by HLC. Bacterial community structure is represented by ( A ) nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index based on OTU abundance and ( B ) heat map of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index based on k-mer presence/absence and hierarchical clustering. In the NMDS plot, Spearman correlation (ρ) and stress values are indicated. The normalized OTU count table used to perform the NMDS analysis is provided in file S8. In the heat map, samples are labeled according to their type (M, midgut; W, water) and habitat of origin (sylvatic or domestic). Midguts dissected following emergence are labeled to match the corresponding water sample (for example, midgut a1 was dissected from a mosquito that emerged from water sample a). Midguts from the same breeding site are marked with matching symbols. Red color indicates high similarity, and green color indicates low similarity.

To determine whether the structure of bacterial communities differed between sample type and habitat, we used two different, complementary approaches (see Materials and Methods for details). In the first approach, a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was generated on the basis of OTU abundance and analyzed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling ( Fig. 3A ). In the second approach, a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix was generated on the basis of k-mer presence/absence and analyzed by hierarchical clustering ( Fig. 3B ). Regardless of the approach, the structure of bacterial communities markedly differed (P = 0.001) between water and midgut samples ( Fig. 3 ). In addition, the structure of bacterial communities was distinct between domestic and sylvatic larval habitats ( Fig. 3 ). Analyses of β diversity based on OTU counts confirmed that bacterial communities significantly differed between combinations of habitat and sample type (P = 0.005). Lack of significant dispersion effects within habitat (P = 0.372) and sample (P = 0.652) types confirmed the validity of the statistical model. Without replicate water samples from the same larval breeding site, the degree of within-habitat heterogeneity could not be accurately quantified. However, one of the domestic water samples clustered with sylvatic water samples, pointing to some degree of heterogeneity among domestic sites ( Fig. 3B ). As noted above, because of the small sample sizes, these analyses were likely underpowered to draw any conclusions about the differences between the midguts from freshly emerged adults and those from HLC adults.

This limited overlap between midgut and water samples was not simply due to differences in rare OTUs. Among the 100 most abundant OTUs, six OTUs that were abundant in midgut samples were undetected in the water they emerged from (fig. S3). Reciprocally, most of the OTUs that were abundant in water samples were not found in the midguts of adult emerging from them (fig. S3). The midguts from freshly emerged adults harbored a larger number of unique OTUs and, therefore, a larger number of OTUs overall, compared to those from HLC adults ( Fig. 2 , A and B). Approximately a third of the OTUs identified in the midguts following emergence were shared between domestic and sylvatic habitats ( Fig. 2C ). While more than half of the OTUs found in sylvatic water sites were unique to this habitat, a majority of OTUs found in domestic water sites overlapped with OTUs found in sylvatic water sites ( Fig. 2D ). Among the OTUs that were shared between sample types, the abundance of 137, 2, 495, and 291 OTUs differed significantly (Wald test) between domestic and sylvatic water samples, domestic and sylvatic midguts, sylvatic midguts and water samples, and domestic midguts and water samples, respectively (file S2).

OTU richness was higher in the water samples than in the midgut samples, and it was higher in sylvatic water samples than in the domestic water samples (fig. S1A and file S1). Despite differences in the total number of distinct OTUs between sample type and habitat, there was no significant difference in the Shannon diversity index (fig. S1B and file S1). Note that because of the small sample sizes, the analyses of bacterial diversity were likely underpowered to draw any conclusions about the differences between the midguts from freshly emerged adults and those from HLC adults. Plotting the overlap of OTUs between sample types revealed that although some bacterial community members were shared, a large proportion was unique to each sample type ( Fig. 2 and fig. S2). Within both the domestic and sylvatic habitats, there was only partial overlap between bacterial communities found in the midguts dissected following adult emergence, the midguts of HLC adults exposed to the natural environment, and water of larval development sites ( Fig. 2 , A and B). Notably, 28 OTUs (51%) found in the midguts from both freshly emerged and HLC adults were undetectable in the corresponding water samples.

( A ) Water and A. aegypti pupae (for later midgut dissection from emerging adults) were collected from sylvatic larval sites in gallery forests along the rivers and streams of Lopé National Park in Gabon and from domestic larval sites in a nearby village. ( B ) At domestic sites (lower pictures), samples were collected from artificial containers such as discarded plastic containers, tires, and metal tins. At sylvatic sites, samples were collected from rock pools (upper picture). ( C ) At each collection site, both water and pupae were collected into a sterile tube using a sterile pipette. The samples were brought back to the field station, and an aliquot of water was removed next to a Bunsen burner flame and frozen until processing. Back in the laboratory, the water samples were thawed and centrifuged, and the bacteria pellet was resuspended in sterile water and spotted on Whatman FTA cards for later DNA extraction. The pupae were held in the same collection tube until adults emerged. Midguts from adults were dissected within 12 hours of emergence next to a Bunsen burner flame and preserved for later DNA extraction. Midguts were also dissected from wild adult females caught by HLC. Deep-sequencing libraries were made using the V5-V6 hypervariable region of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA gene. The sequences were clustered into OTUs and used for analysis of taxonomical abundance and community structure. At the same time that an aliquot of water was frozen, another aliquot was also removed to make a glycerol stock. Upon return to the laboratory, the glycerol stocks were streaked out onto different medium types and individual colonies isolated. For functional assays in vivo, gnotobiotic larvae were created by adding a single bacterial isolate to sterile flasks containing axenic larvae. Adult mosquitoes that had undergone different gnotobiotic treatments as larvae were used to test for variation in life-history and antimicrobial phenotypes.

We compared the bacterial communities between domestic and sylvatic larval development sites and the midguts dissected from surface-sterilized adult A. aegypti females using a metagenomics approach based on targeted sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene ( Fig. 1 ; for details, see Materials and Methods). Sylvatic samples were collected in gallery forests inside Lopé National Park, central Gabon, whereas domestic samples were collected in a nearby village. In the sylvatic environment, we characterized the bacterial communities in water collected from eight different A. aegypti larval development sites, nine midguts from adult females emerging from these sites, and six midguts from adult host-seeking females caught by human-landing catch (HLC) next to the larval development sites in the gallery forests. In the domestic environment, we characterized the bacterial communities in water collected from six A. aegypti larval development sites, eight midguts from adult females emerging from these sites, and three midguts from adult host-seeking females caught by HLC in the village. Overall, we analyzed eight water samples and 15 midguts from the sylvatic environment and six water samples and 11 midguts from the domestic environment. To control for contamination of bacteria introduced during sample processing, aliquots of reagents and blank samples were included as negative controls (for details, see Materials and Methods). A total of 2851 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified among all the samples, of which 2412 were included in the analysis after removing OTUs that were present in the negative controls (that is, likely resulting from laboratory contamination).

Together, our results provide the proof of principle that exposure to different bacteria during larval development can influence the variation in adult traits in the holometabolous insect A. aegypti. By building on the observation that in Gabon, the composition of bacterial communities differs between ecologically distinct A. aegypti larval development sites, we demonstrated that experimental exposure to different natural bacterial isolates at the larval stage can influence the potential transmission of a medically relevant human pathogen. A. aegypti larvae in nature would not be exposed to a single bacterium like in our gnotobiotic experiments, which did not fully capture the true complexity of a natural situation. Because of the inability to culture all bacteria present in larval development sites and the logistical difficulties to recreate relevant natural bacterial communities under laboratory settings, our study rather establishes the proof of concept that habitat-mediated differences in the bacterial communities of A. aegypti larval sites can influence adult traits. Evidence that differential larval exposure to bacteria, and thus larval ecology, may contribute to phenotypic variation in mosquito vectorial capacity is an important step toward a more comprehensive understanding of how environmental conditions shape the risk of vector-borne disease.

Differences in hemolymph antibacterial activity and titer of disseminated dengue virus, despite similar midgut infection rates the gnotobiotic treatments, are consistent with those in hemolymph-mediated immune priming. Note that although our results suggest immune differences among different gnotobiotic treatments, further work will be necessary to establish a link between specific immune mechanisms and susceptibility to bacterial colonization of the midgut and dengue virus dissemination. An alternative explanation is that differences in bacterial exposure during larval development result in differences in the composition of the gut bacterial microbiota of adult mosquitoes, which could indirectly modulate the antibacterial and antiviral immune responses. In line with this hypothesis, we observed differences in the bacterial composition and the number of cultivable bacteria present in the midguts of adults who underwent different gnotobiotic treatments (file S3), although there was no clear correlation between different bacterial communities and the phenotypes tested.

We observed differences in adult susceptibility to systemic dengue virus dissemination and differences in the innate immune response to M. luteus. Mosquito hemolymph is regarded as an essential component of the immune system and plays an important role in pathogen recognition and elimination and in immune memory. We detected differences in the ability of hemolymph collected from adults exposed to different bacteria as larvae to clear M. luteus on an agar plate. Specifically, hemolymph from adults exposed to the Esp_ivi isolate during larval development was less efficient at clearing M. luteus compared to other gnotobiotic treatments. Protection against M. luteus does not imply uniform protection across all bacteria species, and further work remains to be carried out to determine whether the effect we observed extends to other types of bacteria. It was the Esp_ivi treatment that resulted in adults who were better at controlling systemic dengue virus dissemination (that is, less infectious viral particles in the head tissues), pointing to a potential trade-off between bacterial defense and the ability to control viral infections. Infectious titer of disseminated dengue virus is positively correlated with the probability of virus detection in A. aegypti saliva ( 60 ) and is often used as a proxy for transmission potential. Adult body size has been shown to influence the susceptibility of A. aegypti to viral infection ( 61 ), but differences in wing length did not explain the differences observed in dengue virus dissemination in our experiments. Both the nonaxenic and Esp_ivi treatments resulted in significantly smaller adults; however, the level of viral dissemination was high in the control and low in the Esp_ivi treatment.

The second aim of this study was to assess whether exposure to different bacteria during larval development resulted in changes in adult traits involved in vectorial capacity. It was previously observed that the addition of any bacteria to axenic mosquito larvae rescued their development and allowed them to pupate and become adults ( 31 , 32 ). Although the authors of the study did not elucidate the mechanism underlying this observation, they hypothesized that the requirement for bacteria in the larval water was not nutritional because nonaxenic larvae maintained on sterile food in a sterile environment were still able to develop. Our observation of differences in pupation rate and adult body size hints at a possible role of nutrition and/or metabolism and deserves further work. Despite differences in pupation rate and adult size, the life span of adults exposed to different bacteria as larvae was similar regardless of the bacterial isolate. It is possible that other bacteria besides the three isolates that we used could alter adult life span, as was shown for the endosymbiont Wolbachia in Aedes mosquitoes ( 58 , 59 ).

The first aim of our study was to describe habitat-related differences in the bacterial composition of A. aegypti larval development sites. Our observation of distinct bacterial communities between domestic and sylvatic habitats supports previous observations of habitat-related differences in bacterial communities in mosquito larval sites ( 27 – 30 ) and verifies an important assumption of our study. Another marked observation from our targeted metagenomics approach was the dissimilarity between bacteria found in the larval site water and those in the adult midguts emerging from these same sites. The bacterial composition is known to vary between the larval and adult mosquito midguts ( 44 – 49 ), and adult mosquitoes are thought to have lost most of their midgut bacteria during metamorphosis ( 50 , 51 ). However, recent work has also shown that several bacterial community members in A. aegypti are transstadially transmitted ( 32 ) and that adult Anopheles may acquire their gut community from larval breeding sites ( 52 ). The limited overlap in bacterial OTUs between the matched water samples and the midguts from freshly emerged adults could be explained by at least five scenarios. (i) The OTUs that we detected in the adult midguts were also present in the water but at a frequency that was too low to be detected by our sequencing method. (ii) The bacteria found in the adult midguts were not acquired from the water during larval development and, instead, were inherited in alternative ways such as vertical transmission. Wolbachia can be inherited vertically in Culex species and Aedes albopictus ( 20 , 53 , 54 ), and vertical transmission of the bacterium Asaia has been observed in Anopheles mosquitoes ( 55 ). (iii) The bacteria found in the adult midguts were not present in the water but were acquired during the larval stage from larvae feeding on organic detritus such as leaves, wood, or other arthropods. (iv) The bacteria identified in the midguts were acquired from a different water depth than we sequenced. We did not control for the depth of the water that we collected for sequencing. It is possible that bacterial communities differ between water at the bottom and at the top of a pool ( 56 ) and that the bacteria that we identified in the mosquito midguts were acquired from the bottom of the pools or vice versa. (v) The low sample size of eight to nine midguts from freshly emerged adults per habitat may not capture the true taxonomical diversity. There is great variability in the composition of mosquito midgut bacterial microbiota, and we may need a larger sample size to capture all taxa present. Finally, we found that the number of OTUs detected in the midguts (that is, OTU richness) was significantly smaller than that in the water samples. This finding is consistent with previous reports of the low complexity of bacterial communities typically found in mosquito midguts ( 20 , 57 ).

To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first empirical evidence that exposure to different bacteria during larval development can result in variation in adult traits related to pathogen transmission by an important insect vector. We observed differences in the bacterial communities that inhabit ecologically distinct A. aegypti breeding sites in Gabon. Using native bacterial isolates derived from these natural breeding sites, we created gnotobiotic mosquitoes to reveal the functional consequences of differential bacterial exposure at the larval stage. These results improve our understanding of environmentally mediated effects that carry over from one life stage to another life stage in holometabolous insects. They also emphasize the importance of accounting for larval ecology to unravel the determinants of pathogen transmission by insect vectors of human pathogens.

Ethical statement The Institut Pasteur animal facility received accreditation from the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on live animals in compliance with the French and European regulations on the care and protection of laboratory animals. Rabbit blood draws performed in the context of this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Institut Pasteur under protocol number 2015-0032. Mosquito collections inside Lopé National Park were conducted under permit number AR0020/14/MESR/CENAREST/CG/CST/CSAR. Mosquito collections by HLC in Gabon were performed under protocol number 0031/2014/SG/CNE approved by the National Research Ethics Committee.

Field sampling Water from larval breeding sites and midguts of A. aegypti females emerging from the same larval sites were collected in Gabon in November 2014. Sylvatic collections were made inside Lopé National Park (latitude, −0.148617; longitude, 11.616715), and domestic collections were made in Lopé village (latitude, −0.099221; longitude, 11.600330) approximately 6 km from the sylvatic collection sites (Fig. 1). All of the sylvatic collections originated from rock pools, and the domestic collections were from various types of artificial containers and tires (Fig. 1B and file S5). At each larval breeding site, pupae and water were collected into a sterile 50-ml conical tube with filter-top lid using a sterile plastic pipette and brought back to the Station d’Etude des Gorilles et Chimpanzés field station. Upon arrival at the field station, 10 ml of water was transferred to a new sterile 50-ml conical tube next to the flame of a Bunsen burner and immediately stored at −20°C. The remaining water and pupae were held until the adults emerged and were visually identified as A. aegypti. The frozen water was transported back to the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville facilities in Franceville, Gabon, where the water was thawed and centrifuged at 3400 rpm for 10 min. Under a laminar flow cabinet, the supernatant was removed and replaced with 500 μl of sterile water to resuspend the bacterial pellet. The resuspended bacteria were spotted onto Whatman FTA cards (WB120401, GE Life Sciences), allowed to dry, and then wrapped in sterile foil for transport to Institut Pasteur in Paris. Within 12 hours of adult emergence, the midguts from A. aegypti females were dissected and stored in RNAlater (Qiagen) at +4°C. RNAlater was initially chosen to preserve the midgut tissue with the hope of being able to recover both RNA and DNA from the samples, but it was not possible to isolate a sufficient amount of RNA and DNA from each sample, so only DNA extractions were performed. Because of the lack of a laminar flow cabinet at the field station in Lopé National Park, the midguts were dissected within 50 cm of a Bunsen burner flame in an effort to maintain sterility. Before and between each dissection, the dissecting tools were disinfected with 3% bleach. Adult A. aegypti were removed from the tube in which they emerged and were cold-anesthetized. The mosquito was then surface-sterilized in 3% bleach and rinsed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the midgut was dissected in a drop of sterile PBS. Because of the limited access to ethanol in the field, surface sterilization was only performed with 3% bleach. Negative controls were included in an attempt to control for potential contamination of bacteria introduced at this step (see below). The dissected midguts were placed in individual sterile tubes containing RNAlater that had been filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and aliquoted under sterile conditions. The midguts in RNAlater were stored at +4°C until being frozen at −20°C upon their arrival at Institut Pasteur in Paris until the DNA extraction was performed. Following the same procedure, the midguts from non–blood-fed, host-seeking adult females caught by HLC were also dissected. Human volunteers sat next to either the rock pools (sylvatic habitat) or the artificial containers (domestic habitat) where A. aegypti had been previously observed and caught the females as they landed and were preparing to probe.

DNA extractions DNA from bacteria originating from the water samples was extracted from the Whatman FTA cards following the organic DNA extraction procedure provided by Whatman. DNA extractions were performed on two consecutive days, mixing samples each day to randomize a potential batch effect. Briefly, the filter paper was cut into small pieces using sterile scissors and soaked in 500 μl of extraction buffer [10 mM tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, disodium salt (pH 8.0), 100 mM sodium chloride, and 2% (v/v) SDS] and 20 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) prepared in sterile water overnight at 56°C with agitation. An equal volume of buffered phenol (pH 8.0) was added, vortexed briefly, and centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube containing 500 μl of chloroform, vortexed thoroughly, and centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube containing 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2). Eight hundred microliters of 100% ethanol was added and vortexed. The DNA was allowed to precipitate at −20°C for at least 1.5 hours. The DNA was recovered by centrifuging for 30 min at maximum speed. The supernatant was discarded, and 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the pellet and centrifuged for 20 min at maximum speed. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was air-dried for 30 min and dissolved in 50 μl of sterile water. Because of the large number of samples, the extractions were performed in two batches. To control for contamination of bacteria introduced during the DNA extraction, a negative control was made from each day of extraction by performing the extraction on a blank sample. Upon thawing the samples, the midguts were removed from the RNAlater and added to 300 μl of lysozyme (20 mg/ml) dissolved in Qiagen ATL buffer in a sterile tube containing grinding beads. The samples were homogenized for two rounds of 30 s at 6700 rpm (Precellys 24, Bertin Technologies). The samples were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours, after which 20 μl of proteinase K was added and vortexed briefly, followed by another incubation of 4 hours at 56°C on a shaker (300 rpm). After the incubation, 200 μl of Qiagen AL buffer and 200 μl of 100% ethanol were added to the samples and vortexed to mix. The lysate was transferred to a Qiagen DNeasy Mini Spin column (except midguts from HLC adults that were passed through Qiagen AllPrep columns), washed with buffers Qiagen AW1 and AW2 following kit instructions, and eluted in 20 μl of sterile water. To control for contamination of bacteria introduced both during the midgut dissections in the field and during the DNA extraction in the laboratory, negative controls were made by performing the same DNA extraction procedure on an aliquot of RNAlater opened at the field station in Gabon, an aliquot of sterile PBS used for midgut dissections that was opened at the field station in Gabon, and a blank midgut sample.

16S sequencing Libraries were made from 8 sylvatic water samples, 6 domestic water samples, 15 sylvatic midguts (9 freshly emerged and 6 HLC adults), and 11 domestic midguts (8 freshly emerged and 3 HLC adults). In addition, two technical replicates were prepared with different primer pairs used on the same water samples. Technical replicates were used to confirm the repeatability of the sequencing results. Custom-made polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeting the hypervariable V5-V6 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene were designed following Fadrosh et al. (62). These custom primers were designed to include the necessary Illumina adapters and indexes so that only one round of PCR was needed and therefore avoid multiple rounds of PCR that could lead to a sampling bias. To overcome the issues that arise when sequencing libraries with low-diversity sequences, such as PCR amplicons, heterogeneity spacers consisting of 0 to 7 base pairs were added to the custom primers so that the sequences would be sequenced out of phase (62). A total of eight forward and eight reverse primers were designed (file S6) and used in all 8 × 8 combinations to amplify all the breeding site water and midgut samples. Four microliters of each breeding site water sample and 6 μl of each midgut sample were used to amplify the V5-V6 16S region in triplicate using Expand High-Fidelity polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the addition 0.15 μl of T4gene32 and 0.5 μl of bovine serum albumin (20 mg/ml) per reaction to improve PCR sensitivity. Water samples were amplified for 30 cycles, and midgut samples were amplified for 40 cycles. The three PCRs were pooled, and the PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). The purified PCR products were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA fluorometric quantification (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and pooled for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina). The sequencing run failed multiple times with no achievable explanation except for the inability of the sequences to bind to the flow cell. The failed custom sequencing tags were replaced with sequencing tags used successfully in previous projects (57), which required performing a second round of PCR because all extracted DNA from the midgut samples had been used in the initial PCR. The second round of PCR used new custom primers containing the same V5-V6 region to rescue the samples (file S7). One microliter of each library was amplified in triplicate using Expand High-Fidelity polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) for eight PCR cycles. The three PCRs were pooled, purified using AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), and quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA fluorometric quantification (Invitrogen). Library quality was checked by Bioanalyzer (Aligent Technologies), and 300–base pair paired-end sequences were generated on the Illumina MiSeq platform using a V3 kit (Illumina).

Targeted bacterial metagenomics analysis Read filtering, OTU clustering, and annotation were performed with the MASQUE pipeline (https://github.com/aghozlane/masque), as described by Quereda et al. (63). A total of 2851 OTUs were obtained at 97% sequence identity threshold. The statistical analyses were performed with SHAMAN (shaman.c3bi.pasteur.fr) based on R software (v3.1.1) and bioconductor packages (v2.14). Because bacterial communities were expected to differ substantially between mosquito midguts and water samples, the normalization of OTU counts was performed at the OTU level by sample type (midgut or water) using the DESeq2 normalization method. All samples including the negative controls and technical replicates were included in the normalization step. The technical replicates were removed from the data set before analysis. To account for possible contamination at various steps in the sample-processing pipeline, the OTU counts were corrected with the reads from the negative controls (see above). All OTUs found in the negative control samples were removed from the normalized OTU table unless the count in a real sample was >10 times higher than the mean OTU count in the negative controls. This operation was performed with a homemade script in R (64). This normalized OTU count table with the OTUs found in the negative controls removed (file S8) was used for the richness, Shannon index, Venn diagrams, abundance heat map, and NMDS analysis. Observed richness, Shannon index, and Bray-Curtis distances were calculated with the vegan package in R (65). The effects of sample types and ecotypes on the bacterial richness were tested by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution. The SEs were corrected for overdispersion using a quasi-GLM model where the variance is given by the mean multiplied by the dispersion parameter. A χ2 test was applied to compare the significance of deviance shift after adding the covariates sequentially. The effects of sample type, ecotype, and their interaction on Shannon index were tested by fitting a linear model with a normal error distribution. The response variable was power-transformed to satisfy the model assumptions. The significance of each variable was tested with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) after adding the covariates sequentially. The results of the two models were confirmed by the convergence of backward and forward selection based on the Akaike information criterion. The Bray-Curtis distances were plotted with an NMDS method constrained in two dimensions. The Spearman correlation with real distances and stress value was estimated with the vegan R package (65). Effects of habitat and sample type on β diversity were tested with the betadisper and adonis permutational multivariate ANOVA methods from the vegan R package with 999 permutations of the Bray-Curtis distance matrix derived from OTU counts. In SHAMAN, a GLM was fitted and vectors of contrasts were defined to determine the significance in abundance variation between sample types. The GLM included the main effect of habitat (sylvatic or domestic), the main effect of sample type (midgut or water), and their interaction. The resulting P values were adjusted for multiple testing according to the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. All OTUs that were present in the negative controls were excluded from the final list of differentially abundant OTUs. To confirm the OTU-based results with an OTU-independent method, a dissimilarity matrix was generated with the SIMKA software (66). Reads with a positive match against the sequences assembled from the negative controls were removed using Bowtie v2.2.9 (67). Then, k-mers of size 32 and occurring at least greater than two times were identified with SIMKA. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was estimated between each sample.

Bacterial isolation At the same time water was removed to freeze for DNA extraction, an aliquot of the larval site water was added to 50% sterile glycerol to make 20% glycerol stocks of the larval site water. The glycerol stocks were frozen at −20°C until they were transported back to Institut Pasteur in Paris. Upon arrival in Paris, the glycerol stocks were streaked out onto agar plates made with LB medium [LBm; LB with NaCl (5 mg/ml)] and PYC medium [peptone (5 g/liter), yeast extract (3 g/liter), and 6 mM calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl 2 ·2H 2 O) (pH 7.0)] plates and incubated for 3 days at 30°C. LBm and PYC were chosen for being generalist media. Individual colonies were picked from the plates and used to inoculate 3 ml of the appropriate media, which were shaken at 30°C until bacterial growth occurred and used to create new glycerol stocks of the individual isolates. The same colony was also put into 20 μl of sterile water and exposed to two rounds at 95°C for 2 min and resting on ice for 2 min. The samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed to remove cell debris, and the supernatant was used to amplify the entire 16S region by PCR [5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCCGCA-3′ (reverse)] using Expand High-Fidelity Polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), quantified by NanoDrop (NanoDrop Technologies Inc.), and sequenced by Sanger sequencing. The sequences were aligned and classified at the genus level using the SILVA database (www.arb-silva.de/). The raw sequence data are available at the European Nucleotide Archive under accession number PRJEB16334. Individual colonies were chosen on the basis of size, color, and morphology. The purity of the colonies used in the gnotobiotic experiments was verified by restreaking the bacteria on multiple occasions.

Gnotobiotic larvae Axenic larvae were created using the eighth generation of an A. aegypti laboratory colony derived from a natural population originally sampled in Thep Na Korn, Kamphaeng Phet Province, Thailand, in 2013. This mosquito strain was used to create gnotobiotic larvae as a common genetic background from a different geographical region that had, presumably, not encountered the specific bacterial isolates introduced. The rationale was to avoid potentially confounding effects of local adaptation between mosquitoes and bacterial isolates. Eggs were gently scraped off the paper they were laid on into a 50-ml conical tube. The eggs were incubated in 70% ethanol for 5 min, 3% bleach for 3 min, and 70% ethanol for 5 min. The eggs were then rinsed in sterile water three times and allowed to hatch in sterile water in a vacuum chamber. Upon hatching, the larvae were transferred to sterile 25-ml tissue-culture flasks with filter-top lids and maintained in 15 ml of sterile water. Larvae were seeded to a density of 10 to 15 larvae per flask. The larvae were maintained on 50 μl of sterile fish food every other day. The water of the larval flask was not changed for the duration of the experiment. Fish food was made sterile by resuspending ground-up fish food with water and autoclaving it for 20 min. Axenic larvae were made gnotobiotic by adding a single bacterial isolate of choice. One to 3 days before inoculating the larval flasks, the bacteria were streaked out onto agar plates with their appropriate medium. They were allowed to grow 1 to 3 days until colonies of roughly similar size were obtained. A single bacterial colony was picked and added to each 25-ml flask. The sterility of the axenic larvae, as well as efficient colonization of the gnotobiotic larvae, was verified by PCR (see below). Five third-instar larvae were collected from each gnotobiotic treatment, and 10 axenic larvae were collected from three replicate flasks at the same time (5 days after hatching). Pooled larvae from each treatment were surface-sterilized by rinsing them once in sterile water, soaking in 70% ethanol for 10 min, and rinsing three times in sterile water. The larvae were then homogenized in Qiagen ATL extraction buffer, and DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. The presence or absence of bacteria was qualitatively verified by PCR using the same primers listed above for bacteria identification. Homogenates from the surface-sterilized larvae were plated to confirm that the added bacteria had colonized the larvae and that only a single morphological colony matching that of the input bacteria was present. The water in which gnotobiotic larvae developed was also plated to confirm that only the expected morphological colony was present. The axenic larval flasks were maintained for the duration of the experiment and manipulated in the same way to serve as negative controls. The amount of bacteria measured in the water of gnotobiotic treatments was not correlated to pupation rate (file S4).

Selection of bacterial isolates for functional assays Because cultivable bacteria only represent a small fraction of all bacteria present, and because specific bacterial isolates do not necessarily represent OTUs, the selection of isolates for functional assays was unrelated to the 16S metagenomics data. In particular, the choice of bacterial isolates did not depend on their relative abundance or habitat of origin. Instead, it was based on an arbitrary set of selection criteria described below. The original collection of 168 bacterial isolates was narrowed down to 37 isolates to test in an initial screen of pupation rate with the hypothesis that bacterial isolates that resulted in differences in larval growth kinetics would potentially induce phenotypic differences at the adult stage. The 37 test isolates were chosen on the basis of genetic dissimilarity to other isolates (<95% genetic similarity) and previously being associated with Aedes mosquitoes in the literature. To test the pupation rate of each of the 37 initial test isolates, individual colonies were inoculated into triplicate flasks of axenic larvae, as described above. The number of pupae was counted in each flask every day for 17 days. The list of 37 isolates was further narrowed down to 16 candidate isolates based on those that reached 60% pupation. Of the 16 candidate isolates, three isolates were chosen on the basis of differences in pupation rate (file S9) and differences in the cultivable bacterial composition found in adult midguts after 4 to 6 days in the insectary (file S10). On the basis of their full-length 16S sequence, two of the three isolates were assigned to Salmonella (Ssp_ivi) and Rhizobium (Rsp_ivi) genera. The third isolate (Esp_ivi) was assigned to the Enterobacteriaceae family, but classification at the genus level was inconsistent among databases (alternatively Salmonella, Escherichia, or Shigella). Whereas Escherichia was previously found in wild A. aegypti specimens, and Shigella and Rhizobium were found in wild A. albopictus specimens, Salmonella was not previously reported to be associated with Aedes mosquitoes (20, 31). In all cases, colonies belonging to the bacterial genera that were added during the larval stage could not be recovered from the corresponding adult midguts. Even when the same bacterial genus was detected in adult midguts (file S10), the 16S sequence was distinct.

Adult life-history traits After adult emergence from the different gnotobiotic treatments, 18 to 20 females were placed into triplicate 1-pint cardboard cups and maintained under standard insectary conditions (27 ± 1°C; relative humidity, 75 ± 5%; 12:12-hour light/dark cycle) on a sugar diet. The number of dead mosquitoes was recorded daily for 60 days until >90% of mosquitoes had died. The wings of the individual females harvested in the second replicate of the vector competence experiment (see below) were kept for later analysis. Wing length was measured from the tip (excluding the fringe) to the distal end of the allula using an ocular micrometer and a dissecting microscope. When both wings were intact, the mean of the two wing lengths was used for the statistical analysis.

Lysozyme-like activity of hemolymph Antibacterial activity of the hemolymph was measured by a bacterial growth inhibition zone assay. In this assay, mosquito hemolymph was spotted onto an agar plate containing M. luteus, and the antibacterial activity of the hemolymph was measured by the area of visible bacterial clearance around the hemolymph sample. Five to 7 days after adult emergence from gnotobiotic treatments, hemolymph was collected from females and placed on agar plates seeded with M. luteus. To make the agar plate, 10 ml of agar solution [2× agar (BD BactoAgar, Becton, Dickinson and Company), freeze-dried M. luteus (5 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and 67 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4)] was plated, and 3-mm holes were punched in the solidified agar. Twenty females (two replicates of 10 females each) from each treatment were cold-anesthetized and stored on ice until hemolymph was collected. To collect hemolymph, 2 μl of anticoagulant solution [60% Schneider’s medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 30% citrate buffer (pH 4.5) (98 mM NaOH, 186 mM NaCl, 1.7 mM EDTA, and 41 mM citric acid)] was injected into the thorax using a finely drawn glass capillary and a bulb dispenser (Microcaps, Drummond Scientific Co.). Ten microliters of the anticoagulant solution was then injected into the abdomen, and hemolymph was collected through capillary action by placing a capillary tube next to the injection site. The hemolymph was immediately placed on ice and then deposited in the cutout holes on the agar plates. The plates were stored at 30°C for 24 hours, and the number of individuals with detectable M. luteus growth inhibition and the size of M. luteus growth inhibition zone were calculated. The size of M. luteus growth inhibition was determined by using ImageJ (www.imagej.nih.gov/ij/) to calculate the diameter of the clear zone. The diameter of the clear zone for the hemolymph samples was converted to lysozyme-like activity using a standard curve generated by spotting 10-fold serial dilutions of lysozyme (200 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and measuring the diameter of the clear zone using ImageJ.

Vector competence Following the gnotobiotic treatments, pupae were picked every day for 1 week, and adults were allowed to emerge under standard insectary conditions (27 ± 1°C; relative humidity, 75 ± 5%; 12:12-hour light/dark cycle). The adults were maintained in the insectary for 3 to 7 days after emergence on a standard sugar diet. Females were starved for 24 hours before the infectious blood meal. Vector competence assays were performed as previously described (68). Briefly, mosquitoes were experimentally exposed to a wild-type dengue virus serotype 1 isolate (KDH0026A) originally from Thailand (69). The isolate was passaged five times in A. albopictus C6/36 cells before its use in this study. The virus stock was diluted in cell culture medium (Leibovitz’s L-15 medium + 10% heat-inactivated FBS + nonessential amino acids + 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin + 1% sodium bicarbonate) to reach a dose of 2.4 × 105 FFU/ml in the first experiment and 7.15 × 105 FFU/ml in the second experiment. One volume of virus suspension was mixed with two volumes of freshly drawn rabbit erythrocytes washed in distilled PBS and 60 μl of 0.5 M adenosine 5′-triphosphate. After gentle mixing, 2.5 ml of the infectious blood meal was placed in each of several Hemotek membrane feeders (Hemotek Ltd.) maintained at 37°C and covered with a piece of desalted porcine intestine as a membrane. After feeding, fully engorged females were sorted into 1-pint cardboard cups and maintained under controlled conditions (28 ± 1°C; relative humidity, 75 ± 5%; 12:12-hour light/dark cycle) in a climatic chamber for 14 days. After 4 days (experiment 1) and 14 days (experiments 1 and 2), detection of dengue virus RNA was performed with a two-step reverse transcription PCR assay. Heads and bodies were separated from each other, and bodies were homogenized individually in 400 μl of RAV1 RNA extraction buffer (Macherey-Nagel) during two rounds of 30 s at 5000 rpm (Precellys 24). Total RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions (Macherey-Nagel). Total RNA was first reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) with random hexamers using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was amplified by 45 cycles of PCR using the set of primers targeting the NS5 gene [5′-GGAAGGAGAAGGACTCCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATCCTTGTATCCCATCCGGCT-3′ (reverse)]. Amplicons were visualized by electrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels. In both experiments 1 and 2, the heads from infected bodies were titrated by standard focus-forming assay in C6/36 cells, as previously described (68). Briefly, heads were homogenized individually in 300 μl of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 2× Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Life Technologies). C6/36 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and each well was inoculated with 40 μl of head homogenate and incubated for 1 hour at 28°C. Cells were overlaid with a 1:1 mix of carboxymethyl cellulose and Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 0.1% penicillin (10,000 U/ml)/streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml), 1× nonessential amino acids, 2× Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Life Technologies), and 10% FBS. After 3 days of incubation, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated with a mouse anti-dengue virus complex monoclonal antibody (MAB8705, Merck Millipore), washed three times with PBS, and incubated with an Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies). FFU were counted under a fluorescence microscope.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700585/F1.large.jpg,"['drive', 'larval', 'bacteria', 'differences', 'exposure', 'effects', 'variation', 'vector', 'trait', 'different', 'environmental', 'larvae', 'samples', 'water', 'mosquito', 'adult', 'sites', 'midguts', 'bacterial']", ,none
20,20,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Stonehenge: Australia's Forgotten Farmers - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/stonehenge-australias-forgotten-farmers,"STONEHENGE, AUSTRALIA - Stonehenge is dry and has been for too long — seven years too long. You can taste the dust well before you cross the cattle grids that cut the only road into town.

More than 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) northwest of Sydney, Australia's Stonehenge could not be more different from its famous namesake, the World Heritage prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in England.

A stockman rides his horse as he leads another down a road toward the cattle yards in the outback town of Windorah, Queensland, located south of Stonehenge, in Australia, Aug. 11, 2017.

Stonehenge in England averages 10 days a month of rainfall and a maximum temperature of 22 degrees Celsius (72 Fahrenheit).

The town in Australia averages 325 sunny days a year and summer temperature of about 45C (113F), and forget regular rain.

How the town got its name is a mystery.

""In the mid-1800s, dingo [wild dog] trappers built a stone fortress which they used as a shelter, but no one is really sure,"" said resident Judy Baldry as she drove along a dusty road on the outskirts of town.

Another possibility is the stony landscape, with rocks ranging in size from marbles to boulders scattered across the plains as far as the eye can see.

The stones lure tourists to an area known as ""The Address Book"" on the outskirts of town, where people create their names or love messages using stones, such as ""Jim loves Kerry"" and ""Dan 4 Jan.""

Praying for rain

Stonehenge's remaining 23 residents say they are struggling to survive one of the longest droughts in memory.

""Certainly, this is the worst drought I've seen in the last 28 years because of its longevity. It's just gone on for so long,"" said cattle and sheep farmer Tony Jackson.

Jackson's Hill View Park Station property of more than 150,000 acres (60,000 hectares) is excellent wool country because of the stones. Less dirt means better quality wool.

He manages 800 cattle and about 6,000 sheep on the drought-hit property, but he fears he will have no feed or water if there is no rain by Christmas.

Jackson and his neighbors have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on feed.

Debt levels for broadacre farms, which include cattle, sheep and crops, is estimated to have increased by 7 percent during 2015-16 to average A$560,500 per farm, the Australian government's agricultural bureau said.

Other parts of Australia have seen the drought break, and farmers there are looking at a bright future. Cash incomes on cattle farms are estimated to be the highest in more than 20 years, at A$204,000 per farm, because of rising beef prices.

A rusted boat that was last used during local floods in the 1940s sits under a tree in a paddock near the Thomson River on the outskirts of the outback town of Stonehenge, in Queensland, Australia, Aug. 13, 2017.

But the drought has a stranglehold on Stonehenge.

For the first time in more than 34 years, the main water supply, the meandering Thomson River, has stopped flowing.

Farmer Dick Smith says it has been seven years since the last decent rain filled the river.

""This is drought country. No one forced me to live here. We have to expect a drought, but this one's gone on too long,"" he said on the veranda of his home on the Depot Glen property.

Smith usually manages about 1,500 cattle but has destocked to survive and now has just 47 cows and calves.

He said that because of droughts over the past decades, he had ""completely destocked three times,"" and the potential for a fourth was high.

When the rains do come, the farmers of Stonehenge will struggle to pay for new stock at a time when cattle prices are at record levels because of demand for beef.

Hard on families

The drought has taken its toll on families, with the emotional and financial stress contributing to poor mental health, according to a study by the Australian National University.

The study examined 8,000 people living in drought and found that the more severe the drought, the more severe the impact on the mental health of a farmer and his family.

Sue Smith knows the burden. She runs Depot Glen alone for many months while her husband, Dick, is away driving a grader or fixing fences thousands of kilometers away in the Northern Territory.

""You really have to love your husband to live out here,"" said Sue, a champion equestrian when she was young.

""We're not isolated up here. We have bitumen roads, telephones, internet, but I do miss white sheets,"" she said, referring to the groundwater that stains her sheets.

Stonehenge has suffered a huge loss of people because of the drought. The town many years ago boasted three hotels, and until just a decade ago, a population of 106.

Frank Irwin, who used to work on a farm, now runs the Stonehenge Hotel, a tin building with a bar crowned with empty beer bottles and rodeo memorabilia.

Stonehenge, like its English namesake, will survive, he said.

21,21,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"The losses that come after the earthquake: Devastating and costly: While most people focus on the dreaded shaky ground associated with earthquakes, a new study recommends we shift our focus to learn from and prepare against the range of disasters that ty - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170825104002.htm,"Earthquakes: Nature's most unpredictable and one of her most devastating natural disasters. When high intensity earthquakes strike they can cause thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damaged property. For decades, experts have studied major earthquakes; most have focused on fatalities and destruction in terms of the primary effects, the shaking unleashed.

A new study takes a different approach to generate a more complete picture.

The study, titled, ""Losses Associated with Secondary Effects in Earthquakes,"" published in Frontiers in Built Environment, looks at the devastation resulting from secondary disasters, such as tsunamis, liquefaction of sediments, fires, landslides, and flooding that occurred during 100 key earthquakes that occurred from 1900 to the present. And unlike previous studies, Daniell et al put a dollar value to the devastation from these secondary causes.

Since 1900, 2.3 million people have died in 2,233 earthquakes, yet it is important to understand that 93 percent of the fatalities that occurred as a result of violent earthquakes happened in only 1 percent of key earthquakes. In other words, the worst devastation tends to happen in only a very few quakes and generally as a result of dire secondary effects. Indeed fully 40 percent of economic losses and deaths result from secondary effects rather than the shaking itself. Several key earthquakes have changed our knowledge of secondary effects and serve as models to understand and heed in planning communities, homes and buildings, highways, and infrastructure such as nuclear power plants.

In 2004 the Indian Ocean earthquake unleashed tsunamis that killed a total of 227,300 people in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand, plus more than $10 billion in damages. In 2011, the Tohoku earthquake created a series of huge tsunami waves, which damaged coastal communities killing more than 17,900 people, forcing more than 50,000 households to relocate, and caused the Fukushima nuclear power plant failure, a nuclear disaster second only to Chernobyl in Russia in 1986, but which spread radiation across the Pacific Ocean. Studying the Indian Ocean and Tohoku earthquakes gives us information to create maximum tsunami height models for these high risk areas to better predict how populations, property, and gross domestic product might be impacted in the future by similar events.

The 1995 Kobe earthquake, also in Japan, and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand provide insight into the devastation that liquefaction can cause. Liquefaction occurs when sandy soils that are partially or fully saturated are turned from solids to liquid by the stress exerted upon the material by the earthquake. The result: soils that suddenly lose their strength and integrity and flow as landslides; liquefaction is especially destructive to buildings, highways, and mountain communities, such as Christchurch, New Zealand.

In the past, fire has been the greatest contributor to damage following earthquakes. The 1906 San Francisco fire, created an inferno of property damage. Five-sixths of the total damage was due to fire, worth tens of billions of dollars in today's market. Many of San Francisco's Victorian-era mansions, shops and businesses, and infrastructure -- indeed, whole neighborhoods -- burned to the ground in the city by the bay. In 1923, again in Japan, a fire that erupted following the Great Kanto earthquake killed more than 92,000 people and was responsible for two-thirds of the total damage, amounting in today's market to hundreds of billions of dollars.

High intensity earthquakes can also cause severe flooding. While most dams and reservoirs have been designed to withstand earthquake forces, but the simple lateral motion of an earthquake can cause natural and human-made structures to fail, and unload large volumes of water. Landslides can also block rivers and create 'quake lakes,' which can then flood settlements downstream, as happened in 2008 following the Sichuan earthquake in China. The authors say that of 6,800 plus dams and reservoirs worldwide, 623 are expected to have a significant shaking hazard within a return period of 475 years and that of these 333 are more than 45 years old and should be reassessed.

The authors further detail their process for disaggregating fatalities and damages resulting from secondary effects as compared to the actual shaking caused by the earthquake by presenting two case studies: the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunamis and the 1960 Chile earthquake and tsunami sequence and landslides.

As experts collect more data on secondary effects and resulting losses from high-intensity earthquakes, three benefits emerge. First, better models can be developed to understand the inherent risks and projected losses of building and living in certain areas. Secondly, scientists can reassess historic events, many of which were insufficiently recorded at the time. Thirdly, in this paper the authors demonstrate that to truly learn from these violent events data must be shared internationally and new technologies employed to process large volumes of information -- otherwise, these tragedies appear as isolated, random events, rather than as natural disasters to which we can and must adapt.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['focus', 'shaking', 'learn', 'secondary', 'result', 'f', 'shaky', 'devastation', 'effects', 'recommends', 'damage', 'losses', 'ground', 'earthquakes', 'liquefaction', 'study', 'earthquake', 'shift']", ,flood

It’s used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and as an add-on treatment for major depression and generalised anxiety disorder in people who haven’t responded to other therapies. The recommended dose range for these conditions is 200-800mg a day.

Off-label prescribing is when a drug is prescribed for uses outside those for which it has been licensed. It’s relatively common in psychiatry and may help patients who haven’t responded to standard treatments. But due to the lack of evidence for the safety and efficacy of off-label uses, there is a potential for harm.

Doctors prescribe quetiapine off-label for various conditions, including anxiety, autism, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder. It is also increasingly prescribed off-label for insomnia, usually at lower doses of 100mg or less a day.

But the evidence so far suggests the risks of prescribing quetiapine off-label outweigh any benefits.

Rise in use

Since quetiapine came onto the market in 1997, prescription rates have skyrocketed, especially in the United States, where it became the fifth-biggest-selling pharmaceutical in 2010.

Prescriptions for quetiapine also increased significantly in Australia between 2000 and 2011.

Patients switching from another antipsychotic to quetiapine cannot account for these changes; the rise is most likely due to off-label prescribing.

In fact, drug company AstraZeneca paid US$520 million in 2010 to resolve allegations the company illegally marketed Seroquel for uses not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Antipsychotic drugs

All antipsychotic drugs – both first generation, which were developed in the 1950s, and second generation, developed since the 1950s – exert their effect mainly by blocking dopamine transmission in various parts of the brain. They block dopamine D2 receptors, which alleviates symptoms of psychosis such as hallucinations, delusions and thought disorder.

Other receptors may also be blocked. However, these blockages may cause serious side effects.

Quetiapine is a second-generation antipsychotic drug that also blocks histamine H1 and serotonin type 2A receptors. This is thought to account for its sedative properties, which is why it’s used off-label for insomnia.

Antipsychotic drugs, especially first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol, fluphenazine and trifluoperazine, can be associated with some serious side effects, such as the neurological disorder tardive dyskinesia. This involves involuntary movements of the face, tongue and mouth and, less commonly, the limbs, head, neck and trunk. In some cases, tardive dyskinesia may be irreversible.

All antipsychotic drugs can also cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a neurological disorder which can progress rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can cause instability, altered consciousness, muscle rigidity and even death. The incidence is greatest in young men.

Both first- and second-generation antipsychotics have been reported to contribute to heart arrhythmia, where the electrical impluses co-ordinating your heartbeats malfunction. In a recent large cohort study, researchers reported that antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine, almost doubled the risk of sudden death from a heart attack.

Quetiapine has fewer side effects than first-generation antipsychotics. But recent research and clinical trials have reported considerable risk of metabolic side effects. These include weight gain, elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides, and diabetes, even when prescribed at recommended doses.

Quetiapine as a sleeping drug

Studies on the use of quetiapine for sedation have produced conflicting results.

A very small randomised placebo-controlled study, funded by AstraZeneca (manufacturer of quetiapine) and involving 14 healthy subjects, reported that, compared to placebo, both 25mg and 100mg quetiapine administered at night increased the sleep quality and the amount of sleep.

Another independent study conducted in Thailand did not support these findings. Researchers tested the drug in a randomised two-week controlled trial (where one group received the drug and another received a placebo). They found 25mg quetiapine at night for primary insomnia did not improve sleep.

Quetiapine can cause significant weight gain, even when used in small to moderate doses for sleep. It has also been associated with increased blood glucose (sugar) and dyslipidaemia (an imbalance of fats circulating in the blood). These increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

In a retrospective study in the United Kingdom, 43 psychiatric patients aged 19 to 65 years were prescribed low-dose quetiapine for insomnia, usually 100mg at bedtime. Over the 11-month study period, their weight increased by an average of 2.22kg.

Despite the safety concerns associated with using quetiapine as an antipsychotic, the risks may be acceptable when treating patients with serious mental illness, given there are few alternatives.

But the evidence so far suggests prescribing quetiapine off-label for people who have problems sleeping places them at unnecessary risk of harm.","Tue, 29 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/90283/original/image-20150730-25757-6ur5s4.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C2002%2C971&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['quetiapine', 'reported', 'offlabel', 'insomnia', 'seroquel', 'disorder', 'antipsychotic', 'drug', 'risk', 'explainer', 'prescribed', 'study', 'increased']", ,none
25,25,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"Elderly Mexican Villagers Cling to Town, Fight Plans to Flood Land - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/americas/elderly-mexican-villagers-cling-town-fight-plans-flood-land,"TEMACAPULÍN, MEXICO - Abigail Agredano fears her 96-year-old mother would not survive being uprooted from their hometown in the highlands of western Mexico, where its 400 mostly elderly residents are battling a government plan to dam the nearby Río Verde.

""If they manage to force us out, I think she and many others would die immediately,"" Agredano, head of the Committee to Save Temacapulín, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Damming the Río Verde would supply water for major urban areas in the state of Jalisco and neighboring Guanajuato but leave Temacapulín and the smaller villages of Palmajero and Acasico underwater.

While the dam was proposed a dozen years ago, the campaign has grown more urgent this summer since Jalisco Governor Aristóteles Sandoval abandoned a pledge he made in 2013 to save Temacapulín.

Temacapulin, Mexico Temacapulin, Mexico Temacapulin, Mexico

Construction of the dam was halted at 80 meters (262 feet)after a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 and, as the partially finished dam has not been sealed, the river still runs through it.

But Sandoval, a member of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said in late June the government now intends to raise the Zapotillo dam to 105 meters, a height that would seal the fate of the three tiny towns.

""Saving Temacapulín is no longer an affordable option,"" Sandoval said, because of growing water demands of the state capital Guadalajara, Mexico's second-biggest city.

Citing a recent study by the U.N. Office for Project Services that advocates raising the height of the dam to create a larger water supply, Sandoval has rejected alternatives such as building dikes to protect Temacapulín as half measures that would leave local residents at risk of flooding.

Not for sale

Settled by indigenous tribes in the sixth century, Temacapulín lies in a fertile valley where residents grow maize, beans and chiles.

Called Temaca for short, it is known for its hot springs and an iconic stone chapel built by a Catholic priest more than 250 years ago.

It is quiet, with little noise aside from chirping birds, with leafy plazas and wide cobbled streets. A sign on a scrubby hillside overlooking the town reads ""Temacapulín greets you from the sixth century.""

While many of its young people have left to seek economic opportunities in the United States, the elderly residents who remain have demonstrated, held fundraisers and lobbied lawmakers to save their town.

Many homes are marked with defiant murals, and a sign reading ""Temacapulín"" at the town's entrance has been altered with spray paint to add the word ""resists.""

In the days following the governor's announcement, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside Guadalajara's government palace to sing protest ballads and chant ""Temaca is not for sale!""

Guadalupe Espinoza, a lawyer who represents many Temacapulín residents, told the crowd the project could not legally proceed because of the 2013 court ruling that suspended its construction.

But a Jalisco government spokesman told the Thomson Reuters Foundation this hurdle could be overcome by reaching a new agreement with Guanajuato state and Mexico's National Water Commission.

Damage to social fabric

Susana Delgado, a social sciences professor at the University of Guadalajara who has studied how the threat of displacement has affected Temacapulín residents, says they are suffering stress, sleeplessness, fatigue, anger, depression and high blood pressure.

Pressure to sell their homes to the government has divided families, friends and neighbors, fueling distrust and the stigmatization of those who do sell.

""The social fabric of the community has been torn apart,"" Delgado said. ""This is the product of a strategy implemented by the state to wear down those who resist displacement.""

Consuelo Carvajal, who runs a convenience store, said she has seen how the tense situation has taken its toll. She said she thinks people are suffering heart attacks and falling ill from prolonged fear and uncertainty.

""They're worried about what will happen to their children and their homes,"" she said.

Carvajal, who has lived her whole life in a spacious, 200-year-old adobe house, said authorities have threatened to seize people's homes if they refuse to sell.

""It's a great injustice,"" she said. ""These houses were built by our ancestors. We have real affection for them.""

More transparency

The Jalisco government denies treating residents improperly or unfairly.

""We're not imposing anything on them,"" said Felipe Lugo, the State Water Commission (CEA) director in charge of relocation. ""We ask them whether they prefer to be paid in cash or relocated in a new town.""

Lugo said the CEA has reached agreements with almost half of Temacapulín's 344 families.

Those who agree to trade properties are relocated in Talicoyunque, a housing development built for them on a stony hilltop overlooking Temacapulín.

Talicoyunque consists of 32 modest bungalows but has no school, health center, church, shops or public transport links.

Paint is already peeling off some of the homes, and there is little fertile soil to grow crops or space to graze livestock.

Residents only have running water for two hours on every third day, and they have not been given the deeds to their new properties, almost two years after some gave up their old homes.

Article 19, a press freedom watchdog group, recently called for greater transparency after security guards barred journalists from entering the community.

Lugo said the CEA has been assigned 335 million pesos ($18.7 million) to build more homes and infrastructure, including a well to provide a constant water supply.

Residents will have ""everything they need, in optimum conditions,"" and will receive proof of ownership once the authorities finish revising the deeds to their former properties, he said.

Many of those still in Temacapulín remain unconvinced.

""Sometimes we feel tired from fighting for so long,"" Agredano said. ""But our love for our town gives us the strength to keep going.""","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/D7EED8B4-2172-4EF4-8B75-4EB4E7080F53.jpg,"['homes', 'jalisco', 'elderly', 'sandoval', 'land', 'fight', 'cling', 'temacapulín', 'villagers', 'dam', 'residents', 'mexico', 'town', 'water', 'state', 'mexican', 'told', 'plans', 'flood']", ,none

27,27,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,From the surface to the seafloor: How giant larvaceans transport microplastics into the deep sea - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700715,"Abstract Plastic waste is a pervasive feature of marine environments, yet little is empirically known about the biological and physical processes that transport plastics through marine ecosystems. To address this need, we conducted in situ feeding studies of microplastic particles (10 to 600 μm in diameter) with the giant larvacean Bathochordaeus stygius. Larvaceans are abundant components of global zooplankton assemblages, regularly build mucus “houses” to filter particulate matter from the surrounding water, and later abandon these structures when clogged. By conducting in situ feeding experiments with remotely operated vehicles, we show that giant larvaceans are able to filter a range of microplastic particles from the water column, ingest, and then package microplastics into their fecal pellets. Microplastics also readily affix to their houses, which have been shown to sink quickly to the seafloor and deliver pulses of carbon to benthic ecosystems. Thus, giant larvaceans can contribute to the vertical flux of microplastics through the rapid sinking of fecal pellets and discarded houses. Larvaceans, and potentially other abundant pelagic filter feeders, may thus comprise a novel biological transport mechanism delivering microplastics from surface waters, through the water column, and to the seafloor. Our findings necessitate the development of tools and sampling methodologies to quantify concentrations and identify environmental microplastics throughout the water column.

INTRODUCTION Globally, plastic waste is now a pervasive feature of nearly all marine environments, ranging from coastal bays and estuaries to large oceanic gyres and down to the abyssal seafloor (1–3). In the absence of changes to current waste management practices, the annual amount of plastic waste available to enter the ocean from land is predicted to rise to 250 million metric tons by 2025 (4). Documented ecosystem impacts from this widespread contamination by plastic debris range widely from physical hazards and digestive blockage from ingestion by marine life to ecotoxicological effects resulting from the trophic transfer of plastic-related contaminants through marine food webs (5–7). Of the diverse marine habitats from which plastic debris have been documented, the distribution and fate of plastics in open ocean ecosystems are the most poorly known. Offshore marine waters comprise the largest living space on the planet, and the diversity of ecosystem inhabitants form complex food webs of vast international economic importance. Within the open ocean, a spectrum of plastics has been globally documented from surface waters (2, 8) and, more recently, in the seafloor sediments of deep-ocean basins (9, 10). Thus, along with sinking organic matter that fuels most of the deep-sea ecosystems, there is a poorly understood but potentially highly dynamic plastic debris field [including negatively buoyant materials (11)] sinking through the ocean’s mid-waters, for which ingestion and vertical transport processes are virtually unknown (3). Microplastics (defined as particles <5 mm in diameter) are the most numerically abundant size range of particles within marine plastic debris fields (2). Despite their pervasiveness, we lack a comprehensive understanding of environmental microplastic distributions, their sources and sinks, physical and biological transport mechanisms, and the associated organismal and human health hazards. Microplastics arguably exert the largest ecosystem-scale pollution due to their small sizes, which allow for ingestion by pelagic organisms ranging from zooplankton (12), micronekton (13), and even large predatory fishes (14). However, the biological impacts on organismal feeding, growth, reproduction, and mortality are poorly known, in part because there is a lack of in situ data on the ingestion of microplastics and subsequent digestive processing (5). Nevertheless, there is evidence that the chemical burdens associated with microplastics present ecotoxic hazards to marine animals (7, 15). Here, to better understand the ability of midwater consumers to ingest and process microplastics, we conducted in situ feeding experiments with abundant filter-feeding larvaceans, Bathochordaeus stygius, from the open ocean ecosystem of Monterey Bay, California. Larvaceans, or appendicularians, are active filter feeders that are circumglobal components of marine zooplankton assemblages (16), whose abundances are often second only to those of copepods (17). They are basal chordates whose morphology consists of a trunk (or head) and a tail (Fig. 1). Larvaceans secrete complex mucus filters that form a “house” in which the animal lives (18). By beating their tails to drive a feeding current through their mucus houses, larvaceans are able to concentrate food particles and other media suspended in the water column. Giant larvaceans of the genus Bathochordaeus are generally an order of magnitude larger than most other larvacean species, building mucus houses in excess of 1 m in diameter (19). Because of their abundance and highest known filtration rates by any midwater filter feeder (average of 42.9 liters hour−1; maximum of 76.2 liters hour−1], giant larvaceans in Monterey Bay have the capacity to completely filter their principal depth range in less than 2 weeks (20). Discarded Bathochordaeus houses sink rapidly to the seafloor and contribute significantly to the vertical transport of carbon to the deep sea (21). Fig. 1 Experiments were conducted on board R/V Western Flyer using DeepPIV’s particle injector deployed from ROV Doc Ricketts. We conducted in situ feeding studies of giant larvaceans using a modified dye injector pump developed with the DeepPIV hardware (20). A peristaltic injector pump emptied a bag filled with microplastic particles and dispensed particle-rich fluid through the tubing nearby an animal. Giant larvaceans are ideal candidates to investigate microplastic ingestion because their feeding filters exclude and subsequently concentrate particles of the same size range as microplastics (<5 mm), and ingestion of microplastics can be observed directly within the animal’s transparent trunk. Midwater larvaceans are also highly abundant and, like other filter feeders, generate currents to ingest particles of organic matter from the water column. Because of their effective filtration rates [up to ~80 liters hour−1 (20)] in combination with their status as important prey items (22), giant larvaceans could be a strong vector for microplastics into marine food webs. We used a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) outfitted with novel instrumentation, Deep Particle Image Velocimetry (DeepPIV; Fig. 1) (20) to make observations of giant larvaceans feeding on experimentally released microplastics with sizes ranging from 10 to 600 μm in diameter (see Materials and Methods). We evaluated (i) the potential for this filter feeder to ingest microplastics, (ii) the size range of ingested particles, and (iii) whether microplastics can be incorporated into the mucus house and/or fecal pellets, enabling the rapid removal of microplastics from near-surface waters and subsequent deposition on the seafloor.

RESULTS Microplastic particles were dispensed on a total of 25 B. stygius individuals; particles were observed to enter the inner filters of 11 of these individuals. At-sea conditions limited our ability to conduct sustained ROV observations on many of the animals. Of these 11 individuals, microplastics were subsequently processed into the guts of 6 specimens. Some particles were dislodged by water flow from the internal surfaces of the inner filter and passed through the buccal tube and into the gut of the larvacean (Fig. 2 and movie S1). No particles were observed to exit from this pathway. Of the five individuals subsequently collected by the ROV, ship- and shore-based microscopy confirmed the presence of microplastics in the guts and/or fecal pellets of four specimens; one individual was lost during ROV recovery (Fig. 3 and table S1). All size classes of particles used in the feeding experiments were ingested (table S1). During and after passing of microplastic-rich fecal pellets, the collected specimens appeared to swim normally within their holding containers. Fig. 2 During feeding experiments, microplastics were observed inside and attached to the inner house and inside the gut of giant larvaceans. Microplastic particles in varying size ranges (from 10 to 600 μm) are represented by different colors (for example, red, yellow, green, and orange; see table S1 for specific particle sizes). Image corresponds to B. stygius specimen D5 from dive D870 (table S1). Scale bar, 2 cm. ih, inner house; bt, buccal tube; mp, microplastics; g, gut; tr, trunk; m, mouth; t, tail; r, ramp of inner house. Fig. 3 Collected giant larvaceans were maintained in a cold room, and after 12 hours, animals and fecal pellets were imaged under a microscope to determine microplastic particle size. (A) After the 12-hour period, the guts of intact individuals were completely evacuated. (B) Microplastic particles were incorporated into the fecal pellets, where each color (for example, red, orange, yellow, and green) corresponds to specific size classes of particles shown at lower (B) and higher (C) magnifications. (See table S1 for specific particle sizes). The fecal pellet in (C) can be seen in the upper left corner of (B). Images shown here correspond to B. stygius specimen D5 from dive D870 (table S1). Microplastic particles trapped within the collapsed filters of discarded Bathochordaeus houses would travel quickly to the seafloor, based on published sinking rates of about 800 m day−1 (21). We also measured the sinking rates of Bathochordaeus fecal pellets from specimens not used in the feeding experiments (and thus not containing microplastics) and found that these pellets descend at an average rate of 300 m day−1 (see Materials and Methods and table S2). These relatively fast sinking rates (23) reduce the likelihood of interception, consumption, or degradation during their fall to the seafloor. Despite the near-neutral buoyancy of particles selected for this feeding study, the collected microplastic-rich mucus houses and fecal pellets were negatively buoyant in their holding containers. While these observations support the assumption that microplastic-rich structures sink, the rates of deposition are expected to vary because sinking rate inherently depends on the density of the ballasting material (24).

DISCUSSION Our findings show that giant larvaceans can ingest and package microplastics into sinking aggregates. Arguments that could limit the significance of these results include the following: (i) Microplastics may be disproportionately constrained to the top of the water column, above the principal depth range of Bathochordaeus (100 to 300 m) (20), and (ii) giant larvaceans may be able to selectively reject microplastics at concentrations found within their environment. However, microplastics have been reported from different subsurface marine habitats, such as abyssal ocean sediments (10) and the upper water column (25, 26), directly suggesting a dynamic microplastic particle field sinking through the water column. More measurements of concentrations and distributions of microplastics across the water column are needed. With regard to particle rejection, studies on smaller, near-surface larvacean species using fluorescent plastic and latex particles may extend our findings of microplastic uptake to the oikopleurids Oikopleura dioica (27–29), O. vanhoeffeni (30), and Stegasoma magnum (27) and to the fritillarid Fritillaria borealis (29). Oikopleurids (including Bathochordaeus) are among the most abundant filter feeders found in the ocean (17); oikopleurids and fritillarids occur at depths extending from the surface to 3500 m (31, 32). Although very little is known about subsurface microplastic distributions, filter-feeding larvaceans can be found anywhere in the oceanic water column where microplastics are expected to occur. For example, larvaceans have been reported as important components of zooplankton assemblages in the subtropical and subarctic North Pacific regions (33), oceanic areas that encompass microplastic convergence zones associated with the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (2). Larvaceans are known to be able to actively reject particles during ingestion and to have the ability to differentiate particles by size, nutrient concentration, and the presence of toxins (34). Given these abilities, larvaceans would be expected to differentiate nutrient-rich prey items from nutrient-poor microplastics. However, laboratory feeding studies on O. dioica found no difference between grazing rates on plastic beads and natural phytoplankton (28), which is consistent with our in situ ingestion observations of B. stygius. Our results present a novel biological transport vector that could effectively move large amounts of microplastics from near-surface waters into the deep sea. While the overall importance of this pathway is dependent upon relatively unmeasured environmental concentrations and characterizations of microplastics across the water column [for example, abundance, size range, and microplastic material properties including density (35)], our results suggest multiple, interacting areas that require further study. Larvaceans have been shown to be the primary prey for many planktonic carnivores and larval fish (22) and could thus serve as an important trophic node for the transfer of microplastics through marine food webs. In addition, the discarded houses of larvaceans are widely consumed by a diversity of mesopelagic and bathypelagic animals, as well as benthic organisms on the seafloor (36). The same is likely to be true for larvacean fecal pellets [for example, see study of Turner (23)]. A number of other highly abundant pelagic filter feeders and suspension feeders, including salps, doliolids, and pyrosomes (35), are potential consumers of microplastics and could also transfer plastics through food webs. Little is known about whether these widespread animal groups ingest microplastics in situ, although laboratory feeding studies on salps have demonstrated plastic ingestion (37). To comprehensively evaluate the overall impacts of microplastics on marine food webs and nutrient cycling in the ocean, targeted efforts are required to gather data on the rates and concentrations at which microplastics are aggregated by larvaceans and other pelagic filter-feeders.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of microplastics for in situ feeding studies Polyethylene microspheres, or microplastic particles (Cospheric LLC), were selected based on particle density (closely matching the density of seawater or 1.027 g/cm3) and size range, while minimizing overlap of coloration to distinguish between particle size classes during feeding experiments. Given these constraints, we selected red, orange, yellow, and green microplastic particles that ranged in size from 10 to 600 μm in diameter (table S1). All particles but the largest size class (red; 500 to 600 μm in diameter) had fluorescent surface coatings to enhance visibility for observations during experiments. Microplastics were prepared using a protocol that uses Tween 80 biocompatible surfactant to ensure separation of particles once in solution (www.cospheric.com/tween_solutions_density_marker_beads.htm). To minimize any adverse behavioral responses to the surfactant, the Tween solution was replaced with seawater at the end of the protocol, which did not have any visible effect on particle separation. Before each ROV dive, an intravenous bladder with a volume of 1 liter was filled with a mixture of 200 ml of microalgae (cultured Nannochloropsis sp.), 1.25 g of prepared microplastics (0.25 g of each size class), and 800 ml of filtered seawater. The addition of microalgae to suspended microplastics is consistent with previous studies of larvacean filter feeding (28, 29). Microplastic concentrations within the bladder were approximately 1.25 g/cm3 for all feeding experiments. Microplastic dispersal using modified DeepPIV dye injector In situ feeding experiments were enabled by the deployment of DeepPIV (20) from the port manipulator on ROV Doc Ricketts. DeepPIV is an instrument that allows for the in situ visualization and quantification of small-scale fluid motion (Fig. 1). In addition to camera and laser housings, DeepPIV was equipped with a peristaltic pump (Cole Parmer), whose tubing diameter allowed for the passage of particles greater than 1 mm in size. An intravenous bladder filled with the microplastic mixture was attached to the injector such that microplastic particle–rich seawater was released from the injector tubing once the peristaltic pump was activated (fig. S1). In situ feeding experiments with giant larvaceans Feeding experiments with B. stygius were conducted in Monterey Bay, California, in June 2016 using ROV Doc Ricketts and DeepPIV and occurred between depths of 200 and 400 m. During in situ feeding experiments, an ROV pilot positioned the vehicle such that the injector tubing was adjacent to the larvacean inner house. Particle-rich fluid was dispensed into the water column for 1- to 5-s intervals depending on the quantity of particles released (fig. S1, 00:00:00). After particle release, the ROV was positioned away from the animal such that the hydrodynamic signature of the vehicle did not disturb larvacean feeding behavior. Sustained observations of a feeding larvacean would continue until microplastic particles could be visually confirmed inside the gut of the animal (fig. S1, 00:01:50) or until proper positioning between the ROV and surface vessel could no longer be achieved, whichever was longer. At the completion of the experiment, the animal was collected in a detritus sampler (fig. S1, 00:10:15), stowed, and brought to the surface at the end of the ROV dive. Once at the surface, animals were transferred from the samplers into separate containers and kept overnight in a cold room. Over the ensuing 12 hours, those specimens produced fecal pellets that were collected and imaged using ship-based microscopy to confirm the presence of microplastics (Fig. 3, A and B). Animals and fecal pellets were then preserved in formalin and brought to the shore for further microscope imaging to quantify the size distribution of particles ingested (Fig. 3C and table S1). Movie S1 shows an in situ feeding experiment, which includes particle injection, microplastic ingestion, and collection of giant larvacean specimen D5 during dive D870 (table S1). Sinking velocities of giant larvacean fecal pellets Seven specimens of Bathochordaeus spp. were collected in August 2016 using ROV Ventana from depths between 100 and 200 m. Thirteen fecal pellets (derived from food captured by the Bathochordaeus specimens before capture and then generated by those specimens) were photographed, measured, and used to determine sinking rates (table S2). Giant larvacean specimens were kept at 9°C in an environmental chamber, and seawater from each unique collection was transferred to a chilled, glass graduated cylinder 50 mm in diameter. Sinking experiments commenced once water movement in the graduated cylinder ceased. Fecal pellets were introduced individually into the graduated cylinder using a large-bore pipette and timed as they settled through the 243-mm column. Fecal pellets were video-recorded as they sank and subsequently collected and preserved in 5% formalin.

28,28,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Cinnamon: Pantry staple -- and medical powerhouse? - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/24/health/cinnamon-health-benefits/index.html,"(CNN) Cinnamon is one of the world's most popular spices, sprinkled on lattes, boiled with ciders and enjoyed in numerous dishes. Without it, Thanksgiving and Christmas meals might well become tasteless and definitely less fragrant.

Harvested from the inner bark of a tropical evergreen plant, cinnamon has been used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat respiratory and digestive problems for centuries. Ancient Egyptians used cinnamon as a perfume during the embalming process, while Romans used it in funeral pyres to mask the stench of burning flesh.

The Bible mentions cinnamon several times, most commonly as a way to perfume bedding, clothes and anointing oil. The essential oil form is made from the bark, leaves or twigs of the plant.

But it's cinnamon's use as a medicinal agent that has scientists buzzing, trying to determine just how well its antioxidant capabilities might work to better our health.

""Medicine started as herbs and plants,"" said Lauri Wright, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""So it almost comes full circle, as we're now going back and proving what some of these plant substances may do for health.""

Not all cinnamon is created equal

There are two basic types of cinnamon. Ceylon, or Cinnamomum verum, is grown in Sri Lanka. C. cassia, C. loureiroi and C. burmannii, communally known as cassia, are widely produced in China and Indonesia. Cassia has the stronger flavor and odor of the two and, due to its much lower cost, is what we buy in the store to sprinkle on our food.

But it's the more expensive Ceylon version, with a milder, sweeter flavor, that might be the best for your health.

Cassia can contain relatively high concentrations of coumarin, a plant compound that can damage the liver. A study of 91 cinnamon samples from various stores in Germany found 63 times more coumarin in cassia cinnamon powder than Ceylon powder. Cassia sticks, which look like a thick layer of rolled bark, also contained 18 times more coumarin than Ceylon sticks, which have thin layers.

""A challenge with some of these herbal solutions, because they are not a regulated drug, is that you don't know exactly what you are getting,"" said registered dietitian Melinda Maryniuk, who serves on the professional practice committee for the American Diabetes Association. ""A lot of things affect the makeup of the product: where it's grown, the soil, growing conditions, even how the spice was stored and dried.""

That problem also plagues research on cinnamon. Scientists have used different doses, species and compounds of the spice for their research.

""The doses have varied greatly among the studies, from less than 1 gram to levels that would be toxic in humans,"" Wright said. ""The duration of taking the capsules has also varied greatly. That's the problem with translation of all of this work. Even when we find positive results, how do we come up with the correct compounding and dosage for maximum safety?""

Keep that in mind as you read on about where science stands on cinnamon.

""I think the strongest evidence lies so far with diabetes and the promise of cinnamon and blood sugar control,"" Wright said, pointing to studies in test tubes and mice and even small studies in people showing that cinnamon helps with insulin sensitivity and glucose transport while decreasing inflammation.

""A lot of the studies have been in postmenopausal women and men of that age,"" said biochemist Amy Stockert, who studies cinnamon at Raabe College of Pharmacy at Ohio Northern University. ""Some have found positive effects; other studies have not.""

Stockert co-authored a small study of 18 people with type 2 diabetes that showed the cassia species of cinnamon was more effective than diet alone in lowering blood glucose levels. In fact, her study found that it was comparable to oral diabetes medications.

Another study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes found that small doses of cinnamon reduced blood sugar levels and improved LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol.

""I like the fact that the amount that showed benefits for blood sugar and cholesterol in that study was 1 to 6 grams, which is the range of half-teaspoon to three teaspoons, or one tablespoon, so it's easy to sprinkle on cereal or in yogurt or use in recipes,"" said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer, who writes about nutrition for CNN. The Food and Drug Administration's recommended limit is 6 grams a day.

But while the future looks promising, the American Diabetes Association urges caution.

""The ADA believes there's not enough evidence,"" Maryniuk said. ""A 2013 meta-analysis, which is one of the most rigorous of reviews, found that cinnamon had no impact on hemoglobin A1c levels, which is what we look at to measure how well blood sugar is being controlled over time. If that had gone down, I'd be more impressed.""

Still, if you want to see whether cinnamon works for you, Maryniuk suggests that people with type 2 diabetes do a self-test.

""Do some paired blood glucose testing,"" she said. ""Use a half a teaspoon in the morning, on fruit or oatmeal or in coffee, and see what happens to your blood sugar levels before and after you eat. Check again two to three hours later and see if there's a difference.

""But keep taking your medicine,"" she warned. ""You don't want to try something to the exclusion of the medicine you're taking.""

""We still need a bit more work before we roll this out,"" Wright agreed. ""And you must be careful to work with your doctor when using cinnamon with diabetes medications, as it might drop your blood sugars too low.""

Dementia, HIV, cancer and more

The antioxidant properties of cinnamon are also being studied for their impact on the formation of the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Cinnamaldehyde, a compound responsible for the spice's sweet smell, and epicatechin, a powerful antioxidant that's also in blueberries, red wine and chocolate, seem to offer some protection against the oxidative stress that damages tau, a key player in the development of dementia.

Another study found a component of Ceylon cinnamon to have the same effect. However, research has occurred only in mice, rats and laboratory Petri dishes.

""It appears to work as an anti-inflammatory or antioxidant, protecting the body on a cellular level from bad things that happen,"" Wright said, ""by getting rid of waste products and keeping the cells healthy.""

Cinnamon and other traditional Indian medicinal plants are also being tested in the fight against HIV. One study found that green tea, elderberry and some extracts of cinnamon rich in flavonoids blocked the virus from entering and infecting certain cells.

""That's how AZT works, which is one of the early HIV drugs,"" said Wright, who specializes in nutrition for infectious disease at the University of South Florida. ""And while that's interesting, what I would hate is that patients will use cinnamon and other supplements instead of their HIV medications.

""Having worked with many HIV clients over the years, I know there's definitely a big interest in supplements,"" she said. ""But I would always caution them to always use the meds that we know work, that have been tested and dosed, and then look carefully to make sure there are no conflicts with any additional supplements.""

The research on cinnamon doesn't stop there. Ceylon cinnamon has also been associated with cancer-fighting properties in rodents, anti-parasitic effects, improved diabetic neuropathy, lower blood pressure and wound healing, including liver damage. Studies have shown that solutions of cinnamon oil can kill a number of common bacteria, such as streptococcus and E. coli. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health is investigating cinnamon's impact on multiple sclerosis.

Using a computer model, biochemist Stockert found that cinnamon was as effective as resveratrol, an antioxidant in red wine known for anti-aging and disease-fighting properties, in activating SIRT-1 -- also known as the longevity gene because of its role in repairing DNA.

""In some cases, it did better than resveratrol,"" Stockert said. ""We're talking anti-cancer, anti-aging, a very, very big deal if that is what is going on.""

Cinnamon as health aid

Based on all this preliminary research, the potential of cinnamon seems enormous. But experts caution that it's still too early in the scientific process to suggest cinnamon as a daily supplement.

""I don't recommend capsules. There's not enough science to tell us to take capsules,"" Wright said.

""You are affecting your body's signaling,"" Stockert said, ""and that's significant. We're at an early stage in research where we don't know how cinnamon will affect most people. Is it healthy to cook with spices and use them liberally? I'm sure that's fine. But I would be cautious about taking any supplements on their own.""

""I think the bottom line is that cinnamon is a perfect pantry staple, a pleasant spice that can add flavor to foods for minimal calories, with antioxidant properties that may give an edge to those looking to better control their blood sugar,"" Drayer agreed. ""But we need to see more research before we can make any solid health claims linking cinnamon to reduce risk of disease or improved health.""","Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170807181545-herbs-and-spices-cinnamon-super-tease.jpg,"['studies', 'medical', 'powerhouse', 'cinnamon', 'blood', 'work', 'staple', 'sugar', 'research', 'health', 'pantry', 'diabetes', 'wright', 'study']", ,none
29,29,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,How to help your kids transition to high school - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/how-to-help-your-kids-transition-to-high-school-81018,"At this time of year, it can sometimes be hard to tell who’s more excited about returning to school, youth or their parents.

But the excitement for kids about new friends, teachers and ventures can be overshadowed by anxiety and stress, particularly if they’re moving into high school.

The sheer size of a high school building can be overwhelming to the uninitiated. The potential loss of social status among a larger group of peers and the increased number of teachers — each having different styles and expectations – can be intimidating for newcomers. Add to this the hormonal changes that accompany puberty and drive physical, emotional and cognitive growth, and the demands on young people can be overwhelming.

In high school, teachers tend to stay in one place while the students rotate through their classrooms. This can be difficult for students who are used to having a homeroom teacher for the majority of their subjects.

Some high schools have instituted homerooms for core subjects such as language arts and social studies. These allow students to connect daily to at least one key adult who knows them and ostensibly has their best interests in mind. Regrettably, this practice is rare past Grade 8.

Fortunately, parents and their children can take some steps to make the transition easier. As an educator and a psychologist from the Werklund School of Education at the University of Calgary, I offer you a few simple strategies:

1. Get to know the school space

Familiarity helps to reduce anxiety. If possible, youth should try to tour the school halls in advance to get to know where specific rooms are located. Of course, it helps if they can have a school map to help them navigate. It’s always important to learn where key spaces are such as the administrative offices, washrooms, cafeteria and water fountains.

2. Make the leap with a few friends

The adolescent years are significant in the transition from relying on parents to learning to trust and rely on peers. During this time, peer socialization becomes critically important and being part of a peer collective can make the transition smoother while helping to ease stress. Confidence in social interactions with peers contributes to positive self-evaluation and successful school transitions.

Youth can identify friends from their previous school who plan to attend the same high school. If they live close together, they can travel together to school or plan to meet up before school, at lunch breaks and during times when they might not have scheduled classes. Among other things, this will give them the opportunity to share and compare experiences — essentially normalizing what they are going through, while brainstorming solutions to challenges they might be facing.

3. Identify clubs and interest groups

These hobby-based groups tend to be smaller than regular classes and have supportive teacher sponsors with an interest in the subject area. This can be an easy way to connect with others who have similar interests, while building a support network at school.

Since the high school years are ones of exploration, novelty seeking and even risk-taking, such groups offer an opportunity to explore interests in a safe environment.

4. Help with planning and organization

In high school, there’s an increased expectation for students to take responsibility for planning and organizing materials for themselves, as well as getting to class on time, handing in homework and assignments and coming prepared for quizzes and exams. This also includes managing class materials, unique clothing for sports and clubs, musical instruments and other school equipment. Most schools offer a personal planner booklet that can help students to overcome some of these challenges. However, most will require support to be able to use and maintain them properly.

It’s true that adolescence is a time of cognitive growth and consolidation. This comes from the myelination of nerves (insulation for faster signals) and the pruning of neural networks (specialization for efficient brain function) that improve thinking capacities. However, the adolescent brain keeps developing well into the early 20s. Higher order thinking, planning and foresight can take time to develop.

5. Organize a study schedule

Family support and parental engagement are linked to academic success. It’s important to start building study habits early, even if there is no assigned homework to do. Students should plan for 30 to 60 minutes of study, homework and project work per night. It is often best to schedule a regular time, such as just before or after the family dinner.

Whatever the schedule, it’s also important to take breaks after school. And try to plan time carefully so that such work does not drag on and become demotivating.

6. Monitor stress

Even after settling into the new environment, getting to know teachers and their expectations and collecting a group of friends, the level of stress in high school can still be intense. Schools can be competitive environments. Exams (particularly high-stakes final exams) can be stressful to the point of debilitation. And social demands can be overwhelming.

Challenges like these can be exacerbated if students have unique needs such as physical or sensory impairments, learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or a mental health condition such as anxiety or depression. In cases where such challenges are known in advance, it is important to connect to the receiving school’s specialized supports, which often come in the form of guidance and counselling services and accessibility services.

Kids should also be monitored to ensure they’re coping with the demands being placed on them. Their ability to cope can change day to day and month to month, and parents should be ready to offer support when it’s needed. In some cases, stress can become overwhelming or persistent to the point of immobilization. If they aren’t experiencing reduced anxiety within a month, they likely need help.

If so, specialized professional support may be needed to identify the underlying problem and intervene appropriately. School counsellors can be a good place to start, while family doctors can often point the way toward a good child psychologist or counselling specialist.

With the right kind of planning and support, the transition to high school can be a life-changing and empowering one that can set your youth on the path toward an amazing future. Start now to plan for success.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/182853/original/file-20170821-12584-c4e514.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=32%2C16%2C5439%2C2637&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['high', 'help', 'school', 'kids', 'students', 'teachers', 'stress', 'social', 'support', 'important', 'transition', 'plan']", ,none
30,30,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Cities need more than air conditioning to get through heat waves - The Conversation - US,https://theconversation.com/cities-need-more-than-air-conditioning-to-get-through-heat-waves-81069,"When a heat wave is forecast, the standard advice is to drink plenty of water, take frequent breaks and wear sunscreen. But for extreme heat events, those steps may not be enough.

Over 30 percent of all weather-related deaths in the United States are attributable to high outdoor temperatures, heat stroke or sunstroke. And heat waves are expected to increase in intensity with climate change.

How should U.S. cities prepare for extreme heat events? My research shows that the answer isn’t clear-cut, and that they should pursue multiple solutions rather than looking for one “best” option.

How to cool off

In a 2016 article for the Michigan Journal of Sustainability, I explored how Cuyahoga County, Ohio addresses high temperatures. I chose northeast Ohio because it is one of the most vulnerable areas of the United States: The region has an older population, poor-quality housing stock and less central air conditioning than the national average.

Although Cleveland and its suburbs are at risk, public health experts view healthy housing and environmental programs developed there as national models. I also hoped that research results would be useful to other cities in the Great Lakes region.

I focused on the perceptions of a specific set of people – professionals from the health, building and urban sectors – because they have significant influence on how programs and policies are created. Professionals also tend to serve as experts, operating in a middle area between government officials and the public.

After attending numerous municipal meetings, reading reams of policy documents and completing dozens of interviews, I was surprised to find that local professionals disagreed on how to prepare for heat waves. Public health officials felt that cooling centers and air conditioning were critical. Energy efficiency experts wanted to see more funding spent on home energy efficiency. City planners called for increasing tree cover to shade pavement and buildings.

This made me wonder: If the experts don’t agree, is there one approach that works better than others?

Active, passive and urban cooling

Cooling centers and central air conditioning protect people by lowering indoor air temperature and humidity. However, not everyone can access cool locations like libraries or recreation centers during heat waves. Some people have limited mobility or lack access to transportation. For this reason, public health officials often tout residential air conditioning as an important intervention.

Unfortunately, air conditioning is an “active” system. It requires electricity and doesn’t work when the power is out. This is a problem because as the mercury climbs, blackouts also increase.

As a result, building energy efficiency experts are interested in “passive” cooling systems – solutions that don’t depend on the electrical grid. Window shades, light-colored building materials and radiant barriers in attics are time-honored techniques. If the power goes out, these systems can still help. This is called improving “passive survivability.”

But while these techniques moderate interior temperatures, indoor conditions are still typically within a few degrees of the outdoor air temperature. This means that if it’s over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) in the afternoon, it’s still going to be in the 90°F (32°C) range indoors. Passive systems alone won’t help vulnerable populations like the elderly ride out extreme heat events.

This is why city planners advocate for planting street trees to promote urban cooling. Leafy trees and shrubs provide shade and increase evaporation of water from the ground, cooling the air. But like passive systems, these approaches serve only to moderate local temperatures. If a massive heat wave settles over a region, it’s still going to be extremely hot outside.

Since no approach is foolproof, why not apply apply all of these strategies? One challenge is that with limited funding, there may not be enough money to go around.

Moreover, these strategies may actually conflict with one another. Air conditioning systems reduce interior temperatures, but they increase household energy consumption, undoing the work of energy efficiency experts. In addition, air conditioners exhaust waste heat from inside houses to the outdoors, further warming surrounding neighborhoods.

To address these conflicts, we need to make stronger connections between the environmental health science, building science and urban climate communities. Fortunately, cities like Cleveland are making strides in this direction.

Collaborative cooling

With support from the Kresge Foundation’s Climate Resilience and Urban Opportunity Initiative, the city of Cleveland, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, the Cleveland Urban Design Collaborative and the Resilient Buildings Lab at the University at Buffalo recently hosted a series of neighborhood discussions to better understand how climate change will affect Cleveland neighborhoods. One major concern is preparing for future heat waves.

The effort, led by Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, generated a series of climate adaptation strategies, including complementary ideas to reduce heat stress at the house, block, neighborhood and city levels. These ideas were incorporated into a climate resilience plan to guide local efforts.

Although it’s still early in the process, results from this collaborative effort are encouraging. Community members are engaging with city staff and preparing climate emergency kits to distribute to residents. These kits will contain information on cooling centers, weather radios to keep residents informed, and guidance on stocking food and water to ride out a multi-day emergency without power.

Scholars from university health, architecture and planning departments are also discussing heat preparedness challenges with the Cleveland emergency operations center and local community development corporations. Current efforts focus on setting up additional cooling centers, weatherizing homes and using vacant lots as green space to buffer temperatures.

In Cleveland, preparing for extreme heat events has brought professionals together and encouraged overlapping approaches because no single strategy is foolproof. Other cities, like Baltimore and Providence, are working on similar multifaceted approaches.

No city wants to repeat what happened in Chicago in 1995, when approximately 700 people died during a week-long heat wave. But with a collaborative approach to heat wave planning, perhaps cities cities can lower the risk of harm from hot weather.","Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/181091/original/file-20170805-2386-my0n4j.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C358%2C2048%2C993&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['need', 'experts', 'health', 'waves', 'city', 'cooling', 'air', 'cleveland', 'conditioning', 'cities', 'climate', 'heat', 'urban']", ,none
31,31,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Photoinduced nanobubble-driven superfast diffusion of nanoparticles imaged by 4D electron microscopy - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701160,"Dynamics of active or propulsive Brownian particles in nonequilibrium status have recently attracted great interest in many fields including artificial micro/nanoscopic motors and biological entities. Understanding of their dynamics can provide insight into the statistical properties of physical and biological systems far from equilibrium. We report the translational dynamics of photon-activated gold nanoparticles (NPs) in water imaged by liquid-cell four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D-EM) with high spatiotemporal resolution. Under excitation of femtosecond laser pulses, we observed that those NPs exhibit superfast diffusive translation with a diffusion constant four to five orders of magnitude greater than that in the absence of laser excitation. The measured diffusion constant follows a power-law dependence on the laser fluence and a linear increase with the laser repetition rate, respectively. This superfast diffusion of the NPs is induced by a strong random driving force arising from the photoinduced steam nanobubbles (NBs) near the NP surface. In contrast, the NPs exhibit a superfast ballistic translation at a short time scale down to nanoseconds. Combining with a physical model simulation, this study reveals a photoinduced NB propulsion mechanism for propulsive motion, providing physical insights into better design of light-activated artificial micro/nanomotors. The liquid-cell 4D-EM also provides the potential of studying other numerical dynamical behaviors in their native environments.

Active Brownian particles generally engage in both translational and rotational motion, where the translational dynamics are particularly significant for applications of artificial micro/nanomotors. Here, we chose symmetric gold NPs and studied their translational dynamics in water under femtosecond laser pulse excitation in both diffusive and ballistic regimes by 4D-EM. We systematically investigated the laser fluence and repetition rate dependence of the particle translational dynamics. Under repetitive laser pulse excitation, the NPs exhibit a superfast diffusive translation with a diffusion constant following a power-law dependence on the fluence and a linear increase with the repetition rate, respectively. In contrast, the NPs exhibit a superfast ballistic translation at a short time scale down to nanoseconds. A full picture of rapid nucleation, expansion, detachment, and collapse of steam nanobubbles (NBs) around the gold NP was directly visualized during the particle translation. Combining with physical model simulation, a photoinduced NB propulsion mechanism for propulsive motion was revealed, in which the particles were propelled by strong random driving forces arising from the photoinduced steam NBs. In addition, the threshold laser fluence for explosive boiling (generation of steam) around a single gold NP was experimentally determined.

Over the past decade, active Brownian motion far from equilibrium status ( 3 – 7 ) has attracted increasing interest due to the great potential of using autonomous micro/nanomachinery in biomedical applications ( 8 ). For a Brownian object, an external driving force could drive it out of equilibrium to realize the autonomous motion ( 9 ). Notable examples of these out-of-equilibrium systems range from biological entities, such as bacteria ( 10 ) and motile cells ( 11 ), to artificial micro/nanomotors ( 12 – 14 ). They present the potential as autonomous agents for delivering nanoscopic objects to targeted positions, such as in noninvasive microsurgery ( 15 ) and drug delivery ( 16 , 17 ), where the interplay between the external activations and the internal fluctuations from the nature of the systems leads to a complex behavior of their dynamics. So far, a number of different propulsion mechanisms have been proposed for artificial micro/nanomotors. Most of these mechanisms are based on a scheme that the micro/nanomotors act as an engine and generate a propulsive force owing to the following: magnetic field ( 18 ), electric field ( 19 ), special flow field induced by a gradient of osmotic pressure or temperature ( 20 – 23 ), and catalytic decomposition ( 24 ). However, the diffusion process or the directional motion of the micro/nanomotors by these propulsion mechanisms is relatively slow, where the average speed is usually below several micrometers per second. It has been reported that the nucleation and growth of oxygen or hydrogen bubbles through a chemically catalytic reaction could lead to an efficient propulsion of tubular microjets ( 25 – 27 ), where the average speed could be up to 10 mm/s ( 28 ). As shown in the first experimental observation of the bubble propulsion and the instantaneous velocity damping due to liquid drag of the tubular microjets at low Reynolds number ( 25 ), the microjets presented discrete velocity peaks over time because of the cyclic formation and expansion of bubbles at the tube end, which was distinct from their counterparts at the macroscopic scale. This unique motion behavior at low Reynolds number makes the tubular microjets promising for applications in noninvasive microsurgery and micro-object delivery ( 29 ). This chemically powered gas bubble propulsion usually requires hydrogen peroxide fuel or highly acidic-/salt-rich environments, and real-time observation of the velocity peak evolution induced by a gas bubble requires high temporal resolution. On the other hand, the dynamical phenomenon of superfast propulsive motion of Brownian objects, especially nanoscale objects, is still far from being understood due to the lack of a proper liquid-phase imaging technique with high spatiotemporal resolution. The development of four-dimensional electron microscopy (4D-EM) provides the promising capability of imaging nanoscale objects at an ultrafast time scale ( 30 – 32 ). Recently, we have successfully extended 4D-EM to include liquid cells and made the liquid-phase 4D imaging no longer limited by the response of the detector ( 33 ). In that work, we demonstrated 4D imaging of the rotational dynamics of nanoparticle (NP) dimers in aqueous solution and studied the morphological asymmetry effect on their rotational behaviors.

Back in 1827, using an optical microscope, the botanist Robert Brown first observed the jittery motion of small suspended particles and found that each moving step of the particle was independent of the previous one ( 1 ). This random motion of the particles, now known as passive Brownian motion, was first interpreted by Einstein in 1905 as the amplification of thermal fluctuations: A Brownian particle receives momentum from the surrounding molecule collisions, but its movement is dissipated by the viscosity of the liquid ( 2 ).

RESULTS

4D imaging of NPs in liquid To image the translational dynamics of photon-activated gold NPs in liquid with high spatiotemporal resolution, the solution containing spherical gold NPs (~80 nm in diameter; with strong optical absorption at the excitation wavelength through localized surface plasmon enhancement) was sealed between two electron-transparent, 20-nm-thick silicon nitride membranes with a liquid thickness of ~300 nm. Details of the preparation protocol of the liquid cell are described in Materials and Methods and are also available elsewhere (33–35). The liquid cell was then integrated to our 4D-EM for dynamical measurement (see Fig. 1). In 4D-EM, green femtosecond laser pulses were used to trigger the dynamics, whereas precisely timed electron pulses were used to image the particle motion (see Materials and Methods), where the time resolution is not limited by the response of the detector inside the electron microscope. For the measurement at long times, repetitive femtosecond laser pulses (with wavelength of 520 nm and pulse duration of 350 fs) were used to activate a single NP, whereas a continuous electron beam with a low electron dose was presented to trace the trajectory of the NP motion. At a short time scale, single-pulse imaging methodology was used to capture the transient morphologies of the NP activated by a single femtosecond laser pulse, where the images were acquired by a single precisely timed electron pulse at specific delays. Details of the procedure are also available in the previous studies from this group (32, 33). Fig. 1 Schematic of photon-activated gold NP diffusion in liquid imaged by 4D-EM. Infrared femtosecond laser pulses (1040 nm; pulse duration of 350 fs) were used to generate green femtosecond laser pulses (520 nm) via second harmonic generation, which were directed to the liquid cell integrated in the transmission electron microscope (TEM) to trigger the particle dynamics in liquid. Ultraviolet (UV) nanosecond laser pulses (266 nm; pulse duration of 10 ns) were directed to the photocathode inside the TEM to generate electron pulses, which were accelerated to 120 keV to image the particle dynamics. The femtosecond laser pump pulse and nanosecond electron probe pulse were synchronized by a digital delay generator, which controls the time delay between them. For the time-resolved imaging at long times, a continuous thermal emission electron beam with a low electron dose was present to image the NP diffusion under repetitive femtosecond laser pulse excitation, whereas for the time-resolved imaging at short time scale, a single femtosecond laser pulse triggered the NP motion and a precisely timed electron pulse was used to image the transient NP morphologies at specific time delays, where the time resolution was unlimited by the response of the charge-coupled device (CCD).

Superfast translational dynamics in diffusive regime We traced the translational dynamics of a single photon-activated gold NP at a long time scale by continuous electron beam imaging mode (see Materials and Methods). A set of typical snapshots of the NP translational motion under repetitive femtosecond laser pulse excitation (fluence of 2.3 mJ/cm2, repetition rate of 1 kHz) at different times is presented in Fig. 2A. Before excitation (0 s), the NP inside the thin-layer solution sandwiched in the liquid cell was weakly bound near the substrate surface by weak electrostatic interaction (36, 37). Upon excitation, the NP was activated to move randomly due to rapid nucleation, expansion, detachment, and collapse of the visible steam NBs around the particle surface (see Fig. 2A and movie S1). Note that the number, size, and nucleation position of the NBs were independent at different times. The long-time visibility of these steam NBs under repetitive laser pulse excitation will be discussed later. Two typical trajectories of the NP under repetitive laser pulse excitation with different fluences (2.0 and 2.3 mJ/cm2) are displayed in the left column of Fig. 2 (B and C), respectively, whereas their corresponding displacement distributions along x and y directions (with Gaussian distribution) are shown in the right column. These trajectories and Gaussian displacement distributions indicate that the particle translates in a manner of random walk and that the range of its displacements increases with the fluence, indicating the faster translation of the particle at the higher laser fluence. Fig. 2 Typical snapshots and trajectories of photon-activated gold NP diffusion in liquid. (A) Typical snapshots of a gold NP diffusion under 1-kHz laser pulse (fluence of 2.3 mJ/cm2) excitation at the different times. The NP was driven to move by rapid nucleation, expansion, detachment, and collapse of the photoinduced steam NBs near the particle surface (see the circles with white contrast). (B and C) Two typical trajectories (left column) of the gold NP diffusion and the corresponding displacement distributions along x and y (right column) at different laser fluences of 2.0 and 2.3 mJ/cm2, respectively. The dashed black lines in the right column of (B) and (C) show the Gaussian fit, which indicate that the NP translates in a manner of random walk. To understand the statistical properties of the translational dynamics of the photon-activated gold NP, its mean square displacements (MSDs) under different laser fluences (1.6 to 3.0 mJ/cm2; repetition rate of 1 kHz) are presented in Fig. 3A. The detailed calculation of MSDs is described in Materials and Methods. All the measured MSDs almost show a linear relation with time, that is, MSD ∝ t, following a substantial increase in the slope with increasing laser fluence. These linear MSDs demonstrate that the photon-activated gold NP exhibits a diffusive behavior, which is similar to conventional passive Brownian motion. However, the diffusion constant in our observations exhibits a power-law dependence on the laser fluence as D ∝ (J − J c )2.2 for J ≥ J c (see the fit curve in Fig. 3B), and its value (1.2 × 103 to 36 × 103 nm2/s) is four to five orders of magnitude greater than that of the conventional Brownian motion of gold NPs without photon activation (36). The parameter J c is the minimum laser fluence (threshold) required to raise water above its boiling temperature for the water molecule evaporation near the gold NP surface, namely, the threshold of explosive boiling around a single gold NP (38). The retrieved threshold value of the fluence from the fit is 1.25 mJ/cm2, which agrees well with the experimental observation that, below a fluence of ~1.3 mJ/cm2, the laser heating of the NP is insufficient to generate any steam to actuate the NP to move. Moreover, at a fixed laser fluence (J = 3.2 mJ/cm2), the diffusion of the gold NP becomes faster as the laser repetition rate increases (see the MSDs in Fig. 3C), and the diffusion constant is proportional to the repetition rate (see Fig. 3D). From these results, an intuitive mechanism for the superfast diffusion of the photon-activated NP under repetitive laser pulse excitation emerges. Owing to the strong local photothermal effect because of the localized surface plasmon–enhanced optical absorption of the gold NP at the laser wavelength, the particle is heated up in hundreds of picoseconds (39–41). This results in a rapidly raised temperature over the boiling point of the neighboring water molecules that evaporate into steam (42). This water steam would nucleate as NBs on the NP surface (38, 43, 44). Consequently, these steam NBs expand, detach, and collapse, inducing a random driving force on the NP to propel its motion, where the instantaneous velocity of the NP is damped by the fluid drag. Unlike the random force arising from the fluid molecule collisions in passive Brownian motion, it is the random force arising from the photoinduced steam and NBs near the NP surface that dominates the superfast diffusion. The radiation pressure or optical trapping force induced by the laser pulse is negligible compared to the strong driving force arising from the NBs. In our experiment, the NPs are much smaller than the size of the laser beam (diameter of ~35 μm); therefore, the radiation pressure along the z axis has negligible impact on the NP diffusion in the x-y plane, and the optical trapping due to a light intensity gradient in the x-y plane is insignificant. No motion of the gold NP was observed when the laser fluence was below the threshold for generating steam around the NP.

Translational dynamics in ballistic regime Using the single-pulse imaging mode of 4D-EM, we further studied the transient dynamics of the photon-activated gold NPs at a short time scale down to nanoseconds. Figure 4A presents the typical imaging result of the transient translation process of a gold NP induced by a single femtosecond laser pulse excitation with a fluence of 7.8 mJ/cm2. The first and second columns show the typical single-pulse images of the NP before the laser pulse and at specific delays (25, 40, and 60 ns; similar single-pulse images of more delay points are not shown here), respectively, whereas their corresponding difference images are shown in the third column. The red and blue dashed circles in the difference images indicate the initial position and the position of the NP at specific delays, respectively. Apparently, the displacement of the NP increases with the delay time. By considering the ballistic feature of the Brownian motion at a short time scale (45–48), we assume for simplicity that for each single-pulse imaging measurement on the same, single gold NP with the same laser fluence, (i) the driving force on the NP has similar magnitude (the direction of the force may be random), and (ii) the NP is in the same liquid environment. Therefore, we plotted the displacements of the same NP at different delays in Fig. 4B to evaluate its time-dependent displacement evolution in the ballistic regime. We only traced the magnitude of the displacement, not the direction of translation in each single-pulse imaging measurement. The displacement increases very slowly in the first 25 ns and then grows fast from 25 to 60 ns (nearly linear increase), followed by a very slow increase to a saturation level after about 80 ns. This result demonstrates that upon the femtosecond laser pulse excitation, the NP was accelerated and obtained a momentum in 20 to 30 ns due to the photoinduced steam and NBs near the particle surface, and then its velocity and translation were damped in hundreds of nanoseconds by the surrounding drag, including both the liquid friction and the interaction from the substrate. The velocity of the NP (from 20 to 60 ns) was estimated to be ~6 m/s, which is three orders of magnitude faster than that of the conventional passive Brownian motion in the ballistic regime (48). Therefore, the nature of the photon-activated Brownian motion is similar to the passive one at the short time range (both are ballistic), but the former one has a much higher velocity due to the strong impulsive driving force induced by the photoinduced steam NBs. Fig. 4 Single-pulse imaging of a photon-activated gold NP in the ballistic regime. (A) Single-pulse images of the photon-activated NP at three specific delay times. The images in the first and second columns are the states of the NP before the laser pulse and at specific delays of 25, 40, and 60 ns after the laser pulse (fluence of 7.8 mJ/cm2), respectively. The third column shows the corresponding difference images obtained by subtracting the single-pulse image before the laser pulse from that at the short delay time. The red and blue dashed circles indicate the NP positions before the laser pulse and at short delays after the laser pulse, respectively. (B) Evolution of the displacement of the NP as a function of delay time with a physical model fit. The inset shows the image of the measured gold NP.

Visibility of NBs in the liquid cell We showed experimentally that the translational motion of the NPs was propelled by strong random driving forces arising from the photoinduced steam NBs. In the continuous electron beam images (see Fig. 2A and movie S1), the steam NBs were visualized when the gold NP was under repetitive laser pulse excitation with a fluence above the threshold. However, it was difficult to distinguish NBs in the single-pulse images with only a single laser pulse excitation (Fig. 4A). The reasons are as follows: (i) There are only ~105 electrons in one electron pulse, and the image contrast is low in the single-pulse imaging mode; (ii) the steam NBs with a single laser pulse excitation are initially very small and invisible and are difficult to grow into big visible NBs before collapse or dissolution. Nevertheless, under repetitive laser pulse excitation, which causes continuous heating accumulation, the small invisible steam NBs would coalesce with their neighboring ones and grow into big visible NBs. Therefore, the repetitive excitation–induced continuous heating accumulation is necessary to form the big visible steam NBs. Because of the continuous heating accumulation, these big visible NBs involve several subsequent processes: nucleation of small invisible steam NBs, merging of small NBs, detachment from NPs, and expansion of the merged NBs; thus, they were present for subseconds to seconds in the continuous electron beam images (Fig. 2A and movie S1). It should be noted that the duration of the impulsive forces is only involved in a portion of the whole process, namely, initial generation of steam, nucleation of small invisible NBs, and detachment/collapse from NPs.

Modeling of translational dynamics in diffusive regime To unravel the underlying mechanism for the observed superfast diffusion of the photon-activated gold NPs, theoretical simulation was performed at both long and short time scales. On the basis of Einstein’s theory, the 1D translational dynamics of an active Brownian particle can be generally reformulated in terms of a Langevin equation (49) as (1)where x is the particle displacement, γ is the damping factor due to surrounding friction force, A th (t) is the acceleration induced by the random force arising from the liquid molecule collisions, and A ext (t) is the acceleration executed by external activations. For the photon-activated gold NPs in our experiment, it is reasonable to consider that A ext (t) ≫ A th (t). For the dynamics at the long time scale, we proposed a simple physical model to analyze the MSD directly from the Langevin equation, with the assumption that A ext (t) consists of a comb of very short rectangular-shaped impulses that arise from the NBs induced by the repetitive laser pulse excitation with a duration of τ 0 and a time interval of T p (repetition rate is ). For the kth impulse, A ext (t) = A k (0)(H(t − kT p ) − H(t − τ 0 − kT p )), where H(t) is a Heaviside step function. The Langevin equation can be thus recast as (2) For simplicity, we assume the initial value x(0) = 0 and the velocity . Because there is neither correlation between the initial velocity and the impulsive forces nor correlation between the directions of the impulsive forces in different excitation circles, one has 〈u 0 A k (0)〉 = 0 and , where A ave (assumed to depend on the laser fluence) represents an average value of the comb of random impulses. Assuming that the damping constant γ is independent of liquid temperature and resolving the above Langevin equation (see Supplementary Text), we obtained a key formula for the MSD in the long time limit of as (3) Similarly, for a 2D case, , which is linear with respect to time t and agrees with our experimental results (Fig. 3, A and C). In analogy with Einstein’s linear law for a conventional 2D Brownian motion (MSD = 4Dt) (2), one can get an effective diffusion constant as , which has a quadratic dependence on the strength of the average impulsive acceleration. Because A ave is proportional to the laser fluence J − J c (J c is the threshold fluence required to raise the temperature to cause evaporation of the water molecules near the gold NP surface), the deduced effective diffusion constant should also follow a quadratic relation with the laser fluence, that is, D ∝ (J − J c )2 for J ≥ J c . Our experimental observation, D ∝ (J − J c )2.2 (see Fig. 3B), agrees well with the simulation. The small discrepancy of the exponent is probably due to temperature dependence of the liquid viscosity (related to the damping constant γ in Eq. 2), which slightly decreases with the temperature change of the surrounding liquid and steam NBs around the water boiling point. Furthermore, the predicted diffusion constant linearly increases with the impulse repetition rate at a given fluence, which is in line with the experimental result (see Fig. 3D). These agreements validate our hypothesis and the physical model for the photoinduced steam NB–driving mechanism.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701160/F1.large.jpg,"['np', 'gold', 'nbs', 'excitation', 'superfast', 'diffusion', 'imaged', 'nanobubbledriven', 'steam', 'pulse', 'motion', '4d', 'fluence', 'electron', 'microscopy', 'laser', 'photoinduced', 'nanoparticles']", ,none
32,32,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Shark fins sold for soup in Canada include many at-risk species - CBC.ca,https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/shark-fins-1.4262628,"Shark fins and manta ray gills found for sale in stores and markets in Vancouver and in China just a few years ago belonged mainly to species that are now listed as at-risk and banned for trade, DNA testing shows. Researchers led by Dirk Steinke at the University of Guelph found that 71 per cent of more than 100 samples tested belonged to species that are considered at risk of extinction, including the whale shark, the largest fish in the world. It has been listed as ""vulnerable"" by the International Union of Conservation since 2003.

Shark fins are traditionally made into soup that is served as an expensive delicacy — it can cost more than $100 per bowl — at Chinese banquets for special occasions such as weddings.

Manta and mobula ray gill rakers, thin filaments that the animals use to filter food from the water, are used in traditional Chinese medicine. According to the conservation group Manta Ray of Hope, they are promoted as a cure for ailments ranging from chickenpox to cancer in some Chinese communities.

Shark finning is also banned in some countries such as Canada because it involves removing the fin from a live shark and throwing the rest of the animal back in the water to die a slow death.

Steinke said he and his colleagues started the research after hearing reports about threatened species being fished, and after being approached by the Vancouver Animal Defence League, which had concerns that the shark fins were sold locally.

""We got curious for Canadians, especially in Vancouver,"" he said. He added that Canada is the largest importer of shark fins outside southeast Asia. According to Statistics Canada, in 2016, Canada imported 140,750 kilograms of shark fins worth $3.08 million.

'They're not cheap'

In 2011 and 2012, University of Guelph researchers and volunteers from the Vancouver Animal Defense League collected 71 dried shark fins from Vancouver stores and markets.

""It took them awhile to get the money together because they're not cheap,"" Steinke said.

Meanwhile, Scientists working with the Save Our Seas Shark Research Centre at Nova Southeastern University obtained 54 ray gill plates from Hong Kong and mainland China.

The samples were analyzed using a technique developed at the University of Guelph called DNA barcoding. The method allows individual species to be identified from small pieces of DNA.

Steinke said the technique for drying shark fins for sale actually helps preserve the DNA, making the testing relatively simple — as long as the fins haven't already been turned into soup.

The testing found 20 species of sharks and five species of rays. Of those species, 56 per cent are on the IUCN Red List as endangered or vulnerable, while 24 per cent are near threatened.

Trade, import bans

Seven of the shark species and all five of the ray species are banned from international trade under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species . The start of the trade bans mostly began between 2014 and 2017, after the samples were collected.

""However, the confirmed occurrence of these species' body parts in recent trade suggests ongoing market demands,"" the researchers wrote.

The proportion of threatened species is high considering that that three quarters of sharks and rays are not considered threatened with extinction — and the fact that Canada bans the import of fins of at-risk shark species.

Steinke said that's ""very frustrating, although not unexpected,"" given that rarer types of fins are worth more.

Shark fins, which cost between $366 and $489 Cdn. per pound, are on display inside a dried seafood store in Hong Kong, January 2, 2013. The price varies with the size and type of the fin. (Bobby Yip/Reuters)

He added that authorities don't have the resources to enforce laws about shark fins on a large scale, especially since there's no way to tell simply by looking what kind of dried shark fin you've come across.

Even if someone is caught and fined occasionally, shark fins are so valuable that selling illegal species ""might overall still pay off,"" Steinke said.

DNA testing — which now costs as little as $10 a sample, but can take several weeks — may make enforcement easier, he added.

Steinke hopes the research will raise public awareness about the issue.

""If demand goes down because people get more aware and say, 'I don't want to be a part of this' … the market gets a hit.""

He also hopes it might encourage politicians to ban shark fins on a larger scale. Shark fins are banned in more than a dozen municipalities across the country, but a private member's bills pushing for a federal ban failed in 2013 and in 2016.

The research was funded by the Government of Canada, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Save Our Seas Foundation and the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.4262693.1505750149!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ecuador.jpg,"['university', 'species', 'shark', 'soup', 'atrisk', 'fins', 'water', 'include', 'canada', 'ray', 'chinese', 'trade', 'vancouver', 'sold']", ,none
33,33,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Fishing to live: Time for action to support and protect small-scale fisheries - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/fishing-to-live-time-for-action-to-support-and-protect-small-scale-fisheries/,"Two-thirds of the caught fish that humans eat are taken by small-scale fishers, many using canoes carved from logs or stationary beach seine nets such as the rampani that dot India’s eastern coast.

Far from being relics of a bygone age, small-scale fisheries technologies and practices are usually well adapted to the ecological and social circumstances within which they operate. Yet small-scale fisheries often struggle to compete due to regulatory frameworks that tend to ignore them or that are tailored to the concerns of large commercial fleets, according to a new book published by FAO.

The Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines: Global Implementation offers more than 30 case studies ranging from Greenland to Zanzibar and addressing diverse issues including gender and sustainable resource use.

“ It’s time for policymakers to take concrete action – ranging from legislation, technical capacity development and especially engagement with the fishing communities themselves – to make sure the guidelines are implemented. Nicole Franz, lead officer on sustainable small-scale fishery, UN FAO

It serves as an initial report on progress in implementing the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication, endorsed in 2014 with the aim of bolstering the livelihoods of the 100 million+ people who work in the sector and increase their contribution to global food security and nutrition.

“Now it’s time for policymakers to take concrete action – ranging from legislation, technical capacity development and especially engagement with the fishing communities themselves – to make sure the guidelines are implemented,” says Nicole Franz, FAO’s lead officer on sustainable small-scale fishery issues.

Policy coherence – pursued through inter-ministerial collaboration on trade, environment, tourism as well as social and economic development issues – must be the keystone for protecting the rights and livelihoods of the often poor and marginalized people engaged in the world’s small-scale fisheries, she says.

“It’s going to be a long and windy path, but there are many entry points, so yes, we can do it,” Franz adds.

Ways of life and viable skills

One key issue for small-scale fisheries is tenure rights, which, the guidelines stress must be designed from a broad human rights perspective that takes into account the local complexities of small-scale fisheries.

For example, in the Solomon Islands, tenure rules are based on customary principles, restricting the right to fish only to locals and strictly defining how they do it and even requiring that catches not be sold but used only for household consumption, barter or ceremonial purposes. These customs can put non-indigenous fishers at a disadvantage.

Environmental protection

An emerging challenge is how to ensure continued access by small-scale fisherfolk to marine protected areas, where in some cases all fishing is prohibited. The trade-offs between conserving marine resources on the one hand and protecting the livelihoods and food security of vulnerable communities on the other need to be carefully considered.

Costa Rica, a leader in creating biodiversity protection zones, is with FAO’s help implementing the SSF Guidelines using a novel approach that actively engages small-scale fishers – many of whom are fairly recent and poor migrants from the countryside – as partners in dialogue in a bid to allow them to use more marine resources in a sustainable way.","Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/20360108665_5ccd803ccd_z.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['fishing', 'sustainable', 'protect', 'fisheries', 'smallscale', 'rights', 'guidelines', 'marine', 'support', 'security', 'ranging', 'action', 'livelihoods', 'live', 'franz']", ,none
34,34,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,The role of floridoside in osmoadaptation of coral-associated algal endosymbionts to high-salinity conditions - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1602047,"Abstract The endosymbiosis between Symbiodinium dinoflagellates and stony corals provides the foundation of coral reef ecosystems. The survival of these ecosystems is under threat at a global scale, and better knowledge is needed to conceive strategies for mitigating future reef loss. Environmental disturbance imposing temperature, salinity, and nutrient stress can lead to the loss of the Symbiodinium partner, causing so-called coral bleaching. Some of the most thermotolerant coral-Symbiodinium associations occur in the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea, which also represent the most saline coral habitats. We studied whether Symbiodinium alter their metabolite content in response to high-salinity environments. We found that Symbiodinium cells exposed to high salinity produced high levels of the osmolyte 2-O-glycerol-α-d-galactopyranoside (floridoside), both in vitro and in their coral host animals, thereby increasing their capacity and, putatively, the capacity of the holobiont to cope with the effects of osmotic stress in extreme environments. Given that floridoside has been previously shown to also act as an antioxidant, this osmolyte may serve a dual function: first, to serve as a compatible organic osmolyte accumulated by Symbiodinium in response to elevated salinities and, second, to counter reactive oxygen species produced as a consequence of potential salinity and heat stress.

INTRODUCTION Coral reefs are biodiversity hot spots of immense biological and economical value (1). The relationship between Symbiodinium—an autotrophic endosymbiotic dinoflagellate—and scleractinian corals form the basis of coral reef ecosystems (2). The coral host provides inorganic nutrients and carbon dioxide to the dinoflagellate in exchange for energy in the form of photosynthetically produced carbohydrates (3, 4). This symbiotic relationship is highly sensitive to environmental disturbance. For instance, increases in temperature, salinity, nutrients, and/or high solar irradiance can impair photosynthetic efficiency and enhance the formation of harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that must be detoxified by the organism via antioxidants and ROS scavengers (5–8). Otherwise, environmental stress can ultimately lead to coral bleaching, the visual whitening of corals due to loss of their endosymbionts (5, 8). As a consequence, increasing exposure to environmental stress, in particular to rising seawater temperatures, is threatening the existence of coral reefs at a global scale (9, 10). In comparison to the detrimental effects of elevated seawater temperatures, much less is known about the effects of increased salinities on corals and their endosymbionts. Yet, reef corals from the Red Sea and the Persian/Arabian Gulf (PAG) are commonly found at salinities of up to 41 [Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78)] in the Red Sea and up to 50 in the PAG, at summer temperatures exceeding 32° and 35°C in parts of the Red Sea and PAG, respectively (11–14). Both salinity and temperature in these regions are the highest globally to support reef growth (15). Although the osmotic response of Symbiodinium at the molecular level is virtually unknown (16–18), studies on free-living algae suggest that production and accumulation of compatible organic osmolytes (COOs), referred to as osmoadaptation (19), is the most widespread mechanism for adjusting intracellular osmotic pressure in response to elevated salinity; accumulation of inorganic ions and cell volume changes may occur as well. However, because the latter two processes are stressful and can disturb cellular function, they are not considered to represent viable long-term solutions for osmoadaptation (20–23). In contrast, the accumulation of COOs adjusts the osmotic pressure and protects proteins from increased ion concentrations (22). To test whether Symbiodinium is capable of synthesizing COOs, we subjected Symbiodinium strains from different clades and origins to conditions of high salinity, both in vitro and in their coral hosts (hereafter referred to as in hospite), and screened for the presence of COOs using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We hypothesized that Symbiodinium would increase cellular concentrations of COOs in response to elevated salinities and that the response would be similar in vitro and in hospite. Among the COOs employed by Symbiodinium, we identified the carbohydrates floridoside, inositol, and mannitol in vitro and in hospite. These compounds can act as both osmolytes and antioxidants, thereby having the potential capacity to convey osmoadaptation to increased salinities and the ability to counter ROS produced as a consequence of salinity or other forms of stress, including heat stress (6, 8, 24–30).

RESULTS High levels of floridoside in Symbiodinium exposed to high salinities We screened Symbiodinium cultures exposed to different salinities (that is, 25 for low salinity, 38 for ambient salinity, and 55 for high salinity) for the presence of carbohydrate COOs. A markedly high abundance of a compound at 31.5-min retention time in the GC-MS trace was detected in all four tested Symbiodinium cultures under high-salinity conditions (that is, Symbiodinium microadriaticum type A1, Symbiodinium sp. type A1, Symbiodinium minutum type B1, and Symbiodinium psygmophilum type B2) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This compound was identified as the derivative of floridoside [2-O-glycerol-α-d-galactopyranoside-(hexa-trimethylsilane)] by a search against the National Institute of Standards and Technology Mass Spectrometry (NIST MS) library with a reverse match factor of 971 of 1000 (table S1). Floridoside levels of Symbiodinium strains exposed to high salinity ranged from 50.3 ± 4.3 nmol (S. minutum) to 489.5 ± 31.9 nmol (S. psygmophilum) and were consistently represented among the most abundant carbohydrates quantified in this analysis (Table 1). In contrast, floridoside was nondetectable under low-salinity conditions for all Symbiodinium strains (Fig. 2A and Table 1). At an ambient salinity level of 38, floridoside was only detected in S. psygmophilum at a level of 51.0 ± 8.0 nmol (Fig. 2A and Table 1). This strain also accounted for the highest measured amounts of floridoside under a high-salinity level of 55 (489.5 ± 31.9 nmol). In comparison, inositol and mannitol were consistently present at low salinities and showed reduced levels at higher salinities for some strains (Table 1). Fig. 1 GC analysis of carbohydrate osmolyte diversity in S. psygmophilum at three salinity levels. Green, low-salinity level of 25; black, ambient-salinity level of 38; red, high-salinity level of 55. The trace from 26- to 32-min retention time (RT) shows a floridoside peak at 31.5-min RT. The abundances are normalized to an internal standard (ISTD). The chemical reaction depicts synthesis of floridoside (3) as a product of uridine diphosphate (UDP)–galactose (1) and glycerol 3-phosphate (2).

Osmolyte levels represent measured amounts (in nanomoles) per 105 cells ml-1. We identified several other metabolites in the same GC-MS trace and could quantify a total of five additional carbohydrates (that is, glycerol, glucose, galactose, ribose, and fructose) and four amino acids (that is, glycine, alanine, valine, and proline) that serve as putative osmolytes for each of our samples. Metabolite levels were significantly different between different salinities (except proline) and Symbiodinium strains, as well as combinations thereof (all P ANOVA < 0.01) (Table 2). This indicates that these metabolites are differentially regulated under changing salinities and in different Symbiodinium strains. Only the production of floridoside showed a substantial increase at high salinities, whereas the levels of all other metabolites (including mannitol and inositol) showed inconsistent patterns (Table 1).

Symbiodinium strain and salinity level are fixed factors, and strain*salinity serves as the interaction effect. Two-way ANOVA was used. Significance levels at P < 0.01 are in boldface. View this table: Because floridoside can be derived from glycerol and glucose/galactose (31), we investigated changes in the abundance of these molecules in detail (Fig. 3). In all Symbiodinium strains, a decrease in glycerol coincided with the accumulation of floridoside when comparing low- to high-salinity conditions (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Notably, glucose and galactose were enriched under high-salinity conditions in S. microadriaticum, Symbiodinium sp. type A1, and S. psygmophilum; it was only in S. minutum that these sugars remained at the same level or showed a slight decrease between low- and high-salinity conditions (Fig. 3 and Table 1).

Tukey’s post hoc tests were not performed if ANOVAs yielded a nonsignificant F ratio, designated as n.s. (not significant). Osmolyte levels represent measured amounts (in nanomoles) per 105 cells ml−1. High levels of floridoside in Symbiodinium from coral holobionts exposed to high salinities To assess the importance of floridoside in coral holobionts, we exposed the coral Porites lobata associated with Symbiodinium thermophilum originating from the southern PAG (11) to different salinities and measured floridoside levels. All samples exposed to high salinity displayed a substantial increase of floridoside (~6-fold increase) (Fig. 2B and table S2). We then compared floridoside levels in Symbiodinium from coral holobionts that show different capacities to survive at high salinities. We found that corals that were actively growing and surviving at a salinity of 42 for >24 months (that is, P. lobata and H. grandis) had higher floridoside levels than Porites lichen, which is only capable of surviving for a short period of time at this salinity (Fig. 2C and table S2) (11). We also checked for homologs of the putative enzyme that converts glycerol 3-phosphate to floridoside in the available genomes of the corals Acropora digitifera and Stylophora pistillata to assess whether coral hosts are, in principle, able to synthesize floridoside. Following the study of Pade et al. (31), we used the gene sequence that encodes the enzymatically active floridoside phosphate synthase/phosphatase from the red alga Galdieria sulphuraria (Gasu_26940) to search for homologs in coral. We found no homologs for the corals A. digitifera and S. pistillata. Conversely, we found putative full-length homologs of this gene in all available Symbiodinium genomes, that is, S. microadriaticum (Smic14738, Smic32192, and Smic6078), S. minutum (symbB.v1.2.003359, symbB.v1.2.013114, and symbB.v1.2.013196), and Symbiodinium kawagutii (Skav203497). Hence, the coral genomes investigated do not harbor the floridoside phosphate synthase/phosphatase enzyme required to produce floridoside.

DISCUSSION Here, we determined levels of the carbohydrates floridoside, inositol, and mannitol in response to high salinity in Symbiodinium in vitro and in hospite to assess the capacity of these COOs to fulfill a function in osmoadaptation to high salinities. Notably, other osmolytes that were not measured in our study, for example, taurines, betaines, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (32–34), might also contribute to the osmoadaptation of Symbiodinium. Consequently, our data should not be considered a complete assessment of all osmolytes in Symbiodinium. However, we identified the osmolyte floridoside consistently and in increased amounts in Symbiodinium at high salinities. This shows that cultured Symbiodinium cells produce floridoside in response to salinity stress. We also found elevated floridoside levels in Symbiodinium of corals capable of long-term survival under high-salinity conditions (P. lobata and H. grandis). Hence, our work has uncovered a putative key COO that allows Symbiodinium to osmoadapt to extreme salinities in vitro and in hospite. The fact that our results show a consistent accumulation of floridoside across a range of Symbiodinium strains and experimental conditions provides strong support for the notion that increased floridoside levels constitute part of the osmoadaptive response to high salinities. Our findings also provide insight for our understanding of the role of osmoadaptation in the coral-Symbiodinium endosymbiosis, with implications for the coral stress response, as further discussed below. Floridoside as a key osmolyte in Symbiodinium Synthesis of the osmolyte floridoside has been identified as a conserved pathway in evolutionary distinct organisms, such as red algae, green algae, and Cryptophyceae (24, 31, 35). Floridoside is produced by UDP galactosyltransferases via condensation of glycerol 3-phosphate and UDP-galactose (31). UDP-galactose demands can be supplied via starch mobilization, resulting in increased glucose/galactose pools, as described for the green algae Dunaliella sp. under conditions of high salinity (36). A similar mechanism might explain the increased levels of glucose (in cultures of S. microadriaticum and Symbiodinium sp. type A1) and galactose (in all cultured strains) that we measured in Symbiodinium at high salinity (Fig. 3 and Table 1). The consistent increase of glucose and galactose in concert with up-regulation of floridoside suggests that these compounds fulfill a conserved osmotic adjustment function within the genus Symbiodinium (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Notably, the different Symbiodinium strains exhibited a differential response in regard to absolute floridoside production levels, but these differences did not follow a geographic (considering salinity levels at origin) or phylogenetic pattern (Fig. 3). Besides UDP-galactose, the second component required for floridoside synthesis, glycerol 3-phosphate, is likely supplied from photosynthesis or via the Calvin cycle (37). Glycerol 3-phosphate can be produced from glycerol, which is considered to be one of the main COOs in marine algae (38), although it has been shown to be released under osmotic pressure in Symbiodinium (16, 18, 39). Given that our analysis on available Symbiodinium genomes confirmed the presence of homologs for the enzyme that produces floridoside, it will be interesting to check for the presence and identity of the enzyme(s) required for floridoside synthesis in ecologically relevant Symbiodinium (for example, S. thermophilum) and to determine whether gene expression or duplication can be aligned with strain- or species-specific differences (40). Osmoadaptation in the coral-Symbiodinium endosymbiosis, with implications for the coral stress response Our results demonstrate that exposure to high salinities leads to higher endosymbiont floridoside levels in vitro and in hospite. This may point to the fact that elevated floridoside levels increase not only the capacity of Symbiodinium, but also that of the holobiont, to cope with the effect of high osmotic pressure in extreme environments. Furthermore, our results suggest that osmolarity changes within the coral tissue are noticed by endosymbiotic Symbiodinium; thus, both the coral and Symbiodinium respond to salinity changes, presumably by adjusting the inner osmolarity to the higher outside salinity. However, it remains to be determined whether Symbiodinium adjust their inner osmolarity the same way in hospite as in vitro (32). Since potentially any metabolite contributes to the osmolarity in hospite, the endosymbiotic environment in coral cells might differ from the in vitro seawater environment (38). Beyond its function as an osmolyte, floridoside has been shown to act as an antioxidant with ROS-scavenging properties (25, 26). Hence, floridoside has the capability to convey osmoadaptation as well as to counter ROS produced in response to salinity or other forms of stress (6, 8, 24, 26–28). In particular, increased ROS is detrimental to photosystem II in photosynthetic organisms (5, 41–43). Therefore, the production of antioxidants at high salinities is potentially important for Symbiodinium, and floridoside represents an osmolyte that fulfills a ROS-scavenging function at the same time (26). Increasing levels of floridoside and oxidative stress in response to increased salinities were shown in the red algae Gracilaria sordida (44) and Gracilaria corticata (45), respectively. Future work should determine the exact role that floridoside plays in response to conditions of high salinity, as either an antioxidant, a COO, or both, for example, by comparing floridoside and ROS levels at ambient and increased salinities. The notion that ROS-producing mechanisms for photosynthetic organisms are similar (if not identical) under salinity and heat stress (42) also has interesting implications for our understanding of the response to heat stress in Symbiodinium and, by extension, for the coral hosts. Similar to salt stress, heat stress results in malfunction of the photosynthetic machinery of Symbiodinium and in the production of ROS that may damage the algal cells and, in the case of the coral-algal endosymbiosis, may trigger bleaching (46). We find that Symbiodinium exposed to high salinity in vitro and in hospite accumulate high amounts of floridoside. Hence, elevated floridoside levels in high-salinity environments may increase the ability to tolerate heat stress in Symbiodinium and, by extension, their coral hosts through scavenging of increased ROS levels. Consequently, the thermal resilience of coral holobionts may potentially increase under conditions of high salinity because of the accumulation and inherent antioxidative capabilities of floridoside. Experimental data connecting increased floridoside levels to decreased ROS and bleaching levels at increased salinities are in demand to support this potential link.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Symbiodinium cultures S. microadriaticum CCMP2467 (type A1; originally isolated from S. pistillata, Red Sea, Gulf of Aqaba) (40), Symbiodinium sp. type A1 (originally isolated from Astreopora sp., Central Red Sea) (47), S. minutum Mf1.05b (type B1; isolated from Orbicella faveolata, Florida Keys, United States) (48, 49), and S. psygmophilum Mf10.14b.02 (type B2; isolated from Oculina diffusa, Bermuda, UK) (50, 51) were cultured in f/2 medium without silicium under a photon flux of 108 μmol m−2 s−1 at 26°C (52). The f/2 medium was prepared from sterile filtered Red Sea water [with a salinity of 38 and complemented with NaNO 3 , NaH 2 PO 4 , vitamins, and trace metals (53)]. For each strain, we used replicate culture flasks and prepared three salt-adjusted f/2 media [salinities of 25, 38, and 55; following the study of van der Merwe et al. (54)] either by adding appropriate amounts of NaCl or by diluting the media with double-distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O). Triplicates of 5 ml of Symbiodinium cultures at exponential growth (105 to 106 cells ml−1) were transferred to 35 ml of salt-adjusted f/2 media for each salinity and incubated for 4 hours under culturing conditions. Symbiodinium cells were subsequently harvested by centrifugation (4500g, 10 min, 4°C). Cells were counted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To do this, 1 ml of each Symbiodinium culture was collected and fixed with formalin. After washing, samples were resuspended in 1 ml of ddH 2 O and labeled with SYBR Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific), of which 150-μl aliquots were supplied for FACS (50-μl counting volume). FACS measurements were conducted in triplicate on a cell analyzer (LSRFortessa, BD Biosciences). Stained DNA or RNA was excited via a 488-nm blue laser and emission-detected for total nucleotide detection (Alexa Fluor 488 filters, Life Technologies). Detection of valid signals was a combined measure of forward and side scattering and of both fluorescence signals (that is, SYBR Gold and chlorophyll autofluorescence). FACS data were analyzed by FlowJo 10 flow cytometry analysis software (FlowJo LLC). Coral cultures Corals were kept in long-term culture (>24 months) in different compartments of the experimental coral mesocosm facility at the University of Southampton at salinity levels mimicking those of their habitats of origin [salinity of 42 for P. lobata from the PAG (11) and salinity of ~36.5 for P. lichen and H. grandis from the Indo-Pacific (11, 55, 56)]. P. lobata was additionally cultured under a reduced salinity condition of 34 for >24 months. Corals were kept at a temperature of 26°C with a 10-hour/14-hour light/dark cycle under a photon flux of 150 μmol m−2 s−1 (11). Light and temperature levels suitable for long-term culture of the corals were established during previous work (55, 56). These three species were studied owing to their different capacity for survival at elevated salinities: P. lichen associated with Symbiodinium sp. type C96 exhibits short-term survival (11), whereas P. lobata with S. thermophilum (11, 14) and H. grandis with Symbiodinium sp. type C40 both show long-term survival. Survival capacity was determined before the experiment by incubating 10 replicate colonies for >24 months at a salinity of 42. In contrast to other Indo-Pacific species (including P. lichen) (11), P. lobata and H. grandis have not suffered any mortality and have been actively growing during this time (56). In the present experiments, replicate colonies of P. lichen and H. grandis previously cultured at lower salinities (34 and 36.5) were gradually adjusted to a high salinity of 42 over 2 days before being moved to the high-salinity compartment for 12 days before sampling. Replicate colonies were produced by earlier fragmentation. Using an airbrush, coral tissue was blasted off the skeleton with ice-cold, sterile-filtered, freshly prepared artificial seawater with the same salinity as the culture-rearing water. Three coral colonies were used per species to extract zooxanthellae. Symbiodinium cells were precipitated from the homogenate by centrifugation at 2500g for 5 min at 4°C. The cells were washed twice (to remove the host tissue fraction and to prevent residual salt to infer with the downstream GC-MS analyses), first in precooled seawater and then in ddH 2 O, each step followed by centrifugation and resuspension. Exposure to ddH 2 O was limited to ~30 s to minimize potential effects of the hypo-osmotic environment. It should also be noted that because of the slow diffusion of water through the cell wall/membrane, the Symbiodinium cells experienced only a minimal influx of water and were protected from bursting by their rigid cell walls. Furthermore, any water that had entered the cells was removed in the process of freeze-drying and hence could not interfere with osmolyte downstream analysis. After the final centrifugation step, all liquid was removed, and the cell pellet was lyophilized for 14 hours. Although this procedure might still retain traces of host animal tissue/cells and osmolyte profiles may contain a host component, we consider the potential carry-over minor, in particular because corals do not seem to harbor the gene to produce floridoside. Metabolite extraction and recovery Cell pellets from Symbiodinium cultures and Symbiodinium extracted from coral tissues were resuspended and washed with 30 ml of sterile seawater on ice, pelleted, and washed for ~30 s, with further 5 ml of ddH 2 O to remove residual salt. After a further centrifugation step, pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ddH 2 O, and cells were disrupted by tip ultrasonication for 4 min at 3-s pulsing and 6-s pause. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000g for 20 min at 4°C. Proteins, DNA, or RNA was removed by ethanol precipitation by adding nine parts of −20°C ethanol to one part of supernatant. The precipitate was pelleted and removed by centrifugation, whereas the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Dry samples were dissolved in 240 μl of ddH 2 O, spiked with 10 μl of internal standard [HBA (1 μg/μl) in ddH 2 O], transferred into GC vials, and dried under vacuum. For derivatization, 50 μl of MOX reagent (2% methoxamine HCl in pyridine) was added to each sample, and the solution was heated to 75°C for 1 hour. Afterward, 100 μl of MSTFA solution [N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, 1% trimethylchlorosilane; Thermo Scientific] was added, and samples were heated for 1 hour at 75°C. Each sample vial was centrifuged at 2000g for 10 min, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to glass inserts placed inside GC vials. GC-MS analysis, quantification, and analysis Derivatized carbohydrates, amino acids, and further intracellular compounds were characterized and quantified by GC-MS. For separation, an HP-5ms column (Agilent Technologies) and a temperature profile starting at 70°C were chosen. Temperature was increased in increments of 6°C min−1 up to 230°C, followed by increments of 60°C min−1 to a maximum of 280°C where it was held for 4 min. Metabolites were quantified by standard curves produced with pure glucose (99.5%; Sigma) and glycerol (≥99.5%, ACS Reagent–grade; Sigma), with 60, 30, 10, 1, and 0.1 μg of both compounds. The calibration standards were spiked with 1 μg of HBA, derivatized for GC-MS, and analyzed as described above. All samples were prepared and measured in triplicate. GC-MS data were processed (that is, background subtraction, peak picking, and integration; OpenChrom v. 0.901, Lablicate UG) and MS ionization spectra–identified (NIST MS Software 2.0, Agilent Technologies). Statistical testing was conducted on normalized quantities of metabolites (in nanomoles) using ANOVAs and Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests to assess differences between pairwise comparisons. In the case of cultured Symbiodinium, we normalized to 105 cells ml−1. For corals, Symbiodinium extracts were normalized over dry weights in milligrams. Floridoside homologs in coral and Symbiodinium genomes We searched for homologs of the putative enzyme that converts glycerol 3-phosphate to floridoside (31) in the available coral and Symbiodinium genomes via BLASTp on reefgenomics.org (57) using an e value cutoff of <10−5. Briefly, the amino acid sequence for the gene (Gasu_26940) coding for floridoside phosphate synthase/phosphatase from the red alga G. sulphuraria was queried against the genomes of A. digitifera (58) and S. pistillata (59), as well as against the genomes of S. microadriaticum (40), S. minutum (49), and S. kawagutii (60).

35,35,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,17 of the world's most overlooked islands - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/worlds-most-overlooked-islands/index.html,"(CNN) — Let's be honest: Islands are rarely a hard sell, but some of these pretty places for always-needed indulgence get a little more love than others.

But on the world's lesser-known islands, still-secret spots, aquamarine seas and a relative lack of selfie-snappers could add up to castaway vacations more noteworthy than those on islands always topping best-of lists.

From the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, and a spot in the literal middle of nowhere, here are 17 less-boasted paradises worth adding to any travel lust list:

1. Cocos Keeling

Out in the beautiful middle of almost nowhere is Cocos Keeling, a place most people don't even realize is probably the island of their dreams.

Belonging to Australia, these Indian Ocean isles lying roughly halfway between the Aussies and Sri Lanka have just 600 residents loving life on the two atolls and 27 coral islands that make up Cocos. Only two of these isles are inhabited, which means there's an embarrassment of empty islands and accompanying unoccupied beaches. Canoeing out to explore them is encouraged.

Those after more than just sun-basking and sea baths can do an atoll walk through the shallow lagoon Cocos encloses and wind up on Prison Island, where real prisoners were once stranded.

2. Grenada

If the thought of people-littered beaches is too much to bear, there's Grenada. Beaches are bountiful on the Spice Island, so named because it supplies 20% of the world's nutmeg. Grand Anse may be the most recommended, but Paradise Beach has a beauty and seclusion all its own.

For another experience, take a day trip to Carriacou, or land of the reefs. The little isle off Grenada is known for snorkeling and a people extra steeped in the Spice Island's African cultural heritage.

Beyond water pursuits, Grenada is known for revelry during Spice Mas. Every August, Grenada gives itself over to the rhythmic sounds of Jab Jab and soca music for its Carnival celebration, which will see masqueraders parading through the streets from night into day.

3. Nosy Be

Nosy Be, the gem of Madagascar, is still a haven for the island escapist.

In addition to its glassy, gin-blue waters, Nosy Be is known as the perfumed island because the breeze carries the scent of its abundant ylang ylang. Eleven volcanic crater lakes sprinkle Nosy Be and small islets and rock formations lining the coastline mean personal, private beaches abound.

Beyond these beaches, there's Nosy Tanikely, a small island off this already small island that's home to a marine reserve with unspoiled snorkeling. Beach picnics complete with fresh catch are the eating experience of choice.

Any island where the modus operandi is ""mora mora,"" which literally means ""slowly, slowly"" in Malagasy, is surely one where taking it easy is celebrated.

4. Dominica

Not to be confused with the Dominican Republic, Dominica is the Caribbean island with the Champagne Reef.

Though it's not champagne exactly; it's an underwater geothermal spring with hot bubbles that make divers feel like they're bathing in champagne. Not surprisingly, Champagne Reef has been ranked one of the world's top -- and most unusual -- snorkeling sites.

Known as the Nature Island, Dominica is the destination to pick for those interested in a little more land life, like hiking. The island is lined with 300 miles of trails running through Morne Trois Pitons National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and along the Waitukubuli National Trail, past volcanoes, mud baths, waterfalls and wildlife.

5. Reunion Island

There's more to the Indian Ocean than the Maldives. Though Reunion Island may be the Indian Ocean's most prosperous, it isn't the most popular, which makes it the perfect underrated isle to check out next.

A photographer's paradise, the French territory has panoramas graced with rugged, greenery-coated mountains and the still active volcano Piton de la Fournaise. These vistas often serve as backdrops for open-air dining on Creole cuisine that foodies will fill their Instagrams with on the spot and salivate over later.

When it's time for adventure, there's canyoning, rafting and paragliding over Reunion's pristine white and black sand beaches.

6. Sumba

Indonesia has been thrust further into the spotlight of world's-best-island lists, but Bali tends to get all the love. Sumba, however, seems to have all the beauty without the ""Eat, Pray, Love"" fan club flood.

An hour's flight from Bali, Sumba has been luring surfers to its seas for years, especially those dying to ride The Wave, a left-hand break with cult status accessible to those staying at the island's high-end Nihiwatu resort . But for the rest, the nearly 10-foot tall waves at Tarimbang Bay aren't too bad at all.

For nonsurfer types, beach hopping awaits. Start at Watu Mandorak Cove, then on to Puru Kambera Beach and Tanggedu Waterfall, with drives past valleys of rice paddies serving as a reminder that it's Indonesia.

7. Tobago

Serene and relaxing, what more could you want? (Photo courtesy Oswin Browne) Courtesy Oswin Browne

One-half of the island duo that is Trinidad & Tobago, the much smaller of the two, Tobago, may be serenity incarnate. At just more than 6 miles wide, beaches on this petite paradise in the Caribbean are scarcely more than 10 minutes away from anywhere.

And without the throng of tourists to constantly cater to, Tobago has managed to remain true to itself. That authenticity appears in the cuisine, too, yielding mainstays like curry crab and dumpling and treats like homemade coconut ice cream served in restaurants that feel like a mother's kitchen.

From the popular Pigeon Point with its postcard-perfect jetty to the more secluded Pirates Bay, beaches in Tobago are often just as calm as they are striking. On many, visitors won't find two sets of people within earshot of each other.

8. Mauritius

The antidote to anything stress related, the 100 miles of beaches in Mauritius mean travelers will be spoilt for choice. With beaches that belong in a daydream or as desktop wallpaper, this island nation off Africa lures far fewer travelers than it should, but those who go are rewarded.

The only accessible-by-boat Ile aux Cerfs along the east coast is a perfect spot for snorkeling in a lagoon, beach barbecues and dancing to lively sega music sung in Creole.

Eaters will rejoice in Mauritius, too. The island's Indian, Creole, Chinese and French influences find their way to tables in the form of highly rated spicy curries and seafood galore. Heaven, according to Mark Twain, was modeled after Mauritius.

9. Barbuda

Antigua's other half, Barbuda rarely gets its own attention, though it's very much deserving of those vacation days.

The no-frills Eastern Caribbean destination that was a beloved hideaway for Princess Diana is exactly what an island escape should be: tranquil.

With a population of 1,600, a handful of hotels, a couple of paved roads and not many attractions to speak of, Barbuda is much more about zen than zeal. But it makes up for any lack of happenings with beaches well worth idling on for hours. Some have pink sand. There's also a slew of caves on the island that visitors can camp in, with petroglyphs carved into the walls by Barbuda's original Amerindian inhabitants.

Bonus for birders: The island's bird sanctuary boasts the world's biggest colony of the Magnificent Frigatebird.

10. Sulawesi

Beyond Bali, Sulawesi is another of Indonesia's still somewhat-secret treasures. In Sulawesi , beaches give way to rainforests and tanning gives way to jungle treks for those inclined.

Four marine parks surround the island, catering to divers and sunbathers alike. With its 17,000-plus isles, Indonesia has beaches upon beaches, and the likelihood of too many people landing on one is pretty slim.

11. Guadeloupe

There's little that can't be done on the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.

Whether it's chasing waterfalls that drop into secluded swimming holes, or diving in underwater volcano Sec Pâté, or taking selfies with a submerged bust of famed explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau, it's all there on-isle. When it does come time for simple sun worshipping, though, don't miss the beach vendors selling beignets.

Food is definitely feted in Guadeloupe. Every year on the Saturday closest to August 10, the Fête des Cuisinières, a celebration of the patron saint of cooks, takes place in Pointe-à-Pitre. Women dressed in their finest traditional Creole garb cook and have their dishes blessed at Mass before parading the streets until it's time to feast and dance.

12. Sal, Cape Verde

Africa may not be first to mind for beautiful beaches, but they're definitely there.

Sal, one of 10 islands in Cape Verde off the west coast of Africa , could be counted among the most diverse of its sister isles. Named for its abundance of salt deposits, travelers to Sal can replenish themselves in curative salt pools where the water's warm and saltier than the Dead Sea, meaning floating is made easier.

It's the ""Blue Eye,"" however, that gets the most attention. When the sun hits the sapphire-blue waters at Buracona, an underwater cave, the result is a brilliantly turquoise spot locals lovingly call the eye. Intrepid divers can swim through the eye into the natural lava pool, finding hidden grottos to explore under the sea.

13. Roatan

Countering the flashier island destinations, Roatan feels no need to boast its beauty -- those who should know will find it and those who find it will return.

The biggest of Honduras' Caribbean Bay Islands has been calling divers for decades because of its position at the foot of the 700-mile-long Mesoamerican Reef, the largest barrier reef in the Caribbean Sea and second biggest in the world after Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

Life is laid back on Roatan. Its seaside shacks serve up simple ""baleadas,"" a Honduran take on a taco. Made with a flour tortilla and filled with refried beans, cheese and cream, then topped with meat and avocado, they're well-suited to be washed down with a Salva Vida, meaning ""lifesaver,"" a local and loved cerveza.

14. Alonissos

Santorini and Mykonos have long been the popular kids among the Greek Isles, but Alonissos is a treasure it'd be best not to miss.

With all the beauty of the Mediterranean without the pretense, Alonissos caters to those looking to slow down and soak up a local culture. The cobblestone streets of the island's old town, Chora, beg to be explored. Other don't miss experiences: An ouzo at an unassuming tavern, a stroll through olive groves and orchards and dolphin watching.

Of course, there are the Aegean beaches, which are best enjoyed by boating from one to the next. Milia, Marpounta and Glyfa are all worth a stop.

15. Bequia

In Bequia, (pronounced bekway), life -- not surprisingly -- is centered on the sea.

The 5-mile long, half-mile wide island that's part of the Caribbean's St. Vincent and the Grenadines, is a magnet for the yachts often dotting Admiralty Bay, though its petite size keeps it from being overcrowded.

Because of its centuries-old dependence on trading, the island is accustomed to welcoming visitors and has been counted among the friendliest in the Caribbean. Beaches here, like Spring Bay on the eastern side of the island, are lined with palm trees and visitors will likely find themselves solo.

For a taste of other Grenadines, board the Bequia-built SS Friendship Rose, the last operational schooner in the Caribbean.

16. La Gomera

La Gomera has never much worried about what the rest of the world's doing.

One of Spain's Canary Islands off the coast of Africa, the quieter La Gomera has remained much the same as it always was, thanks at least in part to an abridged airport runway that can't accommodate international flights and the masses that come with them.

Playa de Santiago on the sunniest side of the island boasts volcanic black sand beaches. An ideal post-basking snack consists of ""almogrote,"" a spicy cheese paté, and some locally made Gomera white wine, which has gained acclaim but remains exclusive to the island, because production is too small for much export.

Listen for ""el silbo,"" a pre-Hispanic whistling language preserved as part of the island's cultural heritage.

17. Isles of Scilly

Contrary to common knowledge, England has a set of tropical-looking islands all its own.

The Isles of Scilly, off England's southwest coast, are an archipelago made up of mostly uninhabited isles surrounded by turquoise waters ripe for all manner of water pursuits.

There are sea safaris, snorkeling with seals, stand-up paddle boarding and, for the really adventure-inclined, coasteering -- or exploring a rocky coastline without boats, opting instead for cliff jumping, climbing and swimming.","Thu, 10 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170728120313-guadeloupe-super-tease.jpg,"['isles', 'overlooked', 'snorkeling', 'theres', 'beach', 'beaches', 'island', 'courtesy', 'islands', 'caribbean', 'worlds', '17']", ,none

37,37,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Effects of silver nanoparticles on nitrification and associated nitrous oxide production in aquatic environments - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603229,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most common materials in nanotechnology-based consumer products globally. Because of the wide application of AgNPs, their potential environmental impact is currently a highly topical focus of concern. Nitrification is one of the processes in the nitrogen cycle most susceptible to AgNPs but the specific effects of AgNPs on nitrification in aquatic environments are not well understood. We report the influence of AgNPs on nitrification and associated nitrous oxide (N 2 O) production in estuarine sediments. AgNPs inhibited nitrification rates, which decreased exponentially with increasing AgNP concentrations. The response of nitrifier N 2 O production to AgNPs exhibited low-dose stimulation (<534, 1476, and 2473 μg liter −1 for 10-, 30-, and 100-nm AgNPs, respectively) and high-dose inhibition (hormesis effect). Compared with controls, N 2 O production could be enhanced by >100% at low doses of AgNPs. This result was confirmed by metatranscriptome studies showing up-regulation of nitric oxide reductase (norQ) gene expression in the low-dose treatment. Isotopomer analysis revealed that hydroxylamine oxidation was the main N 2 O production pathway, and its contribution to N 2 O emission was enhanced when exposed to low-dose AgNPs. This study highlights the molecular underpinnings of the effects of AgNPs on nitrification activity and demonstrates that the release of AgNPs into the environment should be controlled because they interfere with nitrifying communities and stimulate N 2 O emission.

Estuaries, especially large-river deltaic systems (for example, the Yangtze Estuary), are dynamic regions where rivers, lands, and oceans interact, and they are among the most productive ecosystems ( 32 ). Estuarine ecosystems have long been disturbed by human activities due to their ability to support large human populations ( 32 ). In addition to receiving large quantities of AgNPs ( 19 , 20 ), estuaries have also suffered from a substantial loading of anthropogenic nitrogen ( 33 ), which has threatened their overall quality and function ( 34 ). Hence, a deeper understanding of how AgNPs affect key nitrogen transformations in estuarine environments is required. Here, we examine the toxicity of PVP-coated AgNPs on the activity of nitrifying communities from the Yangtze estuarine sediments and the effects of AgNPs on associated N 2 O production during nitrification. Isotopomer analyses were conducted to identify the pathway of N 2 O production affected most by AgNPs. Metatranscriptomes were analyzed to elucidate the metabolic response of nitrifying organisms by tracking the expression of AgNP-responsive genes. This research provides a new view of the AgNP toxicity mechanism affecting nitrification in estuarine environments.

The global production of AgNPs ranges from 5.5 to 550 metric tons per year ( 10 ). However, annual production is predicted to increase to 1216 metric tons by 2020 ( 5 ). The environmental concentration of AgNPs in surface waters is estimated to be approximately 0.04 to 0.32 μg liter −1 , with a predicted sedimentation rate of approximately 2 to 14 mg kg −1 a −1 ( 11 ). By 2020, concentrations of AgNPs in surface water and sediment may reach approximately 0.2 to 1.8 μg liter −1 and 87.8 to 614.4 mg kg −1 , respectively ( 5 ). AgNPs have been shown to readily undergo sulfidation and transform into highly insoluble Ag 2 S during their transport, especially in sewage disposal systems ( 12 – 15 ). However, part of the released AgNPs cannot be fully transformed into Ag 2 S before they exert toxicity in the environment, depending on particle size, aggregation level, and concentration of the released AgNPs ( 16 ). Notably, silver exists in the natural environment in various species, including Ag 2 S, AgCl, Ag + , and particulate silver ( 8 ). It has been demonstrated that AgNPs could be substantially reformed from Ag 2 S in the presence of Fe(III) under sunlit conditions in natural aquatic environments ( 17 ). In addition, Ag + could be photochemically reduced to AgNPs by dissolved organic matter (DOM) in environmental waters exposed to sunlight ( 8 ). AgCl has also been demonstrated to transform into AgNPs under irradiation ( 18 ). Because Fe(III) and DOM are ubiquitous in natural aquatic ecosystems, the process of reformation of AgNPs from Ag 2 S and Ag + might also be ubiquitous, and thus increase the persistence of AgNPs in natural aquatic environments, such as rivers and estuaries ( 19 , 20 ). Therefore, with the constant increase of AgNP usage, the risk associated with AgNPs in aquatic environments will also increase, as will the need for corresponding ecotoxicological assessments. The toxic effects of AgNPs have been suggested to stem mainly from dissolution and release of silver ions (Ag + ), reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, endocrine disruption, and cell injury and inflammation ( 5 , 21 – 23 ). Although toxicity mechanisms are being explored, little is known about the effects of AgNPs on nitrification rates and the associated production of N 2 O, which is a greenhouse gas, in aquatic environments. Nitrification is a critical process for the balance of reduced and oxidized nitrogen pools in the environment, linking mineralization to nitrogen loss pathways of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) ( 24 – 26 ). The slow growth of nitrifiers and their high sensitivity to environmental perturbations often result in cell growth inhibition by toxicants, including AgNPs ( 4 ). Nitrification is an important pathway for N 2 O production in the environment ( 27 , 28 ). During nitrification, N 2 O can be produced either as a by-product of hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) oxidation (NH 2 OH→NOH→N 2 O) or as an end product or intermediate product of nitrite (NO 2 − ) reduction via nitrifier denitrification ( 29 , 30 ). N 2 O has a >300-fold stronger effect on climate warming than carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and can react with ozone in the stratosphere ( 30 , 31 ). Stress from low oxygen can induce nitrifier N 2 O production, and we hypothesize that stress from AgNP exposure can also exacerbate nitrifier N 2 O production.

Nanotechnology has advanced rapidly over the past few decades ( 1 , 2 ). Large quantities of nanomaterials are being discharged into the environment because of the production and widespread application of nanotechnology-based consumer products. These nanomaterials trigger potential human health and eco-environmental problems ( 3 ). Nanoparticles with high surface/volume ratios and increased catalytic properties are more reactive than their bulk counterparts and therefore could be more toxic. Nanoparticles can also serve as carriers for dangerous contaminants and can thus promote their translocation in the environment. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are commonly used nanomaterials because of their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity ( 4 ). They are used in products such as laundry additives, personal care products, children’s toys, textiles, and medical products, which when combined account for approximately 25% of all nanotechnology-enhanced products ( 4 , 5 ). In general, AgNPs are immobilized with capping agents, which are usually negatively charged species or relatively large, hydrophilic polymers, such as citrate, dextran, gum arabic, polyethylene glycol, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ( 6 ). Among these, PVP is an attractive and commonly used capping reagent that can stabilize and protect AgNPs by steric stabilization ( 7 ). Stabilized AgNPs can be exposed to the environment through a variety of routes including during their manufacture, use, recycling, and disposal ( 8 ). Recently, the rapid increase in AgNP usage has raised extensive public concern regarding potential environmental effects ( 9 ), especially the unintended impacts of AgNPs on microbial ecosystems and associated ecological risks.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Effect of AgNPs on nitrification rate The toxicity of AgNPs to the activity of nitrifying communities from the intertidal sediments of the Yangtze Estuary was examined via a sediment slurry incubation experiment (fig. S1). Three different sizes (10, 30, and 100 nm) of PVP-coated AgNPs were chosen. The toxicity of Ag+ (in the form of AgNO 3 ) was also investigated to compare its toxicity with that of AgNPs. Within 30 hours of acute exposure, the nitrification inhibition level increased gradually for the first 12 hours (fig. S2) and then remained relatively stable, probably due to nearly saturated silver toxicity. Thus, dose-response curves were constructed by plotting the measured nitrification inhibition level against AgNP exposure concentrations over 12 hours (Fig. 1). Nitrification inhibition increased exponentially as the AgNP dose increased (P < 0.01). On the basis of the dose-response curves, we determined AgNP concentrations that produced 10% (EC 10 or effective concentration) and 50% (EC 50 ) reductions in the nitrification rate relative to the control. The toxicity of AgNPs to nitrification activity was size-dependent, with EC 10 values of 32, 145, and 502 μg liter−1 and EC 50 values of 421, 1775, and 6020 μg liter−1 for the 10-, 30-, and 100-nm AgNPs, respectively (Fig. 1). The increased toxicity of the smaller AgNPs was perhaps caused by increased contact between cell membranes and the surface of the smaller particles or indirectly caused by the increased dissolution of Ag+ from the smaller AgNPs due to their greater surface area–to–volume ratio (35). Fig. 1 Percentage reduction of nitrification rate in AgNP or Ag+ treatments compared to the no-silver control (incubation time = 12 hours; n = 3). EC 10 and EC 50 represent the concentrations that produced a 10 or 50% reduction in nitrification rate relative to the control, respectively. Nonlinear fitted curves (ExpDec1) and equations are given (P < 0.01). The mechanisms by which AgNPs exert their toxicity are debatable (36). Recently, the direct particle-specific effect of AgNPs was ruled out because no toxicity was observed when they were synthesized and tested under anaerobic conditions where Ag+ release was precluded (36). AgNP morphological properties—such as particle size, shape, and capping agent—might still be indirect effectors influencing Ag dissolution (22, 36). This point is confirmed in this study, wherein AgNP toxicity to nitrification correlated significantly with dissolved Ag+ concentration (P < 0.01) (fig. S3 and table S1). Dissolved Ag+ exerted toxicity via interaction with the thiol groups of the cysteine residues in respiratory chain enzymes, such as NADH (reduced form of NAD+) dehydrogenase, which decoupled respiration and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (22, 37). In addition, Ag+ may bind with transport proteins, leading to proton leakage and proton motive force collapse (37, 38). AgNO 3 (as a source of dissolved Ag+) exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on nitrification than AgNPs, with EC 10 and EC 50 values of 1 and 11 μg liter−1, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the Ag+ dissolved from AgNPs was more toxic than the same concentration of the Ag+ present as AgNO 3 (Fig. 1 and fig. S3). This result may indicate that AgNPs deliver Ag+ more effectively to nitrifiers because they are less susceptible to binding and reduced bioavailability by common natural ligands, such as chloride, sulfide, thiosulfate, and dissolved organic carbon, compared with AgNO 3 (36, 39). During the AgNP inhibition experiment, no NO 2 − accumulation (always below the detection limit) was detected in the sediment slurries, supporting the idea that AgNPs inhibit ammonia (NH 3 ) oxidation more than NO 2 − oxidation (4). The PVP capping agent (less than 0.5% coating on AgNPs by weight) may contribute to the toxicity of AgNPs. However, on the basis of the independent inhibition experiment conducted for PVP, less than a 1.5% reduction in the nitrification rate, accounting for only 0 to 5% of the AgNP toxicity, resulted from exposure to PVP (0.05 to 15 μg liter−1) for 12 hours (fig. S4).

Effect of AgNPs on N 2 O production The increasing release and atmospheric accumulation of the powerful greenhouse gas N 2 O have caused concern during this era of rapid environmental change (27, 34). N 2 O production during nitrification was affected by AgNP exposure (figs. S5 and S6). For 10-nm AgNPs, although concentrations below 0.1 μg liter−1 apparently did not affect the N 2 O emission (Student’s t test, P > 0.05), those between 1 and 10 μg liter−1 stimulated N 2 O emission by up to 17.6% during the 30-hour incubation (Student’s t test, P < 0.05). When exposed to higher concentrations (100 to 500 μg liter−1), an initial inhibition (up to 23.5%) of N 2 O emission occurred (Student’s t test, P < 0.05) but switched to stimulation (up to 60.8%) after 12 hours of incubation (Student’s t test, P < 0.05). However, when concentrations were increased to 1000 to 2000 μg liter−1, inhibition of up to 90.0% was always observed (Student’s t test, P < 0.01). Similar results were recorded for the effects of increasing dosages of 30- and 100-nm AgNPs and Ag+ (provided as AgNO 3 ) on nitrifier N 2 O production (fig. S6). Thus, nitrifying communities respond rapidly to AgNPs or Ag+ exposure, probably by regulating gene transcription and adjusting metabolic pathways. One important response was the regulation of the by-product N 2 O emission. Dose-response curves were constructed between Ag exposure concentration and N 2 O emission over 12 hours (Fig. 2). Although nitrification rates decreased exponentially as the AgNP or Ag+ dose increased (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1), the dose-response relationship between Ag concentration and N 2 O emission showed both low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition [that is, hormesis (40)] (Fig. 2 and fig. S7). N 2 O emission increased with the increasing Ag concentrations, reaching maximum increases of 71.8, 70.9, 97.2, and 125.3% under Ag concentrations of 5.2 μg liter−1 for Ag+, and 257, 713, and 1173 μg liter−1 for 10-, 30-, and 100-nm AgNPs, respectively, based on the constructed curves (Fig. 2). The stimulation of N 2 O production due to Ag addition might be a stress response, as is observed under low-O 2 conditions (41). However, with increasing Ag concentrations, the degree to which N 2 O emission was stimulated was initially reduced, after which the emission of N 2 O became inhibited compared with the no-silver control, showing that the damage from Ag to nitrifying cells increased until it was strong enough to counteract the stimulated N 2 O production. This observed hermetic effect of AgNPs on N 2 O production during nitrification has not been reported previously. This finding is globally significant as environmental inputs of AgNPs have been increasing exponentially due to their rising usage and disposal levels worldwide (20, 42, 43). Fig. 2 Effect of AgNPs or Ag+ on N 2 O emission during nitrification (incubation time = 12 hours). Data show the percentage changes of N 2 O emission in the AgNP or Ag+ treatments compared to the no-silver control (n = 3). Nonlinear fitted curves (Gauss) and equations are given (P < 0.01). Although low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions (<3 mg liter−1) enhance N 2 O emissions, mainly through the nitrifier denitrification (41), the DO concentration in this study ranged from 6.3 to 9.1 mg liter−1 (fig. S8). The DO concentration was significantly lower in the no-silver control (6.3 to 6.5 mg liter−1) than in the AgNP-treated samples where N 2 O production was greatly enhanced (Student’s t test, P < 0.01). Therefore, the simulated N 2 O emission due to the AgNP treatments was likely not caused by DO stress. High NO 2 − concentrations can promote nitrifier denitrification and N 2 O production (44). However, NO 2 − concentrations remained below the detection limit during the incubation, indicating that NO 2 − stress did not enhance N 2 O production. The possibility that the PVP capping agent might contribute to increased N 2 O emission was excluded, as the impact of PVP (0.05 to 15 μg liter−1) on N 2 O emission remained at only 0.1 to 1.2% of inhibition (fig. S4).

Identification of key N 2 O production pathways As shown here, increasing AgNP concentrations in estuarine environments can enhance N 2 O emissions. However, the mechanisms by which AgNPs stimulate N 2 O production are still unclear. N 2 O isotopomer analysis is a powerful tool to distinguish whether N 2 O originates from NH 2 OH oxidation or NO 2 − reduction (30). It is based on the intramolecular distribution of 15N in the central position (14N15N16O) and the end position (15N14N16O) of asymmetric N 2 O molecules (45). The 15N-site preference (SP) is defined as the difference in the bulk nitrogen isotope ratios of N 2 O between δ15Nα and δ15Nβ, where 15Nα and 15Nβ represent the 15N/14N ratios at the central (α) and end (β) sites of the nitrogen atoms, respectively (45). Because N 2 O produced through NH 2 OH oxidation and NO 2 − reduction have different SP values [33‰ (per mil) for NH 2 OH oxidation and 0‰ for NO 2 − reduction (46, 47)], analyzing the SP enables the identification of the sources of N 2 O produced during these two respective processes. The isotopomer analysis showed that SP in the no-silver control was 29.3‰ at 12 hours, indicating that approximately 89% of the released N 2 O was produced via NH 2 OH oxidation, whereas only approximately 11% was attributed to NO 2 − reduction (Fig. 3, A and B), assuming that each process is linearly proportional to SP (47). When exposed to AgNPs (100 μg liter−1, 10 nm; 500 μg liter−1, 30 nm; or 1000 μg liter−1, 100 nm), under which N 2 O production was enhanced by 43.0, 84.1, and 121.5%, the SP values increased to 30.0, 31.5, and 35.6‰, respectively, at 12 hours (Student’s t test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3A). In addition, SP increased to 32.2‰ when exposed to Ag+ (5 μg liter−1) (Student’s t test, P < 0.01), exhibiting a 73.9% N 2 O enhancement. Under low-dose AgNP exposure, δ15Nα increased, whereas δ15Nβ simultaneously decreased (Fig. 3, C and D), thus resulting in higher SP. The increased SP indicated that low-dose AgNPs stimulated NH 2 OH oxidation, which contributed to more than 90% of N 2 O emission or even became the sole pathway, whereas the contribution of NO 2 − reduction was minor or nil (Fig. 3B).

Control group represents the incubation without silver. The 10 nm, 30 nm, 100 nm, and Ag+ in the “N 2 O stimulation” area represent the incubations with AgNPs (100 μg liter−1, 10 nm; 500 μg liter−1, 30 nm; and 1000 μg liter−1, 100 nm) and Ag+ (5 μg liter−1), wherein 43.0, 84.1, 121.5, and 73.9% of N 2 O emission enhancement were detected, respectively. The 10 nm, 30 nm, 100 nm, and Ag+ in the “N 2 O inhibition” area represent the incubations with AgNPs (2000 μg liter−1, 10 nm; 3000 μg liter−1, 30 nm; and 3000 μg liter−1, 100 nm) and Ag+ (500 μg liter−1), wherein 89.9, 48.3, 19.0, and 59.3% of N 2 O emission inhibition were detected, respectively. The incubation time was 12 hours. The inhibition mechanism of high AgNP concentrations on N 2 O production during nitrification was investigated. When exposed to AgNPs (2000 μg liter−1 10 nm, 3000 μg liter−1 30 nm, and 100 nm) or Ag+ (50 μg liter−1), wherein N 2 O production decreased by 89.9, 48.3, 19.0, and 59.2%, respectively, SP decreased to 17.4, 24.2, 26.9, and 23.3‰, respectively, at 12 hours (Student’s t test, P < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). These results imply that, although NH 2 OH oxidation remained the main contributor of N 2 O, its contribution was reduced under high-dose Ag exposure, which was reduced to approximately 53% when the N 2 O emission was inhibited by 89.9% (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the regulation of N 2 O production by AgNPs during nitrification occurred via affecting NH 2 OH oxidation, whereas the production of N 2 O via NO 2 − reduction was minor and insensitive to AgNP exposure. Previously, N 2 O reduction to N 2 was reported to increase SP, and the effect of NO 2 − reduction might be underestimated when N 2 O reduction is intense (48). However, no significant increase in the δ18O of N 2 O was detected during the incubation (it remained approximately 20‰, Student’s t test, P > 0.05), showing that N 2 O reduction to N 2 was not important (47). This study is the first to explore and distinguish the effect of AgNPs on different N 2 O production pathways of nitrifying communities. Although NO 2 − reduction was not the main contributor to N 2 O production in this study, N 2 O isotopomer analysis does not distinguish the relative contributions of nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification (30). When the headspace O 2 concentration is between 0.5 and 3% (v/v), at least 50% of the total N 2 O production generally derives from the NH 3 oxidation pathway rather than heterotrophic denitrification (41). In addition, when the dissolved O 2 concentration is ca. 0.06 mg liter−1, the N 2 O production by denitrification is completely inhibited (49). Therefore, considering that the dissolved O 2 concentration remained above 6.3 mg liter−1, NO 2 − reduction via heterotrophic denitrifiers is likely to be minor (fig. S8). This conclusion was supported further by the metatranscriptomic analyses (see below).","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603229/F1.large.jpg,"['fig', 'liter1', 'nitrification', 'agnps', 'aquatic', 'silver', 'nanoparticles', 'effects', 'associated', 'n', 'ag', 'μg', 'agnp', 'emission', 'environments', 'production', 'nitrous', 'oxide']", ,none
38,38,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Nucleation speed limit on remote fluid-induced earthquakes - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700660,"Abstract Earthquakes triggered by other remote seismic events are explained as a response to long-traveling seismic waves that temporarily stress the crust. However, delays of hours or days after seismic waves pass through are reported by several studies, which are difficult to reconcile with the transient stresses imparted by seismic waves. We show that these delays are proportional to magnitude and that nucleation times are best fit to a fluid diffusion process if the governing rupture process involves unlocking a magnitude-dependent critical nucleation zone. It is well established that distant earthquakes can strongly affect the pressure and distribution of crustal pore fluids. Earth’s crust contains hydraulically isolated, pressurized compartments in which fluids are contained within low-permeability walls. We know that strong shaking induced by seismic waves from large earthquakes can change the permeability of rocks. Thus, the boundary of a pressurized compartment may see its permeability rise. Previously confined, overpressurized pore fluids may then diffuse away, infiltrate faults, decrease their strength, and induce earthquakes. Magnitude-dependent delays and critical nucleation zone conclusions can also be applied to human-induced earthquakes.

INTRODUCTION When an earthquake happens spontaneously, it is nearly always accompanied by aftershocks that cluster around it in time and space. Physical explanations for this include static stress transfer, which is caused by permanent distortion of the crust from slip on the mainshock fault plane that can, in turn, trigger more local earthquakes (1), as well as dynamic stress transfer, where straining of the crust by seismic waves temporarily changes the stress state long enough to trigger aftershocks (2). The aftershock zone stretches much farther than the obvious areas immediately around the mainshock rupture, as evidenced by significant seismicity outbreaks that can be attributed to passing long-period surface waves (high-amplitude seismic waves trapped in Earth’s crust) from Earth’s largest (M ≥ 7) mainshocks at global distances (2, 3). Remotely triggered earthquakes [greater than ~300 km away from M ≥ 7 mainshocks on average (4)] can only be initiated by seismic waves, because static stresses become vanishingly small with distance. Identifying remote dynamically triggered earthquakes is complicated because unrelated, spontaneous earthquakes can coincide with seismic wave arrivals by chance and/or mask their signal (5). Nonetheless, many individual studies link seismicity outbreaks, well-water level changes, volcanic activity, and nonvolcanic tremor to mainshock earthquakes that can be on opposite sides of Earth (6–16). Unequivocal seismicity outbreaks triggered by remote earthquakes are rare (17) but can be attributed to about 3% of M ≥ 7.0 mainshocks worldwide at any given locality (5). The possibility that an earthquake that happens on one side of Earth might prompt a second, damaging shock on the opposite side raises obvious concerns. Is there a period of enhanced worldwide seismic hazard that follows every large earthquake? How long might such an alarm last? Because dynamic earthquake triggering is initiated by seismic wave oscillations that temporarily stress the crust, there is no expected net change after the waves pass through. Intuitively, we would anticipate triggering to occur during this transient period, and many times, this is what happens (3). However, observations show that many dynamically triggered earthquakes do not initiate immediately but are instead delayed by hours or days following the passage of surface waves, an effect that is easiest to see among the largest remotely triggered earthquakes (18–22) because background rates of small earthquakes are the highest. Delayed remote earthquake triggering may be caused by surface waves that circle the globe more than once (23), by waves that jostle and change frictional properties in a fault zone (24) that causes delayed nucleation (25), or by a process where waves shake open (26) a fluid pressure valve (27) that unlocks a fault. As an example, we highlight two well-documented (6, 7, 28) cases of remote dynamic earthquake triggering that struck the Basin and Range Province of the western United States following the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers, CA and 2002 M = 7.9 Denali, AK earthquakes. These cases illustrate (Fig. 1) what regional responses to distant mainshocks look like. They show widely distributed, anomalously high seismicity rates that initiate as surface waves pass through. Their rates rise sharply and then decay over time like aftershocks, although they occur without a local mainshock. These examples demonstrate a globally observed tendency (5, 18–22) for remotely triggered sequences to be deficient in higher-magnitude earthquakes during the first 24 hours (or longer) as compared with local aftershocks (Fig. 1), which may be a result of comparatively smaller numbers of remotely triggered events or because of a physical process. The combined remote (r > 300 km) response in the Basin and Range Province shows that most of the triggered M ~ 2 to M ~ 3 shocks happen in the first 24 hours, whereas most of the M ~ 3 to M ~ 4 events happened during the first 30 days (Fig. 1D). Published physical explanations of dynamic triggering modes usually invoke the oscillating deformation of a fault zone by seismic waves that causes transient stress increases that briefly cross a failure threshold (8, 9, 24, 29, 30). Here, we focus on the interval between this temporary stressing of the crust and eventual occurrence of triggered earthquakes because it is diagnostic of their nucleation process. Fig. 1 7, Examples of known ( 6 28 ) remote dynamic triggering. (A) In the Basin and Range Province of the western United States. All M ≥ 2.0 western U.S. seismicity during the 24 hours after both the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers, CA (green dots) and the 2002 M = 7.9 Denali, AK (blue dots) earthquakes are shown. Both earthquakes have abundant local aftershocks and have produced significant triggered seismicity in the Basin and Range Province. Yellow stars show mainshock locations. The magnitude versus distance distribution from (B) the Landers earthquake shows continuous aftershocks trending into the Basin and Range Province out to ~1500 km away, whereas the (C) Denali earthquake has a clear spatial gap between local and remote aftershocks (~400 to 2300 km). Both earthquakes only have M ≥ 5 aftershocks within 300 km from mainshocks during the first 24 hours. The cumulative magnitude-frequency distribution of remotely triggered earthquakes in the Basin and Range Province during the first 24 hours after mainshocks is shown in (D). It is initially deficient in M ≥ 3.5 events (lighter blue points), whereas after 30 days [approximate duration of the rate increase (28)], it begins to fill in (darker blue dots) as evidenced by a significant decrease in the slope (b value) (Methods). Similarly, in (E), the temporal evolution of cumulative magnitude-frequency trends is shown for a global compilation (5) of remotely triggered earthquakes over 24 hours. The distributions are deficient at higher (M ≥ 4.5) magnitudes but gradually fill in over time, with b values decreasing.

RESULTS It is not difficult to identify temporal associations between individual distant earthquakes because Earth produces continuous seismicity in its most active regions, and therefore, any two shocks can be correlated in time. It is more difficult to establish causation and to find clear examples such as those depicted in Fig. 1. We thus work from a published global compilation of remotely triggered earthquakes that were identified through a systematic process of using high-quality seismic networks (capable of recording and locating earthquakes down to M ~ 2) on all continents except Antarctica (5). Periods before and after a group of all M ≥ 7.0 mainshocks that have happened globally since 1979 were checked for anomalous local seismicity outbreaks such as those depicted in Fig. 1. A population of earthquakes recorded within 17 seismograph networks during periods when passing surface waves from 260 M ≥ 7.0 mainshocks was assembled. We study the most robust of these results, as defined by a rate increase during the 24-hour period after surface waves have passed that is much greater (>2σ) than normal day-to-day variation in both time and space and that is not attributable to any known local cause (Fig. 2). Ultimately, 1249 M ≥ 2 earthquakes are culled from 34,095 candidate events that have characteristics in common with the most diagnostic behavior of aftershocks, an Omori law (31) decay (rate decreases as inverse of time) (Fig. 3), yet they are widespread and have no local mainshocks. Given that their initiation correlates with passing surface waves from remote mainshocks, we find that the most reasonable conclusion is that we have a population of identified, remotely triggered earthquakes for which the nucleation behavior can now be studied. Fig. 2 Examples of the earliest occurrences of remotely triggered earthquakes across the magnitude spectrum worldwide in (A) Greece, (B) New Zealand, (C) China, (D) Chile, and (E) the Basin and Range Province of the United States. Remotely triggered earthquakes are defined as regional outbreaks occurring at rates significantly (>2σ) greater than day-to-day mean variation within local seismograph networks associated with surface wave arrivals from remote (r > 1000 km) global mainshocks (M ≥ 7.0). Blue spikes show ±24-hour variation in earthquake rates within regional networks, and red dashed lines show 1σ and 2σ variation on the mean variability (blue curves). Yellow histograms show daily seismicity rates for ±20 days before and after global mainshocks. Example maps show spatial distributions with red dots representing earthquakes in the 24 hours after surface wave arrivals and blue dots showing those in the 24 hours before. These examples demonstrate the origins of the earliest occurrences of 3.0 ≤ M ≤ 6.7 triggered earthquakes used to construct the relations shown in Fig. 3. Many more events are detected globally (5). Fig. 3 (A) Remotely triggered earthquakes (EQ) are part of a typical Omori law time decay that is similar to local aftershocks, which suggests that their timing should be advanced relative to a random process. The remotely triggered earthquake catalog was developed from 24-hour periods following 260 M ≥ 7.0 global mainshocks as recorded in 17 different seismograph networks around the world (white boxes on the map) (5). (B) Earthquakes from 38 randomly drawn 24-hour periods when no global or local mainshocks occurred demonstrate the anomalous nature of the rate increase associated with surface wave arrivals from global mainshocks (A). We use 38 24-hour periods because the observed data were triggered by 38 global mainshocks. (C) Locally (r ≤ 300 km) (blue dots) and remotely (r > 1000 km) (red dots) triggered earthquakes are plotted as a function of their magnitudes. Different shading of the locally triggered events represents five realizations of nonoverlapping sample sizes equal to the remotely triggered population. First-observed remotely triggered events in 0.1 magnitude-unit bins are plotted as bright red dots. There is an evident log-linear trend of delay time versus magnitude that is less evident in the locally triggered earthquakes (histogram in Fig. 1E shows the magnitude-frequency distribution of remotely triggered earthquakes). Lines fit to first-occurrence distributions from 100 sets of 38 random 24-hour periods within the 17 local networks are shown and are all earlier than, or overlap, the remotely triggered events. We are primarily interested in learning more about the largest remotely triggered earthquakes because they are the most dangerous. Indications from past studies suggest that these largest events happen but that they are often delayed relative to the arrival of surface waves (18–22). We begin by carefully examining the earliest observed events in the population of remotely triggered earthquakes as a function of their magnitudes to establish if there are any consistent patterns. We organize the combined catalog of remotely triggered earthquakes by sorting them into 0.1 magnitude-unit bins and then we find the earliest occurrence of events within each bin. These first occurring earthquakes are traced back to their original locations and checked to ensure that they are not examples of secondary triggering, meaning that a smaller nearby event could be responsible for initiating it by static or local dynamic triggering. We plot the geographic and temporal distributions of the earliest and subsequent remotely triggered earthquakes in Fig. 3. We find that a global population of remotely triggered earthquakes obeys a power-law relationship between nucleation time and magnitude and can be fit to a linear trend between magnitude and log 10 of occurrence time (Fig. 3). Such a trend might be expected because high-magnitude earthquakes happen less often than smaller ones, and they obey an empirical power-law relationship between frequency and magnitude called the Gutenberg-Richter relation, where the number (N) of earthquakes is distributed as logN = a − bM, where a is the number of events at magnitude completeness and b is observed to be ~1.0. Therefore, over extended periods and/or across large areas, an approximately 10-fold decrease in event rates is observed at each increasing magnitude-unit threshold. Thus, if we think of short-term (24 hours) earthquake occurrence in the absence of a local or remote perturbing event as steady state with randomly distributed interevent times (Poisson process), we would expect longer wait times between higher-magnitude earthquakes, and the odds of seeing higher-magnitude events in 24 hours would be lower. This means that random earthquake first-occurrence times should also follow a log-linear trend versus magnitude. Virtually every aspect of earthquake scaling (rupture area, magnitude, frequency, slip, etc.) is described by power-law relationships. We compare observed dynamically triggered initiation times to steady-state, spontaneous earthquake occurrence. The catalog of remotely triggered earthquakes that we work with was prompted by 38 M ≥ 7 global mainshocks out of 260 candidates, with the remaining ones having no effect. We thus examine 100 sets of 38 random 24-hour periods drawn from the same local networks when no local or global M ≥ 7 mainshocks have happened. We follow the same procedure of binning by magnitude and finding earliest occurrences, which, as expected, also follow log-linear trends (fits shown in Fig. 3). However, they tend to happen with less delay over much of the magnitude range. Comparison between the full ranges of first-observed remotely triggered earthquake times and those from random periods using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [a standard approach to comparing power-law distributions (32)] shows virtually no overlap between the groups (P ≤ 0.01 in 94 of 100 cases, and all cases have P ≤ 0.05). There is correspondence between some individual first-observed remotely triggered earthquake times and random trends because all triggered sequences must contain some random background events unless pre-mainshock rates are zero. We emphasize that the comparison is made with the earliest possible nucleation times, whereas the rest of the remotely triggered events occur even later (Fig. 3). Thus, although there are significantly more earthquakes happening during the first 24 hours after surface waves pass through local networks, they are not nucleating sooner than would be expected under a random process. We assemble a catalog of locally triggered earthquakes culled from the same 17 networks as the remotely triggered population that happened within 300 km from, and 24 hours after, M ≥ 7 mainshocks within the networks. This catalog has more M ≥ 2 events in it (7741 triggered by 96 M ≥ 7 mainshocks) than the remotely triggered catalog (1249) and is likely deficient at smaller magnitudes at the earliest times because local networks become overwhelmed by the large number of aftershocks occurring simultaneously. We thus draw groups of 1249 nonoverlapping events from the full population of locally triggered earthquakes (five examples are plotted in Fig. 3) to directly compare their characteristics. Each of these groups of local aftershocks has M ≥ 5 events with delay times on the order of seconds to minutes, whereas the first-observed remotely triggered M ≥ 5 earthquake is delayed by 9.85 hours. Locally and remotely triggered aftershocks share a characteristic Omori law rate increase and exponential decay with time (Fig. 4). Fitting Omori law parameters to the observed combined global rate increase of remotely triggered earthquakes and integrating yield an expected 56% probability increase of seeing earthquakes in the 24 hours after surface wave arrivals, yet unlike locally triggered aftershocks, these event times are not advanced relative to a random process (Fig. 3). Instead, the remotely triggered shocks display a magnitude proportional delay, which is a feature unique to them. Fig. 4 Comparison between locally (r ≤ 300 km; red) and remotely (r ≥ 1000 km; blue) triggered earthquakes versus time. Event rates are normalized and expressed as a percentage (per hour) of the total number in the ±10-day periods. The local mainshocks produce far more aftershocks than the remote mainshocks, which is evident when they are plotted on the same scale. Both sequences display Omori law rate increases that are followed by an inverse time decay. Global observations thus identify three distinct initiation-time versus magnitude behaviors during the initial 24-hour periods. Local aftershocks are clearly advanced in time relative to earliest-observed spontaneous earthquakes in randomized 24-hour periods, which, in turn, are distinct from, but can overlap, first-observed times in the population of remotely triggered earthquakes at lower magnitudes [up to M ~ 3 (Fig. 3)]. However, earliest-observed higher-magnitude remotely triggered shocks are delayed relative to periods when there is no local or remote mainshock. This observation is puzzling because the overall rates of earthquakes during the 24-hour periods following surface wave arrivals are higher (compare Fig. 3A with Fig. 3B). Further, no remotely triggered events ever violate the observed magnitude-dependent nucleation speed limit (Fig. 3C) despite being part of an anomalous rate increase. We concentrate on the specific earliest occurring remotely triggered earthquakes because a systematic minimum delay time is diagnostic of the earthquake initiation (nucleation) process. Explanation of magnitude-dependent nucleation delay There are a number of suggested mechanisms by which delayed dynamic earthquake triggering can happen (23–25), although these apply to nucleation of all magnitudes. The exception is induced (26) high-pressure fluid infiltration (p) that presses open fault walls (33) and reduces the clamping normal stress (σ n ) that usually keeps a fault closed and locked. This can be described as Coulomb failure as τ = τ 0 − μ s (σ n − p), where failure stress (τ) is balanced between a driving shear stress (τ 0 ), and the normal (clamping) stress as modified by pore pressure, and the fault friction coefficient (μ s ). Strength is reduced when pore fluid pressure increases. The reason that an induced pore fluid pressurization model is most consistent with observations is that the concept involves dynamic stressing from seismic waves disrupting a physical seal that had previously blocked free flow of fluids into a fault zone. This newly broken seal (or seals) could exist at a very specific location, and therefore, all invading fluids would have to pass through to flow into the fault zone before they can strongly influence its stress state (26). Thus, time is required before failure conditions are met. Earthquake seismic moment is directly proportional to fault rupture area (34), meaning that a longer fluid transit time is needed to induce a larger earthquake. Rupture-area dimensions (diameter of circular rupture) range from ~0.2 to ~20 km (35) over the magnitude range (M = 2.0 to M = 6.7) of our observed (5) triggered earthquakes, marking approximate transit distances for whole rupture zones to be infiltrated. However, magnitudes also scale with the size of the smaller sticking area (asperity) that primarily resists slip and where most earthquakes begin (36). The critical nucleation dimension (2L c , in meters) for an earthquake with seismic moment m 0 (energy release proportional to magnitude in Newton meters) is derived (37) as , and measures ~5 m to 2.3 km for a magnitude range between M = 2.0 and M = 6.7. This is the size of the asperity nucleation zone that must be unlocked for a fluid pressure–induced earthquake of a given magnitude to occur and represents a minimum fluid transit distance. Causative seismic waves traveling global distances have long wavelengths that simultaneously affect regions at 101- to 102-km scales, meaning that direct triggering by seismic waves involves simultaneous deformation of entire rupture areas (particularly for M < 5). The systematic and spatial-area dependence in our observations shows delay variations discernable over nucleation dimension differences of just a few meters (Fig. 5) and is seen on an array of global faults, indicating a universal fluid-triggering process initiated by seismic waves. Fig. 5 Nucleation dimension–dependent delay of remotely triggered earthquakes. First-observed earthquake times versus magnitude are also plotted against their magnitude-dependent, critical nucleation dimensions. These areas are the stuck patches (asperities) of earthquakes that must become unlocked for ruptures to occur (36, 37). Fault zone fluid pressurization rates are plotted for the range of observed (41–45) fault zone diffusivity values, which illustrate consistency between delay times and asperity sizes. Generally, to obtain the earliest high-magnitude (largest rupture areas) induced earthquakes, fault zones must be highly diffusive. Critically stressed (near failure) faults are the only ones observed to be hydraulically conductive (38) and thus most susceptible to fluid-induced triggering. Fluids moving from a highly pressurized source through a porous medium, such as fault zone rocks, exhibit diffusive behavior (39) that takes the form of , where r is the distance from the high–fluid pressure source, c is a constant [derived in one dimension for fault zones as c = 2.32 (40)], t is time, and D is the coefficient of diffusivity. We note the consistency between diffusion rate curves calculated with typical (41–45) fault zone diffusivity values and observed magnitude-dependent delay expressed as time versus critical nucleation dimension (37) (Fig. 5). Thus, nucleation time is considered as a function of this distance and the diffusivity within the fault zone (Fig. 5). Diffusion delays can be fit to full rupture areas rather than to the smaller nucleation zones, but this requires unrealistically high (~102 m2 s−1) values of D. We model induced triggering by calculating the reduction in normal (clamping) stress caused by fluid pressure infiltration into a fault zone after a sudden opening of a fault valve (27). If we assume initially hydrostatic conditions within target faults (pore fluid pressure equal to 0.37 of lithostatic; for an average rock density of 2.7 × 103 kg/m3) and a typical fault orientation of 30° to the maximum principal stress axis, then we can calculate the frictional strength reduction resulting from the sudden opening of a moderately pressurized (pore fluid pressure, 0.6 of lithostatic) fluid compartment adjacent to the asperity. Strength reduction is a function of time, distance, and diffusivity such that a more permeable, highly diffusive fault will allow more pressure to build in a given time and distance. In other words, the speed limit on nucleation of large induced earthquakes is enforced by how fast pressurized fluids can move through a fault zone. To illustrate this, we calculate expected clamping stress reductions for observed delays of remotely triggered earthquakes over a range of diffusivity values (bracketed by measured values) (41–45) because each of the earliest-observed remotely triggered events for a given magnitude range occurred on a different fault (Fig. 3); these faults could have different diffusivity characteristics. We note for low-magnitude earthquakes (M = 2 to M = 3) that the calculated clamping stress reductions are insensitive to diffusivity because of their small nucleation zones and rupture areas (Fig. 6). For larger triggered earthquakes, our calculations show that diffusivity values on the higher end of the observed range (D ~ 100 m2 s−1) are required for significant clamping stress reductions, which may explain why high-magnitude remotely triggered earthquakes are rare (5). Fig. 6 Calculated pore fluid pressure induced strength reduction as a function of earthquake magnitude and fault diffusivity. Points correspond to earliest-observed remotely triggered earthquakes in Figs. 2 and 3. Strength reduction is normalized by the initial shear strength on faults, which removes nucleation depth dependence. Low-magnitude (M < 3) earthquakes can show significant reduction (10 to 100% of initial resisting shear strength) regardless of diffusivity because the rupture areas are small. Higher-magnitude triggering appears to require high diffusivity, with D approaching 1.0 m2 s−1.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS We find significant variation in the temporal distribution of triggered earthquakes depending on whether they are prompted by local or remote mainshocks. Both locally and remotely triggered earthquakes exhibit rate increases during the first 24 hours after they are initiated by either static or dynamic stress changes. However, only locally triggered, higher-magnitude aftershocks are advanced in time across the magnitude spectrum as compared to normal background rates. Delayed dynamic triggering has been explained by different stress threshold models, though all but one lack a clear indication why a power-law relationship between nucleation time and magnitude should persist. A primary clue comes from the fact that earthquake rupture areas and the size of locked asperity zones scale logarithmically with magnitude. Thus, a mechanism wherein the locked part of the fault must be traversed before it ruptures suggests itself. We show that a diffusion process where shaking from passing surface waves opens up pathways between locked faults and sealed pockets of pressurized fluids is consistent with observations of nucleation delays that are proportional to magnitude. Our results have ramifications for human-induced seismicity because conditions required for higher-magnitude triggering are potentially identifiable. Asperity identification and location are possible using advanced crustal imaging and analysis of microearthquake behavior (46–49); thus, larger critical nucleation zones might be delimited and avoided. Additionally, it is clear that the interplay between absolute stress, fluid pressure, and fault zone diffusivity (a measurable quantity) governs the occurrence and timing of induced earthquakes of a given magnitude.

METHODS The catalog of remotely triggered earthquakes was compiled in a previous study (5), and we briefly describe how it was developed. Daily changes in the number of earthquakes in each regional catalog were calculated over their durations (typically two to three decades) excluding the 260 24-hour periods after global mainshocks occurred. Mean daily changes (δ) and variances are found in 2-year sliding time windows at 0.5-year intervals because catalogs grow more complete and record more events with time. Time-dependent variance and SDs (σ) were found by fitting daily rate changes to negative binomial distributions, which represent clustered phenomena (50, 51). A maximum likelihood regression technique (52) was iterated until the change in the log likelihood was vanishingly small, yielding the dispersion (temporal clustering factor α) inherent to each catalog. Time-dependent variance for each catalog was calculated as var(t) = δ + αδ2 to find 1σ and 2σ variations. One-day periods following 260 M ≥ 7 mainshocks were then examined for significant (>2σ) rate increases in all regional networks. Mainshocks closer than 1000 km were excluded to remove any possibility that local static stress change–induced processes could be mistaken for remote triggering. Every significant rate increase was examined in detail to establish its character. A significant regional outbreak of triggered earthquakes was quantified by first dividing network regions into 0.5° × 0.5° boxes and then calculating the means and variances of each with 100 random trials across catalog durations. If the number of affected subregions after a global mainshock exceeded a 2σ threshold in the number from random trials, and there was no local mainshock, then we identified the response as widespread and, thus, probable remote triggering. Earliest-observed remotely triggered earthquakes versus magnitude were found by subtracting surface wave travel times between source mainshock and remote events and sorting into time order within 0.1 magnitude-unit bins. If there were a possibility that an earliest-observed event could be a local aftershock, based on proximity to a preceding earthquake, it was excluded. We calculated b values (slopes of magnitude-frequency distributions) using the maximum likelihood method (53, 54), which uses the equation , where is the mean magnitude and M min is the minimum magnitude. The SE can be calculated (55) using , where We report 95% confidence bounds on the calculations. A higher b value indicates a distribution that lacks higher-magnitude events relative to lower values. We modeled strength reduction from fluid pressurization within the observed delay times and rupture sizes. The initial stress states of normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults may be written as (40) where θ is the angle between the fault plane and the maximum principal stress axis (assumed to be 30°), and μ s is the fault friction coefficient (assumed to be 0.6). Shear stress τ represents the strength of a fault, which is highest at minimum pore fluid pressures (hydrostatic). We assumed that the volumes where triggered earthquakes occur were originally under hydrostatic conditions (λ f ≈ 0.37) and that an overpressured, initially sealed crustal compartment (λ f ≈ 0.6) was located adjacent to nucleation. The purpose of the calculations is to demonstrate functional consistency between nucleation delay times and failure stress increase; thus, although values are sensitive to parameter choices, the logarithmic form of delay times is not. For the one-dimensional problem of two half-spaces in contact, in which the overpressure remains constant over time, after seismic waves break the seal, fault pore fluid pressure increases with time and distance as where with ρ r as rock density and ρ w as water density. P 0 is the overpressure, and P 1 is the hydrostatic pressure.

40,40,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"How friction evolves during an earthquake: By simulating quakes in a lab, engineers study the way that friction changes along a fault during a seismic event - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170816084935.htm,"By simulating earthquakes in a lab, engineers at Caltech have documented the evolution of friction during an earthquake -- measuring what could once only be inferred, and shedding light on one of the biggest unknowns in earthquake modeling.

Before an earthquake, static friction helps hold the two sides of a fault immobile and pressed against each other. During the passage of an earthquake rupture, that friction becomes dynamic as the two sides of the fault grind past one another. Dynamic friction evolves throughout an earthquake, affecting how much and how fast the ground will shake and thus, most importantly, the destructiveness of the earthquake.

""Friction plays a key role in how ruptures unzip faults in the earth's crust,"" says Vito Rubino, research scientist at Caltech's Division of Engineering and Applied Science (EAS). ""Assumptions about dynamic friction affect a wide range of earthquake science predictions, including how fast ruptures will occur, the nature of ground shaking, and residual stress levels on faults. Yet the precise nature of dynamic friction remains one of the biggest unknowns in earthquake science.""

Previously, it commonly had been believed that the evolution of dynamic friction was mainly governed by how far the fault slipped at each point as a rupture went by -- that is, by the relative distance one side of a fault slides past the other during dynamic sliding. Analyzing earthquakes that were simulated in a lab, the team instead found that sliding history is important but the key long-term factor is actually the slip velocity -- not just how far the fault slips, but how fast.

Rubino is the lead author on a paper on the team's findings that was published in Nature Communications on June 29. He collaborated with Caltech's Ares Rosakis, the Theodore von Kármán Professor of Aeronautics and Mechanical Engineering at EAS, and Nadia Lapusta, professor of mechanical engineering and geophysics, who has joint appointments with EAS and the Caltech Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences.

The team conducted the research at a Caltech facility, directed by Rosakis, that has been unofficially dubbed the ""seismological wind tunnel."" At the facility, researchers use advanced high-speed optical diagnostics and other techniques to study how earthquake ruptures occur.

""Our unique facility allows us to study dynamic friction laws by following individual, fast-moving shear ruptures and recording friction along their sliding faces in real time,"" Rosakis says. ""This allows us for the first time to study friction point-wise and without having to assume that sliding occurs uniformly, as is done in classical friction studies,"" Rosakis adds.

To simulate an earthquake in the lab, the researchers first cut in half a transparent block of a type of plastic known as homalite, which has similar mechanical properties to rock. They then put the two pieces together under pressure, simulating the static friction that builds up along a fault line. Next, they placed a small nickel-chromium wire fuse at the location where they wanted the epicenter of the quake to be. Triggering the fuse produced a local pressure release, which reduced friction at that location, and allowed a very fast rupture to propagate up the miniature fault.

In this study, the team recorded these simulated earthquakes using a new diagnostic method that combines high-speed photography (at 2 million frames per second) with a technique called digital image correlation, in which individual frames are compared and contrasted with one another and changes between those images -- indicating motion -- are tracked with sub-pixel accuracy.

""Some numerical models of earthquake rupture, including the ones developed in my group at Caltech, have used friction laws with slip-velocity dependence, based on a collection of rock mechanics experiments and theories. It is gratifying to see those formulations validated by the spontaneous mini-earthquake ruptures in our study, "" Lapusta says.

In future work, the team plans to use its observations to improve the existing mathematical models about the nature of dynamic friction and to help create new ones that better represent the experimental observations; such new models would improve computer earthquake simulations.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['fault', 'ruptures', 'friction', 'simulating', 'rupture', 'lab', 'way', 'team', 'seismic', 'event', 'sliding', 'rosakis', 'quakes', 'evolves', 'dynamic', 'study', 'earthquake']", ,none
41,41,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Lubricating the halal food market - Engineer Live,https://www.engineerlive.com/content/lubricating-halal-food-market,"Mark Burnett looks at the role of food-safe lubricants in halal food production and ensuring machinery is contaminant-free and fully-functional

The growing halal food market means that plant managers need to be more aware of issues such as adapting production lines, potential sources of contamination and choosing a food grade lubricant for equipment and machinery.

The World Halal Forum estimates that the global market for halal food is worth around $700bn.

This demand can be partly attributed to a growing Muslim population, which currently stands at around 1.6bn people, but also to the fact that many non-Muslim consumers choose to buy halal as part of a lifestyle choice that accompanies healthy eating and ethically sourced foods.

The problem is that not all plants can keep up with the flexibility demanded from halal food.

Because foods and beverages cannot be halal if they contain pork, blood, carrion or alcohol, all preparation and processing areas must eliminate the risk of contamination.

The consequence is that from slaughter and handling to production and packaging, the process places a lot of stress on machinery and equipment.

As with all food production environments, high volume production with frequent customisation and line changes can cause machinery components such as gearboxes and bearings to fail prematurely.

One of the leading causes of equipment failure is poor lubrication.

To make matters worse, in the food and beverage industry, all lubricants need to be food-grade.

That means they need to meet industry standard NSF H1 regulations that limit the amount of incidental contact that can occur to a trace amount, usually in the region of ten parts per million. Anything more than this is deemed unsafe for consumption.

Most food-grade greases and lubricating oils available in the marketplace compromise performance to achieve this safety standard. When these lubricants are exposed to heavy loads, high temperatures and contaminants such as water, acids and particulates, they promote the growth of microorganisms that cause the lubricant to rapidly break down and become a dangerous food contaminant.

To make sure this does not happen, plant managers need to take a methodical approach to lubricant maintenance. It is important to effectively clean and remove used lubricants before applying the right lubricant that can handle the demands of food machinery.

To help maintenance engineers, NCH Europe has developed a cleaning solution called Flush and Clean. This gearbox cleaner dissolves gear-oil deposits, neutralises acids and cleans the metal surface ready for the next application of oil.

Once the gearbox has been prepared, engineers can use NCH Europe's Top Blend CS FG, a calcium-sulphonate food-grade gear oil that contains adhesive cohesive polymers that allows it to cling to metal surfaces without being washed away by high temperature steam and condensation in food applications.

Where equipment such as bearings need grease rather than oil, NCH Europe has also developed a food-grade grease called K Plex White. As well as adhesive cohesive polymers, it also contains shock load reducers and extreme pressure (EP) agents that work to cushion impacts and minimise stress, vibration and chatter under heavy loads.

As the global halal food market continues to grow, plant managers can no longer rely on traditional methods.

By closely monitoring maintenance cycles, downtime and lubricants, they can successfully adapt to the changing needs of the marketplace.

42,42,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,The 9 Most Popular Wellness Travel Destinations on Pinterest - SELF,https://www.self.com/story/popular-wellness-travel-destinations,"Imagine coming back from a life-changing trip feeling like you're ready to take on the world. I’d be lying if I said I’ve never thought about it. And while my daydream includes plenty of relaxation, I also imagine yoga on the beach, backpacking in the Pacific Northwest, and trail running through green national parks.

Plenty of other people are having the same idea: Fitness travel searches are up 618 percent year over year according to Pinterest and Airbnb. And it’s not just yoga retreats, although searches for them are also up 77 percent. It’s also pinners looking for wellness travel destinations to run marathons (always working on those NYE goals), meditation retreats, and boot camp sessions.

Here are the top nine pinned destinations and where to stay according to Pinterest and Airbnb. I've added a few of these to my bucket list—and I'm pretty sure you will, too.

1. Bali, Indonesia

A respite for yogis, this country is well known for it’s beaches, water, and gorgeous hotels. This is the perfect spot to DIY your next private yoga retreat (which is another common theme among Pinners).

What’s really popping in Bali is the opportunity for mediation retreats and thermal bathing. Three of the top spots to stay according to Airbnb are this private two bedroom home with a pool garden, this lux pool villa, or this nature hut out in the middle of rice paddies.

2. Cape Cod, Massachusetts

This spot is a little closer to home for most of us. The family-friendly beach destination is also great spot for runners and bikers thanks to the rail trail with over 22 miles of pavement. While all that is reason enough to visit, Cape Cod is also a trendy spot for yoga and meditation retreats. We’re guessing it has something to do with being surrounded by water on two sides (or three if you’re at the edge of the peninsula). With art and yoga studios for rent, like this Airbnb, it can be easy to find your inner calm.

3. Brookings, Oregon

Both Nike and Adidas have HQs near Portland, making the city a breeding ground for impressive athletes. And now, it seems like the coast is starting to blow up. You can surf off the coast or enjoy hiking through the wild forests. If you haven't heard of forest bathing (basically, unplugging and enjoying the woods sans technology), Oregon is a great place to try it. According to Pinterest and Airbnb, forest bathing searches are up 152 percent, making this spot come in as number three. This two-bedroom home by the sea is the perfect spot to press pause for a while.

4. Tahoe City, California

If you love the outdoors, I highly recommend you visit Tahoe. The lush green mountains and lakes are so vibrant they look Photoshopped. Plus if you grow up on the East Coast, you’ll be in awe of the sheer altitude of the place. This city is trending for its fitness travel options, and with wellness travel searches up 248 percent, it’s no wonder Tahoe City ranks high. Whether it’s a swimming hole, glamping option, or a rafting trip on the Truckee River, you can find something unique in Tahoe.

5. Phoenix, Arizona

Phoenix is another spot that is bursting at the seams with fitness travel options, and it's also the home to many spring training spots for baseball players. If professional athletes are heading there, why not you too? Bonus: There are plenty of ghost towns around here to explore. You’re on your feet all day long walking around, so you’re sure to log lots of steps. A good home base for the trip includes a location with a pool since it’s definitely going to be hot.

6. Haleiwa, Hawaii

Talk about a destination for the active traveler. No matter what island you pick, Hawaii has it all. While it’s slightly hard to get to (#islandprobs), it’s worth the flight time. From hiking to snorkeling to surfing, this state has numerous active travel options. This solar home on the North Shore is located directly across from the Banzai Pipeline, a beach famous for its huge waves. Depending on when you visit, you can catch surfing competitions like Pipe Masters, the Volcom Pipe Pro, the IBA Pipeline Pro, or the Pipeline Bodysurfing Classic. Nothing like a little inspiration from the top of the class to show you how it’s done.

7. Alajuela, Costa Rica

Seeking a meditative state? Book a flight to Costa Rica. This country has long been known for it’s amazing fitness travel options, and now its meditation options are sky rocketing. Costa Rica has the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the inland rainforests, so you only need to pick which one you’d like to visit—although it’s easy to hit both beaches and forests during weeklong vacation. Stay in a tree house in the rainforest to help disconnect from society and find some calm. If you want, you can relax in all natural hot springs or go for walks around the property to tap into your inner Zen.

8. Bora Bora, French Polynesia

Meditation is definitely trendy: Searches for meditation retreats are up 88 percent in comparison to last year and are a great way to recharge and renew yourself when you’re feeling burned out. Bora Bora comes out at the top of that list in terms of places to visit to try out a meditation retreat. Stay in a spot close to the water and let the soothing ocean waves wash your stress levels away.

9. Weaverville, North Carolina

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park saw over 11.3 million people last year, making it the highest visited national park in the U.S. (FYI, 4.6 million people visited the Grand Canyon, 3.8 million visited Yosemite, and 3.2 million checked out Yellowstone, so the Smokies are waaaay ahead).

43,43,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,The forgotten fish: a new look at our underwater friends - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/the-forgotten-fish-a-new-look-at-our-underwater-friends/a-40224207,"It is one of the most popular myths about fish: The three-second memory. The goldfish swims round and round in circles in his glass bowl - but he doesn't mind, does he? By the time he has swum around the bowl once he has already forgotten where he is. It's a brand new adventure for the dumb little fella every time!

But that's actually not true. Scientists have discovered that goldfish can recall information for up to five months. Other fish species, like carp, have an even longer memory span. They will avoid a certain type of bait for up to three years after being hooked just once.

The short memory span is just one of our many misunderstandings about fish. Our fin-bearing co-voyagers have a lot more going on inside their heads than we once thought.

Researchers are only starting to discover how intelligent fish actually are. According to recent studies, fish feel pain, stress and fear. They are emotional, aware creatures and have an active social life.

Fish have feelings too Fish do have feelings Fish were long believed to be unfeeling, dead-eyed animals. But now scientists are discovering the intrinsic social life of fish. They grieve, engage in cooperative hunting and some have very weird sex lives. Take an underwater journey to learn more about the greatly misunderstood and underappreciated fish.

Fish have feelings too Bodyguards Fish have each other’s back. The rabbit fish even go out for lunch together: While one of them feasts on the algae found on deep-water reefs, the other is on the look out for predators. Then they switch. Scientists call this virtuous behavior. The rabbit fish make sacrifices for another by waiting their turn.

Fish have feelings too The fearful fish It was long believed that fish cannot feel fear because they’re missing the part of the brain where other animals and humans process it. But scientists have now shown that fish do feel fear, pain and stress. It is still a contested issue among researchers, though. Fish welfare lobbyists say the new findings are an inconvenient truth as it means we would need to rethink our fishing practices.

Fish have feelings too Red lips are made for kissing Those lush lips look like they are made for smooching! One fish species goes even further and uses their mouths to procreate. The female drinks the male's sperm which passes rapidly through the intestinal systems and fertilizes the eggs. It’s a pretty weird sex practice not often observed in the animal kingdom. But the red-lipped batfish pictured here actually procreates the traditional way.

Fish have feelings too Full house The world-famous clown fish are very social creatures: They share their anemone homes with other fish. The venomous anemones offers life-saving protection to the little fish, as they are immune to its sting. As a result, it often gets a bit tight in their cozy homes.

Fish have feelings too Hunting pals The mean-looking grouper cooperates with the moray eel while hunting. The grouper initiates the hunt by shaking its head at the eel. The eel then follows it to the prey hiding in a hole and enters the hide-out. It's a 50/50 chance whether the eel corners and eats the prey or it escapes out of the hole into the grouper's mouth. This kind of team effort is extremely unusual in the animal kingdom. Author: Katharina Wecker



Bad image

However, the dimwitted, bug-eyed fish stereotype remains persistent.

The underwater creatures are in serious need of some good PR. Animal behavior specialist Jonathan Balcombe has made it his mission to improve the image of fish.

""Fish don't trigger our sympathies the way animals on land do, especially mammals and birds. We can't see them; we don't share the same world. They are not part of our lives unless they are on our plates,"" Balcombe told DW. ""So fish need a lot of help.""

In his book ‘What a Fish Knows,' Balcome busts some of the most well-known myths about fish and explains what they can do, how they do it and why.

Scientific studies have shown that fish can recognize each other. They can even learn to recognize humans by their faces.

Many species are very social. They live in groups, go hunting together and watch out for each other when they are in dangerous areas.

But most importantly - despite a long-held belief which assumes otherwise - fish can feel pain – both physically and psychologically.

Studies have revealed that fish experience feelings of high stress when they are kept for half an hour in a bucket filled with just a few centimeters of water.

But fish also know how to relieve their pain. Researchers dissolved a pain-killer in an area of water the fish usually avoid, and they suddenly swam towards it.

Fish don’t get our love and attention because we can only visit them briefly in their underwater world, experts say

It's groundbreaking knowledge, argues Balcombe, but it remains highly disputed.

""We don't want to admit that fish feel pain because if they suffer, we would need to ask questions about fishing. It is inconvenient, but we need to come to grips with this knowledge,"" says Balcombe,

Fish welfare

Some people already consider fish to be complex animals. One of them is Douglas Waley, Fish Welfare Programme Leader at Eurogroup for Animals.

Essentially, he is a fish welfare lobbyist at the European Union. It may sound like a bizarre job, but its one that is badly needed, says Waley.

""Several trillion fish are caught and farmed every year and their welfare issues are barely acknowledged,"" he told DW.

Fish missed out during a wave of European animal welfare regulations in the early 2000s as the science on their inner lives was only just emerging at the time.

Unlike cows, pigs, chickens and other animals we eat, policymakers haven't considered setting standards on slaughtering fish. Fish are often caught in huge nets and dragged along for hours. They are then dumped on board the ship and left to suffocate.

Normal-sized trawlers can catch up to 100 tons of fish in one go

Considering that fish do feel pain, this is a cruel method, say researchers. Fish welfare lobbyists are therefore calling for international regulations that would ""see fish caught quickly with a line and stunned and killed efficiently,"" says Waley.

He believes it will take years before EU legislation is adapted. It will also depend on how strongly the public demands it.

So far, there seems to be little public support for fish welfare.

Waley admits that it is difficult for people to identify with the underwater creatures: ""They're not furry and cuddly. And because they live life underwater in a world that we can only visit briefly and occasionally.""

Nevertheless, the fish lobbyist argues that fish deserve our love and attention just as much as other animals do.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/40203729_6.jpg,"['need', 'forgotten', 'pain', 'scientists', 'welfare', 'underwater', 'feel', 'social', 'fish', 'friends', 'look', 'feelings', 'animals']", ,none
44,44,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Seismic evidence for complex sedimentary control of Greenland Ice Sheet flow - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603071,"The land-terminating margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet has slowed down in recent decades, although the causes and implications for future ice flow are unclear. Explained originally by a self-regulating mechanism where basal slip reduces as drainage evolves from low to high efficiency, recent numerical modeling invokes a sedimentary control of ice sheet flow as an alternative hypothesis. Although both hypotheses can explain the recent slowdown, their respective forecasts of a long-term deceleration versus an acceleration of ice flow are contradictory. We present amplitude-versus-angle seismic data as the first observational test of the alternative hypothesis. We document transient modifications of basal sediment strengths by rapid subglacial drainages of supraglacial lakes, the primary current control on summer ice sheet flow according to our numerical model. Our observations agree with simulations of initial postdrainage sediment weakening and ice flow accelerations, and subsequent sediment restrengthening and ice flow decelerations, and thus confirm the alternative hypothesis. Although simulated melt season acceleration of ice flow due to weakening of subglacial sediments does not currently outweigh winter slowdown forced by self-regulation, they could dominate over the longer term. Subglacial sediments beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet must therefore be mapped and characterized, and a sedimentary control of ice flow must be evaluated against competing self-regulation mechanisms.

It is clear that the opposing implications of the two hypotheses for the future evolution of ice flow and mass loss from the GrIS must be reconciled. Direct observations that assert the simulated modifications of subglacial sediment strengths, and thus test the hypothesis of a sedimentary control of ice flow, are a requirement in achieving this reconciliation. Seismic reflection surveys are particularly well suited for hypothesis testing because they have a successful history of delineating and characterizing the substrate beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet, and increasingly so beneath the GrIS ( 13 , 16 – 18 ). On the basis of an in situ study in the Kangerlussuaq sector in West Greenland, we present here the first seismic observations of subglacial sediments affected by supraglacial lake drainages, and explain them in a catchment-wide context using numerical modeling.

Either hypothesis of self-regulation or widespread sediment strengthening can therefore explain the observed decadal slowdown of GrIS’s land-terminating margin. However, a straight contradiction arises in their implications for the long-term evolution of ice flow, as forced not only by increased meltwater volume but also by increased variability in its delivery in a warming climate. Self-regulation and therefore slowdown of ice flow would endure or even magnify in the long term according to the first hypothesis ( 7 – 12 ). This conflicts directly with a modeled increase in the future significance of daily meltwater variability in weakening subglacial sediments and forcing enhancements of melt season ice flow ( 3 ). According to the second hypothesis, mean annual acceleration, and not deceleration, of ice sheet flow would result in the long term, as melt season accelerations progressively outweigh late-season and winter slowdown ( 3 , 27 ).

The second hypothesis builds on the growing recognition that large swathes of the GrIS are underlain by soft sediments that control basal traction and ice flow so that the assumption of negligible hydrodynamic effects may be flawed ( 13 – 21 ). Fluctuating subglacial water pressure gradients are proposed to drive water into or out of a basal sediment layer, respectively weakening or strengthening it by decreasing or increasing its pore water pressure and shear resistance. Sediment weakening or strengthening would correspondingly reduce or enhance basal traction, thereby causing the ice flow of the GrIS to accelerate or decelerate ( 19 , 22 ). This mechanism has been suggested by numerical modeling to be greatly enhanced when supraglacial lakes drain and large quantities of meltwater are discharged rapidly into the subglacial environment, resulting in an overall net strengthening of sediment ( 3 ). Moreover, the cumulative effect of hundreds of melt season supraglacial lake drainages ( 23 – 26 ) on mean annual sediment traction and ice flow is currently modeled to outweigh that of aggregated meltwater variability caused by daily changes in subglacial runoff ( 3 ). Supraglacial lake drainages thus emerge as the primary predicted control on present-day seasonal ice flow, and widespread sediment strengthening by cumulative supraglacial lake drainages is modeled to effect the observed slowdown of the GrIS in recent decades ( 3 ). To date, in situ observations that assert the modeled sedimentary control of ice flow have not been available.

The driving forces are currently subject to debate, and two alternative hypotheses exist. The first of these considers self-regulation of mean annual ice flow ( 7 – 11 ). Early in the melt season, subglacial channel networks are poorly developed and easily overwhelmed by incipient meltwaters, reducing basal traction and accelerating ice flow. Because highly efficient networks of low-pressure subglacial channels develop through the boreal summer, basal traction increases progressively by either stored waters being drawn into the channels ( 7 – 11 ) or complex lateral stress transfers ( 12 ). The resulting slowdown of ice flow through the melt season and the subsequent winter is then proposed to overcompensate for early-season accelerations, sustaining mean annual ice flow reductions over recent decades as increasingly larger channel networks persisted through the winter ( 8 , 10 ). Any hydrodynamic effects of the ice sheet substrate are assumed to be negligible in this self-regulation hypothesis.

It was proposed initially that increased meltwater volumes in a warming climate would scale inversely with basal traction and therefore directly with future ice flow speed ( 4 ). Since then, ice flow accelerations in the summer have been observed to correlate with meltwater variability ( 5 – 7 ). This shorter-term variability arises principally from the drainage of thousands of surface (supraglacial) lakes, diurnal melt cycles, and rainfall, affecting subglacial water pressure gradients, hydrological network development, and thus basal traction ( 6 ). On multiannual time scales, an entirely different picture has been emerging, where enhanced meltwater availability may lead to annually averaged ice flow deceleration, rather than longer-term acceleration ( 7 – 11 ). Perhaps most strikingly, the land-terminating southwestern margin of the GrIS appears to have slowed down by ~12% between 1985–1994 and 2007–2014, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production ( 10 ). It is therefore important that the processes driving this observed decadal deceleration, and the future evolution of ice flow, are fully understood and embedded within ice sheet models.

The contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) to eustatic sea level rise has increased more than sixfold since 1992, due in almost equal measure to increased surface melt runoff and dynamic ice discharge ( 1 ). Current understanding of dynamic discharge processes is, however, disproportionally poor compared to their significance in conveying interior ice into the ocean. Pressurized subglacial water reduces traction and thus enables well-lubricated basal slip, and as such is modeled to exert a strong control on the form and flow of the GrIS ( 2 ). The impacts of basal water on the ice sheet’s mass balance are less certain, however, because observations of the substrate and spatial and temporal variations in its traction are sparse ( 2 , 3 ). Our study directly addresses this problem.

If a thin layer of subglacial water was perched above either lodged (4.26 ± 0.59 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 ) or dilatant (3.0 × 10 6 to 3.4 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 ) sediment, our existing models of subglacial AVA responses ( 16 ) would predict strongly negative zero-incidence reflectivities with respective values of −0.22 and −0.26 to −0.28. These models are incompatible with the weakly positive zero-incidence reflectivities measured in both profiles S1 ( Fig. 3C ) and S2 ( Fig. 3D ), thus excluding the possibility of a thin water layer beneath the ice-bed interface.

The northwestern subglacial valley’s substrate (profile N, Fig. 2A ) is characterized by a positive zero-incidence reflectivity and a negative AVA gradient ( Fig. 3B ) and has an acoustic impedance of 4.17 ± 0.11 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 and a Poisson’s ratio of 0.06 ± 0.05. These AVA attributes are compatible with a very stiff substrate of low water content ( 16 ) and are interpreted as lodged subglacial sediment ( 34 ). The positive AVA gradients observed for profiles S1 ( Fig. 3C ) and S2 ( Fig. 3D ) are conceptually indicative of either dilatant sediment or water beneath the ice base ( Fig. 3A ), although observed zero-incidence reflectivities are positive ( Fig. 3 , C and D) instead of negative, as would be expected from theory in these cases ( Fig. 3A ). We showed previously that this apparent contradiction is diagnostic of a composite seismic reflection, where lodged sediment is overlain by a seismically thin cap of dilatant sediment ( 16 ). On the basis of our established models of “thin-layer” seismic responses, we thus infer the presence of a layer of dilatant sediment within the subglacial basins in profiles S1 and S2 ( Figs. 2 , B and C, and 3 , C and D) that is less than 2 m thick with an acoustic impedance range of 3.0 × 10 6 to 3.4 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 and a Poisson’s ratio approaching 0.5 ( 16 ). This thin dilatant sediment layer is interpreted to be underlain by stiffer, lodged sediment with acoustic impedance of 4.26 ± 0.59 × 10 6 kg m −2 s −1 ( 16 ). The inferred acoustic impedances of the lodged sediments identified by profiles N, S1, and S2 are therefore indistinguishable ( Fig. 3 , B to D).

( A ) Conceptual AVA curves for possible ice substrates ( 48 ), with range of panels (B to D) highlighted. ( B to D ) AVA data and uncertainty ranges derived respectively for profiles N, S1, and S2, where solid red lines are best fits from Bayesian modeling, as explained in Materials and Methods. The presence of lodged subglacial sediment is revealed in profile N, and an additional layer of thin dilatant sediment is indicated by composite reflections in profiles S1 and S2 ( 16 ).

All three seismic profiles imaged undulating glacier beds characterized by topographic variations of up to 150 m ( Fig. 2 ). Profile N shows a continuous reflector beneath, and subparallel to, the basal reflector between positions 1.0 and 2.3 km ( Fig. 2A ). Profiles S1 and S2 show planar sections of reflectivity, dipping northeast at ~1° and northwest at ~3.5°, respectively, beneath which concave reflections suggest subglacial basins, up to 700 m wide ( Fig. 2 , B and C). These interlake basins are distinct from the ice-bed parallel reflector dominant in profile N ( Fig. 2A ). Amplitude-versus-angle (AVA) seismic analysis ( Fig. 3A ) revealed that the AVA gradient for profile N ( Fig. 3B ) is negative, whereas the AVA gradients for profiles S1 ( Fig. 3C ) and S2 ( Fig. 3D ) are both positive, and all three profiles are characterized by positive reflection coefficients at incidence angles of 0° (“zero incidence”).

Automatic gain control, with a 300-ns window, was applied for display, and the yellow dashed lines show the intersections between profiles S1 and S2 in (B) and (C). Major subglacial sediment basins and the range of ice substrate reflectors supplied to our AVA analyses are indicated.

We acquired three two-dimensional (2D) seismic reflection profiles, including profile N in the northwestern subglacial valley between 3 and 5 July 2010, and profiles S1 and S2 beyond the southern margin of Lake F on 10 July and 16 to 17 July 2010, respectively ( Figs. 1C and 2 ). Profile N was located immediately adjacent to the input point of Lake F waters into the northwestern subglacial valley ( Fig. 1C ), and therefore surveyed a basal environment that experienced extreme discharge rates during its rapid drainage some 4 to 6 days before. Calculated hydrological gradients reveal that a hydraulic barrier separated the interlake ice sheet bed beneath profiles S1 and S2 from the subglacial input point of Lake F waters ( Fig. 1C ). Seismic data acquisition and processing are explained in Materials and Methods.

The rapid drainage of Lake F was characterized by peak discharge and uplift rates—due to elastic hydraulic jacking—of ~3300 m 3 s −1 and 0.8 m hour −1 attained ~1 hour after initiation ( 25 ). The lake had a volume of ~7.4 × 10 6 m 3 immediately before drainage and emptied in ~2 hours. Numerical simulations constrained by Global Positioning System (GPS) observations of ice uplift and acceleration at the ice surface before, during, and after lake drainage were consistent with the subglacial dispersal of the lake waters via a transient turbulent sheet and the surrounding distributed subglacial water system ( 25 , 31 , 32 ). Basal ice motion was measured to be enhanced for several hours ( 25 ). Passive seismic monitoring of lake drainage ( 25 ) and icequake analysis using novel techniques ( 33 ) revealed that input of lake waters into the subglacial environment occurred below its western margin ( Fig. 1 ). The waters then spread out into the northwestern subglacial valley, as affirmed initially by reconstruction of ice tectonics using fracture patterns, by uplift and separation of GPS stations and rates of seismicity ( 25 ), and subsequently by numerical modeling ( 31 ). The assertions are consistent with the morphological dominance of the northwestern subglacial valley within the Kangerlussuaq sector ( Fig. 1A ). Several moulins then fed the subglacial hydrological system for the remainder of the melt season ( 25 ). Conduit closure modeling indicates that the subglacial system beneath Lake F remained distributed and at high pressure throughout the drainage event, potentially with a number of smaller subglacial conduits or cavities operating within it ( 25 , 31 , 32 ).

We focused our seismic surveys on supraglacial Lake F in the sector’s Russell Glacier catchment ( Fig. 1 and fig. S1), because it was large and had a high recurrence rate of annual rapid drainage since records began in 2002 ( 30 ). The lake is located on ~1200-m-thick ice and at the head of a broad subglacial valley through which ice and subglacial water flows are channeled toward the northwest ( Fig. 1 ) ( 28 ). The mean date of rapid drainage of Lake F between 2002 and 2009 was 14 July, but 2010 was an abnormally warm melt season and rapid drainage occurred some 2 weeks earlier during the night of 29 to 30 June (fig. S1) ( 25 ). Multiple rapid lake drainages tended to occur in distinct clusters within the same elevation band, migrating up-glacier during the course of the melt season (fig. S1). Accordingly, Lake F was part of a cluster of lake drainages that occurred between 30 June and 2 July 2010 ( 25 , 30 ). Before this, only little surface melt accessed the ice sheet bed via small moulins ( 25 ) so that the subglacial hydrological system below Lake F was likely distributed and inefficient ( 31 ).

Seismic profiles N, S1, and S2 and their acquisition directions are indicated by thick black arrows. The dotted box indicates the 6 km × 6 km area over which sediment strengths and ice flow velocities in Fig. 5 were averaged.

The Kangerlussuaq sector is well suited for an investigation of subglacial conditions because it is land-terminating, and hydrological forcing of ice flow is therefore isolated from oceanic influences. Furthermore, a rich scientific baseline includes high-density radar mapping of the bed ( Fig. 1A ) ( 28 ) and compelling evidence for an abundance of subglacial sediments ( 15 – 17 , 29 ). The sector has also a high areal extent of supraglacial lakes ( 23 ), of which some 28% drain rapidly and in clusters to the bed every melt season ( 30 ).

DISCUSSION

Although our seismic observations are consistent with common sediment textures and depositional histories in all profile locations, the upper horizon of the subglacial sediments in the basin to the south of Lake F is interpreted to be soft and weak, whereas subglacial sediments beyond its northwestern margin are interpreted to be stiff and strong. These observations are counterintuitive because the latter sediments had been affected by rapid subglacial drainage of Lake F some 4 to 6 days before, whereas those in the southern basin had not. The hypothesis of a sedimentary control of ice flow that we aim to test here was suggested by numerical modeling (3). We therefore use herein the same model to understand our tantalizing observations within the broader context of the seasonal evolution of subglacial hydrology and ice flow on the catchment scale. The numerical model is described in Materials and Methods.

Numerical modeling and hypothesis testing Our model simulations highlight cumulative subglacial water fluxes due to multiple supraglacial lake drainage because their aggregate impact on subglacial sediment strength currently outweighs that of daily changes in runoff (above). Although these fluxes were negligible in our study area before the night of 29 to 30 June 2010, the drainage of Lake F during that night caused a distinct spike in cumulative simulated fluxes that are particularly concentrated in the northwestern subglacial valley (Fig. 4A). These simulations agree with previous observations (25), numerical modeling (31), and its morphological dominance in the Kangerlussuaq sector (Fig. 1A). The subsequent drainage of several supraglacial lakes then caused widespread subglacial water fluxes in the Russell Glacier catchment during the 3 to 5 July acquisition period of profile N (Fig. 4B). Many more supraglacial lakes then drained and further enhanced subglacial water fluxes simulated between 5 and 10 July (Fig. 4C), when profile S1 was acquired, and between 10 July and 16 to 17 July (Fig. 4D), when profile S2 was acquired. Fig. 4 Modeled cumulative fluxes due to supraglacial lake drainages in the 2010 melt season. (A) On 30 June, showing fluxes due to Lake F drainage (white circle). (B) On 5 July, showing drainages on 30 June (Lake F, white circle) and 3 to 5 July (pink circles). (C) On 10 July, showing drainages on 6 July (orange circles with white border) and 10 July (orange circles with black border). (D) On 17 July, showing drainages on 11 to 16 July (red circles with black border) and 17 July (red circles with white border). The gray box outlines the 6 km × 6 km area over which sediment strength and ice velocity were averaged in Fig. 5. To facilitate an integrated comparison of our AVA results and model simulations, we have averaged the latter over an area of 6 km × 6 km that is centered on Lake F and includes all three seismic profiles (Fig. 1C). The drainage of Lake F on 29 to 30 June 2010 (days 180 to 181) is simulated to weaken the subglacial sediments in the northwestern valley, but by the time we acquired our seismic profile N on 3 to 5 July (days 184 to 186), the sediments are modeled to have restrengthened again (Fig. 5). In contrast, simulated sediment strengths were low both on 10 July 2010 (day 191) when profile S1 was acquired and on 16 to 17 July 2010 (days 197 to 198) when profile S2 was acquired (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Modeled subglacial sediment strength and ice flow velocity, averaged over a 6 km × 6 km area centered on Lake F (dotted box in Fig. 1C ). The gray shaded areas indicate the acquisition periods of our seismic profiles N, S1, and S2. Sediments are modeled to be strong and weak when profiles N and S1/S2, respectively, were acquired. Corresponding modeled subglacial water fluxes are shown in Fig. 4. Our seismic observations are therefore consistent with changes in subglacial sediment strength forced by supraglacial lake drainages on the GrIS, in full agreement with our numerical simulations (3). Furthermore, the model simulates pronounced accelerations of ice flow when sediments are measured to be weak (for example, on days 191 and 197 to 198) and decelerations when sediments are measured to be strong (for example, on days 184 to 186) (Fig. 5). Because simulated changes in ice flow velocities and sediment strengths generally scale inversely with each other (Fig. 5) (3), our seismic observations confirm the hypothesis of a sedimentary control of ice sheet flow by implication.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603071/F1.large.jpg,"['sheet', 'flow', 'fig', 'complex', 'profiles', 'f', 'ice', 'control', 'greenland', 'evidence', 'subglacial', 'sediment', 's1', 'seismic', 'sedimentary', 'lake']", ,none
45,45,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Liquid crystalline cellulose-based nematogels - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700981,"Physical properties of composite materials can be pre-engineered by controlling their structure and composition at the mesoscale. However, approaches to achieving this are limited and rarely scalable. We introduce a new breed of self-assembled nematogels formed by an orientationally ordered network of thin cellulose nanofibers infiltrated with a thermotropic nematic fluid. The interplay between orientational ordering within the nematic network and that of the small-molecule liquid crystal around it yields a composite with highly tunable optical properties. By means of combining experimental characterization and modeling, we demonstrate submillisecond electric switching of transparency and facile responses of the composite to temperature changes. Finally, we discuss a host of potential technological uses of these self-assembled nematogel composites, ranging from smart and privacy windows to novel flexible displays.

Here, we introduce a new breed of composite materials that combine ordered nematic LC gel networks based on cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) and a small-molecule thermotropic LC fluid similar to that used in LC displays. We pre-engineer the interplay between the LC gel network and the LC fluid surrounding it to enable new composite properties that, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be achieved otherwise. We demonstrate that these composites can be switched by applying electric fields or by varying temperature, or by a combination of these two external stimuli, with the submillisecond response times and switching characteristics consistent with a simple model based on elasticity and surface anchoring properties of LCs. We characterize the structure and both mechanical and optical properties of the ensuing flexible nematogel films, showing that scalable fabrication of these composite materials can lead to technological uses as diverse as smart and privacy windows, electro-optic shutters, and polarizer-free information displays. By considering the scientific and technological impacts exhibited by distantly related classes of mesostructured soft materials, such as polymer-dispersed and polymer-stabilized LCs ( 9 – 15 ) and LC elastomers ( 16 , 17 ), we foresee that our gels will find a large number of practical applications and will reveal a host of new fundamental phenomena arising from the interplay between LC ordering and tunable mesoscale networks of cellulose and related systems.

Composite materials exhibit physical properties that depend on their structure and composition at the mesoscale. However, the approaches to controlling the mesoscopic structure and the ensuing properties are limited and rarely scalable. This is especially true for a broad family of materials, called “gels,” which finds important technological and scientific applications, ranging from biomedical uses of hydrogels to applications of aerogels in thermal insulation and detection of Cherenkov radiation ( 1 – 3 ). Despite large diversity, these materials share a common feature of having three-dimensional (3D) networks of nanoparticles or molecules surrounded by a fluid- or a gas-like medium. These networks are often anisotropic in nature, that is, made of rodlike or ribbon-like and other kinds of anisotropic building blocks ( 4 ). Sol-gel transitions are often accompanied by various types of liquid crystal (LC) phase behavior ( 5 ). For example, cellulose-based gels are typically composed of thin nanofibers, which can be organized in an orderly fashion while being part of the 3D network ( 6 ). Typically, only isotropic fluids are used in gel materials, such as water in hydrogels and alcohols in organogels ( 7 , 8 ), although there have been studies of how silica gel confinement affects the ordering of different LCs ( 9 ). On the other hand, in related classes of soft materials, such as polymer-dispersed and polymer-stabilized LCs, the orientational ordering of the mesophase is mechanically coupled to the polymer matrix or network, which can be anisotropic ( 9 ). However, the means of robust control of the composite properties in these systems remain limited, and the challenges of scalable cost-effective manufacturing hinder a host of potential technological uses.

RESULTS

Liquid crystalline phase behavior of nematogels The CNFs (Fig. 1, A and E) were prepared by using the method of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)–mediated oxidation of native cellulose. During this process, the C6 primary hydroxyl group of the β-1,4–linked d-glucose units is partially converted to C6 carboxylate group (Fig. 1A, inset) (here, according to the common description of the chemical structure of cellulose, C6 is the carbon atom that is linked with the primary hydroxyl group and is not positioned in the ring of the chair conformation). The electrostatic charging of the carboxylate anion on the surface of CNFs provides stabilization of the LC colloidal dispersions against aggregation in polar solvents such as water. CNFs readily form a nematic lyotropic LC when dispersed in water at concentrations above the critical Onsager concentration. The high length-to-width aspect ratio of CNFs (typically within 100 to 300) assures the emergence of nematic LC phase behavior at vanishingly low volume fractions of <1%, which can be well understood on the basis of the Onsager theory, while also accounting for surface charging and nanometer-range Debye screening length (18, 19). Similar to other lyotropic nematic systems (20), the LC of CNFs can be aligned by shearing, which transforms a multidomain sample with defects into an aligned monodomain LC sample, with the relatively uniform shearing-defined director N s , although small variations of local ordering of the nanofibers still remain (just like in other shear-aligned lyotropic LC materials). Cross-linking of these nanofibers (Fig. 1, B and F to H) by hydrogen bonds between carboxyl groups after adding acid (see Materials and Methods) transforms the colloidal LC fluid into a hydrogel while preserving its ordered structural features and preferential ordering of the cellulose nanofibrils along N s . Sequential exchange of the fluid within the gel, which includes the replacement of water with isopropanol and then with the nematic LC 4-cyano-4′-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), transforms this gel solid first into an ordered organogel and then into a nematogel (Fig. 1, C, D, G, and H), as described in detail in Materials and Methods.

Inset: Chemical structure of cellulose before (left) and after (right) the oxidation process. (B) A hydrogel with interlinked CNFs was formed upon cross-linking of the individual fibers into a network, which can be aligned by unidirectional shearing before cross-linking.

The phase behavior of the nematogel as a composite is substantially different from that of the pristine bulk 5CB LC. This new behavior is caused by paranematic ordering of 5CB molecules induced by the network of nanofibrils, with surfaces prompting their tangential orientation with respect to the nanofibers, similar to nematic LCs in other confinement geometries (9–13). The thermodynamic phase behavior of condensed matter is often modified by external fields and confinement so that material systems can exhibit ordered states even at temperatures at which they cannot be thermodynamically stable without fields or nanoconfinement (21). In the case of nematic LCs, the paranematic state is such a state that typically can exist in the presence of fields or confinement even at temperatures above the nematic-isotropic phase transition temperature. For example, these effects of confinement-induced paranematic ordering have been studied previously in polymer-dispersed LCs and other nanoscale confinement geometries (10–12). Optical observations, including light transmission and polarizing microscopy textures, reveal that the nematogel composite formed by 5CB within the CNF network exhibits continuous nematic-like behavior as the sample is heated above the temperature of order-disorder transition of pristine 5CB. Instead of disappearing at the temperature of T NI ≈ 35.3°C of the nematic-isotropic transition of pure bulk 5CB samples, the long-range ordering of 5CB molecules and director (manifested by the strong birefringence and light scattering) persists up to T PNI ≈ 38.5°C of paranematic-isotropic transition of this composite system. Short-range paranematic ordering near CNFs persists even above this transition, although birefringence and scattering drop down abruptly at T PNI ≈ 38.5°C, which is similar to LCs in other nanoscale confinement geometries (9–12). Although the birefringence drops down at the paranematic-isotropic transition and gradually reduces further with increasing temperature, the composite stays weakly birefringent even at high temperatures of about 90°C, which is due to the orientational ordering of CNFs within the gel network itself. The flexible nematogel film derives its unusual physical properties from the interplay between orientational ordering within the cross-linked nematic gel network of CNFs and the nematic fluid infiltrating it (Fig. 2), where the long-range ordering direction of 5CB molecules tends to follow N s . In polydomain nematogel samples obtained with weak or no shearing, the average ordering directions of the cellulose nanofibrils are coupled to the nematic director, as well as to the director of a paranematic state of infiltrated LC induced by the cellulose network in the pretransition region, which can be examined using a polarizing optical microscope (POM) (Fig. 2).

Thermally responsive scattering of nematogels An interesting open question relates to how properties of nanocellulose-based gels can be modified by loading their mesoporous structure with stimuli-responsive materials, which can be controlled by temperature, fields, and other external stimuli. To explore this, we investigate nematogels with two kinds of CNF networks: (i) one with 5.6 weight % (wt %) of CNFs with a smaller aspect ratio and dimensions of 7 nm × 400 nm (CNF1; Fig. 2A) and (ii) one with 0.5 wt % of CNFs with a larger aspect ratio and dimensions of 4.8 nm × 1.2 μm (CNF2; Fig. 2D), although it should be noted that in the process of gel formation, the CNFs can form bundles (Fig. 1, F to H) with diameters considerably larger than the ones in the initial LC colloidal dispersion (Fig. 1E). These nematogels both are infiltrated with the thermotropic LC 5CB and exhibit reversible switching of transparency. The nematogel films with unaligned CNFs appear “milky” (Fig. 2, A and D) at room temperature but become fairly transparent when heated several degrees above the temperature of nematic-isotropic transition T NI of the pristine 5CB nematic fluid and just above T PNI of the nematogel composite (Fig. 2, B and E). The CNF network preserves its nematic-like order and shows birefringence under POM at temperatures not only above T NI of 5CB but even above T PNI of the nematogel composite (Fig. 2, C and F). Even above T PNI , optical anisotropy due to the nematic network of CNFs is additionally enhanced by the short-range paranematic ordering induced by the CNF-5CB interfaces (19), as already discussed above. At temperatures above T PNI , the nematogel exhibits high transparency across a wide range of the visible and near-infrared spectrum, even higher than that of the original cellulose-based hydrogel or organogel infiltrated with ethanol (Fig. 2J). The high transmission is enabled by the effective matching of refractive index of CNFs and the 5CB fluid at these elevated temperatures. The CNFs are optically anisotropic, containing both crystalline and amorphous regions. The crystal structure of the crystalline component of CNFs is reminiscent of that of elementary fibrils found in the cellulose derived from wood (22). Both of the studied types of nanofibers consist of 36 cellulose chains arranged in monoclinic Iβ crystal structure with a P2 1 space group, containing both amorphous and crystalline regions (22). The refractive index of CNF with ideally oriented cellulose I crystal structure was previously reported to be for normally incident light polarized along the fiber and for the linear polarization in the transverse direction (23), although these values depend on the degree of crystallinity, where n e and n o are the extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices, respectively. However, because of the combination of imperfect chain orientations and the existence of amorphous regions, CNFs show weaker optical anisotropy and extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices and closer to each other, different from the theoretical values estimated for ideal crystals without the amorphous content (23). In the nematic phase, 5CB is also a positively anisotropic uniaxial optical material, with the extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices and at 589 nm and 24°C (24). Upon heating the pristine 5CB above T NI (or T NI for our composites), this material becomes an isotropic fluid with a single polarization-independent refractive index at 589 nm and temperatures of 39°C and higher (24), although even this value is altered by the cellulose network within the composite. The surfaces of CNFs impose tangential alignment for the director of the small-molecule nematic 5CB. Because of these boundary conditions, orientational ordering within 5CB mechanically couples to that of the CNF network composed of fibrils oriented, on average, parallel to each other along N s and to the nematic director of 5CB infiltrating it. This coupling in alignment can be seen by examining domains of the CNF-5CB composite at a temperature right above the paranematic-isotropic transition (when the long-range ordering disappears and the nematic-like organization persists only in small regions near the nanofibril surfaces) between crossed polarizers (Fig. 2, C and F). For example, the scattering is large for the linearly polarized incident light, with the polarization direction along the director of the CNF-5CB composite, because of the strong mismatch of refractive index ( ) between CNFs and 5CB in the nematic phase. On the other hand, for the temperature T > T PNI , the mismatch of the refractive index ( , with the gradual changes of the index of 5CB on the nanoscale in the vicinity of nanofibers due to the surface-induced paranematic ordering) is much smaller, causing substantially less scattering of light. This analysis, with a similar conclusion, can be extended to unpolarized light. Beyond the CNF-5CB index mismatch in the nematic state of the nematogel composite, individual domains of the composite can have misoriented ordering directions or even defects, yielding additional spatial variations of the effective refractive index within 5CB. In thick samples, director fluctuations in the nematic state of 5CB also contribute to scattering and hazy appearance below T PNI . The large variety of sources of scattering in the nematic state of 5CB within the composite causes a hazy appearance of the composites across the entire visible part of spectrum. On the other hand, the scattering is mainly of the Rayleigh type above T PNI , arising mainly just from the mismatches of indices between CNFs and isotropic 5CB, consistent with the much stronger scattering of the violet-blue light as compared to red light. A flexible device with thermally and electrically responsive light transmission can be fabricated by sandwiching the nematogel into a plastic LC cell with transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes (Fig. 2G). At room temperature, the cell is in an opaque state because of the scattering of visible light discussed above, but it becomes highly transparent at an elevated temperature T > T PNI because of the closer CNF-5CB refractive index matching in the isotropic phase of 5CB (Fig. 2, H to L). For example, the relative visible spectrum–averaged light transmission η trans of a 30-μm-thick LC cell with the confined nematogel can be increased from 5 to 97% in response to changing temperature from 32° to 41°C (Fig. 2K), where the transmittance η trans is defined as the ratio of direct transmitted and incident light intensities, with the reflections at the gel-air interfaces and the absorption of plastic substrate subtracted. The temperature-dependent light transmission (Fig. 2K) further confirms the presence of the CNF network–induced paranematic ordering of 5CB, with the paranematic-to-isotropic transition temperature T PNI ≈ 38.5°C of the nematogel composite, which is significantly higher than the T NI of the pristine 5CB (35.3°C). This behavior can be further understood by invoking the theoretical models describing the behavior of LCs confined in nanoporous structures, as detailed below (25, 26).

Submillisecond electric switching The transparency of the nematogel composites can be controlled by electric fields. When the polarization of incident light is parallel to the director N s of the CNF-5CB composite at no applied electric field, with the rodlike 5CB molecules following the fiber orientations, the mismatch of the refractive index between 5CB and CNFs is , so the nematogel scatters strongly. The scattering leads to low light transmittance and to the opaqueness of the nematogel cells. When we apply an AC sinusoidal voltage within f = 1 to 50 kHz to the nematogel (note that high-frequency electric fields are needed to demonstrate the fast response of nematogels that we discuss below), the 5CB molecules reorient along the electric field, so the mismatch of refractive index between 5CB and CNFs constitutes at 24°C (and <0.03 when the temperature is close to T PNI ) (24), smaller than the value before applying voltage. Additionally, the nematic director domains of spatially varying director orientation and refractive index disappear as the LC is aligned with the electric field orientation, and even the light scattering due to director fluctuations is suppressed in an applied field. Consequently, an electric field can switch the light transmission from 18 to 70% at 600 nm (Fig. 2J). By measuring the light transmittance of the cells as a function of the applied voltage, we determine the electro-optic switching characteristics and the critical field of the Fréedericksz transition E c at different temperatures (Fig. 2, J to L). The threshold electric fields remain practically unchanged at ≈3.0 V/μm at the studied temperatures, although light transmission of both the “on” and “off” states tends to be higher at elevated temperatures (Fig. 2L), which can be attributed to the effects related to matching of refractive indices of 5CB and CNF at different temperatures. The voltages needed for the nematogel switching depend on the thickness of the film and can range from ~10 V for thin films in the micrometer range to more than 100 V for thick films with thicknesses of 100 μm and higher. To understand the mechanical coupling between the gel network of CNFs and the director of 5CB, as well as to obtain insights into the switching behavior of nematogels (Fig. 3), we apply a physical model accounting for the LC’s elastic, surface anchoring, and dielectric properties in the used geometry of cellulose-based nematogels. In particular, we adopt (and extend to our system) a model that describes electric switching of nanoscale-dispersed LC composites developed previously for polymer-dispersed LC systems (27). We assume that the LC is compartmentalized in domains with a periodicity of a along the x axis and b along the y axis encircled by CNFs (Fig. 3A, inset). By assuming that the CNF nanofibrils are perfectly straight and very long as compared to their width, we can treat the problem as 2D in nature while assuming that the structure is translationally invariant along the z axis of the coordinate system introduced in Fig. 3A. We use the one-elastic-constant approximation within the Frank-Oseen theory of orientational elasticity (19, 28) and model the geometry of domains of the nematic director in the field-on state by rectangles of dimensions a along the x axis and b along the y axis. Minimization of the total free energy, including its elastic and electric field coupling bulk terms and the surface anchoring terms due to the weak anchoring conditions at the surfaces of the CNF network, yields the equilibrium director configurations within the nematogel at different fields, albeit the high-field behavior cannot be easily accounted for analytically (19, 28) and requires numerical studies. We therefore first consider this problem at the onset the Fréedericksz transition, at the lowest threshold field when the dielectric torque overcomes the elastic and surface anchoring torques in prompting the director realignment (19, 28). This problem can be treated for the LC nematogel cell of gap thickness d along the applied field direction, assuming that it can then be extended to understand the realignment transition in each of the identical rectangular nematogel domains confined by the CNF network. The total bulk free energy density (per unit volume within each compartment) of the nematic LC can be expressed as (1)where θ (x,y) is the distortion angle of the nematic director with respect to the z axis, K is the average Frank elastic constant of the LC, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, Δε is the LC dielectric anisotropy, and E is the electric field (27). With finite surface anchoring on the perimeter of each of the rectangular director domains, the geometric parameters a and b have to be modified to account for the finite-strength boundary conditions at the CNF-5CB interfaces. For this, we assume that the boundary conditions are tangentially degenerate and that the surface anchoring energy per unit area can be expressed in the Rapini-Papoular form: f s = W sin2θ/2, where W is the polar surface anchoring strength coefficient characterizing director-CNF coupling at the surfaces in the corners of the rectangular domains. The average distance between the centers of the randomly distributed cellulose fibrils changes with the CNF volume fraction (dimensionless, or can be expressed in percent) c as , where D is the diameter of CNFs and α is a geometry-dependent coefficient with units of length. By considering unidirectional alignment of infinitely long fibers assumed in our simplified geometry model, the volume fraction varies as c = [D/(d′ + D)]2, so that we can roughly estimate d′ as . The parameters a and b vary with increasing concentration as 1/a = 1/d + 1/d′ and 1/b = 1/d′, where the characteristic length d′ is determined by the details of the CNF network geometry discussed above. The critical threshold field needed for director realignment in our nematogel system with finite anchoring can be then expressed as (27) (2)which, as shown below, is consistent with experimentally determined parameters. Analogous to polymer-dispersed LCs (27), we can then model the anticipated electrically driven director realignment response times. Because the falling time is , the falling and rising response times can be explicitly expressed as (27) (3) (4)where γ is the rotational viscosity of 5CB infiltrating the gel. Fig. 3 Characterization of response times associated with electric switching of nematogels. (A and B) Transmission versus time curves used to characterize rising time (A) and falling time (B) of CNF2-5CB nematogel at different temperatures and applied voltages indicated in the legends. The inset in (A) shows the coordinate system and the physical model of the nematogel cell of thickness d, with a CNF-compartmentalized LC domain characterized by geometric parameters a and b; the uniform director at no fields and the CNF fibers are shown co-aligned. The experimental data (scatter symbols) are fitted by the corresponding results emerging from the physical model (solid lines). (C) Response times of CNF2-5CB nematogel versus temperature, where τ rising and τ falling were measured using a field of 7.8 V/μm. (D) Response time versus voltage characterized at 31.5°C. In the studied composite material, the concentration weight fraction of CNF is 0.19 wt %, which translates to the volume fraction of 0.127 volume % when using the density of cellulose ρ CNF = 1.5 g/cm3. By taking the experimental diameter D = 4.8 nm of CNFs (Fig. 1, E to H) and assuming that the CNF network has homogeneous alignment due to shearing and also that the fibrils do not touch each other, we calculate the average distance d′ between the CNFs to be 130 nm, which is consistent with the dimensions of the CNF skeleton and morphology revealed by SEM displayed in Fig. 1G. By substituting the average elastic constant K ≈ 5 pN and dielectric anisotropy Δε = 11.25 of 5CB at f = 50 kHz (29), ε 0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F/m, d = 30 μm, and the experimental value E c = 3.0 V/μm (Fig. 2L) into Eq. 2, we obtain an estimate of the surface anchoring coefficient W = 4.9 × 10−5 J/m2. This estimate is consistent with the weak surface anchoring boundary conditions assumed in the model, and is close to the independent measurements of polar surface anchoring coefficient at the cellulose-5CB interfaces reported in literature (30, 31). The nematogel exhibits ultrafast electric switching of transparency, which is of interest for a broad range of technological uses, including applications such as optical shutters, electro-optic modulators, privacy windows, and transflective flexible displays (32). The microsecond-range response time is two orders of magnitude faster than that of conventional LCs and related composite systems, such as the conventional polymer-dispersed LCs. At a lower temperature of T PNI -T = 7.5°C, the nematogel’s transmission is switched from 5 to 8% across the visible spectrum by an electric field of 3.7 V/μm, whereas it is switched from 5 to 22% by a stronger electric field of 7.8 V/μm. At an elevated temperature close to the paranematic-isotropic transition, T PNI -T = 1.0°C, the electric field of 7.8 V/μm switches the nematogel’s light transmission in a wide range from 20 to 61% (Fig. 3, A and B). These characteristics can be further tuned, depending on the need, by using the infiltrating thermotropic LCs with different refractive indices preselected to optimize transparency in the field-on or field-off states and for different polarizations of incident light. To determine the response time, in accordance with the model detailed above, we fit the transmission dependencies on time by the exponentials η trans − η ref = −A exp(−t/τ rising ) and η trans − η ref = B exp(−t/τ falling ), where η ref is the reference transmission and A and B are fitting coefficients. The submillisecond response times from 0.1 to 0.35 ms are observed at all studied temperatures and voltages (Fig. 3, A and B). Both the rising and falling times increase with temperature, which is mainly because the ratio γ/K increases with temperature (Fig. 3C). The falling time remains almost unchanged at different voltages, whereas the rising time decreases with the magnitude of the applied electric field, which is consistent with Eqs. 3 and 4 (Fig. 3D). The ultrafast response time arises from the constraints on LC molecule orientations in the vicinity of the bulk-distributed surfaces of the CNF network. On the basis of our model and Eq. 3, taking γ = 0.045 Pa·s of 5CB at 31.5°C (33) and experimental τ falling = 117 μs at an electric field of 7.8 V/μm, we obtain the surface-anchoring coefficient W ≈ 2.6 × 10−5 J/m2, which is close to the value deduced from the measurement of the threshold electric field, as discussed above. On the other hand, by using W obtained from the independent measurements and estimates described above, we can use our model to describe or predict the experimental threshold field for electric switching of the nematogel composites, which again exhibits good agreement.","Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700981/F1.large.jpg,"['fig', 'nematic', 'network', 'cnfs', 'nematogel', 'electric', 'temperature', 'cellulosebased', 'nematogels', 'lc', '5cb', 'crystalline', 'composite', 'liquid']", ,none

For years, in her native Syria, she and her husband had longed for a baby but doctors told them Ayesha had no hope of conceiving.

When the war broke out, the couple left the country and headed to Amman, the Jordanian capital. They were still desperate for a child.

“We used our savings to consult doctors to find out what our options were,” says Ayesha. “But they all said the same thing.”

Four years passed before a doctor suggested in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

“We arrived in Irbid to try our luck with IVF here and I got pregnant,” says Ayesha. “But we were running out of money and it’s very hard for us to find work in Jordan. How was I to go through my pregnancy safely?”

It was around that time that she and her husband learned of the existence of a maternity hospital run by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Irbid city, 15 kilometres from the Syrian border.

The hospital has seen the births of more than 10,000 babies, most of them Syrian, since it opened four years ago. Irbid governorate is home to 140,000 Syrians, many of whom, like Ayesha and her husband, left their country at the start of the civil war.

Jordan hosts 660,550 registered refugees, but according to the authorities, more than a million refugees live in the country. Approximately 80,000 live in Zaatari and 53,700 in Azrak – Jordan’s biggest camps – while the others struggle to settle in urban communities or have moved to rural areas.

Born a refugee

With its free-of-charge facility, MSF has become the main reproductive healthcare provider in north Jordan.

“This has placed us in a unique position to witness the hopes brought by new lives, but we also realise it’s likely that these babies may never see their country of origin,” says Erwan Grillon, MSF head of mission in Jordan.

Ayesha’s twins, and the thousands of other Syrian babies born in Jordan, could well be faced with a difficult quest for an identity in a country where, according to the authorities, Syrian refugees represent a heavy burden. Stress on the local economy, unemployment, an overloaded health system and the threat of terrorism are among the issues raised by Jordanians who are weary of the situation.

“When they come to the maternity hospital, patients speak of their challenges with integration into Jordanian society,” says Grillon.

“They are outsiders socially and culturally, and so-called intruders in the economy. They are poor and struggling but carry the weight of being an additional burden on Jordan’s job market.”

To date, the Jordanian government has issued more than 50,000 work permits to Syrian refugees and the harrowing conditions in Syria are likely to force more people across the border.

Costly care

The MSF facility welcomes dozens of patients every day who come for antenatal and postnatal care or to give birth. Many people seek mental health support.

These families are unable to pay for healthcare at private clinics, where each visit costs an average of between 25 and 40 Jordanian dinars (35 and 56 US dollars). Most are unemployed, in debt and rely on limited humanitarian aid.

Basma*, a 20-year-old Syrian, fell pregnant in Zaatari camp. Reluctant to stay there, she and her husband moved to the outskirts of Irbid. While they struggled to find jobs, accessing medical tests, medicines and consultations was even more difficult.

Another Syrian refugee told Basma about MSF’s maternity hospital and she gave birth there a few months later.

“I feel blessed that despite all the hardship the baby was born and now we are a family under the care of impartial doctors and nurses,” she says.","Fri, 04 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://media.msf.org/AssetLink/2t040tuqrhtv672370h3ti2inv6ktkn8.jpg,"['refugees', 'syrian', 'jordanian', 'ayesha', 'msf', 'born', 'husband', 'maternity', 'irbid', 'country', 'jordan', 'babies', 'hospital', '10000']", ,none

The spirit is soaked in Carolina Reaper chilis—which holds the Guinness World Record for the hottest known pepper in the world—before being bottled. Its label even warns “Only Satan himself is brave enough to drink this vodka neat.”

It seems as though one fellow in the UK was in fact brave enough to try the spirit—and paid the unfortunate price of an ambulance ride, International Business Times reports. After a woman decided to share her bottle of Satan’s Shot with a group of friends, a man in his 30s reportedly lost consciousness and was taken to the Royal Surrey County Hospital in the UK after consuming the drink.

Here’s the thing, we love a nice drizzle of Sriracha on just about everything—and spicy foods can actually be good for you. In fact, research suggests that capsaicin—the key source of peppers’ heat—may help regulate your cardiovascular function and metabolism, which helps protect you against heart disease and diabetes. Plus, men who love spicy tastes tend to have higher testosterone levels. (Check out these 31 best hot sauces you’ve never had.)

But there’s a difference between a bit of a kick and literally wanting to dump your head into a bucket of ice water. Let these six other extreme (and rare) instances of horrifically spicy foods gone wrong be your warning.

A MAN ENDED UP WITH A HOLE IN HIS ESOPHAGUS AFTER EATING A GHOST PEPPER

Ever heard of a ghost pepper? It’s one of the hottest chili peppers in the world with twice the strength of a habanero pepper.

After one 47-year-old man ate a hamburger topped with ghost pepper puree, he ended up downing six glasses of water. This led to severe abdominal and chest pain after violent vomiting, according to a case report in The Journal of Emergency Medicine. After he got to the ER, doctors performed X-rays and a CT scan, they found a 2.5-centimeter tear in his esophagus.

The University of California at San Francisco physicians reported that it was the forceful vomiting and retching that ruptured his food pipe, not the heat from the pepper alone. Still, a tear in your esophagus can be fatal if it’s not quickly discovered and treated. In this case, the man remained in the hospital for more than 20 days, but had to leave with a gastric tube placed in his throat.

ONE MAN WAS NEARLY BLINDED AFTER A CHEF THREW A BOWL OF CHILI POWDER INTO HIS EYES

After one couple gave a not-so-great review of their meal at a South Wales curry restaurant, the chef got so enraged that he actually came out of his kitchen and threw chili powder right into the 46-year-old man’s eyes, The Telegraph reported.

He instantly thought he had been blinded and rushed to the hospital, where doctors flushed his eyes out with water.

“It was horrific. He said he’s never had so much pain in his life and was extremely distressed,” his wife told The Telegraph.

DOCTORS FOUND A HOLE IN A MAN’S STOMACH AFTER HE ATE A NOTORIOUSLY SPICY SOUP

After a 26-year-old man in China consumed a mala soup—which literally translates to “numbing hot”—doctors discovered a burned hole in the wall of his stomach, the Herald Sun reported. The dish is traditionally prepared with Sichuan pepper, local spices, and chili pepper.

Shortly after he slurped the hottest variation of the soup, the man began to feel sharp pains in his stomach and vomited up blood. Since he had no history of gastrointestinal illnesses or conditions, his doctors believe the soup might have had something to do with his condition.

While it seems like a bit of a stretch, the doctors estimated that about 15 percent of stomach incidents at the hospital are related to hot pot dishes, like the mala soup.

48,48,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Olive oil by-product shows functional food potential - NutraIngredients.com,https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2017/08/01/Olive-oil-by-product-shows-functional-food-potential,"Enriching fish burgers with 10% dried olive pomace flour (DOPF) increased their content of phenolic compounds by a factor of 13, according to a study published in Food Science and Nutrition​.

The addition of the olive paste also enhanced the flavonoid content and antioxidant activity of the burgers.

“The addition of olive by-products leads to an increase of the phenolic content and the antioxidant activity,”​ wrote the team, a collaboration between the University of Foggia and the Institute of Sciences of Food Production (ISPA), National Research Council of Italy (CNR).

However, the bitterness from the added olive paste gave the enriched burgers an unpleasant taste. The odour of the cooked burgers was also unacceptable, while colour and texture also suffered a deterioration compared to the ‘control’ burgers without the DOPF.

“As expected, the DOPF enrichment considerably improved the fish burger quality, but it negatively influenced the sensory properties due to a very bitter and spicy taste that became the products unacceptable,”​ explained corresponding author Professor Matteo Alessandro Del Nobile of Foggia University.

The researchers eventually produced fish burgers which had a balance of acceptable sensory properties and enhanced nutritional quality (total phenols content and antioxidant activity) using a combined hydration/ extraction technique with water or milk. This removed the bitter taste and unacceptable odour.

Significance ​

Volumes of waste from food processing are large and can potentially create disposal and pollution problems. Thus, the utilisation of a by–product which contains nutritionally beneficial bioactive compounds makes sense from both health and economic standpoints.

The authors suggest that the nutritional benefits of the enhanced phenolic content provide the possibility “to consider the new fish burger suitable for a balanced diet with the possibility to be regarded as a new functional food.”​

Taste improvement process​

To overcome the sensory quality issues, the researchers tried pre-treating the burgers with either water or milk. Although taste improved, the odour of the cooked burgers actually worsened.

Consequently, they tried a two-stage process of hydration and extraction which resulted in significant improvements in sensory quality (particularly using milk). In particular, the bitter taste was substantially decreased.

“The hydration/extraction with either water or milk leads to a substantial decrease of the bitter taste related to DOPF,” ​observed the researchers.

Both cooked and uncooked final products had palatability scores only marginally below those of the DOPF-free burgers.

Although the extraction process lowered the bioactive compound content and antioxidant activity in the burgers, the total phenols content of the DOPF-enriched burgers was still over 3.5 times that of the olive-paste-free controls.

The extraction process therefore enabled production of burgers with a balance between enhanced nutritional content and acceptable sensory quality.

He was held captive and separated from his family, who had no idea that he was still alive. In July as the battle to retake Mosul raged, Emad was found beneath the rubble of the old city.

He was covered in dust and his small, emaciated body was wracked with injuries from shrapnel, bullets and bombs. He had only tiny morsels of food to eat in the two months before he was found, as Iraqi forces closed in on the old city in the west of Mosul.

The youngster was attempting to get a drink of water near one of the bridges that span the Tigris River, which bisects the city, when he was struck by a bullet. It was the last thing he remembers, and the culmination of his terrifying ordeal

“Emad suffered a great deal ... but thank God he is okay.”

He was subsequently reunited with his uncle, Hadi Tammo, 31, in this city in northwest Iraq. “Even though he’s injured, we’re very happy,” Tammo said.

One month after his escape, Emad’s wounds had been bandaged and he had been given a haircut. But he continued to wear a sad, tired expression not normally seen on children of his age. His wounded stomach, elbow and head continued to cause him pain.

“Emad suffered a great deal and his family were also captured,” said Hadi, whose children and wife were kidnapped by the extremists, before managing to escape from their ordeal last year. “He’s not feeling well, but thank God he is okay.”

The Yazidi community in Sinjar, northwestern Iraq, was targeted by extremists in 2014. Militants separated men and boys older than 12 years old from the rest of their families, and killed those who refused to adopt their beliefs.

More than 6,000 women and girls were kidnapped and sold as slaves, among them many of Emad’s relatives. Thousands of Yazidis were massacred or died of dehydration and exhaustion as they tried to escape the onslaught.

The UN has deemed their ordeal an ongoing genocide that amounts to crimes against humanity and war crimes.

After the attack, the life of Emad’s family, and the lives of many other families like theirs, changed forever.

Emad’s mother managed to escape captivity in 2016, and earlier this year she was relocated to the Canadian city of Winnipeg with the help of UNHCR. When Emad was rescued in July, UNHCR connected the names of mother and child and realized who he was, said UNHCR resettlement specialist Sarah Webster.

The boy made his way to Canada on August 16, along with a UN minder and another Yazidi family who were also being relocated there. While in Dohuk, UNHCR arranged a meeting between Emad and the other family so that he would have some familiar faces on the flight.

“It was of utmost importance to us to get Emad back to his mother and siblings as soon as possible.”

“Family unity is one of the most important principles for UNHCR. The family provides a really important support network for people who have been through what Emad has been through,” Webster said, a few days before Emad's departure. “It was of utmost importance to us to get Emad back to his mother and siblings as soon as possible.”

The youngster was so excited by the prospect of being reunited with his mom that he had his bags packed days in advance.

“He can’t wait to see his mother again after three horrific years apart,” said his uncle Hadi. “When Emad first talked to his mother they were both very happy. It was like Emad was waking up from a grave. He was almost dead. He had been injured in his belly. But for his mom, she was just very happy. It was like Emad was reborn.""

Following his ordeal, Emad could hardly communicate when he met his relatives again because his captors had forced him to speak Arabic and not his native Kurdish. “We want him to go to school so his mind will be clear and then he can move forward with a new life,” said Hadi.

Once he is settled in Canada he will be assessed and will receive specialized care which is limited or unavailable in Iraq.

“Children who were held in captivity for long periods of time have been subject to a range of things, such as forced labour, forced conversion, physical and psychological abuse, on top of that separation from their family members,” said Webster.

“Our first priority is to reunite them with their family members so that they can at least relieve this stress and separation, and then we start to focus on recovery and access to specialized services, like Emad will have in Canada.”","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb3/59930ebe3.jpg,"['mother', 'emad', 'unhcr', 'yazidi', 'dohuk', 'city', 'canada', 'family', 'freed', 'iraq', 'boy', 'joins', 'unhcrandrea', 'tammo', 'region']", ,none

54,54,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Fairy circle landscapes under the sea - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603262,"Short-scale interactions yield large-scale vegetation patterns that, in turn, shape ecosystem function across landscapes. Fairy circles, which are circular patches bare of vegetation within otherwise continuous landscapes, are characteristic features of semiarid grasslands. We report the occurrence of submarine fairy circle seascapes in seagrass meadows and propose a simple model that reproduces the diversity of seascapes observed in these ecosystems as emerging from plant interactions within the meadow. These seascapes include two extreme cases, a continuous meadow and a bare landscape, along with intermediate states that range from the occurrence of persistent but isolated fairy circles, or solitons, to seascapes with multiple fairy circles, banded vegetation, and “leopard skin” patterns consisting of bare seascapes dotted with plant patches. The model predicts that these intermediate seascapes extending across kilometers emerge as a consequence of local demographic imbalances along with facilitative and competitive interactions among the plants with a characteristic spatial scale of 20 to 30 m, consistent with known drivers of seagrass performance. The model, which can be extended to clonal growth plants in other landscapes showing fairy rings, reveals that the different seascapes observed hold diagnostic power as to the proximity of seagrass meadows to extinction points that can be used to identify ecosystems at risks.

( A ) Side-scan image of a seagrass meadow in Pollença bay (Mallorca Island, Western Mediterranean) from LIFE Posidonia ( 31 ) showing different patterns in meadows of P. oceanica and C. nodosa. Other examples are shown in figs. S9 to S11. ( B ) Image of a fairy circle in a P. oceanica meadow in the Adriatic Sea as seen from the coast. Photography by Zvaqan is available in Google Street View and ( C ) the same fairy circle in a satellite image of Google maps (44°05′37.5″N, 14°55′37.6″E). Other fairy circles can be found at the following locations: 44°04′01.8″N, 14°57′53.3″E and 39°08′48.2″N, 2°56′07.1″E.

Here, we report that inspection of side-scan sonar cartography of seagrass meadows (P. oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa) in Mallorca Island (Western Mediterranean) reveals that vegetation patterns of holes and spots spanning over many kilometers are prevalent along the coastline of the Balearic Islands (see Fig. 1A ) ( 31 ). We also present a simple, parsimonious model of clonal plant growth yielding self-organized submarine vegetation patterns that encompass the diversity of seascapes observed.

With a global distribution along the shorelines of all continents except Antarctica, seagrass meadows are valuable ecosystems that provide valuable ecosystem services ( 27 ); but they rank among the most threatened ecosystems globally ( 28 ). P. oceanica is the dominant seagrass in the Mediterranean Sea, where it forms underwater meadows that support great biodiversity, are a site of intense CO 2 sequestration, and offer shoreline protection ( 29 , 30 ). Unfortunately, this ecosystem is affected by multiple anthropogenic impacts, including reduced water quality and physical impacts, that have led to a loss of 6.9% per year over the past 50 years ( 30 ). Although P. oceanica is a strongly clonal plant propagating through rhizome growth, its very slow horizontal spread of a few centimeters per year implies that losses are essentially irreversible over managerial time scales ( 30 ).

Although self-organized patchiness and pattern formation are well documented in terrestrial ecosystems, their occurrence in marine environments has attracted much less attention. Fairy circle–like structures have been reported in seagrass meadows, such as Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica ( 18 , 19 ) and Zostera marina in the Danish Kattegat ( 20 ). Complex landscapes, such as bare seascapes dotted with plant patches, termed “leopard skin” ( 21 ), and striped vegetation patterns ( 22 , 23 ), have also been studied. However, inspection of satellite images and side-scan cartography reveals that complex seascapes are abundant in meadows of P. oceanica, suggesting that self-organized submarine vegetation patterns may be prevalent but have remained thus far largely hidden under the sea. Obviously, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these submarine fairy circle landscapes must be necessarily different than those operating in water-limited ecosystems on land ( 12 , 14 , 16 ). Although there are some hypotheses of possible mechanisms in several marine ecosystems ( 23 – 26 ), there is only a partial understanding of the phenomenon in P. oceanica meadows.

The processes conducive to different dynamics of vegetation landscapes have been assessed in habitats ranging from arid ecosystems and savannahs to forests and wetlands ( 1 , 2 , 4 ). The most striking patterns have been reported in drylands, where competition for water leads to self-organized vegetation patchiness ( 9 – 13 ), including the appearance of the so-called fairy circles, whose origin has stirred significant controversy ( 12 , 14 – 17 ). These are bare circular patches surrounded by grass, which appear, for example, in regions of the grassy deserts of Namibia ( 14 ) and Australia ( 16 ) and have been used as a basis to formulate a theory of self-organization of vegetation landscapes in water-limited ecosystems.

The spatial organization of vegetation landscapes is a key factor in assessment of ecosystem health and functioning ( 1 – 4 ). Spatial configurations of vegetation landscapes act as potential indicators of climatic or human forcing affecting the ecosystem ( 2 ) and determine energy and material budgets and feedbacks across space ( 2 , 4 – 6 ). In addition, although vegetation tends to cover all available ground under favorable conditions, plant distributions can spontaneously develop spatial inhomogeneities under resource limitation, acting as ecosystem engineers that modify the fluxes of nutrients and water to improve their growth conditions ( 4 , 7 ). Hence, the spatial organization of vegetation landscapes provides an indicator of the existence of stressing factors and the proximity of critical thresholds leading to irreversible losses ( 4 , 8 ).

RESULTS

Sintes et al. (32, 33) developed a model, based on a limited set of simple rules underpinning clonal growth, successfully reproducing seagrass growth: First, the growing apex of seagrass rhizomes elongates in a fixed horizontal direction with a velocity ν, leaving new shoots behind, which are separated along the rhizome by a typical distance ρ. Second, the growing apex develops new branches at a rate ω b , with these branches elongating into a horizontal direction at an angle φ b from the original rhizome. Living shoots have a typical lifetime, depending on external factors and the presence of neighboring shoots, resulting in a per capita mortality rate ω d . If ω d < ω b at a given position, the density of shoots will increase locally. The typical value of each parameter is a characteristic feature of each species with some variability driven by genetic and environmental conditions (32).

We have scaled up this model (originally conceived to describe patch development) to landscape scale by coarse-graining it to describe the dynamics of the shoot, n s , and apex, n a , densities. Total shoot density n t , is calculated as the sum of shoots and apices growing in all directions. This model, which we call the “Advection-Branching-Death” (ABD) model, includes rhizome growth in different directions, contributions from rhizome branching, and shoot death. Shoot mortality rates are density-dependent as well as dependent on environmental factors (for example, resource availability). More specifically, three terms contribute to the total mortality (1)

On the one hand, the intrinsic mortality rate, ω d0 > 0, of an individual shoot at a particular position in the landscape depends on environmental factors, and on the other hand, on two density-dependent terms: local saturation and nonlocal interaction. The saturation term is nonlinear and prevents an unlimited growth, increasing mortality locally when the density increases excessively. The strength b of this density-dependent term reflects the environmental carrying capacity, determining the maximum density in the meadow. Nonlocal interactions are included through an integral term accounting for the interaction of shoots at position with those in a neighborhood weighted by the kernel . Through nonlocal interactions, the abundance of shoots in a place can affect the growth in a neighborhood. The model therefore includes two essential components to yield self-organization: nonlinearity and spatial interaction.

The three terms in Eq. 1 are consistent with the current functional understanding of seagrass meadows. The intrinsic mortality rate of individual shoots, determining ω d0 , depends on external factors such as temperature and irradiance regimes (34). Local density dependence results from self-shading, determining the maximum density of shoots for a given plant size (35) and the general decline in seagrass density and biomass with depth (36), as well as local depletion of other resources, such as CO 2 , which is depleted during daytime in dense meadows (37). Nonlocal interactions integrate a number of facilitative and competitive mechanisms. Facilitative interactions arise, for instance, in the form of stress amelioration, when the presence of neighboring plants dissipates wave energy, which may prevent shoot removal from scouring of waves within the meadow (38) and contributes to stabilize and trap sediments (39). Facilitation has been argued to play a role in shaping seagrass landscapes (40, 41). Negative interactions appear, for instance, as a result of anaerobic microbial decomposition in dense meadows, which leads to diffusing sulfide fronts that spread mortality, leading to the appearance of fairy rings (20). Competition can arise also from depletion of nutrients from the flow by plants up-current (42) or of other diffusing resources, such as CO 2 .

Hence, existing evidence suggests intraspecific facilitation and competitive nonlocal interaction whose precise ranges are difficult to determine. As a result of these interactions, the meadow can self-organize enhancing facilitative effects and diminishing competition, altering the environment to yield more favorable growth conditions.

We consider a kernel with two terms of Gaussian shape (2)where κ > 0 is the strength of the competitive interaction with width σ κ , and μ > 0 is the strength of facilitation with width σ μ , where the widths of the Gaussians correspond to the spatial extension of the interactions. Note that we should have μ ≤ ω d0 to guarantee positive mortality. For simplicity, in the following, we take μ = ω d0 . As a result of the two Gaussians with different widths and signs, the kernel has the shape of an inverted Mexican hat, and the interaction is stronger at short distances, decaying very fast with .

Competition or facilitation may dominate at shorter or longer distances depending on the values of σ κ and σ μ . On general grounds, the main effect of facilitation is to permit the coexistence of the populated and unpopulated homogeneous states, whereas nonlocal competition is one of the mechanisms responsible for the spontaneous formation of regular patterns, either on itself (43) or acting together with the facilitative interaction (4). Thus, observation of spatial patterns suggests the existence of nonlocal competitive interactions. Selecting σ κ > σ μ results in a kernel that is weakly competitive at large distances, yielding to a suitable nonlocal interaction for pattern formation (see the Supplementary Materials) (4). The main nonlocal interaction terms (κ, σ κ , μ, and σ μ ) can be inferred from the comparison of numerical simulations and observed patterns, whereas seagrass growth parameters are largely known [see the study by Sintes et al. (33) and references therein].

The ABD model yields a great diversity of complex spatial patterns emerging at different parameter regions, including nonlinear phenomena resulting in the coexistence of different solutions, which are shown in Fig. 2 for the case of constant ω d0 and b. When mortality is high (ω d0 /ω b > > 1), the only possible solution is bare soil, the unpopulated solution. Decreasing the mortality (or increasing branching rate), the unpopulated solutions become unstable at a threshold ω d0 /ω b = 1. Below this mortality, any small nonzero density will grow to form a meadow. If mortality is much smaller than the branching rate, ω d0 /ω b < < 1, the vegetation will uniformly cover all the available space. Thus, there are two extreme homogeneous stable states: a uniform, continuous meadow (ω d0 /ω b < < 1) and bare seafloor, with no vegetation (ω d0 /ω b > > 1), as it is shown in Fig. 2 (red solid lines). The parameter values that better reproduce the observed patterns of P. oceanica meadows correspond to a kernel that, although competition extends farther, is overall facilitative. As a result, the transition (T) from bare soil to the populated solution is subcritical, so that there is a mortality range in which both populated and unpopulated solutions coexist (Fig. 2). Competition between shoots can destabilize the populated solution, leading to patterns, whereas the homogeneous states are the only possible solutions in the absence of nonlocal interactions. Therefore, the presence of fairy circle landscapes in seagrass meadows is indirect evidence of nonlocal negative interactions.

Mean shoot density(that is, total number of shoots divided by the whole simulation area) as a function of normalized mortality ω/ωfor five different solutions of the ABD model for homogeneous ωand homogeneous b. Homogeneous populated and unpopulated states are shown in red, hexagonal arrangement of fairy circles in yellow, stripes in green, and hexagonal arrangement of spots in blue. Solid (dashed) lines indicate stable (unstable) solutions. The insets show the vegetation patterns in the inhomogeneous cases. Only the stable part of the pattern branches is shown, as obtained from direct numerical simulations of the model. MI corresponds to the modulational instability of the populated state, and T corresponds to the transcritical bifurcation of the bare soil. We take parameter values in a range that reproduce patterns seen in side scans using typical values for P. oceanica for the parameters already known [see the study by Sintes et al. (33) and references therein]: ω b = 0.06 year−1, ν = 6.11 cm year−1, ρ = 2.87 cm, φ b = 45°, b = 1.25 cm4 year−1, κ = 0.048 year−1, σ κ = 2851.4 cm, a = 27.38 cm2, σ μ = 203.7 cm, μ = ω d0 (see the Supplementary Materials). The formation of the three patterned solutions (negative hexagons, stripes, and positive hexagons) is shown in movies S1, S2, and S3, respectively.

A linear stability analysis of the homogeneous populated solution reveals that it undergoes a finite wavelength instability, also known as Turing (4) or modulation instability (MI), at a critical value of mortality rate (in Fig. 2, ), leading to the emergence of complex spatial patterns. Above this mortality, any small perturbation to the homogeneous meadow is enough to trigger a feedback process driving the vegetation to form an inhomogeneous pattern. Different spatial structures are possible. As mortality rate increases, possible patterns shift from negative hexagons (holes arranged in a hexagonal pattern), to stripes, and to positive hexagons (spots of vegetation arranged in a hexagonal pattern), as expected from the general theory of pattern formation (44, 45). Each solution is stable in a different region of parameter space, and two different solutions can be simultaneously stable for the same value of the mortality, a coexistence between solutions that would give rise to hysteresis. In particular, negative hexagons coexist with the homogeneous populated solution in a mortality range below . In part of this region, a single bare hole embedded in a dense meadow (Fig. 3), known as dissipative soliton (46), which is the submarine analog of a terrestrial fairy circle, can be stable (47, 48). Many of the bare circles visible in the coasts of Mallorca and the Adriatic Sea (Fig. 1) can be identified with dissipative solitons.

Fig. 3 Spatial distribution of the shoot density (high densities are represented in dark green and low ones in bright yellow) in a simulation of a P. oceanica meadow showing a stable fairy circle. The fairy circle, or dissipative soliton, is clear in the density profile (B) along the transverse cut shown in (A) by a dashed line. Here, ω d0 = 0.057 year−1. Other parameters are the same as in Fig. 2.

Thus, our model is able to reproduce and to facilitate understanding of the nonlinear behavior, leading to the emergence of dynamic complex landscape patterns in seagrass meadows. The spatial scale of real patterns is mainly related to the range of the competing interaction σ κ . An estimation of the length scale of the observed patterns can be obtained using the Fourier spectrum (see the Supplementary Materials) of images such as Fig. 1A. It is not always possible to obtain a precise estimate of this length scale, because often, patterns are not regular enough, although local hexagonal ordering can be appreciated in the more regular regions. In these regions, one can identify in the Fourier spectrum a typical periodicity of 62.9 ± 12.7 m (see the Supplementary Materials). Choosing σ κ = 28.5 m, the critical wavelength at the MI threshold (see the Supplementary Materials) fits this observed characteristic length, and simultaneously, a typical hole size of about 30 m is also correctly reproduced. This result allows us to conjecture the existence of a competitive interaction with a range of around 20 to 30 m, whose specific nature is not yet known. In addition to their local contribution, the competition for natural resources (for example, dissolved inorganic nutrients or CO 2 ) and the interactions mediated by toxic compounds, such as sulfide, which is accumulated in the soil (20), are expected to contribute to nonlocal competitive interactions. Other hypotheses include interaction through hydrodynamics, which may modify the sedimentary delivery of nutrients.

The time scales for the landscape dynamics captured by the model are long, encompassing decades to millennia (movies S1 to S5 and the Supplementary Materials), depending on the characteristic demographic time scales of the species. For instance, P. oceanica clones are long-lived organisms, with clones living tens of thousands of years (49) and forming meadows over centuries to millennia (50, 51), whereas C. nodosa grows much faster and can form meadows over decades to centuries (50). Hence, the dynamics conducive to formation of complex landscape patterns and the transition between them are too slow to be observed empirically and can be grasped only through a modeling approach, such as the one developed here (movies S1 to S6), with parameter values properly constrained by present-day observations.

In addition to providing qualitative understanding of how demographic imbalances affect the spatial configuration of seagrass meadows, the model proposed provides a remarkable, given its parsimony, description of observed patterns in seagrass meadows (Fig. 4). Two additional model components are needed to reproduce observed density patterns: a decline in mortality rate, ω d0 , with the distance from the coast, x, and a spatial random noise term that mimics irregular spatial variability of the parameters. Simulations in small systems and under ideal conditions (that is, in the absence of noise) may yield perfectly periodic patterns (insets in Fig. 2), whereas simulations in large domains, including noise, better resemble observed patterns (Figs. 4 and 5, movies S4 to S6, and the Supplementary Materials).

The set of model parameters for C. nodosa is ω b = 2.3 year−1, ν = 160 cm year−1, ρ = 3.7 cm, φ b = 45°, b = 112.71 cm4 year−1, κ = 2.76 year−1, σ κ = 2226.1 cm, a = 21.0 cm2, σ μ = 139.1 cm, and μ = ω d0 , and the area modeled (a subset of that shown in Fig. 1A) is bounded by the coordinates 39°53′16.4″N, 3°05′12.7″E; 39°51′52.0″N, 3°06′15.7″E; 39°51′43.1″N, 3°05′55.6″E; and 39°53′07.5″N, 3°04′52.6″E (movie S6). (A) Final spatial density distribution of shoots from a numerical simulation of the ABD model using the mortality profile shown in (B). (C) Observed coverage (31) of C. Nodosa from LIFE Posidonia side-scan cartography in the Balearic coast.

The increase in area coverage from the shore toward moderate depths is characteristic of P. oceanica meadows (Fig. 4C) [as is also the its decrease and disappearance toward deep waters; (36)]. This indicates high mortality rates in shallow, nearshore waters, which could be attributed to scouring by waves, leading to the unpopulated model solution in waters shallower than the upslope limit of the seagrass, and low mortality rates in moderately deeper waters, allowing the formation of stable homogeneous meadows. A smooth decline in mortality with depth should then lead to complex spatial patterns at intermediate depths, where the homogeneous solution is unstable (see Fig. 2). Including such decline in mortality (Fig. 4B) with added noise (see the Supplementary Materials), the resulting patterns (Fig. 4A) accurately reproduce observed features in P. oceanica meadows (Fig. 4C), such as more elongated vegetation gaps near the shore and scattered gaps close to the homogeneous meadow. The transition from bare soil to patterns with elongated gaps signals that this region experiences a steep mortality decrease from very high to moderate values where hexagons begin to be unstable with respect to stripes. Scattered gaps are well reproduced close to the homogeneous meadow, in a mortality range where hexagonal gap patterns coexist with the homogeneous populated state (see Fig. 2) and dissipative solitons (fairy circles) can form. Further downslope, the homogeneous meadow prevails.

The model also reproduces the decline of shoot density and its variability with depth observed in meadows along the littoral of the Balearic Islands (Fig. 4H). Shoot density was measured by scuba divers at random positions in the meadows without previous knowledge of their spatial distribution. The results consistently showed low shoot density variability at depths >10 m compared to high variability at shallower depths (<10 m), ranging from close to 0 to 2000 shoots/m2, a variability much larger than that in deeper regions (thick blue dots Fig. 4H). Our model suggests that high shoot density variability in shallow waters is a consequence of the presence of complex spatial patterns near the coast. Simulations using noisy and depth-dependent mortality and carrying capacity, b(x, y) (see Fig. 4G), account for the decrease in shoot density with depth and generate patterns of shoot density that capture the dispersion of the density close to the coast where patterns form (Fig. 4, E to H, and movie S5). The model also reproduces complex patterns in meadows of C. nodosa, such as the transition from holes to patches observed in one of the meadows (Figs. 1 and 5C). Because this transition occurs parallel to the coast, that is, at a uniform depth, we inferred this pattern to be derived from a sudden increase in the mortality rate along the shore (see Fig. 5B). The resulting simulated pattern (Fig. 5A) reproduces very well the observed features of the real meadow, further confirming that the complex seascape of fairy circle patterns observed in Mediterranean seagrass meadows can be reproduced parsimoniously as a consequence of variability in the seagrass demographic balance caused by spatial interaction and nonlinearity.","Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1603262/F1.large.jpg,"['fig', 'seagrass', 'fairy', 'model', 'sea', 'landscapes', 'spatial', 'b', 'mortality', 'density', 'patterns', 'circle', 'meadows', 'ω']", ,none
55,55,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"From tarsiers to cloud rats, scientist strives to save Philippine species - Mongabay.com",https://news.mongabay.com/2017/08/from-tarsiers-to-cloud-rats-scientist-strives-to-save-philippine-species/,"In this interview, Milada Rehakova shares how she and her husband rediscovered the bushy-tailed cloud rat, previously thought extinct, on Dinagat Island in 2012.

Rehakova is currently working with local allies to establish the first protected areas on Dinagat Island to protect the cloud rat and tarsiers among other species.

Rehokova is also working to save the tarsiers of Bohol from an exploitative tourist trade.

In 2012, Dr. Milada Rehakova’s research brought her back to Dinagat Island, Philippines. It was her second expedition to the island in pursuit of insights on the tarsier, but she had another rare animal in her mind too: the bushy-tailed cloud rat (Crateromys australis). The species had been presumed extinct – it hadn’t been seen in decades – but Rehakova thought it might still be around. She laughs as she tells the story of how her husband, skeptical that she’d find an extinct species, was actually the first to spot the bushy-tailed cloud rat’s brown body with its unmistakable black and white tail.

Before Rehakova’s rediscovery, the rodent had only revealed itself to science once before, in 1975. In the meantime, mining efforts have chipped away at the bushy-tailed cloud rat’s forest habitat.

“It’s a shame that there are no protected areas on Dinagat Island on the national level,” Rehakova said. “Mining companies have divided all the land and it’s just a question of time when they will start.”

The 2012 encounter captured photo and video evidence of the critically-endangered animal’s existence, giving conservationists a new reason to push for more forest protections. The effort brings together Philippine and Czech teams, including a team member from the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and Rehakova is hopeful that key areas will remain intact both for forest-dependent species and Dinagat Island locals.

“This is also important for the people, and we want to teach them, to let them know that they, they, need the forest – not just the animals, not just the cloud rat and other species that they never meet in their life and never care for – but the people are the ones who need the forest,” Rehakova said.

While the Czech-Philippine organizations map and plan protected sites on Dinagat, Rehakova’s other conservation endeavor, The Tarsius Project, educates visitors and locals in Bohol. Just a few years ago, laws allowed locals to catch wild tarsiers for tourist displays as long as owners only had two animals at a time. But tarsiers are sensitive, and Rehakova noticed that owners’ inadequate care resulted in tarsiers’ quick deaths forcing them to continue capturing from wild populations en masse. Rehakova brought the problem to the attention of the authorities, and today, authorities no longer allow such ownership.

Instead, The Tarsius Project collaborates with Habitat Bohol and other organizations to operate a visitors’ center, which includes a spacious and appropriate home for a few tarsiers, including a breeding space that saw the rare birth of a healthy captive-bred tarsier in May 2017.

The advancements on Dinagat and Bohol Islands are occuring through a whirlwind year politically for environmentalists working in the Philippines. The extensive archipelago is home to thousands of endemic species, but mining has long threatened many biodiversity hotspots in the region and the unique animals living within them. For a few months, a new DENR Secretary, Regina Lopez, inspired hope and halted mining throughout the nation in efforts to preserve the Philippines’ astounding ecological riches, including on Dinagat. But government officials voted Lopez out of office this past May, and the fate of the island remains unclear. Still, Rehakova remains optimistic that current plans for establishing protected areas will move forward in DENR offices.

Researchers are still making significant discoveries on tarsiers like last year’s finding of multiple tarsier subspecies in the Philippines. Rehakova’s own field work includes building libraries of tarsier vocalizations and seeing how they compare across different islands, which may help researchers establish the existence of even more species. And though she’s been studying the animal for almost a decade, this nocturnal animal remains so elusive and their behaviors can range so wildly, that our current knowledge of the animal is only beginning, from defining tarsier social systems, to descriptions of their play behaviors, to fighting to keep Dinagat Island’s remaining forests intact.

AN INTERVIEW WITH MILADA REHAKOVA



Jacqueline Hernandez for Mongabay: What’s your background, and how did you come to work in the Philippines?

Milada Rehakova: I have always been fascinated about animals and nature and wildlife since my childhood, so I went to study zoology. I finished my PhD in Charles University in Prague and for my diploma and dissertation I studied monkeys in India. It was my first time [doing field studies], and I really started to love it. I studied play behavior, which is still among my interests… it’s amazing. Then [in 2007] I went to the Philippines with my friend and colleague, a zoologist from university… I visited Bohol Island and I simply fell in love with tarsiers and started to plan research and conservation projects on Bohol on Philippine Tarsiers. That’s how it started. I worked in the Philippines and I went back there for field research in 2009.

Mongabay: How did that take you to Dinagat Island specifically?

Milada Rehakova: On the first visit, we traveled around several island including Bohol. And then I started to work on tarsiers; Bohol is most famous for them. But, it was already known at the time that there is a population of tarsiers on Dinagat Island that would possibly be distinct, as it was confirmed later on by an American zoologist and his colleagues. So I went to Dinagat to see the Dinagat tarsiers and search for them, and then I got to know there are cloud rats that are possibly living [there], but had not been found for several years. It just caught my interest and I started to search for the cloud rats.

I went back the first time in 2009, when I succeeded on seeing the tarsiers but not the cloud rats. I was searching for the cloud rat in 2012 when I went there for a second time with my husband. We were in close touch with William Oliver who was the leading person of the cloud rat conservation program in the Philippines, and he told us there were several expeditions looking for this animal, but unsuccessfully. So we were mainly searching among locals, asking if they saw the species, if they knew it or not. That’s the usual way you can [find] the animals, to ask people who go to the forest, who live there, and who might get [you] in touch with these animals. We hadn’t gotten much information from them, but we got lucky ourselves while sitting in the forest, searching for the tarsiers and wildlife.

It was my husband who first rediscovered the cloud rat and it was quite easy to say that it really was a Dinagat cloud rat because it has a very distinct tail, black and white, so it cannot be confused with any other species.But it took us another [ten] days to get the picture and video footage to really scientifically prove that we had found this missing animal.

Mongabay: That sounds exciting!

Milada Rehakova: Yeah because it was my husband and he texted me, “I found it! It has a black and white tail.” I said, “Did you get a picture?” But he didn’t have a camera. [The camera] was with me and we were on opposite sides [of the forest]. Then it happened again a third time, and after 10 days we finally got it. It was really exciting.

Mongabay: What’s known about the cloud rat’s life history and evolution?

Milada Rehakova: They are rodents, and the [genus, Crateromys] are endemic to the Philippines. This [genus] are not found anywhere else in the world. So they live in the Philippines on several islands. There are like 13 species, 5 genera described, and just last year there were five other species described on Luzon Island, which is north of the Philippines. It’s the biggest island and has great biodiversity.

Most of the species of cloud rat live in the mountain forest there, high in the trees. That’s why they’re called cloud rats…they are always touching the clouds. So, they are hardly visible to people, except the Luzon people. The people of Luzon used to hunt them. They developed hunting techniques like smoking out tree holes and training dogs to hunt them for food or as pets.

But on other islands it’s not a tradition, so people just don’t know about this animal. They hardly meet them in the forest, which was the case of the Dinagat cloud rat. It was first seen and described in 1975 on a zoology expedition, and since that time no single animal, no single specimen had been seen scientifically. Scientists were starting to think it was extinct, but [then] we rediscovered it after 37 years.

Mongabay: Was its habitat already endangered when it was first seen in 1975?

Milada Rehakova: Yes, it was. It’s a shame that there are no protected areas on Dinagat Island on the national level. All the forests that are left there are covered by mining claims. Mining companies have divided all the land and it’s just a question of time when they will start mining. This starts with clearing all of the forest, taking out the soil and taking out the minerals. We have visited several places there where the forest still exists, usually watershed areas that are protected by the local people or the local ordinances or laws…but not on the national level.

So it was a question about what to do with the cloud rat rediscovery. It’s quite risky to publish such results because it can lead to very quick extinctions when people know, “Oh, there’s a Critically Endangered species,” and immediately want to go and collect the species. We were aware of these risks so we didn’t publish the exact locations.

I’m very, very pleased and very lucky that I’ve been contacted by a Philippine organization last year with a proposal that they want to map and establish protected areas on Dinagat Island. They invited me to join their team and help with that. That’s how I came to Dinagat Island for a third time last year.



Mongabay: I’ve read a bit on how authorities have helped with conservation efforts in the Philippines. I’m curious to know a bit more about how they’ve helped specifically with the bushy-tailed cloud rat?

Milada Rehakova: It was a local NGO [Green Mindanao] that contacted me, but they were working closely with DENR, which stands for Department of Environment and Natural Resources, a government organization. It’s good that we can work together because it’s the DENR who should really push through all the laws and change legislation. We have one team member who has joined us from the DENR. He joined us for a couple of days to get training and get to know what we are doing in the field. And now he can push our plans forward in his office. We are still in touch, so it seems they are really proceeding towards this goal and that the protected areas will be established on Dinagat Island. I’m very happy about that because, as I said, they were all covered by mining claims. They want to exclude some land as protected areas. Their hope and goal is to have the whole island mining-free. It would be great. Dinagat Island is really unique. You know, the Philippines are among the top biodiversity hotspots in the world, and Dinagat is special among the Philippine islands. It has a high rate of endemism, of species that are not found anywhere else.

Mongabay: Will you speak a bit about any of the existing effects of mining on Dinagat? What does the landscape look like now, especially the cloud rat habitat?

Milada Rehakova: It’s kind of sad to see what’s going on there, when you go out to the island and you expect to see pristine nature and beautiful forest and animals… and you instead see the worn land and destroyed habitat. A huge amount of the land is already taken out. They take out the trees, then the soil, even the rocks, so it’s a disaster in some places. We have visited the mining areas and there’s just nothing left.

The only chance is to have really protected areas. It can’t go together; if the mining company is there they just destroy everything because they need to take the soil and the minerals, so the forest is gone. And the cloud rats need the forest. The only chance for them is to stop mining in several goal areas there, and protect the forest. This is also important for the people, and we want to teach them, to let them know that they, they, need the forest – not just the animals, not just the cloud rat and other species that they never meet in their life and never care for – but the people are the ones who need the forest. They need to protect the watersheds or there will be no water.

It’s happened on several islands where they cleared all the forest and then there was no water, so then people started wondering, “Oh maybe we shouldn’t do that,” and they started planting again… but the animals are just gone, you know? Once you wipe out the species they cannot come back. That’s something that people should know; that it’s for them, as well as for all of nature.

Mongabay: How did the Czech-Philippine partnership come about?

Milada Rehakova: It started with my first visit of Dinagat in 2009. I met some great people there and visited some places and definitely wanted to come back…I wanted to search for the tarsiers and thought, “Okay, cloud rats are interesting; they’re almost extinct so why not try to find them?” I took my husband with me, and he’s a computer programmer. He didn’t believe me at first: “Oh, right, my wife is going to find an extinct species.” So we go, and then it was him who found it… (laughs), it’s a good story. So that’s how the Czech and Philippine partnership started. I found some great people who wanted to help me with conservation, who were already aware of the necessity of protection. We kept in touch and then I was contacted by the Green Mindanao organization who wanted to do the land protection,­ mapping, and establishing the protected areas, so we joined the expedition again together with my husband and with my colleague Lubomir Peske who works with me on Bohol, and was with me on Dinagat before. So that’s our team who goes to the Philippines through the years.

Mongabay: Since the DENR secretary is no longer the same person, are protections indeed still moving forward on Dinagat?

Milada Rehakova: I don’t have the very latest information. Gina Lopez was very anti-mining and she is very passionate about wildlife protection. She was really going strictly towards this goal, but apparently it was too strict for this country so she was removed. It happened when I was in the Philippines last time. I just came back in May, so I don’t know what exactly is going on now. I hope at least some of the protected areas will be established.

Mongabay: Is there any kind of resistance that environmental groups get from mining companies?

Milada Rehakova: I didn’t get in touch with mining companies that regularly. I just visited these areas in 2012, five years ago, but I’m not in touch with them directly.

Mongabay: How do the locals in Dinagat respond to the possibility of protections on the island? Do they want mining to be there for the income?

Milada Rehakova: That’s a good question. I’m very happy [that] I get news from my colleagues that the locals are really willing to participate in habitat protection. Mining brings money. That’s why it occurs there. It brings money, it employs people, it brings money for the municipalities, and this is how it occur[s]. But the people [have] started to realize that it’s not the best thing and it’s not everything just to have money. And also the money doesn’t go to all the people. It goes to just some of the politicians, basically. So there are more and more people who are aware about the need and necessity of protection of the habitat, as I said, of the watersheds, to have water for the community, to have the forest to go there and collect the firewood. Because if there is mining then they will take out all the forest and there will be no wood for the people. So they want to protect the forest, for it to be there for themselves, which is a good sign.

Mongabay: Tarsiers are obviously charismatic animals, but I was curious what is it about them that you find most interesting?

Milada Rehakova: When I first planned to start with the research, there was not much known about their social behavior [or their] social system. There are several species of tarsiers; one lives in the Philippines, the others live in Borneo, Sulawesi, and neighboring islands. Every species has a different social system. Some live in family groups, some are solitary, some have monogamous mating systems or [are] polygamous. This [social system] was unknown in the Philippine Tarsiers so that’s what we started to study. We used radiotelemetry because it’s very hard to follow the Philippine Tarsiers. The Sulawesi species is much easier. But it’s hard or even impossible to follow the Philippine Tarsiers without the radio-collaring. So we put small radio-collars around their necks and followed them with an antenna for several months and studied their home range size, habitat use, social system, even breeding and infant and mother behavior. As I told you, I’m interested in play behavior so I have recorded the play behavior for the first time in tarsiers.

Mongabay: Can you tell me a bit about what play behaviors you observed?

Milada Rehakova: There are several types of play behavior. Locomotor play, social play, object play, so I’ve observed all of these like three times in the tarsiers. It’s very cute because the animal is just a couple of centimeters tall. It’s jumping up and down on the trees, playing with the leaves, and playing with the mother. They jump on the mother, they started play-fighting together with their hands and mouths. It was very quick. Then it ended, and then they were jumping again through the forest.

Mongabay: How did the tarsiers end up on different islands?

Milada Rehakova: There are now three genera of tarsiers described. One is in the Philippines, one is in Borneo, and one is in Sulawesi. These three lineages are really the most distinct. There are several species in Sulawesi within that genus. This is how the evolution went. One lineage to Borneo, one went to Sulawesi, and one in Sulawesi. And then there is greater biodiversity within Sulawesi, with several species described. There was also a recent study in the Philippines again where they discovered four lineages that [may] be distinct subspecies, or species. It depends [on] how you look at species and subspecies because they live on different islands so they can’t breed together anyway; but there are four lineages in the Philippines, which was discovered in the last year. The animals look very similar so you cannot say the color is distinct or something; they all look very similar. The most helpful tool is genetics… In Sulawesi they just used acoustic communication. Different species talk differently; they have different languages. They live in the same area, they live next to each other, but they talk differently so you can say, “Okay they don’t breed; they are different species.” These are the two most important tools in distinguishing species in such small nocturnal mammals.

Mongabay: On the website it said that vocalizations were one of the first markers of the cloud rat’s existence. Is that right?

Milada Rehakova: The cloud rat is not that vocal like tarsiers are. For tarsiers, we sit in the forest and listen for the vocalizations. And that’s how we found the cloud rat. The cloud rat was vocalizing but very [quietly], but mostly you could hear it walking through the trees. It was quite noisy, shaking the branches and making quite a bit of noise for such a nocturnal animal. In terms of studying vocalizations, we studied tarsiers in Bohol so we can describe some acoustic signals, and this can be used later for comparisons on other islands.

Mongabay: How did local authorities in Bohol help protect tarsiers on the main tourist road?

Milada Rehakova: The tourist business mainly affects the tarsiers in Bohol. Luckily, it’s not on the other islands. On Bohol it’s a severe problem because tourists want to see the tarsiers. A huge number of tourists come every day. New places were [opening] up to show [captive] tarsiers to people, and it was just a disaster. The tarsiers are very sensitive. They cannot survive in captivity very well; they need to have specific conditions. The tarsiers just died and owners just kept removing new tarsiers from the wild, of course, legally. They had a permit to own two tarsiers, so when two tarsiers died, they just went and caught more.

I thought I should do something about that. If we want to protect the species, this is maybe the biggest threat because it was really a large number of tarsiers disappearing from the forest due to this. We approached the local authorities together with the great help of our ambassador. It was good that they listened to us and really forced these places to close down and to transfer these animals to another place built specifically for them. It’s much bigger and much fewer animals inside. There are still some animals involved in this tourist business but it’s not as large a number as it was before.

Mongabay: Has conservation education also helped stop the flow of tarsiers coming out of the forest?

Milada Rehakova: That’s something that we are really focusing on. We have our local manager there and he’s very into education. He and his colleagues developed several interactive educational programs and visited elementary schools, high schools, universities, even did some trainings for teachers. More than 700 kids and teachers participated in this program. I hope that this will have some impact on their lives. We focus on the young generation to bring this knowledge to their parents as well and hopefully to change the future. We work in the areas where tarsiers are quite common, so kids know that it’s not something that lives somewhere else, but it’s something that lives behind their houses in the forest. We’ve been doing this educational work since 2009, when we got in touch with local schools and we’ve continued and developed more and more programs. We also educate visitors together with our partner organizations; we have developed a visitor center there and eco-touristic programs that can educate tourists who go for the program, and also the locals who guide them. They learn that it’s better to have protected forests because it attracts people.

Mongabay: You’ve had some recent success with breeding tarsiers in the center. Can you talk a bit about that?

Milada Rehakova: With our partner organizations, we have developed a visitors’ park with a guided tour, garden, and eco-tour programs for the night safari in the forest with the visitor’s hall where people [are] educated about tarsiers. Then, there’s a separate place for research and conservation purposes. We have built thick enclosures planted with trees to be as natural as we can provide for the animals. We now have one pair of tarsiers, one male and one female. The first year we caught them, there was already successful mating. Unfortunately, the baby died, probably during birth. Two days after we found that dead body on the floor, so we couldn’t do anything about it. Since tarsier breeding is seasonal, we had to wait for another year: a half year for mating, and another half-year during pregnancy. The female gave birth about the same time, in the beginning of May, and the baby is still alive. It’s now two months old, so we’ve passed the most critical period. Now we are really keeping our fingers crossed that it’ll survive. This would be a huge success because there have been some captive-bred tarsiers who didn’t survive until adulthood and didn’t breed again. So we want to have this baby grow up and then hopefully breed again, which would be a great success. This would be the first time in the Philippines, in the local country and area of origin. That’s why we started breeding the tarsiers there; to have their local climate, food, and to eliminate stress from transfer.

Mongabay: At what age do they reach maturity?

Milada Rehakova: It’s not exactly known but it seems that at about two years they’re able to breed. They stay with the mother for quite a long time, almost until the next baby is born, so almost a year.

Mongabay: Anything else you’d like to add?

Milada Rehakova: Anyone can get directly involved in our program by adopting tarsiers. It’s symbolic, of course, but we welcome regular supporters to become members of our program this way. We also sell some tarsier products!

56,56,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Impaired DNA replication derepresses chromatin and generates a transgenerationally inherited epigenetic memory - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701143.full,"Impaired DNA replication is a hallmark of cancer and a cause of genomic instability. We report that, in addition to causing genetic change, impaired DNA replication during embryonic development can have major epigenetic consequences for a genome. In a genome-wide screen, we identified impaired DNA replication as a cause of increased expression from a repressed transgene in Caenorhabditis elegans. The acquired expression state behaved as an “epiallele,” being inherited for multiple generations before fully resetting. Derepression was not restricted to the transgene but was caused by a global reduction in heterochromatin-associated histone modifications due to the impaired retention of modified histones on DNA during replication in the early embryo. Impaired DNA replication during development can therefore globally derepress chromatin, creating new intergenerationally inherited epigenetic expression states.

Multicopy transgene arrays are subject to epigenetic repression in the Caenorhabditis elegans germ line by the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) ( 1 ) and additional chromatin- and small RNA–related pathways ( 2 – 4 ). In C. elegans, modified histones and small RNAs are transmitted across generations ( 5 , 6 ), acting as carriers of epigenetic information ( 7 – 10 ). In addition to germline silencing, multicopy transgene arrays also show variation in their somatic expression level, which, at least in some cases, can be epigenetically inherited between generations ( 11 , 12 ).

RESULTS

To identify regulators of the heritable somatic repression of a daf-21::mCherry multicopy transgene array, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen (Fig. 1A). First-stage larval animals were fed in 96-well plates with bacteria expressing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting ~17,000 protein-coding genes, and expression from the array was scored in the adult worms of the same generation and in their larval progeny. Multiple RNAi clones that increased expression from the transgene targeted core components of the DNA replication machinery: DNA polymerase epsilon (pole-1 or pole-2), the polymerase α-primase complex (div-1, pri-2, or Y47D3A.29/POLA1), replication factor C (rfc-1 or rfc-3), and replication protein A (rpa-2) (Fig. 1B, fig. S1, and table S1).

Fig. 1 Impaired DNA replication during embryonic development derepresses a transgene array. (A) Genome-wide RNAi screen to identify repressors of expression from a multicopy transgene array. (B) Expression of the daf-21p::mCherry transgene in F1 progeny when the indicated genes are inhibited by RNAi. (C) Male worms carrying a daf-21p::GFP multicopy transgene were crossed to wt or div-1(or148) mutant hermaphrodites. (D to F) Expression was quantified in F1 embryos by time-lapse microscopy. Quantification in (F) is at t = 300, indicated by the dashed line in (E) [6.2-fold difference, P = 1.4 × 10−46, two-sided t test; n = 33 and 42 for progeny of wt and div-1 hermaphrodites, respectively]. Crossing male div-1 animals to hermaphrodites carrying the daf-21p::mCherry did not result in an elevated transgene expression in the progeny (fig. S3), demonstrating that div-1(or148) heterozygosity in the progeny does not affect transgene expression during embyrogenesis. Effects on additional transgenes are summarized in table S4.

The core replication machinery is mostly encoded by essential genes, but we could confirm the RNAi phenotypes using a hypomorphic allele, or148, of the gene encoding the B subunit of DNA polymerase α-primase, div-1 (fig. S2) (13). This allele is a point mutation that causes delayed embryonic division due to prolonged S phase at 20°C and lethality at 25°C (13).

In C. elegans, the early stages of embryonic development are under maternal control (14). To test whether impaired DNA replication during embryonic development is sufficient to derepress the array, we crossed male animals carrying a daf-21p::GFP multicopy array to hermaphrodites carrying the div-1 mutation (Fig. 1C). In this way, the array is delivered from a wild-type (wt) father into an egg produced by mutant div-1 mothers, that is, containing mutant maternal div-1 mRNA and DIV-1 protein. Expression in the resulting progeny was strongly up-regulated from the onset of zygotic transcription (Fig. 1, D to F). In contrast, crossing mutant div-1 fathers to wt hermaphrodites carrying the array did not result in array derepression (fig. S3). Thus, impaired DNA replication during very early embryonic development results in increased expression from the start of zygotic transcription.

As in mammals, repressed chromatin in C. elegans is associated with specific histone modifications: trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and di- and trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2/3) (15). In C. elegans, addition of H3K27me3 is catalyzed by the PRC2 (MES-2/3/6) complex (16). Inactivation of mes-2 (Fig. 2, A and B) strongly increased expression from the transgene array. Similarly, inactivation of MET-2, a putative histone methyltransferase required for mono- and dimethylation of H3K9 (3, 17), also strongly increased expression from the array (Fig. 2, A and B), as did inactivation of the putative H3K9me3 methyltransferase SET-25 (Fig. 2, A and B) (3). The very strong reduction in H3K9 methylation in a met-2;set-25 double mutant (3, 18) increased expression more than either single mutant (Fig. 2, A and B), and expression was highest in animals lacking H3K27me3 and H3K9me1/2/3 (mes-2;met-2;set-25 triple mutants; Fig. 2, A and B), consistent with multiple repressive pathways being partially redundantly involved in repression of the array.

(D) Representative images of mCherry fluorescence. Bottom: The contrast is adjusted for each genotype so that the change in expression relative to the control RNAi can be visualized. Ctrl, control.

We tested the effects of impaired DNA replication in embryos lacking these histone modifications alone and in combination. Impaired replication still resulted in a strong increase in expression in animals lacking H3K27me3 (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that the effects of impaired replication are not simply due to altered inclusion of this modification. Similarly, the array was still strongly up-regulated when replication was impaired in animals lacking all H3K9 methylation (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, the impact of impaired DNA replication cannot be due to alterations in just one of these repressive chromatin pathways. In contrast, the impact of impaired replication was strongly reduced in animals lacking both H3K27me3 and H3K9me1/2/3 (Fig. 2, C and D). This is not due to RNAi insensitivity or any saturation effect because inhibition of the chaperone HSP-1, which triggers a stress response and drives expression through the daf-21 promoter, still strongly increased expression from the array (Fig. 2, C and D). Increased expression from the array after pole-2(RNAi) treatment was also partially suppressed in mes-2;met-2;set-25 triple-mutant animals (fig. S4). This is consistent with impaired replication altering expression from the array by interfering with repression by multiple histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H3K9me1/2/3). In the absence of these modifications, impaired replication has a reduced effect on expression.

To characterize how the chromatin marks of the array are altered when replication is impaired, we first used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to compare the levels of H3K27me3 in wt animals and in div-1 mutants. H3K27me3 was reduced on the array in animals with impaired replication (~3- and ~4-fold in the gene body and the promoter, respectively) (P < 0.01) (fig. S5). Impaired replication therefore interferes with the maintenance of H3K27me3 on the array. However, H3K27me3 levels changed similarly on four additional regions of the genome (fig. S5), indicating that the alterations to chromatin are not restricted to the high-copy array.

To investigate this further, we quantified the global levels of H3K27me3 in wt and div-1 chromatin from embryonic nuclei using immunofluorescence. Consistent with the ChIP results, H3K27me3 levels were globally reduced in the nuclei of early div-1 mutant embryos (Fig. 3A; 1.35-fold, P = 0.022). We used the same technique to quantify the levels of H3K9me3 and found that they were also globally depleted in the chromatin of div-1 embryos (Fig. 3B; 1.4-fold, P = 0.025). In contrast, the levels of a transcription activation–associated histone modification, H3K4me3, were increased in the div-1 embryos (Fig. 3C; 1.4-fold, P = 0.0055). All the embryos quantified were from the 2- to 10-cell stage, which is before the onset of major zygotic transcription, indicating that the changes in chromatin are not a secondary consequence of any changes in transcription. We also observed similar changes in late-stage div-1(RNAi) embryos (fig. S6), indicating that the changes in chromatin are maintained after the onset of transcription and during development. Depleting pole-2 confirmed the results obtained with div-1(RNAi) (fig. S7). The globally reduced levels of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were also confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3D and fig. S8). Impaired DNA replication therefore globally alters the histone modification levels in chromatin, including those before the onset of widespread zygotic transcription (19).

(A to C) Representative images and quantification of histone modification levels in wt and div-1 embryos derived from self-fertilizing hermaphrodites.

Quantification is shown on the right (means + SD; two-sided t test). Antibodies used here were validated by us and others (5, 12).

To test whether loci other than the transgene array also have altered expression when replication is impaired, we sequenced RNA from wt and div-1 L1 stage larvae. Consistent with the response of the transgene array, many more genes had increased compared to decreased expression in the div-1 mutants [493 up-regulated genes versus 9 down-regulated genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) of <0.05].

To relate changes in expression to the normal chromatin state of each gene, we used data from the modENCODE consortium (15). Consistent with the response of the array, this revealed widespread up-regulation of genes with normally repressed chromatin states (Fig. 4). This derepression was observed for genes normally characterized by states defined by either high H3K9me2/3 or high H3K27me3 (Fig. 4). In contrast, genes without repressive chromatin states (15) in wt animals were not up-regulated as a group in div-1 mutants (Fig. 4). Together, these results show that impaired DNA replication during early development has a major impact on chromatin and gene expression, globally reducing the levels of repressive histone modifications and causing widespread up-regulation of heterochromatic genes in the resulting animals.

A recent study demonstrated that paternal histones marked with H3K27me3 are transmitted from C. elegans sperm chromatin to the zygote (5). These paternally inherited histones marked with H3K27me3 are then recycled during replication and deposited on the two daughter DNA strands during each of the early embryonic divisions, even in the absence of a functional PRC2 complex (5). We hypothesized that the loss of heterochromatin-associated histone marks might result from reduced retention of heterochromatic histones on the genome during the embryonic cell divisions. To test this, we quantified the decay of paternally inherited histones marked with H3K27me3 in control and div-1(RNAi) embryos that were PRC2-deficient (Fig. 5). In this assay, there is no PRC2 activity in the early embryos because of the maternal mes-2 genotype, and only the paternal genome contributes H3K27me3-marked histones to the zygote. The dilution of these modified histones during the early embryonic cell divisions therefore quantifies the extent to which they are successfully transmitted to and retained on the DNA daughter strands during each replication cycle. Compared to in control embryos, the decay of H3K27me3-modified histones during the early cell cycles was accelerated in div-1(RNAi) animals (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, impaired DNA replication induces the loss of H3K27me3 by impairing the retention of modified histones on the genome during the replication cycles of the early embryo. However, it is important to note that this assay does not exclude the possibility that impaired replication may also interfere with histone methyltransferase activity.

Bars indicate SD, and the middle dots indicate the means. (D) Summary of the result of the experiment. Impaired DNA replication resulting from div-1 knockdown interferes with efficient transmission of H3K27me3 histones to daughter nuclei.

An important question in epigenetics is the extent to which acquired epigenetic states are transmitted between generations (20). We therefore tested what happens to the expression from the derepressed transgene array after normal DNA replication is restored. If the epigenetic state of the locus is not transmitted between generations, then restoration of normal DNA replication would result in the reestablishment of repression. In contrast, if the derepressed state is transmitted from parent to offspring, then expression would remain high in subsequent generations with normal replication.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we crossed wt males to div-1(or148) hermaphrodites (both carrying the daf-21p::mCherry transgene) and measured mCherry expression in the wt descendants for multiple generations (Fig. 6A). We found that the expression from the array was elevated for five generations after returning to the situation in which both animals and their parents had a wt div-1 genotype (Fig. 6B). Moreover, introducing the div-1(or148) mutation for a single generation before outcrossing was sufficient to induce transgenerationally inherited elevated expression (fig. S9). Thus, impaired DNA replication derepresses the transgene array, and this derepression takes multiple generations to completely reset after normal replication is restored. The return of the transgene expression to the basal level further demonstrates that the effect is epigenetic and not caused by genetic changes.","Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701143/F1.large.jpg,"['fig', 'transgene', 'generates', 'derepresses', 'impaired', 'chromatin', 'inherited', 'memory', 'epigenetic', 'n', 'expression', 'div1', 'h3k27me3', 'transgenerationally', 'array', 'replication', 'dna']", ,none

EFSA’s Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA), said the revisions come due to the availability of new scientific on adult intakes since the publication of the SCF report 24 years.

Riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin that is involved in energy metabolism and the functioning of various enzymes. It is naturally present in many foods of plant or animal origin including milk, milk products, eggs and offal.

The European Commission requested that EFSA review DRVs for riboflavin, after which the agency published a draft opinion that was put out for comments and input in April​​.

Now, EFSA has published its final opinion​​, which redefined daily PRIs as follows:

0.6 mg for children aged 1-3 years;

0.7 mg for children aged 4-6;

1.0 mg for children aged 7-10;

1.4 mg for children aged 11-14;

1.6 mg for adolescents aged 15-17 as well as for adults;

1.9 mg for pregnant women;

2 mg for lactating women.

For children aged 7-11 months, the panel set an adequate intake (AI) of 0.4 mg per day.

The NDA Panel, also suggested further areas of research, including biomarkers of riboflavin intake and status, and their dose-response relationship with riboflavin intake; the requirement for riboflavin in some population groups like infants, children, pregnant or lactating women and the potential influence of age and sex; and the effect of physical activity and energy expenditure.

“The Panel also notes that riboflavin status is modified by physical activity as urinary excretion of riboflavin is (generally) decreased and EGRAC increased when physical activity is increased, suggesting higher utilisation of riboflavin with increased energy expenditure,”​ wrote the NDA Panel.

“However, there is a lack of experimental data showing a clear quantitative relationship between riboflavin status biomarkers (urinary excretion of riboflavin and EGRAC) and energy expenditure (or physical activity).”​","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-a.william-reed.com/var/wrbm_gb_food_pharma/storage/images/7/5/2/8/7188257-1-eng-GB/EFSA-updates-24-year-old-riboflavin-dietary-reference-values.jpg,"['efsa', 'panel', 'old', 'values', 'status', 'children', 'riboflavin', 'updates', '24', 'physical', 'energy', 'activity', 'dietary', 'mg', 'nda', 'reference', 'aged']", ,none

UNHCR, the United Nations’ Refugee Agency, has been stepping up its aid effort for Iraqi families in Mosul, including for thousands who have recently returned to the city after fleeing the fighting.

Our field assessments show that the returning population of Mosul needs assistance of every kind, but the shelter needs are the most pressing, particularly in the western part of the city. Many neighbourhoods in the west have been extensively damaged or totally destroyed during months of fighting.

Our UN partners say that of the 54 residential districts in West Mosul, 15 suffered destruction or heavy damage, another 23 areas are moderately damaged, while further 16 neighbourhoods sustained light damage.

Mines, unexploded ordnance and related devices pose massive risks for the city’s residents, especially children. UNHCR welcomes the ongoing mine clearing efforts by the authorities and the UN Mine Action Service to ensure safe return of the city’s displaced population. But given the magnitude of the problem, clearance work to remove all explosive hazards could take a very long time.

Returning families also face challenges in accessing basic services and utilities – accessing water, electricity or fuel in parts of Mosul can be difficult and very expensive.

So far, according to government figures, some 79,000 people returned to battered West Mosul – that is one out of every ten people who were forced to flee from this part of the city. Also, the government says, more than 90% of families (more than 165,000 people) who had fled East Mosul during the conflict have now returned. There has been considerably less destruction in East Mosul and we witness progress in gradual resumption of day-to-day life there.

However, there are also families who have returned to camps. Managers in the IDP camps east of Mosul estimate that at least 200 families have moved back to the camps after finding living conditions difficult in Mosul. Reasons cited for their return a include lack of shelter; high rental prices; a lack of livelihood opportunities and limited basic services such as electricity and water.

For returns to the city to be safe and sustainable, there must be conducive conditions on the ground. We stress that the return of any displaced population needs to be voluntary, it has to be carefully planned and carried out on the basis of the international humanitarian principles.

Since the end of military operations in west Mosul in July, together with our partner Human Appeal, we have already distributed shelter kits to more than 3,200 families in east and west Mosul, both to returnees and to families who had been unable to move. The aid package includes emergency shelter kits and sealing-off kits which allow families to carry out basic repairs so they are able to live in partially damaged or unfinished buildings. The plan is to distribute kits to up to 36,000 families by the end of this year.

UNHCR has also been providing cash assistance to some of the most vulnerable displaced Iraqi families. So far we have been able to reach a quarter of some 3,000 vulnerable families initially assessed to be in need of cash assistance. Families receive one-off cash assistance of $400 (486,000 IQD), using a system of mobile money transfers. Some of the most vulnerable families will receive the same amount for up to three months, helping them to pay rent and manage basic necessities such as food and utilities.

Large numbers of IDPs and returnees are also missing key civil documents – some 28% of displaced families in camps have reported missing, damaged, invalid or expired paperwork hindering their movements and access to services. UNHCR and partners are providing legal assistance and supporting local authorities as they struggle with capacity and lack of resources, to reissue civil and identity documents to displaced families in the camps, including birth and marriage certificates. We also support the work of mobile courts, residency directorates and notaries to issue civil documents through outreach protection teams in displacement camps.

Given the scale of the destruction in Mosul, particularly in the western sector, humanitarian needs will remain high. UNHCR will continue to support vulnerable families returning to Mosul, while at the same time we also need to maintain shelter and assistance for thousands of families in camps for many months to come.

60,60,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Older victims of Hurricane Harvey may need special attention as Texas recovers - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/older-victims-of-hurricane-harvey-may-need-special-attention-as-texas-recovers-83126,"News and social media reports from coastal Texas have shown many striking images of Hurricane Harvey flood victims, but few were as arresting as a photo of older women in a Dickinson nursing home, sitting in waist-high water in their wheelchairs. Although the women were moved to safety, the picture highlighted how vulnerable older adults can be during and after major disasters.

My work focuses on answering pressing questions about the health of older adults after events such as Hurricane Harvey. While age alone does not make people more vulnerable to disasters, many health issues that are common with aging do, including frailness, memory impairment, limited mobility and chronic illness. Sixty percent of Hurricane Katrina deaths were age 65 and older, and more older adults died after Hurricane Katrina and in the year after than any other age group.

In a study published earlier this year, we showed that older adults are affected by disasters well after storms or other threats have passed. But disaster response planning for communities and health care systems focuses on the immediate surge after the event, which varies with every disaster but typically lasts hours to days.

As flood waters in Texas peak and recede, public officials and health care providers should begin to plan now for older adults’ long-term medical needs. Beyond getting the electricity back on and patching up broken limbs, an adequate disaster response must understand and correct the ways in which disasters disrupt survivors’ normal living patterns in the extended period after the storm.

Learning from past disasters

Understanding the connection between disasters and hospital admissions among older adults, and developing strategies to minimize hospitalizations, are issues of growing importance. Climate change is increasing the number and scale of natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires. There were three times more natural disasters globally between 2000 and 2009 than from 1980 through 1989. And with the U.S. population over age 65 expected to double by 2060, helping older people stay safe through disasters will become increasingly important.

Previous disasters have shown that older adults are particularly vulnerable, especially if they need ongoing health care. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, over 31 nursing homes closed, leaving more than 4,500 residents in need of emergency assistance. After-action reports from Hurricane Matthew in 2016 documented multiple instances of critical communication breakdowns for special medical-needs patients. For example, patients who needed specialized care were placed in shelters with inadequate staffing.

Houston officials did not order a mandatory evacuation last week as Hurricane Harvey approached. In any case, many older adults have physical or financial constraints that can make it hard for them to evacuate. However, when they ride out a storm at home or in a shelter, they do not have ready access to health services. This places them at greater risk of immediate injury and longer-term physical decline.

Health care services along the Texas coast have been severely impacted by Harvey, which will only exacerbate the challenge of caring for the elderly. Over 21 Texas hospitals have either closed or evacuated patients. Multiple nursing homes have also been evacuated. Ben Taub Hospital, which had already upgraded its infrastructure to protect against floodwaters, now is scrambling to provide food to patients.

Long-lasting effects

Experiences like this can have lasting impacts on older people. In a recent study, we examined hospitalizations among older adults after a 2011 tornado outbreak that spawned hundreds of tornadoes throughout Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee, resulting in over 300 deaths and billions of dollars in damage. Using claims data from Medicare and connecting it with geospatial data from the storm area, we compared hospital admissions among older adults in the month after the disaster to admissions during the other 11 months of the year.

Our findings showed that hospital admissions increased over the 30 days after the disaster by 4 percent among older adults who lived in a ZIP code with a tornado touchdown. This translates to hundreds of additional hospital admissions. We then removed the first three days after the disaster from our data analysis, to see whether the increase in admissions might be related to immediate injuries from the storm. But we found that hospitalizations over the rest of the month still remained higher than normal.

Finally, we conducted a similar analysis examining ZIP codes in an area in the same region which was not affected by the storm, in order to rule out the possibility that increased admissions were related to seasonal factors such as extreme temperatures or high pollen counts. Hospital admissions did not increase in the unaffected area, which told us that the higher numbers we found appear to be related to the tornadoes.

Increased hospital admissions after disasters are only part of the story. The aging U.S. population has a rising incidence of chronic diseases requiring consistent health care, such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. If these health needs had been met in the tornado zone after the disaster, these patients might not have had to be hospitalized, and our study would not have shown the increase in hospital admissions that we detected.

Although we did not have data on individual cases that would have shown why each person was hospitalized, it is likely that personal stress, difficulty accessing health care and an ineffective community response to the disaster all were contributing factors. Our team will continue to study the drivers of post-disaster hospitalizations.

Caring for older victims after Harvey

Disruptions in regular care after a disaster can worsen existing chronic conditions, leading to hospitalizations. These immediate disruptions from the disaster can have much longer-lasting impacts on health.

For example, many older adults are dependent on medical equipment requiring electrical power, from refrigeration for insulin to dialysis machines. Patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes or emphysema may run out of the medications or home oxygen supplies they need to manage these conditions.

In coastal Texas, many clinics and community health centers closed as Harvey approached, and road or weather conditions may keep people from getting to care centers after they reopen. The stress of evacuating from home to a shelter can also cause fragile conditions to worsen.

For now, the key priorities are to protect and support older adults and help them return to their normal routines as soon as possible. Past research has shown that some older adults bounce back quickly from disasters, while others struggle to return to baseline. Planning needs to start now for recovery, which will last for years. It also should include preparing for future disasters, so that we can be more prepared and less reactive when the next superstorm looms.

61,61,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,A Dutch butcher shop minus the meat - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/a-dutch-butcher-shop-minus-the-meat/a-39963317,"At first sight, it seems to be a regular butcher's shop. The scales on the counter, the knife, the cutting machine - it's all there. The cooling section presents a mouth-watering bonanza for barbecue-lovers: sausages, hamburgers, meatballs, poultry kebabs. Even tuna and calamari are available. What more do you need for a great cookout?

You can indeed cook out with the culinary delights that Jaap Korteweg offers in his concept store in The Hague. But here's the twist: all the food is plant-based and no animals are harmed in its making.

""Made from soy beans and peas, lupin seeds and cereals,"" the 54-year-old farmer explains as he retrieves a package of 'Little Willies' English breakfast sausages from the refrigerated counter. ""One of our latest and most popular products!"" he adds proudly, pointing out the round logo, which reads ""De Vegetarische Slager"" (the vegetarian butcher).

That's the name of the company Korteweg founded on World Animal Day in 2010. His goal is to offer even confirmed meat-lovers an alternative that is animal-friendly as well as something that vegetarians can enjoy without remorse. His wares are eco-friendly too. They don't stress the environment in the way ""normal"" meat products do.

""We need only half as much agricultural surface, and only a third of the water and fertilizer,"" says Korteweg.

'Meat must become an ancillary item on our plates'

Korteweg was pushed into action by the last outbreak of swine fever that ravaged Europe in the fall of 1997. Nowhere was worse hit by the disease than the Netherlands with its extremely intensive industrial farming sector and the highest density of pigs in the world. Home to 15 million of the animals, the country has nearly as many pigs as humans.

To stop the disease spreading like wildfire, 12 million pigs were preventatively killed within 13 months. Only about 700,000 were actually infected.

​Jaap Korteweg decided to open a vegetarian butchers after a bad outbreak of swine fever in The Netherlands

But where to put the millions of carcasses? Korteweg, a ninth-generation farmer in the south of the country, was among those asked to help out by putting dead pigs in his cold storage units while the animal crematories worked through the backlog.

""That was the moment I told myself: You don't want to be a part of this miserable system anymore,"" the farmer remembers. His own farm had just recently gone organic. And he, like his wife and four daughters, had become a vegetarian. Still, he wanted to do more.

As David once took on Goliath, he decided to compete with the ""bio-industry,"" as industrial farming is euphemistically called in the Netherlands.

Whether it is steaks and roulades, goulash soup or spaghetti bolognese, tuna salad or smoked mackerel - one by one, he wants to replace every meat and fish dish on the market with a vegetarian alternative. ""Meat must become an ancillary item on our plates,"" he says.

A 'plant-based slaughterhouse'

But why can't people just switch to veggies and salads? Why do we need a substitute that looks and tastes like meat? Isn't that hypocritical? Jaap Korteweg laughs out loud. He gets that question a lot.

""Because many people are addicted to meat. Because they are anxious about the idea of not eating meat anymore. And that fear is so great that rational arguments don't get through,"" he explains, citing himself as a prime example. ""I was a passionate carnivore. And I just wanted to keep eating my sausages and my bacon.""

At first, people ridiculed him for his endeavor. Challenge the meat industry? Nice try! But success has vindicated him. At the beginning of 2018, he will expand his business by adding what he calls a huge ""plant-based slaughterhouse"" in Breda in the southern Netherlands.

The project will cost 10 million euros ($11.8 million), a quarter of which he crowdfunded within in three weeks. It exceeded Korteweg's wildest expectations. He had initially hoped to raise 1 million euros in three months. ""I could have raised 10 million, but we had to stop,"" he says. The legal fundraising limit is 2.5 million euros. He took out a bank loan to cover the rest.

No animals were butchered in the making of this burger. It's totally plant-based

Korteweg plans to make 50 million meat substitute meals each year in his new factory. But the ""De Vegetarische Slager"" logo can already be found on the cooling counters and in the refrigerated aisles of about 3,000 outlets in 13 countries, including in snack bars, restaurants, ""regular"" butcheries and many grocery stores.

Better than the real thing?

Among them is the largest Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn, where Korteweg's vegetarian version of the popular sausage roll ""saucijzenbroodjes"" ranked first in taste tests. ""We even beat the 'real' saucijzenbroodjes with meat,"" product developer and chef Paul Bom emphasizes.

The chef and his team explore new meat substitutes in a trial kitchen in the back of the store. ""All we need is a blender, a mixer and a grinder, like in any other kitchen,"" the 44-year-old says. Well, that and the expertise he has accumulated over time.

Spices and consistency are key: ""You must be able to cut the meat substitute without it crumbling; and you have to be able to roll the substitute cold cuts."" A combination of carob bean flour and carrageenan made from red algae cells works really well here.

'Sauzijsenbroodje' are a kind of Dutch sausage roll or pasty. Jaap Korteweg makes a veggie option, pictured here

Sometimes, the team happens upon new products. ""We discovered our calamari by sheer coincidence while trying to develop fish nuggets - which ended up tasting like fried calamari,"" explains Bom.

Whenever a new product is ready for market launch, things get challenging for the team. Then they have to make 200 or 300 pounds (91 to 136 kilograms) instead of the five or six pounds of product made in the trial kitchen. ""And they may all taste different, even though we're using the same recipe!"" adds the chef. That means back to the trial counter to experiment, blend and stir some more.

Right now, the vegetarian butchers are developing a plant-based steak to convince even die-hard meat aficionados. But that won't be ready for another couple of years. Another product is a lot closer to market launch, yet it is still a secret. Bom provides a hint: ""You can spread it on bread.""

62,62,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Your cat is killing the Earth - but you can prevent it - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/your-cat-is-killing-the-earth-but-you-can-prevent-it/a-40003245,"Your cat's sweet purring and loving, contented looks won't change the fact that it's guilty for the planet's suffering - just like we are.

A recent study confirms that pets' meat-based diet has a fatal impact on the climate, due mainly to high carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, our loyal friends are big resource consumers and waste creators.

The situation is particularly worrisome considering the paradigm shift in the human-pet relationship in emerging economies such as China.

Moreover, cats that go or live outdoors eat urban wildlife, particularly newborn chicks. Environmental groups are calling for an to end this vicious cycle.

So is it possible to love and respect your pet, while still protecting the planet?

Huge carbon 'pawprint'

Cats and dogs are responsible for 25 to 30 percent of the environmental impact of meat consumption in the United States, according to a new paper.

To better understand these numbers: a country made up only of US cats and dogs would rank fifth in the world in meat consumption - behind only Russia, Brazil, the United States and China, the author calculated.

Although meat is essential for nutrition of these animals, we might be spoiling them - and with them, our planet. About 54 percent of dogs and 59 percent of cats in the US are overweight or obese, according to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention.

And after eating, we all know what comes next. Pets in the US alone produce as much feces in a year as 90 million humans.

A walk on the wild side

In Germany alone, around 2 million cats are ownerless - and countless housecats are given free rein outside.

The German Hunting Association (Deutscher Jagdverband) estimates that cats kill at least 14 million birds a year - in addition to numerous small mammals and reptiles.

Marius Adrion, part of the team for bird protection with the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), underscores this risk.

""There is a clear influence of cats into birds' population,"" Adrion told DW. Above all, he said, this is a key issue for regions with flightless birds.

A 2013 study found that cats kill billions of animals in the US each year, and represent a major threat to wildlife. Cats have contributed to species extinction - especially on islands. And the worst threat is from feral cats, the study concluded.

The UK charity Cats Protection points out that despite cats being naturally predatory animals, they're still not the primary cause of bird loss in the UK. But doubts still exist on the full impacts of cats' hunting.

Cats are natural predators - how to prevent their hunting instinct from decimating biodiversity?

""Cats tend to kill weak and sickly birds - so it is not clear whether cat predation replaces other forms of death, or is in addition to natural death,"" Sarah Elliott, central veterinary officer with Cats Protection, said in a press release.

In the same vein, the UK's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) believes that most of the birds killed by cats would have died anyway before the next breeding season.

But if proven differently, the impact could be much serious as gardens are a key breeding habitat for declining birds, the RSPB warns.

How to become an eco pet-owner

Now that you are aware of the trail of destruction your little companion leaves behind, what can be done to reduce both the impact on the local ecosystem and the carbon pawprint of your cat?

Allowing cats access to the outside world is very positive for cats' mental health - but it can be done more consciously. Cats Protection recommends keeping cats indoors during the early morning and evening, when prey species are most active.

Love your cat, but don't spoil it - for the sake of the environment

Adrion agrees. ""Owners have to be particularly careful and avoid letting them go out in May, June or July - particularly during mornings,"" he said.

At that time, chicks that still cannot fly are extremely vulnerable.

Above all, neutering cats is a basic requirement to avoid overpopulation and strays, all experts agree. Moreover, spayed and neutered cats tend to stay closer to home.

Reducing the CO2 emissions is more of a challenge.

A vegetarian diet is not an option for a cat - owners can, however, switch to organic feed - which supports biodiversity and reduces pollution since it avoids pesticides - and more environmentally friendly packaging. They can also avoid using hot water for cleaning the litterbox - and above all, buy compostable cat litter.

As with all our resources, reducing consumption is the first step. Thinking twice to avoid overfeeding and reduce waste can be a good starting point.

63,63,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,A molecular quantum spin network controlled by a single qubit - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701116.full,"Scalable quantum technologies require an unprecedented combination of precision and complexity for designing stable structures of well-controllable quantum systems on the nanoscale. It is a challenging task to find a suitable elementary building block, of which a quantum network can be comprised in a scalable way. We present the working principle of such a basic unit, engineered using molecular chemistry, whose collective control and readout are executed using a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The basic unit we investigate is a synthetic polyproline with electron spins localized on attached molecular side groups separated by a few nanometers. We demonstrate the collective readout and coherent manipulation of very few (≤ 6) of these S = 1/2 electronic spin systems and access their direct dipolar coupling tensor. Our results show that it is feasible to use spin-labeled peptides as a resource for a molecular qubit–based network, while at the same time providing simple optical readout of single quantum states through NV magnetometry. This work lays the foundation for building arbitrary quantum networks using well-established chemistry methods, which has many applications ranging from mapping distances in single molecules to quantum information processing.

Over the past few years, a novel atom-sized defect in the form of a nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond has revealed the ability to perform magnetic resonance studies on very few spins in a nanoscale volume ( 21 , 22 ), wherein its quantum nature is harnessed for magnetometry using optical means. Quantum-limited sensitivity has been achieved using the NV center in detecting single electron ( 23 , 24 ) and nuclear spins ( 25 , 26 ) external to the diamond lattice. Its long coherence time ( 27 ), even in close proximity to the surface, makes it possible to sense a single electron spin at a distance more than 30 nm from the NV center ( 28 ). This unique atomic-sized defect serves here as a probe for a network’s unit cell, reading it out with high fidelity using confocal microscopy, while microwave pulses facilitate manipulation of the sensor and network spins.

Quantum spin networks are known to integrate and scale up quantum registers involving many qubits. Combined with local control in implementing quantum logic gates, spin chains can greatly facilitate large-scale quantum information processing ( 11 – 13 ). In addition to the naturally available spin chains in materials ( 14 ), artificial spin chains are realized with quantum dots ( 15 ), chains of magnetic atoms ( 16 ), Josephson junction arrays ( 17 ), and trapped ions ( 18 ). Although the spin-spin distances in materials range in the 10-nm regime, offering scalability and high coupling strength among nearest neighbors, they are less controllable even at the few-spin level. On the other hand, artificially formed spin chains are more controllable, allowing them, for example, to be used as simulators for understanding energy transport in complex networks ( 19 ). In the intermediate regime of length scales in the nanometer region, molecular chemistry offers stable scaffolds to build scalable spin networks. These systems have mostly been studied in the context of magnetic resonance for distance measurements among the spins ( 20 ) but typically in the ensemble limit of around 10 9 spins due to sensor limitations. Therefore, it is necessary to find a suitable sensor system that can read out quantum information from this spin network on the local scale of a few spins in a noninvasive fashion.

Coherent control over a many-qubit system, as well as readout of few or single elementary qubits within this system, is key for quantum information processing techniques. Among the different realizations of qubits, electron and nuclear spins in solids show unprecedented coherence times of up to 6 hours ( 1 ), can be coherently controlled at gigahertz rates ( 2 ), and read out optically ( 3 ) as well as electronically ( 4 ). However, scaling of, for example, spin systems to larger regular arrays is a daunting technical task because typical distances for coupling electron spins via magnetic dipole interaction [below 30 nm ( 5 )] are currently out of reach for reliable top-down nanotechnology. However, a programmable molecular structure can very well cover these length scales ( 6 , 7 ), for example, using sequence-controlled self assembly of peptides on surfaces ( 8 ). These systems show a high degree of regularity required for complex patterns, which are built up from simple, interacting quantum systems. In addition, their flexible chemistry allows them to be manipulated into virtually any shape, such that their design can adopt various spin lattices in two and three dimensions ( 9 , 10 ). Here, we demonstrate measurement of a small basic unit cell for the goal of providing both scalability and a mechanism for quantum information readout, comprising two electron spins positioned on a molecule. Probing the coupling between the two spins and ultimately driving them in a coherent fashion constitute an essential building block for a molecular spin network.

RESULTS

We choose a synthetic, proline (P)–rich peptide as a spacer model system, H–AP 10 CP 10 CP 10 –NH 2 , containing two cysteine (C) amino acids at specific positions, to which various spin labels can be easily attached via site-directed spin labeling (SDSL). Because of the relatively high stiffness of the proline backbone (29, 30), the electron spins attached to the polyproline (network spins) are well localized, making them resilient to phonon-induced decoherence, even at finite temperatures. These network electron spins are locally probed and controlled by their dipolar coupling to the close-by electron spin located on the NV center in diamond (probe spin). To enable this coupling, we use shallow NV centers close to the diamond surface (<10 nm), on which we deposit the spin-labeled peptides (Fig. 1A). The higher gyromagnetic ratio of the network electron spins in comparison to nuclear spins makes it more feasible to drive coherent oscillations at high frequencies and detect their response (31).

Fig. 1 Spectroscopy of few spin-labeled peptides. Electron spin spectra measured at T = 4.2 K and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV); (A) Experimental sketch: The shallow NV center spin couples to doubly spin-labeled polyprolines. Coherent control over all participating spins is provided by a close-by (~ 50 μm) microwave wire (MW). The edge of the depicted sphere is the maximum sensing radius for a single electron spin to be detected, delimited by the NV centers’ T 2 time. The intrapeptide coupling is almost two orders of magnitude larger than any of the other couplings in the few-peptide case, especially the interpeptide coupling. (B) Pulse sequence used to probe the spectrum of external network spins. Red pulses address the NV center spin, whereas the frequency of the blue pulse is swept to address network spin labels (SL). (C) Measured spectrum on a diamond membrane coated exclusively with spin-labeled peptides. The fit of the spectrum is a numerical simulation over random orientations of 50 MTSSL spin labels, including decoherence effects due to interpeptide couplings. a.u., arbitrary units. (D) Same as (C) but the labeled polyprolines were diluted with unlabeled ones at a ratio of 1:10. Distinct hyperfine couplings are clearly visible. (E) Measurement of a diamond dangling bond dark spin on a cleaned membrane for comparison.

The sensor spin, namely, the NV center, is a ground-state paramagnetic S = 1 spin system, which can be optically polarized with near unit efficiency to the nonmagnetic (m z = 0) ground state of the spin. Similarly, its spin-state projection on its quantization (z) axis can also be read out optically with high fidelity (3). Because of a relatively large zero-field splitting of the NV center, its spin-state manipulation by microwave fields can be quite different from the network electron spins (2), enabling independent control. To efficiently characterize the spin network on the nanoscale using the NV center spin-state readout, our first goal is to unravel the various couplings involved in the dynamics. For this, we use double electron-electron spin resonance techniques (see Materials and Methods) as detailed in the following.

Here, we choose the common methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSSL) as a network spin, which will lead to three distinct hyperfine spectral peaks because of the hyperfine coupling of its electronic σ = 1/2 spin from an oxygen radical with a next-neighbor 14N nuclear spin (total spin quantum number I = 1) (24). Initially, we cover the diamond containing the NV center with MTSSL-bearing peptides (see Materials and Methods). Using this sample preparation, almost every NV center shows a strong electron spin signal peak (see the Supplementary Materials). Although it is likely that ≥50 spins are detected, spectra showing two distinct side peaks under ambient conditions can be found. This behavior is attributed to motional narrowing of the different inhomogeneous spectra because peptides were not immobilized on the diamond surface, and hence, molecular tumbling can be significant (32).

One well-known problem in optical excitation of organic molecules is photobleaching, that is, chemical reactions and the accompanying structural and electronical changes induced by supplying energy in the form of photons. Typically, around 1 mW of power is focused on a diffraction-limited spot to saturate the NV center fluorescence. Because of this, the electron spins within a dipolar coupling range to the NV center also experience a power density of usually 109 W ⋅ cm−3, which can often lead to a change or loss of the electronic spin properties in the molecule. We observe a bleaching of the MTSSL electron spin contrast on an hour time scale in almost all cases, preventing more elaborate experiments. To extend this time scale, often lowering the temperature of the system under investigation (33) and stripping the environment of oxygen to prevent photocatalytic reactions are of great benefit. Consequently, all of the following experiments were conducted at liquid helium temperatures (4.2 K) and in a UHV environment (p < 10−8 Pa) (34), wherein we do not observe photobleaching of the organic network spins, demonstrated by an excellent signal stability.

Upon cooling the dense network spin sample we described above, the previously observed narrow lines uniformly show significant broadening (Fig. 1C). This can be explained by the freezing out of any network spin motion on the time scale of the measurement and the resulting loss of motional narrowing. In this case, the resulting spectrum can be well described by a sum over all possible orientations. The high network spin density has a great effect on the coherence of the electronic network spins due to electron-electron flip-flop processes, while at the same time, the magnitude of sensor-network couplings makes it impossible to access single-network spin states. Therefore, we reduced the sensor-network coupling to only a few spins.

To this end, we diamagnetically dilute the peptide stock solution using nonlabeled peptides with a ratio of 1:10 before deposition on the diamond surface, increasing the interpeptide spin-spin distance in the resulting homogeneously mixed molecular film. Subsequently, we observe spectra on NV centers with narrow peaks at low temperature (Fig. 1D), suggesting low spin-spin interaction between the network spins and thus probe-to-network coupling with only a few participating spins, as depicted in Fig. 1A. Because of the rather high concentration of spin-labeled molecules, the ratio of NV centers exhibiting broad peaks to narrow peaks was approximately 40:1. We select an NV center showing four distinct side peaks (Fig. 1D) for all following measurements, possibly caused by pairs of electron spins at different angles and positions, which is expected from a few peptides in the sensing volume. To maximize signal intensity and access all directions at the same time in the following, we drive the external spins on the central peak at zero detuning (dashed blue line in Fig. 1E), which is independent of spin label orientation.

By fixing the π pulse transition frequency at any of the hyperfine peaks, we vary the application timing τ of the network spin pulse within the sequence (Fig. 2A) or equivalently vary the total length of the sequence. With this and various sensor-to-network couplings Fk involved, the resulting population difference among the probe spin states C NV oscillates as C NV ( τ ) = 1 2 [ 1 + ∏ k M cos ( F k τ ) ]

Fig. 2 Coupling to only few MTSSL spin-labels. (A) Coherent oscillation due to dipolar couplings between sensor and network spins, clearly visible by contrast inversion (blue shaded area) of the NV probe spin state, which suggests a low number of participating network spins. For the measurement, we choose a constant evolution time of 19.8 μs for the NV probe spin Hahn echo sequence, maximizing interaction time. Previous to the measurement, T 2 = 14.0 μs of the NV center under investigation was measured. To access the coupling between sensor and network spins, we sweep the application point of the network π pulse within the free evolution of the sensor spin coherence. The measurement data are accompanied by simulations of coupling strength oscillations caused by n = 2, 6, and 10 randomly distributed spins above the diamond surface. We would like to stress that it is difficult to estimate the precise number of spins here, and the relative strength of the overshoot below the NV sensor mixed state (0.5) heavily depends on the couplings (positions) of the participating network spins. (B) Hahn echo measurement on the external network spins directly probing their T 2 time via the readable signal from the probe spin (red). The blue curve was measured on a pulsed EPR spectrometer at 10 K in a frozen solution of water/glycerol (4:1) using the same peptides. A low concentration guarantees a proper separation between peptides, and the agreement of both coherence times points toward comparable SDSL peptide-peptide distances in both samples.

From the above equation, one can see that population inversion of the probe (that is, C S < 0.5) occurs for a single or few spins and slowly vanishes (that is, C S ≥ 0.5) with increasing number of spins in the sensing volume of the NV center probe spin.

Consequently, to gain information on the number of participating network spins, we apply the above-described sequence, showing a coherent oscillatory behavior (Fig. 2A), exclusively for the narrow peak case as on the previously selected sensor spin. From the observed population inversion in the acquired measurement data (that is, C S < 0.5) and from the density of the spin labels deposited on the diamond, we estimate a small number of spins (≲ 6) coupling to this sensor, confirming the few spin limit. For the broad spectra, as for the example in Fig. 1C, the measurement likewise shows a pure decay to the sensor spin’s thermal state (C S = 0.5).

In a similar measurement, we determine the coherence time of the network spins by the pulse sequence shown in Fig. 2B. The measured phase coherence time of T 2 = 3.0 ± 1.1 μs (Fig. 2B) is in agreement with standard low temperature–pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements on diluted peptides in solution. Although the two measurements are performed in different peptide environments and are difficult to compare, this again confirms that spin-labeled peptides are well separated. Another indication for this is the Gaussian decay of coherence, a sign for a proton flip-flop–limited decoherence (35) with no electron bath contribution. In addition to the ability to perform and read out single-spin (qubit) gates, the coherent dipolar coupling within the network allows for performing conditional two-spin gates. For this, however, the extraction of the J coupling among these spins is required, which is not readily possible with the so-far described pulse sequence.

Using regular single-frequency spectroscopy as in Fig. 1B, a J coupling cannot be extracted because the network spins are unpolarized, which leads to averaging of all spectral spin-spin contributions. This results in observing only single peaks instead of doublets split by J. To tackle the problem in an analogous manner to regular spectroscopy, we use a third radio frequency (RF) to address different network spins simultaneously. Accordingly, it seems naturally conclusive to perform a decoupling sequence on the network spins themselves while sweeping a third π pulse and investigate its effect on the coherence created on the network spins (Fig. 3, A and B). This, in principle, amounts to addressing two external spins separately by two distinct RF frequencies.

Fig. 3 Access to dipolar coupling between MTSSL spins. (A) Measurement of a triple-resonance frequency sweep on a few network spins (Figs. 1D and 2) with a π pulse width of 3.4 MHz. The swept frequency channel is SL 2, whereas SL 1 is kept at zero detuning to create a coherent superposition. The resulting spectrum can be fitted with two Lorentzians (red), as is expected from a pronounced J coupling between network spins. (B) Delay measurement on a the same environment, where we fix the excitation frequency of SL 1 at the network Larmor frequency and the SL 2 sweeping π pulse frequency 3 MHz apart from it. The red curve is a fit using a decaying cosine. The oscillations reveal the very same coupling strength as the frequency sweep in (A).

However, because the coupling is small and the width of the RF pulses is non-negligible in our case, this triple-resonance scheme is sensitive to the interspin coupling of the network spins as C NV ( τ ) ∼ 1 − ∏ k M sin 2 ( F k τ ) cos ( J ∥ τ ) cos ( J ⊥ τ ) even when driving the network decoupling sequence at the Larmor frequency of the network spins and having a substantial overlap of the excitation pulses (see the Supplementary Materials). Here, the coupling between network spins is described by a parallel J∥ and a perpendicular J⊥ term (see Materials and Methods). We would like to stress that a proper choice of the excitation frequencies here can give access to the different elements of the dipolar coupling tensor.

We apply the triple-resonance scheme to the previously investigated NV center probe environment. Here, the decoupling of the network spins is performed at their Larmor frequency while sweeping the frequency of a third π pulse. The resulting spectrum is plotted in Fig. 3A and shows two distinct peaks, with an effective coupling strength of 5.2 ± 1.0 MHz. To support these findings, we fix the second excitation frequency at the right peak and sweep the delay within the decoupling sequence, as we did to determine the probe-network coupling. Using this sequence, the intracell coupling is probed, and accordingly, the result is a distinct oscillation, shown in Fig. 3B, with a frequency of 5.8 ± 1.0 MHz, which is in agreement with the previous measurement. Both measurements are supported by numerical simulations, reproducing the behavior for a J-coupled spin system probed by the NV spin sensor (see the Supplementary Materials). Furthermore, we have performed control measurements, driving one of the two excitation channels far off-resonance to exclude any microwave artifacts, and did not observe any coupling. In addition, we conducted measurements on a freshly cleaned sample with different electron spin systems, which did not show any hyperfine interaction (Fig. 1E). These are most likely dangling bonds on the diamond surface and therefore not expected to exhibit any distinct dipolar coupling because their positions on the diamond surface are random. This was likewise not observed in our experiment.","Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1701116/F1.large.jpg,"['quantum', 'network', 'coupling', 'fig', 'nv', 'controlled', 'qubit', 'single', 'spins', 'spin', 'electron', 'center', 'frequency', 'molecular']", ,none
64,64,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"High tsunami danger in Alaska, perhaps elsewhere: Waves could travel far across Pacific - Science Daily",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170801101730.htm,"Scientists probing under the seafloor off Alaska have mapped a geologic structure that they say signals potential for a major tsunami in an area that normally would be considered benign. They say the feature closely resembles one that produced the 2011 Tohoku tsunami off Japan, killing some 20,000 people and melting down three nuclear reactors. Such structures may lurk unrecognized in other areas of the world, say the scientists. The findings appear in the print edition of the journal Nature Geoscience.

The discovery ""suggests this part of Alaska is particularly prone to tsunami generation,"" said seismologist Anne Bécel of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who led the study. ""The possibility that such features are widespread is of global significance."" In addition to Alaska, she said, waves could hit more southerly North American coasts, Hawaii and other parts of the Pacific.

Tsunamis can occur as giant plates of ocean crust dive under adjoining continental crust, a process called subduction. Some plates get stuck for decades or centuries and tension builds, until they suddenly slip by each other. This produces a big earthquake, and the ocean floor may jump up or down like a released spring. That motion transfers to the overlying water, creating a surface wave.

The 2011 Japan tsunami was a surprise, because it came partly on a ""creeping"" segment of seafloor, where the plates move steadily, releasing tension in frequent small quakes that should prevent a big one from building. But researchers are now recognizing it may not always work that way. Off Japan, part of the leading edge of the overriding continental plate had become somewhat detached from the main mass. When a relatively modest quake dislodged this detached wedge, it jumped, unleashing a wave that topped 130 feet in places. The telltale sign of danger, in retrospect: a fault in the seafloor that demarcated the detached section's boundary landward of the ""trench,"" the zone where the two plates initially meet. The fault had been known to exist, but no one had understood what it meant.

The researchers in the new study have now mapped a similar system in the Shumagin Gap, a creeping subduction zone near the end of the Alaska Peninsula some 600 miles from Anchorage. The segment is part of a subduction arc spanning the peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. Sailing on a specially equipped research vessel, the scientists used relatively new technology to penetrate deep into the seafloor with powerful sound pulses. By reading the echoes, they created CAT-scan-like maps of both the surface and what is underneath. The newly mapped fault lies between the trench and the coast, stretching perhaps 90 miles underwater more or less parallel to land. On the seafloor, it is marked by scarps about 15 feet high, indicating that the floor has dropped one side and risen on the other. The fault extends down more than 20 miles, all the way to where the two plates are moving against each other.

The team also analyzed small earthquakes in the region, and found a cluster of seismicity where the newly identified fault meets the plate boundary. This, they say, confirms that the fault may be active. Earthquake patterns also suggest that frictional properties on the seaward side of the fault differ from those on the landward side. These differences may have created the fault, slowly tearing the region off the main mass; or the fault may be the remains of a past sudden movement. Either way, it signals danger, said coauthor Donna Shillington, a Lamont-Doherty seismologist.

""With that big fault there, that outer part of the plate could move independently and make a tsunami a lot more effective,"" said Shillington. ""You get a lot more vertical motion if the part that moves is close to the seafloor surface."" A rough analogy: imagine snapping off a small piece of a dinner plate, laying the two pieces together on a table and pounding the table from below; the smaller piece will probably jump higher than if the plate were whole, because there is less holding it down.

Other parts of the Aleutian subduction zone are already known to be dangerous. A 1946 quake and tsunami originating further west killed more than 160 people, most in Hawaii. In 1964, an offshore quake killed around 140 people with landslides and tsunamis, mainly in Alaska; 19 people died in Oregon and California, and waves were detected as far off as Papua New Guinea and even Antarctica. In July 2017, an offshore quake near the western tip of the Aleutians triggered a Pacific-wide tsunami warning, but luckily it produced just a six-inch local wave.

As for the Shumagin Gap, in 1788, Russian colonists then living on nearby Unga Island recorded a great quake and tsunami that wiped out coastal structures and killed many native Aleut people. The researchers say it may have originated at the Shumagin Gap, but there is no way to be sure. Rob Witter, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), has scoured area coastlines for evidence of such a tsunami, but so far evidence has eluded him, he said. The potential danger ""remains a puzzle here,"" he said. ""We know so little about the hazards of subduction zones. Every little bit of new information we can glean about how they work is valuable, including the findings in this new paper.""

The authors say that apart from Japan, such a fault structure has been well documented only off Russia's Kuril Islands, east of the Aleutians. But, Shillington said, ""We don't have images from many places. If we were to look around the world, we would probably see a lot more."" John Miller, a retired USGS scientist who has studied the Aleutians, said that his own work suggests other segments of the arc have other threatening features that resemble both those in the Shumagin and off Japan. ""The dangers of areas like these are just now being widely recognized,"" he said.

Lamont seismologists have been studying earthquakes in the Aleutians since the 1960s, but early studies were conducted mainly on land. In the 1980s, the USGS collected the same type of data used in the new study, but seismic equipment now able to produce far more detailed images deep under the sea floor made this latest discovery possible, said Bécel. She and others conducted the imaging survey aboard the Marcus G. Langseth, the United States' flagship vessel for acoustic research. Owned by the U.S. National Science Foundation, it is operated by Lamont-Doherty on behalf the nation's universities and other research institutions.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['subduction', 'fault', 'high', 'plates', 'pacific', 'plate', 'waves', 'travel', 'far', 'danger', 'alaska', 'tsunami', 'seafloor', 'quake', 'say', 'japan']", ,none
65,65,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,3 firms winning in Singapore's sustainable business space | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/3-firms-winning-in-singapores-sustainable-business-space/,"A prosperous, sheltered dot in the heart of tropical Southeast Asia, Singapore is typically spared the wrath of nature even as its neighbours are routinely afflicted by earthquakes, cyclones, floods and droughts. But the city-state is not invulnerable to the effects of climate change.

Rises in sea level, rainfall intensity, dry spells, heat stress, flash flooding and vector-borne diseases will be accompanied by a decline in fresh water supply, food security and biodiversity in the island nation over the course of this century, if global warming is not kept in check, predicts Singapore’s National Climate Change Secretariat.

Singapore’s average temperature, which has risen from 26.6 degrees Celsius in 1972 to 27.7°C in 2014, is increasing twice as fast as the global rate.

Though daunting, these climate-related challenges have presented the most forward-thinking members of Singapore’s business community with opportunities to innovate. One such innovation will be rolled out on one of the most important days on Singapore’s national events calendar, National Day.

Chilling on National Day

As they celebrate Singapore’s 52nd birthday on August 9, a section of the crowd watching the National Day Parade fireworks and fighter jet flybys on the floating platform at Marina Bay will experience something new - outdoor air-conditioning. The 31 degrees Celsius-heat and 80 per cent humidity expected on the day will be reduced to 24 degrees in some areas of the platform.

For the first time in Singapore, the cooled air comes with a difference—it has been “recycled” from a sprawling network of underground water pipes used to chill buildings at the Marina Bay area, Singapore’s financial district.

The chilled floating platform is the latest innovation made possible by the world’s largest district cooling system, a piping network some 5 kilometres long that runs across Marina Bay. Owned and operated by Singapore’s grid operator, SP Power, it cools key landmarks including the ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay Financial Centre.

District cooling is the production of chilled water from a central source that is piped to a network of buildings in the local area for air conditioning, removing the need to chill buildings individually, therefore saving on energy, installation and operating costs and manpower.

SP Group, a Temasek-owned firm, estimates that the Marina Bay district cooling system has reduced energy use for building operators by 40 per cent since it started operations in 2012. The energy saved is equivalent to that needed to power 24,000 three-room public housing units.

With the temperature in Singapore increasing by 0.5 degrees Celsius every decade and the need for air conditioning increasing in parallel, the district cooling system at Marina Bay is soon to be replicated elsewhere as part of a movement to keep Singaporeans cool in an energy efficient way, says Jimmy Khoo, the managing director of Singapore District Cooling.

The aim now is to expand district cooling beyond commercial buildings, and introduce the technology to residential buildings and more outdoor spaces dotted around the island, says Khoo.

“Imagine walking around Singapore in bubbles of cooler air in various spots, delivered sustainably at low cost,” says Khoo. “We want to help unlock the potential of urban spaces and make Singapore even more liveable.”

This video details the outdoor cooling innovation:

Running on sunshine

Singapore’s energy mix is dominated by natural gas, which makes more than 95 per cent of consumption and has long been seen as the most reliable, less polluting energy option. Renewables account for just a fraction of the world’s 26th biggest carbon emitter per capita. But that is changing, and a Norwegian firm named REC Solar is primed to take advantage of the trend towards clean energy.

Installled solar capacity in Singapore has almost quadrupled in the last three years - up from 33.1 megawatts peak (MWp) in 2014 to 129.8 MWp in the first quarter of 2017. The government is aiming for solar to make up 5 per cent of the country’s total energy mix - or 350 MWp - by 2020, and is on track to exceed that target, according to the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore.

REC Solar is riding the solar growth wave by innovating its product and service offering. Though a relatively small player, the firm competes with cheaper Chinese rivals by having the lowest claim rate in the industry; out of 1 million panels, only around 50 of REC’s are returned due to glass breakage during transport or other defects.

The company has thrived. When the firm launched a Singapore operation in 2010, it had the power capacity of 15 megawatts in solar modules. This has mushroomed in seven years, to 1.4 gigawatts.

But growth hasn’t come easy. Although the price of solar technology has dropped significantly in recent years, so has the price of fossil fuel alternatives. This is holding back investors in solar energy, believes REC Solar’s regional vice president of sales, Torgeir Ulset.

The prospects for solar are good, however. The introduction of a carbon tax in Singapore by 2019 is likely to encourage more consumers, businesses and public sector agencies to consider installing solar panels on their roofs. And by the second half of next year, Singapore’s energy sector will be fully liberalised and 1.3 million households will be able to more easily opt for renewables over fossil fuels to power their homes.

Meanwhile, solar is finding its way on to new platforms in the land-scarce island of 700 square kilometres; REC Solar is taking part in a trial of the world’s largest floating solar photovoltaic cell test bed at Tengeh Reservoir.

For now though, the company must battle it out in an increasingly competitive market place. Ulset declares: “We need the best product, the most efficient service, and the best warranties and claim rates. And we need to do that at constantly lower cost point. Our biggest challenge is maintaining profitability when the price [of solar] is eroding.”

Designing a city of the future

A city that has expanded its size by a quarter over the last two centuries by reclaiming land is no stranger to the importance of planning for the long term.

“With good planning, a clear understanding of objectives and creative thinking towards problem solving, urban development can be sustainable,” Wong Heang Fine, group chief executive of urban design consultancy Surbana Jurong, tells Eco-Business.

The firm, which has developed masterplans for 90 cities and developed 50 industrial parks,believes that quality living environments can be created despite the physical limitations that exist in Singapore, and is behind some of the city-state’s most sustainable urban creations.

One iconic project is Treelodge@Punggol, a residential complex that was the first in Singapore be awarded the BCA Green Mark Platinum Award, the highests possible award in Singapore’s national green building certification scheme.

The complex was strategically placed facing the prevailing winds to maximise natural ventilation, and to minimise solar radiation. Festooned with plants to reduce heat and noise, Treelodge@Punggol’s walls, roof and courtyards are abundantly green; there is even a dedicated spot for community gardening.

Another green gem in Surbana Jurong’s portfolio is CleanTech One, is the first property to be built in Singapore’s first green business park. Like Treelodge@Punggol, the building has an east-west facing façade to maximise solar orientation, and has plentiful greenery to curb heat stress. The building also features solar panels on the roof, a bio-digester to eliminate food waste, and energy-efficient lighting throughout.

Wong says that technology has given Surbana Jurong a competitive edge in sustainable design. Using building information modelling systems and virtual design and construction (VDC) combined with artificial intelligence in planning, design and construction, the firm can visualise the cities it wants to build more precisely. This enables it to better manage cost and scheduling.

The firm also uses technology to manage cities more effectively. Its smart cities solution, Smart City in a Box, enables officials to better track, monitor and manage features of the urban environment such as traffic, energy use and water quality using a dashboard of integrated applications.

“We are always mindful that what we build must be sustainable and remain relevant and attractive for both present and future generations. Hence our design considerations include social, economical and environmental aspects,” says Wong.

He adds: “Cities must be liveable and have longevity.”","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/003.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['winning', 'singapores', 'national', 'sustainable', 'solar', 'marina', 'bay', 'cooling', 'business', 'energy', 'singapore', 'firm', 'space', 'firms', 'urban']", ,none
66,66,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Coral skeletons may resist the effects of acidifying oceans - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170828164123.htm,"Coral skeletons are the building blocks of diverse coral reef ecosystems, which has led to increasing concern over how these key species will cope with warming and acidifying oceans that threaten their stability.

New research from Pupa Gilbert, a professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, provides evidence that at least one species of coral, Stylophora pistillata, and possibly others, build their hard, calcium carbonate skeletons faster, and in bigger pieces, than previously thought. Instead of slowly adding material molecule by molecule, the coral animal actively constructs large chunks of minerals that it adds to its growing skeleton, helping it grow much faster than it otherwise could, and with greater control.

The new research suggests that because the minerals are first formed inside the coral tissue, they may continue to do so even in acidifying oceans. If other coral species build their skeletons in a similar way, then the oceans could avoid a large-scale crisis in coral skeleton formation that scientists have worried would unravel reef ecosystems. Other stresses, like warmer waters and coral bleaching, still endanger coral, however.

The work is published this week (Aug. 28, 2017) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Collaborators from the University of Haifa and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory contributed to the research.

""Coral reefs only cover one percent of ocean floors, but they host 25 percent of all marine species, so they're incredibly diverse and important from a biological point of view,"" says Gilbert. ""But they're also economically important for the fishing industry, tourism, and because of their role in providing coastlines with protection from tropical storms.""

Corals are colonies of small, tentacled animals that encase themselves in bony structures made of the mineral calcium carbonate, the same material that makes up the shells of other sea creatures. Their role in creating habitat for diverse ecosystems has drawn attention to corals and how they build their rocky skeletons.

Despite decades of research, scientists had been unable to reliably distinguish between two competing theories of coral growth. The classical idea was that corals largely relied on a calcium-rich fluid slowly -- one molecule at a time -- adding minerals to the skeleton. Other evidence pointed to a much more active role for the soft-bodied animals taking in seawater, concentrating it, but still adding it one molecule at a time to their skeletons.

Gilbert developed a new way to image the growing portions of coral skeletons to see what the forming structures were made of, which she calls component mapping. Using high-energy light provided by the Advanced Light Source at Berkeley Lab to distinguish different minerals, Gilbert's team created a pixel-by-pixel map to generate an image of the growing skeletons of Stylophora pistillata, also known as hood coral. They saw particles made up of unstable, amorphous forms of calcium carbonate at and near the growing surfaces of the coral skeletons.

Some of the particles were a comparatively large 400 billionths of a meter across, which is more than 500 times larger than a single calcium carbonate group. The researchers also observed evidence that the unstable precursors eventually crystallized into aragonite, the stable form of calcium carbonate that makes up mature coral skeletons.

""These are the same precursors seen in biominerals from sea urchin and abalone, which are different organisms from completely different branches in the tree of life, so the fact that they used exactly the same mechanism to form their skeletons is really surprising,"" Gilbert explains.

In their new model of coral skeleton growth, Gilbert and her colleagues propose that corals collect seawater in their tissues, add materials, and organize them into large particles of amorphous calcium carbonate. Only then do the animals transport these particles and attach them to their growing skeletons, where they slowly convert to the stable aragonite. This growth pattern is more than 100 times faster than molecule-by-molecule growth, which is in line with previous measurements of how fast corals grow.

Since this new research indicates an active role for corals in developing their skeletons, it suggests that they are not entirely at the mercy of the ocean's chemical makeup. While acidic conditions are known to dissolve calcium carbonate, the method of skeleton construction that Gilbert observed in this study should be much more stable in the face of acidifying oceans. Although increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are acidifying the oceans, the new work suggests that corals could withstand this stress.

""If this mode of formation is verified in other species of coral, then it could be a more general mechanism, and that would enable us to predict that corals will actually form just as well in acidifying oceans,"" says Gilbert.","Mon, 28 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['species', 'skeleton', 'oceans', 'acidifying', 'coral', 'effects', 'calcium', 'corals', 'gilbert', 'carbonate', 'growing', 'skeletons', 'resist']", ,none
67,67,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,NSW virtual fencing trial shows promise in commercial cattle application - Beef Central,https://www.beefcentral.com/production/nsw-virtual-fencing-trial-shows-promise-in-commercial-cattle-application/,"A NEW South Wales beef producer who took part in a recent commercial trial of virtual fencing systems says he can see applications using the technology to reduce expensive fencing and keep stock out of areas that are difficult to muster or control.

John Guest manages Kaluah, a beef cattle property at Tumbarumba on the western edge of the Snowy Mountains in southern New South Wales.

He recently took part in a trial to test new digital agriculture technology, virtual fencing, being developed under the commercial name, eShepherd.

Virtual fencing is an animal-friendly system that trains livestock to be confined or moved without using actual fences. Using eShepherd, the producer creates a virtual fence boundary using a smart phone, tablet or computer and the system uses GPS, wireless technologies and sensors to control the location of livestock.

The trial at Kaluah involved a herd of Angus cattle in a paddock with full access to a river and its adjoining land.

“I can see we would use it on our properties to reduce expensive fencing and keep stock out of areas that are difficult to muster or control,” Mr Guest said.

“It’s got the potential to make livestock handling simpler, cheaper and more efficient through so many ways,” he said.

The system works by giving audio cues to cattle through solar-powered smart collars as they approach the fence and a small electric pulse if they continue on. Over a short period of time, cattle learn to turn away when they hear the audio cue. If they do go as far as receiving the pulse, it’s significantly less than the shock of an electric fence. Minimising any stress and ensuring welfare of the animals has been a key part of the research.

For the first week the cattle in the Kaluah trial, with collars fitted but not activated, were able to roam freely in the paddock, cross the river and head into the bush on the other bank. They were monitored and although they were new to the paddock, they got used to drinking at the river each day and grazing alongside it where the pasture is lusher.

eShepherd collars were then turned on, effectively blocking their access. Within a few hours all animals learned the presence of the virtual fence and chose not to enter the waterway zone. Only four cows ‘touched’ the fence – they turned away and thanks to the herd effect, others followed.

“I was surprised how quickly the cattle learnt what the collars were about and after only a few zaps, they just turned away when they heard the audio cue,” Mr Guest said.

Three days into the trial a few animals pushed through the fence but, unlike an electric fence, the system slowly, within around 40 minutes, ‘shepherded’ them back to where they were meant to be.

After eleven days the virtual fence was removed and the animals rapidly returned to grazing along the waterway.

12-years in development

CSIRO started working on virtual fencing in 2005 and over the next five years, became world-leaders, inventing, developing and patenting its world-first, unique system. CSIRO teamed-up with agritech start-up, Agersens, to commercialise the technology, as worldwide licensee and commercial partner.

The aim of the trial at Tumbarumba was to test the effectiveness of keeping the cattle out of an environmentally sensitive area, however there were a multitude of other reasons farmers could use the developing technology, Mr Guest said.

“With the heifers, I look forward to one day being given an alert when they are in trouble and I won’t have to spend hours checking them during calving time,” he said.

“While its most obvious uses are keeping stock out of creeks or where tree lines are being established, the potential management benefits are endless. From rotational grazing and separating bulls, to being able to graze different mobs on the same crop, or reducing weaning stress by slowly moving calves from their mothers while in the same paddock,” he said.

The Tumbarumba trial was supported by Murray Local land Services and Goulburn Broken Catchment Management Authority.

Second break-feeding trial proves successful

Elsewhere, Agersens and CSIRO carried out a break feeding trial in a six hectare paddock in March this year. Break feeding is a system of controlling the feeding of grazing animals by successively allocating pasture or forage crop using a moveable fence.

Six Angus cattle fitted with the eShepherd prototype were first allowed to graze freely over the whole paddock, and as illustrated in the movement record below, preferred to spend time in the shelter of a row of trees at the right-hand end of the paddock.

A virtual fence was applied to keep the cattle within 40pc of the paddock area away from the trees. During the two-day training period, as can be seen below, cattle were crossing the fenceline, but being shepherded back into the grazing zone.

After a few days the cattle were allocated to new pasture by moving the virtual fence 70 metres down the paddock. Cattle moved into the new area within a short time and started grazing on the new pasture.

After three days the virtual fence was moved a further 70 metres and the cattle again responded by rapidly moving into the new pasture allocation.

Finally, the virtual fence was rotated lengthwise down the paddock and restricted grazing to a single side.

The trial clearly demonstrated that cattle are quick to learn that a virtual fence can be moved, and rapidly adjust to the new position and orientation.

During August, Agersens will start a similar trial on rangeland cattle in Queensland, using the latest collar prototype before scaling up manufacture later this year.

Virtual fencing – Q&As

What is virtual fencing?

Virtual fencing is an animal-friendly fencing system that enables livestock to be confined or moved without using fixed fences. The technology, patented by CSIRO and commercialised by Agersens, uses GPS, wireless technologies and sensors to control the location of livestock without the need for an actual fence.

How do animals learn where virtual fences are?

The system uses a unique training program that allows animals to both predict the presence of a virtual fence using associative learning and control the outcome by changing their behaviour. An animal learns to respond to eShepherd just like it learns to avoid a physical fence but by an audio cue rather than a visual cue.

Is it harmful to animals?

No. Healthy, contented animals are important for productive farms and minimising any stress and ensuring welfare of the animals has been a key part of the research. eShepherd has been specifically developed to address animal welfare concerns by focusing on animal behaviour and learning principles. The technology meets the highest animal welfare standards. If the animal does ‘touch’ the fence and receive the pulse, it’s significantly less than the shock from an electric fence. People can even try it on themselves and it feels like a ‘tingle’ on the skin. No physical fence means no barbed wire laceration or injuries to cattle and no possibility of uncontrolled shocking if they were to get tangled up in electric fencing.

Will the animal receive audio cues and electrical pulses if it’s resting on the wrong side of the virtual fence?

No. In this scenario eShepherd does nothing, even if the animal is lying down or standing at the fence boundary. eShepherd responds to behaviour, not just location. Can the animals be shocked inappropriately? No. The collar is controlled using an automated algorithm developed by CSIRO and eliminates the need for unreliable human intervention. Software controls are used to detect and prevent inappropriate use.

Who is developing the technology?

CSIRO started working on virtual fencing in 2005 and over the next five years they became world-leaders, inventing, developing and patenting this world-first, unique system. They teamed up with agritech start-up, Agersens, to help get the technology out to farmers and Agersens are the exclusive, worldwide licensee and commercial partner in virtual fencing. Agersens, recently named one of the world’s top disruptive brands of 2017 for trailblazing in the industry, is also collaborating in NZ applying eShepherd to their conditions.

When will I be able to buy it?

It’s expected that eShepherd will be commercially available in 2018.

Poor care and maintenance can lead to heart-related complications, said Dr Ahmad Fakri Alhimairi, non-invasive cardiologist at the Canadian Specialist Hospital Dubai.

He explained: “The human body maintains its internal temperature at around 37°C but as the environment warms up, the body tends to warm up as well. Heat-related challenges range from irritating problems such as heat rash to exhaustion and heat strokes.""

Dr Alhimairi added: ""People who do not consume enough water may face dehydration, hypotension, fast heart rate due to hyperdynamic circulation, angina due to workload on the heart, and worsened heart failure status as they may need admissions to hospital for stabilisation.

Heart exhaustion

""In advanced cases, they may get cardiac arrhythmia due to the heart exhaustion, hyperdynamic circulation and electrolytes disturbance.”

Who is at risk?

Hot, humid weather can be especially hard for people with damaged or weakened hearts, or older people whose bodies don’t respond as readily to stress as they once did. The extra work for the heart, compounded by the loss of sodium and potassium and the internal flood of stress hormones, can push some people into trouble. The combination of increased blood flow to the skin and dehydration may drop blood pressure enough to cause dizziness or falls.

Symptoms

“It can be hard to tell where heat exhaustion ends and heat stroke begins. Both can be mistaken for summer ‘flu’ at first. Most people are aware of the importance of drinking fluids during the summer but very few solemnly follow it. In order to maintain the body temperature, the body produces sweat, which means that you lose more fluid than usual from your body. This can drop your blood pressure and make your heart beat faster. Staying hydrated helps your body sweat and maintain a normal body temperature. Be on the lookout for nausea or vomiting, fatigue, headache, disorientation or confusion and muscle twitches,” added Dr Fakhri.

Dos and Don’ts

Avoiding heat strokes and heart issues

People with heart problems, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and patients should avoid diuretics as sodium depletion can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Drink plenty of water and other fluids and make sure you stay well hydrated throughout the day, especially those who suffer from kidney disease and diabetes.

Use sun screen, wear loose clothes, avoid prolonged exposure to the sun, avoid heavy work in hot weather.

In case you do feel the ‘flu’, consult your doctor immediately.

Make wise choices in clothes to help beat the weather and prevent heat from overstressing your heart and spoiling your summer.

69,69,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,All clear for the decisive trial of ecstasy in PTSD patients - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/08/all-clear-decisive-trial-ecstasy-ptsd-patients,"All clear for the decisive trial of ecstasy in PTSD patients

One of the main targets in the war on drugs could well become a drug to treat the scars of war. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as the illegal drug ecstasy, a ""breakthrough therapy"" for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a status that may lead to faster approval.

The agency has also approved the design for two phase III studies of MDMA for PTSD that would be funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), a nonprofit in Santa Cruz, California. MAPS announced the ""breakthrough therapy"" designation, made by FDA on 16 August, on its website today; if the group can find the money for the trials, which together could cost an estimated $25 million, they may start next spring and finish by 2021.

That an illegal dancefloor drug could become a promising pharmaceutical is another indication that the efforts of a dedicated group of researchers interested in the medicinal properties of mind-altering drugs is paying dividends. Stringent drug laws have stymied research on these compounds for decades. ""This is not a big scientific step,"" says David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London. ""It’s been obvious for 40 years that these drugs are medicines. But it’s a huge step in acceptance.""

Since 2012, FDA has designated close to 200 drugs as breakthrough therapies, a status that indicates there’s preliminary evidence that an intervention offers a substantial improvement over other options for a serious health condition. The agency aims to help develop and review these treatments faster than other candidate drugs.

In people with PTSD, a small sensory trigger such as a sound or a smell can bring a traumatic memory rushing back. “The disabling element of PTSD is the fact that when the memory starts, the emotions completely override you and overwhelm the brain,” Nutt says. Studies suggest that MDMA can dampen the emotional response to the memory, allowing people to relive their trauma and work through it, he says. The MDMA-treatment consists of several sessions of psychotherapy, some conducted while the patient is under the influence of the drug.

MAPS Executive Director Rick Doblin set up the group in 1986, one year after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration made MDMA an illegal drug, because he was convinced of its therapeutic potential. Since then, MAPS has poured millions into trials of MDMA, for PTSD and other conditions, and has taken the lead in conducting them. The FDA designation is ""kind of a public acknowledgement of the promise of this research,” Doblin says.

A small U.S. study that first suggested MDMA could help treat PTSD was published in 2011. Since then, researchers in Canada, Israel, and the United States have jointly carried out larger phase II trials funded by MAPS; their results, which remain unpublished but have been reviewed by the FDA, were very good, says Doblin. Overall, 107 participants who had suffered from PTSD for an average of 17.8 years were treated in the phase II trials, Doblin says. Of the 90 patients who were available to be studied 12 months later, 61 no longer had PTSD.

In late July, says Doblin, MAPS and FDA agreed on how the coming phase III trials—usually the last hurdle before seeking a drug's approval from regulators—should be conducted. A key issue that has dogged randomized controlled trials of MDMA and other mind-altering drugs is how to minimize bias. In many trial designs, some patients receive a drug while others are in a control group that receives a placebo. The participants aren’t told which they received, but patients who get MDMA can often tell, which might have an effect all by itself.

In past studies, patients in the control arm received a low dose of MDMA—a so-called ""active placebo""—that made it harder for them to tell in which group they were. But that had a negative effect on the outcome of their psychotherapy, says Doblin, making MDMA look better by comparison. A low dose ""activates people, but it does not provide the fear reduction that the full doses would and so they are more uncomfortable, more unhappy,” Doblin says.

That's why FDA decided it would be better to test MDMA-assisted psychotherapy against psychotherapy with an inactive placebo. But the agency and MAPS agreed on additional measures to ensure that the doctors who evaluate the patients don’t know if they received the real drug.

The biggest hurdle now is raising the money for the two phase III trials, which together will include between 200 and 300 participants. So far MAPS has raised only $12.75 million, about half of its goal, and an effort to crowdfund the rest has been disappointing. ""I think the money will come from major donors,” Doblin says. ""We are going to people in the tech world and family foundations, but we're also trying with the Veterans Administration.” The first phase III trial will start no matter what, he says. ""It’s always been the philosophy of MAPS that if we can do the work, the money will follow.”

MAPS has not conducted trials in Europe yet but is planning to start discussion with the European Medicines Agency, the European Union's regulatory body, soon.

71,71,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,"Michelin-starred Chef Kang battled cancer, weathered bankruptcy - The Straits Times",https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/a-chef-with-tenacity,"Hunger drove Michelin-starred chef Ang Song Kang, 52, into the kitchen.

As a child, Mr Ang, the eldest of five children brought up by a single parent, often drank water to make himself feel full when food was scarce.

He also asked for a job at a zi char stall, selling Chinese home-style dishes, when he was a teenager because he knew the employees there got free meals.

Mr Ang, who is better known as Chef Kang, has not forgotten his impoverished childhood amid his current, hard-won success.

He battled cancer and weathered bankruptcy before his eponymous restaurant, Chef Kang’s, won its first Michelin star in late June, just two years after he set up shop in Mackenzie Road on the fringe of Little India.

The restaurant, which seats about 33 persons, is small but plushly decked out with maroon drapes and royal-yellow tablecloths.

Mr Ang’s signature dishes include steamed crab with glutinous rice and a double-boiled soup with chicken encased in pig’s stomach.

As a chef, you want things to be perfect. If things don’t go well, I will blame myself. MR ANG SONG KANG, who is better known as Chef Kang

Instead of resting on his laurels after winning the award, he still spends most of his time cooking, unlike many chef-owners of restaurants. He is assisted by another chef, who is in his 40s.

Mr Ang, who speaks in a mix of English and Mandarin for this interview, says: “I used to run into the kitchen so that I would have food to eat. That’s how I survived as a child. That’s why I will not let go of my kitchen. If I’m outside, no matter how good my skills are, they will decline.”

His parents divorced when he was a child and his mother, Madam Goi Ah Nia, now in her 70s, worked as a cleaner, struggling to raise five children on her own. One of his younger brothers died of illness in childhood.

At the age of about nine, Mr Ang, who has not communicated with his father in years, took on odd jobs such as helping to sell snacks, including goreng pisang and otah.

He also skipped school to serve hot beverages at a coffee shop, incurring his mother’s wrath when his teacher told her he had been missing classes.

But he was only doing it to earn extra income for his family and handed his mum the few dollars he had earned that week as a “kopi boy” when she confronted him.

Around the age of 11, he dropped out of primary school to help support his family and got a job at a factory sticking labels on bottles for about $30 a month.

If he had a choice, he would have wanted to be a “lushi” (lawyer), rather than a “chushi” (chef), he says.

But he has no regrets. “It was time to go out and work to help the family. I have to help my mother. I’m the eldest son, I’m the big brother,” he says.

A few years later, he came across a zi char eatery in an industrial area in the north of Singapore.

“I felt interested. I could makan (eat) there, no need to worry about lunch and dinner. At the factory, I had to pay for food. I asked the people there, ‘You have food for yourself?’”

He approached the eatery’s managers for work a few times and was rejected as they deemed him too young.

But after he asked six times, they finally relented. He was about 16 when he started working there.

He was charged with keeping the fish tanks for live seafood clean and performed tasks such as scooping out prawns that had died and washing dishes. It was more than a year before he was allowed to work in the kitchen.

For a start, he learnt to cut vegetables and fish and was allowed to start the fire under the wok – his favourite piece of kitchen equipment – and eventually was taught to cook.

One culinary lesson he learnt was the value of simplicity.

Putting his soul in the cooking

When he progressed to cooking lunch for more than 10 staff, he used to be berated by his colleagues if he bungled common dishes such as sweet and sour pork.

""When you see a very easy thing, actually it's very difficult to do. My sweet and sour pork was soft, not crispy,"" he says.

A dish of braised luffa gourd with egg white, simple but tricky to perfect, is often lauded in food reviews as Chef Kang's speciality.

After he did his national service, he landed another job, through a contact, at a restaurant for Hong Kong cuisine in the Thomson area. His curiosity was piqued when he saw dishes he had never encountered before, such as lobster sashimi.

Mr Ang, who was in his early 20s, says he had to ""go back to the bottom"", cleaning tables. There was a language barrier as the staff spoke mostly Cantonese.

Mr Ang, who is Teochew, says: ""I told myself, I have no studies, I need good skills for my future. My English and Mandarin were already poor. It was hard to learn Cantonese, but I forced myself.""

The stress and long hours that came with working in a professional kitchen meant that ""sometimes, (he) wanted to give up"".

He asked to train under a Hong Kong master chef working there, who told him it would take at least 15 years to become a chef of an acceptable standard.

For more than 10 years, Mr Ang followed his late sifu (master) to places such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. He spent between several months and a few years at different restaurants picking up specific skills.

For example, Mr Ang, who now speaks Cantonese like a Hong Kong native, says he took about 10 years to learn all about soup.

""When you follow a master, it's like following a father. My sifu told me, if you don't work hard, it's better not to come to this line. He said what he taught me was 40 per cent; as a chef, 60 per cent would come from myself and my own experience,"" Mr Ang says.

He was introduced to his wife, Ms Annie Pouw Kia Eng, who was working as a hotel receptionist in Batam then, by a friend. Ms Pouw, 47, an Indonesian-Chinese who is a Singapore citizen, runs the front of house at Chef Kang's. She says she defers to him at work as he is more experienced.

Married for 23 years, their 22- year-old son works in sales and their daughter, 18, is a polytechnic student.

By the early 2000s, Mr Ang was ready to be his own boss. He wanted to use his experience in Hong Kong to cook ""high-class zi char"". But financial troubles consumed him within years.

In 2002, he opened his first casual eatery, Canton Wok, in Havelock Road. It moved to Serangoon and then to Joo Chiat before closing down in 2009.

That year, he filed for bankruptcy after various business ventures, including some in China, failed.

Mr Ang and his wife got through the rough patch by focusing on providing for their children.

Ms Pouw says: ""We faced it. Whatever the difficulty, we kept walking forward. No giving up.""

The family had experienced tough times before when Mr Ang was jobless for a few months when his first child was born.

He bounced back from his financial woes by working at an eatery at People's Park Complex for about a year. In 2011, he opened Canton Recipes House in Parc Sovereign Hotel in Albert Street. It closed a few years later.

He took a break for 11/2 years before opening his current restaurant in 2015, with a sum of about $100,000 provided by his wife and a few friends.

At the time, he was battling kidney cancer, which is now in remission.

Things started looking up for him this year.

Lawyer Edward Tiong, a fan of Mr Ang's cooking since his first eatery in Havelock Road, has been taking local and foreign friends to savour Mr Ang's food for about 15 years.

""I've always thought his food is remarkable, with its umami taste. He puts his soul in it and cooks dishes himself. There is a passion and consistency in his cooking.""

For maintaining the standard of his cooking over the years, Mr Ang received the Silver award at the inaugural Best Asian Restaurants Awards in late March this year.

The awards, presented by The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, celebrate and recognise Asian restaurants in Singapore.

Then, in June, came the unexpected star when the second edition of the Singapore Michelin Guide was announced.

Despite his achievements, Mr Ang says he still feels more like a bit player.

""I've done this for so many years. A calefare chef with a star. I'm very satisfied,"" he says. ""After the Michelin star, this is a new life.""","Mon, 28 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/x_large/public/articles/2017/08/28/st_20170828_vlkangwwhx_3378397.jpg?itok=xUJttmDy,"['chef', 'michelinstarred', 'bankruptcy', 'work', 'mr', 'weathered', 'kang', 'kong', 'hong', 'told', 'cancer', 'food', 'battled', 'dishes', 'working', 'times']", ,none
72,72,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Charlottesville: White educators need to fight racism every day - The Conversation CA,https://theconversation.com/charlottesville-white-educators-need-to-fight-racism-every-day-82550,"Like many people, I watched the news coming out of Charlottesville this weekend in horror. Future generations will ask about this moment, wondering: How did this happen? What did you do to resist?

I asked myself: As a white educator, how do I respond? What will I say to future generations? What is my responsibility?

Siva Vaidhyanathan wrote in the New York Times about the choice, as a professor at the University of Virginia, between denying extremists the attention “that feeds their flaming torches” and the call to direct confrontation. I read this piece and wondered, what would I do? What have I done?

In the 2016 documentary I am Not Your Negro, James Baldwin said: “History is not the past. It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history. If we pretend otherwise, we are literally criminals.”

So I need to act. White educators need to act. Every day.

Acting against white supremacy and systemic racism is not about white people demanding to be absolved because we are good people, have been discriminated against ourselves or are self-declared allies. It isn’t about insisting on being called Caucasian — a racist term — instead of white. This is white fragility that distracts from talking about white supremacy and instead centres again on white people’s needs and desires.

I find myself, as I write this, thinking I should tone it down. I want to minimize and not offend. As a white person I can tell myself that, overall, society is equal and fair. But this is a dangerous lie and it requires ignoring overwhelming evidence about global inequity.

White supremacy is defined as thinking that white people are superior to all others. Acting against white supremacy and racism is about learning what white supremacy, systemic racism and white privilege really mean.

It is about learning how the stress of racism affects learning. It is about learning how to understand and dismantle racism. It is about selecting children’s books carefully. It is about teaching children and teens to undo racism and white supremacy.

Systemic racism in school

White supremacy and white privilege normalize winning through violence — imperialism, killing, hurting, stealing knowledge, wasting and convincing everyone that white people are No. 1. White supremacy and white privilege involve doggedly refusing to acknowledge the contributions, and the vast knowledge, of the majority of people in the world who are not white.

This logic infects how we educate, who and what we see as leadership, and how we come to see each other and the planet that we are rapidly destroying.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jacques Boissinot

When I was growing up, the main characters in books were usually white and male. There were some women characters — including Nancy Drew, Wonder Woman, the Bionic Woman and Samantha from Bewitched. But all were white, and their characters often racist. My mother and grandmothers read books with different heroes but what they all had in common is that they were white, and in school we all learned about famous white people. In other words, our education ignored the vast majority of the world’s artists, thinkers, inventors, conservationists and humanitarians.

Today, students are often encouraged to participate in an event to help Africa such as a 24-hour fast that is supposed to enhance their understanding of starvation, or to go build a school or work in an orphanage over spring break. The assumption is that Africa — often represented as one big country rather than a continent with 54 countries — needs the help of us white people to develop.

Their education on Africa doesn’t include facts about African leaders or colonization and the continued violence towards people, water and lands by predominantly white, multinational corporations.

The canon I read in high school was white and predominantly male. The ideas were focused on meritocracy — work hard and you will succeed. Sometimes there were books on totalitarianism, such as 1984 by George Orwell, but race wasn’t discussed. Some of us might have read To Kill a Mockingbird (about a white saviour type). The secondary school students I speak with today have a reading list remarkably similar to what I had back in the 1980s.

So it’s not surprising that scholars, particularly scholars of colour, might anger students and colleagues who presume they’re pushing their special interest if they suggest readings from scholars who are not white. For white students and educators raised on white supremacy and with white privilege, knowledge from people outside of what has been represented as “normal” (code: white) since early childhood seems fringe, it seems special interest, and it seems irrelevant to their education.

It’s not surprising that there is a combination of anger, sadness and confusion when the white savior industrial complex is challenged.

Changing the structures

Bell hooks reminds us that “we have to constantly critique imperialist white supremacist patriarchal culture because it is normalized by mass media and rendered unproblematic.”

Most educators want to do the best for their students. We spend hours in hopes of developing inspiring classes and piquing the curiosity to learn. But we will do harm if we don’t truly act to change the white supremacist power structures we live within. White supremacy isn’t about ignorance, it is about power.

Talking about the crimes committed in the name of white supremacy is painful, but imagine how it is for the mother worried her child might get shot just for having the audacity to walk down the street as a racialized youth. Imagine what it is like for mothers of missing and murdered Indigenous women. Imagine what it is like for students who year after year read stories about white benefactors and superheroes.

We need to refuse to minimize the oppression despite the temptation to do so. White supremacy is real and does immeasurable harm. What do we teach our children? Do they learn about white supremacy and racism and ways to fight against it? Do they learn about people like Rosemary Brown, Mary Two-Axe Earley, James Baldwin, Viola Desmond, Mary Shadd Cary and Nina Simone who give us new ways to think and act for a better world?

Yes, those of us who are white and want to learn new ways of being will get challenged for racism that we are trying to unlearn. We will be embarrassed and we will often be confused and angry. But we do have a responsibility to keep learning a new way of being, despite the discomfort.

Unlearning white supremacy is a lifelong process. The consequence of not doing so is to continue to create a planet that is uninhabitable for all.

The good news is that there are plenty of resources to educate ourselves, and plenty of opportunities to engage in collective action for a better world.

73,73,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Bacteria Behind Mystery Epidemic in Iceland's Horses – The Horse - TheHorse.com,https://thehorse.com/13662/bacteria-behind-mystery-epidemic-in-icelands-horses/,"Researchers from the Animal Health Trust (AHT), in partnership with British and Icelandic research and veterinary institutions, have identified the cause of an epidemic of respiratory disease which infected not only Iceland’s native horse population, but also dogs, cats, and humans.

The respiratory disease epidemic in early 2010 was characterized by coughing and nasal discharge. The disease spread through the population of 77,000 Icelandic horses within weeks, leading to a self-imposed ban on their export and significant economic cost to the country. Initially, due to the speed at which the disease had spread, a viral cause was suspected. Investigations by researchers at the University of Iceland showed that only Streptococcus zooepidemicus, was consistently recovered from coughing horses and rare fatal cases of infection. However, this bacterium was also often found in healthy horses.

Scientists from the AHT and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, in Cambridge, England, were brought in to investigate.

“To identify the culprit, we sequenced the DNA from 257 samples of bacteria from diseased animals and people,” said Simon Harris, BSc, PhD, senior staff scientist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. “This showed that one specific strain of S. zooepidemicus, called ST209, was the likely culprit, and we also found this strain in a human case of blood poisoning. This study highlights, for the first time, how DNA sequencing can be used to identify endemic strains of bacteria and distinguish them from the cause of an epidemic infection.”

Iceland is free of all major equine infectious diseases thanks to the ban on the importation of horses into the country in place since 1882. Consequently, Icelandic horses are particularly susceptible to any new bacteria or virus that crosses the border, and so strict biosecurity regulations are in place to help protect them.

Sigríður Björnsdóttir, DVM, PhD, of the MAST Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, used information from owners and veterinarians to build an epidemiological network. This enabled her to identify an equine rehabilitation center where horses exercised in a water treadmill. The water treadmill is thought to have provided the perfect conditions for transmitting the disease as water was splashed up and ingested. Horses would complete their rehabilitation and return home, while incubating the disease, taking the infection with them.

The ST209 strain of S. zooepidemicus found in Iceland has also been recovered from a coughing horse in Sweden and an abdominal abscess in a Finnish horse trainer.

“There are a couple of theories as to how the strain entered Iceland,” said Andrew Waller, BSc, PhD, head of bacteriology at the AHT. “These bacteria are able to survive outside a horse for a week or so, which means the import of contaminated equipment or clothing is the most likely route by which ST209 entered Iceland. However, this particular strain could have even infected a human who travelled to Iceland, before spreading the strain back to a horse and triggering the epidemic.

“We are delighted to have helped uncover the likely identity of the cause of this epidemic,” he continued. “Our investigation highlights the ability of S. zooepidemicus strains to cause disease in animals and people. We found evidence that even endemic strains of S. zooepidemicus were likely causing cases of respiratory disease in Icelandic horses, illustrating that this group of bacteria causes more clinical problems in horses than was previously thought. We hope that raising awareness of the cause of this epidemic, and the likely involvement of a water treadmill as a key factor in disease transmission, will encourage veterinarians around the world to improve disease control precautions preventing future epidemics.”

The study, “Genomic Dissection of an Icelandic Epidemic of Respiratory Disease in Horses and Associated Zoonotic Cases,” was published in mBio.","Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thehorse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IcelandicHorseinPasture-istock.jpg,"['zooepidemicus', 'icelandic', 'horse', 'likely', 'cause', 'iceland', 'horses', 'bacteria', 'epidemic', 'disease', 'mystery', 'icelands', 'strain']", ,none

Despite multimillion-dollar yurts erected for Elon Musk, Katy Perry, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Mark Zuckerberg at Burning Man in Nevada’s Black Rock City — where the event runs Aug. 27 to Sept. 4 — or air-conditioned Burner Yurts at Jared Leto’s recent Thirty Seconds to Mars microfestival Camp Mars, dust and disorganization can prevail. And let’s not forget the epic fail of Fyre Fest’s geodesic dome accommodations.

Nature-loving entertainment insiders who crave adventure — but not port-a-potties and dehydration — increasingly are turning to outdoorsy destinations, from beautifully designed treehouses in a Scandinavian forest or on a South Pacific island to yurts and geodesic domes that allow views of, say, the aurora borealis. “People are looking for experiences; that’s the trend right now,” says travel concierge Melissa Schwartz of Destination Happiness. “Their takeaway is beyond a five-star hotel.” While on a break from shooting Tomb Raider, Walton Goggins glamped in South Africa’s Timbavati Game Reserve. “Man, I seek out those experiences! I don’t think I’ve ever stayed in a normal hotel room that I was paying for,” he says. “Being out in the space and knowing what’s around you is very real.”

One reason such accommodations are on the rise but under the radar, says travel expert Jaclyn Sienna India: “Privacy is huge.” Ninety percent of clients she books in exotic treehouses or domes have private Instagram accounts: “Someone at the top of their game in Hollywood doesn’t need to share where exactly they travel.” Try one of these luxe outposts for better-than-Burning Man adventures:

TRENDING: TREEHOUSES

Treehouses have a certain allure to the industry. Laura Dern has said her fantasy is to move into one, while designer Roderick Romero has built them for Julianne Moore, Sting and Val Kilmer. “This trend is so popular,” says Pete Nelson of Animal Planet’s Treehouse Masters, who just added a seventh treehouse to his Treehouse Point ($300/night) outside Seattle, where Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson has stayed, and is building a new resort of 27. Nelson constructs architectural wonders — always with a bar and plush bed — for the likes of musician Zac Brown and, most recently, 13-year-old America’s Got Talent star Grace Vanderwaal, who right after winning said, “I want the treehouse guys to build me a sick treehouse.” Nelson is discussing a structure with Eddie Vedder and is at work on a trio of “out-of-control, beautiful treehouses,” worth well into seven figures on a major Seattle corporate campus, where “anybody who works there can disconnect, go out in the woods and get creative.”

Anne Hathaway, Taylor Swift and Drew Barrymore have enjoyed Post Ranch Inn resort, which features ultra-high-end treehouses, “built on stilts 9 feet above the forest floor, each with a cozy fireplace and a skylight to see the stars — but no TVs to completely disconnect,” says Quintessentially Travel’s Kelly Grumbach. Closed this winter for renovation, the Big Sur icon’s just-reopened reclaimed wood, steel, stone and glass structures boast new sound systems and king beds with locally handcrafted organic, dye-free 600-thread-count bedding. A fourth treehouse reopens this month (from $1,375/night). Also in Big Sur is Treebones, which closed for three weeks after the bridge collapse on Highway One. Its Human Nest and treehouses have seen actors Shay Mitchell and Maggie Grace (Supercon), who called it “such a magical place to wake up.” The newest Twig Hut, handwoven by artist Jayson Fann, is BYOSB (bring your own sleeping bag; from $175/night). In San Jose del Cabo, top actresses, directors and models are heading to ACRE, a foodie farmland destination with an acclaimed hyperlocal restaurant that, in spring, began constructing airy treehouses with luxury linens and European bath fixtures (from $275, acrebaja.com).

Farther afield in Indonesia is Nihi Sumba Island’s opulent treehouse compound, Mamole, with two pools and private beach access, which Amazon Studios head of comedy, drama and VR Joe Lewis has called a temporary home. Says recent guest and Gotham actress Jamie Chung: “You are truly on the edge of wildness, with a 180-degree view of the ocean — it was hard to leave” ($6,000/night, inclusive of food).

At Fiji’s Laucala private island, guests who seek even more seclusion — like Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and Miranda Kerr, honeymooners there this summer — walk down a long rope bridge through the treetops to the thatched-roof Peninsula Residence, which hangs off the cliff’s edge ($6,800/night, all-inclusive). “The place to stay when visiting Kaikoura in New Zealand,” says Gen Hershey of Genuine Access travel consulting, is Hapuku Lodge, whose individual treehouses nestled in a native Kanuka grove offer expansive views in all directions. “Love the wood-burning fireplaces, and the food is fantastic.” (From $722/night, hapukulodge.com. At Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica in Peru’s Amazon, Tony Goldwyn Instagrammed his daughter on the swinging bridge 85 feet above the jungle floor, leading to Canopy Tree House, with a 24-hour butler (from $300/night).

Chewton Glen, in Hampshire, England, beloved by Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss and Geri Halliwell, debuted another elegant Treehouse Suite in October, bringing their grand total to 14, each with dining and living areas, private terraces and floor-to-ceiling windows erected 35 feet above the floor of a secluded valley. Everything is delivered to treehouse dwellers, from curated meals (like foraged jam and honey from the grounds) to private spa treatments on their balconies. (From $1,100/night, chewtonglen.com)

Sweden’s Treehotel “is one of the most spectacularly designed hotels in the world,” says John Spence, president of experiential luxury travel company Scott Dunn USA, of the architectural wonder in the woods with seven one-of-a-kind accommodations. Solange Knowles visited, writing on Instagram, “Yesterday I slept in this mirror tree house, ate moose meatballs, bathed in the Northern Lights (the sun never set!).” Just debuted: the 7th Room, 32 feet high in the trees, with a pine growing through the patio and a net where guests can sit, seemingly suspended in midair (from $607/night). Beloved by studio execs who want to wow their kids, the Arctic Treehouse Hotel, opened less than a year ago, is a compound of sleek luxury treehouses and glass houses perched in the forest beside Finland’s SantaPark (from $644/night, including breakfast).

YURTS, DOMES, GERS

Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart — as well as Bill Gates, arriving by floatplane — have traveled to the secluded shore of Tanzania’s Lake Tanganyika to stay in one of Greystoke Mahale’s six yurt-like, open-fronted bandas in the Mahale Mountain forest treeline. Each is raised off the ground, with dressing rooms and upstairs chill-out decks reached by a canoe-ladder; a highlight is chimpanzee trekking through the lush green forest (from $690/night per person, all-inclusive, nomad-tanzania.com ).

Three Camel Lodge, a luxurious, remote Nomadic Expeditions camp in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert, is “on a lot of must-do lists,” says Sienna India. Well off the beaten path, with the nearest Wi-Fi connection more than 300 miles away, the singular outpost has enabled top talent — this summer a Tony-winning composer, hit TV series actress and a Broadway performer — to truly unplug. Each yurt-like ger (“ger” is Mongolian for “home,” while “yurt” is Turkish for “dormitory”) features a bar, massage ger and screening room (two-night inclusive stays from $1,985).

Closer to L.A., Joshua Tree’s Dome in the Desert, so eye-catching that Airbnb built a mini version inside its Portland HQ, is a geodesic dome, an angular, rounded structure popularized by architect Buckminster Fuller in the 1950s. The boho-chic outpost has been visited by directors, writers and a couple of studio execs along with “award-winning musicians who sought inspiration in the desert to work on new songs,” says co-owner Kathrin Smirke (from $185/night).

After hitting Stockholm, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick and their kids decamped to Island Lodge in spacious, dome-shaped tents with panoramic windows, wood stoves, reindeer skins and luxe Mille Notti linens. According to the property, Parker and family took a cooking class and celebrated the Swedish midsummer with a smorgasbord and aquavit ($550/night per person, all-inclusive with private chef).

New in 2015, Aurora Dome in Finnish Lapland is designed with a glass wall to provide a window to the elusive aurora borealis; it’s “the best place to view the Northern Lights,” says Sienna India ($118/night). The travel expert adds that Finland’s Golden Crown Levin Iglut, “one of the most serene locations in the world,” has seen royals and pop stars and this winter booked an Oscar-nominated director. The glass-ceilinged igloos provide personal drivers and chefs along with ice fishing and reindeer safaris (from $386/night). Further south, the Swiss Alps’ high-tech, igloo-like geodesics at Whitepod Hotel provide ski gear at more than 5,500 feet above sea level (from $360/night).

Talent including Marina Benedict and Marty Papazian go to Patagonia’s Torres del Paine National Park for dramatic geodesic domes built in the same shape as ancient Kaweskar tribe dwellings at EcoCamp Patagonia, the area’s first fully sustainable accommodation. Wildlife excursions are on the itinerary before crawling into a king-size bed under a clear domed ceiling to gaze at stars. (From $320/night, with breakfast, ecocamp.travel)

GLAMPING

Paws Up is the classic American glamping resort, visited by everyone from Paltrow to The Rolling Stones (who bought out the entire 37,000-acre property) — now with brand-new, uberluxe three-bedroom tents that have heated slate flooring. Top Chef winner Brooke Williamson, who hosts annual culinary events at the property, says “the tents, especially North Bank, are truly stunning, having all the five-star amenities but also that really authentic camping experience.” Laura Prepon described her visit to Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan in glowing terms: “I can rough it, but Paws Up is the best. We did a cattle drive, which was amazing, and I was able to fly fish.” (Three-bedroom tents from $3,517/night for four people, pawsup.com)

The glamping wedding is trending, too: Channing Tatum’s and Elizabeth Banks’ stylist Wendi Ferreira (who works with her sister Nicole) and her new husband, Manuel Bronson, were married this July at Utah’s Conestoga Ranch (conestogaranch.com). Based off a trip there last summer, they chose the location for the “rustic ease of the resort,” says Ferreira, whose 135 guests stayed in fancy canvas tents with en suite bathrooms. “It was magic.”

Long a top pick for the likes of Dern, Natalie Portman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, Ventana Big Sur, an Alila Resort, launches a new glamping program this fall (along with a total renovation of its rooms), with 15 safari-style tents offering custom-designed mattresses, natural-fiber rugs and furniture designed by on-staff craftsmen using reclaimed redwood from the adults-only (and now dog-friendly) property.

76,76,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Role for cranberry seen in oral health for seniors - NutraIngredients-usa.com,https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2017/08/28/Role-for-cranberry-seen-in-oral-health-for-seniors,"Oral hygiene for institutionalized seniors who require high levels of care has been a research focus for dental professional Shirley Gutkowski, RDH. She said numerous studies have shown that poor oral hygiene among institutionalized seniors is a critical and worsening issue. Patients who are suffering from dementia, paralysis or various forms of palsy may have trouble keeping their mouths, gums and teeth free of food debris. Relying on poorly trained and poorly paid nursing assistants to do this for them has proven repeatedly to be a nonstarter, Gutkowski said.

Gap in oral care

“​I​’​m always looking at how to do things better to reduce the amount of decay in my ​patients​. Dental hygienists have thousands of hours of training in how to properly clean someone​’​s teeth,​” ​Gutkowski told NutraIngredients-USA. “​Nursing assistants get a week of training at best. And then they practice on each other.​”​

In addition to more training, dental hygienists working in dental offices can rely on a fairly high level of patient compliance. In other words, the patients understand why certain operations are being performed on their teeth and will cooperate in the treatment. No so in long term care facilities, Gutkowski said. It makes for a highly challenging work environment to say the least.

“​All the studies that have been done on trying to get nursing assistants to do long term oral care have shown that it just doesn​’​t work. They get bitten; they get spit upon. Nursing assistants are just not equipped to deal with this,​”​ she said.

A dye applied to teeth shows how much bacteria can remain on the teeth of nursing home patients even after cleaning from a poorly trained nursing assistant. Fruit d'Or photo.

Gutkowski said the extremely poor level of oral hygiene that results can start a cascade of health consequences that can end up causing accelerated periodontal disease and can even be lethal. Gutkowski said there is a ‘big gun’ wide-spectrum antibiotic approach available, but it’s not clear how effective it can be in this particular setting.

“​Chlorhexidine, applied with a sponge, is one strategy but it is associated with staining, alters the taste buds and it is not clear how it mixes with other medications,​” ​she said. “​Plus, ​chlorhexidine has never been studied in this population, and it is difficult for it to penetrate the immense of amount of build-up on their teeth.​”​

How cranberry might help

This is where the cranberry can be effective, she believes. Cranberry when taken orally in shot form can both coat the teeth and soak into any food debris that might be present. The ingredient has demonstrated ability to interfere with the ability of pathogenic bacteria to adhere to surfaces. This can interrupt the formation of extensive biofilms in which an excreted carbohydrate matrix allows the organisms to shield themselves from the body’s natural defenses.

“​Swishing with the shot would be ideal but in this patient population is probably impractical. But with all of the debris in their mouths this will kind of quickly soak in. That​’​s how I envision this working,​” ​she said.

At the upcoming Supply Side West trade show Canadian cranberry supplier Fruit d’Or will be highlighting its organic cranberry powder formulated into a prototype shot delivery form of the sort advocated by Gutkowski. Business development director Stephen Lukawski said the shot could be sweetened with xylitol, which has oral health benefits of its own, and in any case the company has been working to control the tartness of its ingredient. The formulation gets around one of the criticisms of cranberry juice cocktail, that being that those products are mostly water and sugar, with enough juice added in to provide the flavor.

“​In our process we are trying to limit the pH, and we​’​ve been successful at that. This is where the proanthocyanidins in cranberry really provide the ​benefits​. We have an ingredient with standardized levels of PACs,​” ​he said.

77,77,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Canada Sees 'Unsustainable' Spike in Asylum Seekers at US Border - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/americas/canada-sees-unsustainable-spike-asylum-seekers-us-border,"TORONTO/MONTREAL - The number of asylum seekers who illegally crossed the U.S. border into Canada more than tripled last month, according to Canadian government data released Thursday, as migrants worried about the U.S. administration's immigration crackdown head north.

More than 3,100 people walked across the border illegally in July to file refugee claims and were arrested, up from 884 in June, the federal government said.

Ninety-six percent of them went to Quebec, where an influx of asylum seekers, primarily Haitians, is sparking a backlash from opposition politicians and anti-immigrant groups in the primarily French-speaking province.

In the first 15 days of August, an additional 3,800 asylum seekers were arrested crossing the U.S. border into Quebec, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. More than 1,000 people are living in tents and government facilities at a Lacolle, Quebec border crossing across from upstate New York.

""It's not a crisis. It's a situation that is extraordinary. But it's well-managed,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters in Lacolle on Thursday.

Canada is struggling to house and provide social assistance for the influx of asylum seekers as its refugee system faces the worst delays in years.

The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), which is responsible for hearing all asylum claims, has redeployed resources to deal with the Quebec arrivals.

""The IRB had to make adjustments to be in a position to respond to the current situation that is clearly unsustainable,"" spokeswoman Anna Pape said in an email.

Canada has launched a campaign to counter misinformation about the country's refugee policy, which is believed to be one reason for the influx of refugees.

""Asking for asylum in Canada is not a guarantee for permanent residence in Canada, and it's extremely important we stress that,"" immigration ministry spokesman Louis Dumas told reporters.

Criticism of Trudeau

Conservative parliamentarian Michelle Rempel, her party's immigration critic, said the government steps are a ""Band-Aid"" solution.

""This situation started with Prime Minister Trudeau's irresponsible tweets and he has a responsibility to fix it,"" Rempel said in a statement, referring to January tweets Trudeau sent touting Canada's welcome of refugees after a U.S. travel ban was unveiled.

A Trudeau spokesman said the government has been consistent on the issue of refugees: ""Canada welcomes immigrants ... that said, there are laws and processes in place for people seeking asylum and our government is sending a clear message.""

Many of the most recent asylum seekers arriving in Quebec have been Haitians who face looming deportation from the United States when their temporary protected status expires in January 2018.

Canada ended its own ban on deportations to Haiti last summer. In the first quarter of this year, almost two-thirds of Haitian refugee claims were rejected, according to government figures.

The spike in asylum seekers has sparked protests by anti-migrant groups who say Canada is being soft on law-breakers.

The Montreal suburb of Boucherville has received dozens of messages on social media denouncing the asylum seekers, some of whom are being housed at a former seniors' home in the quiet suburb, according to local media reports. Montreal, Quebec's biggest city, opened its Olympic Stadium to house the arrivals.

India is richly endowed with a wide range of soft power resources, but it lacks an appropriate institutional “ecosystem” to harness its soft power and further its interests in the international sphere.

Multicultural India’s soft power resources are mostly autonomous of the government and critically depend on the health of its inclusive democracy.

The present ruling party’s indiscriminate pursuit of political consolidation is affecting social harmony within the country and, by implication, the foundations of India’s soft power.

The government can leverage soft power resources to support its foreign policy interests, if it unobtrusively provides infrastructural support for soft projects and refrains from interfering in the cultural and social lives of people.

Summary

India is richly endowed with a wide range of soft power resources that can help it to engage countries as far apart as Iran and Israel. Much of India’s soft power, and the ability to deploy it, is autonomous of the government, which limits the extent to which soft power can be actively harnessed. Moreover, India lacks an appropriate institutional “ecosystem” to harness soft power and further its interests in the international sphere. The present government’s capacity to deploy soft power is further constrained by the ruling party’s indiscriminate pursuit of political consolidation that is affecting domestic social harmony and, by implication, the foundations of the country’s soft power. India’s soft power resources can be nurtured and better used to advance its foreign policy interests, if the government unobtrusively provides infrastructural support for soft projects and refrains from interfering in the cultural and social lives of its citizens.

Analysis

The Narendra Modi Government, the first majority government since 1984, was expected to recast India’s foreign policy. It has, however, mostly followed the previous government’s policies. That is not surprising because, in large and stable democracies, major policies are mainly governed by deeper socio-economic factors and are not driven by the whims and fancies of the ruling party, let alone any individual. There does seem to be some change in style, though. Greater mobility of the Prime Minister, the marginalisation of the External Affairs minister,[1] the Prime Minister’s personality-centric approach to foreign policy, attacks on opposition parties and previous governments from foreign shores, the growing use of foreign policy “achievements” in domestic politics, the use of Indian languages in international interactions, a willingness to air differences with other countries in public, a greater reliance on social media, and a greater stress on soft power stand out. The last is part of a longer trend in India’s foreign policy and bears close scrutiny.

Traditional Sources of Soft Power

Assessments of India’s soft power stress historical, spiritual, ethno-linguistic and cultural ties with other countries. The recent spats between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and India and Nepal, reveal the fragility of such bonds in international affairs, though. These pairs of countries share as close traditional ties as possible. On the other hand, the close relationship of Buddhist Sri Lanka and Islamic Pakistan with atheist China shows that material and strategic considerations can outweigh socio-cultural differences.

The huge and persistent disparity in material power between India and the rest of the countries in the Indian Subcontinent engenders a sense of insecurity in the region despite the shared heritage. Soft initiatives such as the introduction of Varanasi-Colombo flights to ease the difficulty of Sri Lankan Buddhist pilgrims, Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka on the International Vesak Day commemorating the Buddha’s enlightenment, and the participation of Sri Lankan President in Simhasta celebrations in India, cannot diminish that insecurity, which pushes countries in India’s neighbourhood to embrace outside powers irrespective of socio-cultural differences and also makes India-bashing attractive in the domestic politics of most of those countries. Outside powers that can provide “unconditional” defence assistance are particularly welcome in India’s neighbourhood. No wonder China is already a key, if not the largest, trading partner, source of FDI, and supplier of arms and ammunition to all but one of India’s neighbours.

India’s neighbours backed its call to boycott the 2016 Islamabad Summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) that was as good as dead after India pulled out. Later, they readily participated in the Belt and Road Forum for International Co-operation. So, as usual, the neighbours sided with India on a trivial issue, but deserted it on a substantive issue even though everyone, including, of course, Sri Lanka, was aware of Hambantota; governments grappling with immediate economic challenges seem to ignore long-term consequences. It is not a mere coincidence that China has put Bhutan, the sole exception, under enormous pressure ahead of elections in that country. India’s neglect of its relationship with Bhutan has only made China’s task easier.

India’s non-violent anti-colonial struggle, participation in the Non-Aligned Movement and championing the cause of the developing countries, which allowed for a sense of a shared cultural unity with other decolonising countries, have been other traditional sources of soft power. India’s understanding of its anti-colonial credentials seems, however, to be outdated. As the memories of colonialism recede, the West’s global dominance reduces and India’s investments in developing countries grow, India will increasingly be judged by its present conduct (and in comparison to China), more than its past credentials.[2]

A recent example is illustrative. Pranab Mukherjee, the first Indian president to visit Ghana, unveiled a statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the University of Ghana. Later, a group of academics demanded its removal on the grounds that Gandhi was racist. They were motivated by historical revisionism (see stamps of Gandhi below),[3] a growing “sons-of-the-soil consciousness”, and, possibly, a resentment against the mistreatment of African students in India. Unlike the first two, the last is, in principle, not beyond India’s control. Moreover, it is time India promoted newer global icons. The Modi Government has made a small attempt in this direction by supporting the celebration of the birth anniversary of Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee at the United Nations.[4]

India’s diaspora, which boasts of several heads of states and governments and, more recently, CEOs of multi-national corporations, is yet another traditional source of soft power. The Indian diaspora is among the few of its kind in terms of size, global spread and occupational, ethno-linguistic and religious diversities. While Indian governments have mostly focussed on the North Atlantic region and a particular class within the diaspora, Modi has tried to reach out to Indian workers during his foreign visits. The diaspora ought not to be engaged through high-decibel Madison Square Garden and Allphones Arena-type shows of strength, however, because they not only stretch the understaffed Indian diplomatic corps, but also needlessly highlight the diaspora as an organised body, which may not be a good thing amid growing nativist tendencies across the world.

India’s Twenty-First Century Soft Power

Just like the historical sources of India’s soft power, the sources of India’s contemporary global cultural appeal – Bollywood, cricket,[5] Indian cuisine,[6] new age spirituality, yoga[7] – are autonomous of the government, which, in most cases, cannot influence them except when obstructing them.[8] Moreover, cultural ties and people-to-people relations have only limited impact on the hard calculus of international relations. China was busy altering the ground reality on the India-Bhutan-China tri-junction even as Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping discussed Aamir Khan’s record-breaking inspirational movie Dangal and International Yoga Day was celebrated on the Great Wall. The road from Dangal to Doka La was indeed very short. It is not that yoga does not help, but only when relations are already good. Benjamin Netanyahu, for instance, creatively used yoga to underscore the foundations of the bilateral relationship: ‘When I do a relaxing Tadasana pose, in the morning I’ll turn my head to the right, India is the first democracy that I’ll see. And when Prime Minister Modi does a relaxing pose of Vasisthasana and he turns his head to the left, Israel is the first democracy that you can see.’[9]

In the recent past, success in the new economy sectors such as information technology, bio-technology and space technology has also enhanced India’s global visibility. The fact that women form a significant proportion of the workforce in these sectors has also attracted attention from the rest of the world. The government can get some mileage out of private activity in this sector, but cannot push private players to align with foreign policy. So, while Modi could visit Tata Consultancy Services centres in Japan and Saudi Arabia, he did not get a similar opportunity in Iran. However, the government has used its control over India’s cost-effective space technology to promote the country’s interests abroad. The South Asia satellite is the latest example of India’s space diplomacy that is at least a decade old.

Some of the other, newer sources of soft power, such as the smooth conduct of parliamentary elections and decennial censuses, the largest peacetime exercises of their kind, are directly under the government’s control, but require it to maintain a studied distance except for providing necessary administrative support. Likewise, India’s independent judiciary and free media require the government to respect the autonomy of other institutions in society.

The peaceful resolution of land and maritime border disputes with neighbours such as Bangladesh, contributions to disaster relief, evacuation of people from conflict zones and humanitarian assistance across the Indian Ocean and Himalayan regions, contributions to UN peacekeeping missions, and small need-based development assistance, as in Afghanistan, have also contributed to India’s soft power.

Nurturing Soft Power

Much of India’s soft power, and the ability to deploy it, is autonomous of the government and demands that the government nurture cultural diversity, openness and creativity, or at the very least, not curb them. By thrusting a monolithic identity upon India, the Prime Minister’s party is further shrinking the room available to the government to harness soft power.

Unlike Wahhabi Saudi Arabia or Han China, multi-cultural India’s soft power critically depends on the health of its inclusive democracy. India cannot afford to promote one language, ideology or religion abroad – à la Saudi Arabia and China – because each of its provinces has its own language, script and religious and cultural icons, and there are serious ideological differences among the leading political parties. Hindu nationalism promoted by some of the sister organisations of the ruling party is not only straining social harmony within the country, but will also make India less attractive to scholars, artists, students, and tourists from abroad and even the non-Hindu communities, as well as non-orthodox Hindus, within the Indian diaspora.

The Modi Government would do well to recognise the character of India’s soft power and check the forces that are undermining its very foundations by trying to impose a singular identity. Otherwise, the emerging mismatch between the values and icons advertised abroad and those promoted within the country will stall the country’s soft power push – the government cannot celebrate the Taj Mahal and actor Aamir Khan abroad, while the sister organisations of the ruling party attack those icons at home (Cartoon 1, below). Historical revisionism is similarly undermining some of the well-known icons of India (Cartoon 2, below).[10]

The government has to appreciate that soft power resources need space to thrive and are not like instant coffee that is available just in time when it is needed. A good example of this is provided by the government’s attempt to use Sufism to reach out to the larger Muslim world, even as the ruling party’s sister organisations are contributing to the long trend of marginalisation of the traditional liberal voices within Islam in the Indian Subcontinent.

How Useful is India’s Soft Power?

India has the largest Shia population and Persian language archives outside Iran and is home to the world’s largest Zoroastrian population. While India and Iran share a millennia-old multifaceted relationship, Iran does not allow nostalgia to influence the pursuit of national interests. Imam Khomeini’s ancestors migrated to the Lucknow region, one of the most important centres of Shia culture in the Indian Subcontinent, in the late-eighteenth century and left for Najaf in the mid-nineteenth century before settling in Khomein in Iran, where they were known as Hindi.[11] It is also likely that Imam Khomeini’s ecumenism was influenced, among other things, by the work of the Lucknow-based Shia thinker Sayyid ‘Ali Naqi Naqvi. Imam Khomeini reportedly “denied” his Indian connection, however, and rebuffed the Indian Government’s attempt to approach him soon after the Islamic Revolution through Lucknow’s traditional Shia élite.[12]

Another example of the limited usefulness of soft power is in order. Regarding India’s success in canvassing support for the International Yoga Day, India’s External Affairs Minister noted that:

An unprecedented 177 out of the total 193 member states of the United Nations; joined-in as “co-sponsors” to the resolution for “International Yoga Day” … in the history of the United Nations, this is the highest number of co-sponsors ever for any Resolution of this nature [who] not just supported India, but expressed their public willingness to own the initiative as well … from the time Prime Minister Modi first formally initiated this proposal during his maiden address to the 69th session of the United Nations General Assembly on 27th September 2014, it took exactly 75 days for its formal adoption by the entire United Nations, last Friday, on the 11th of December. The speed and ease with which this proposal moved to final fruition, is a remarkable achievement in itself.

But how many of those countries will support an Indian candidate for the office of UN Secretary-General or India’s candidature for the Security Council? An assessment of what India gained from participation in the Non-Aligned Movement leads to similarly dismal conclusions. The above examples illustrate the inherent and severe limits to conversion of soft power into tangible gains in the international sphere. Moreover, India does not have an ecosystem within which to harness soft power earned through, say, its contribution to disaster relief and peacekeeping. For instance, in 2004, Indian disaster management teams were the first to reach tsunami-hit countries across the Indian Ocean Region, yet late comers such as the US received more coverage in the international media. More recently, India was the first and also the biggest source of assistance after the recent earthquake in Nepal, but the crass coverage by some of India’s private news channels allowed the anti-India lobby there to whip up a backlash against India.[13]

Soft Power needs a Hard Foundation

Soft and hard powers are complements rather than substitutes and the former has limited use in isolation. So, soft power cannot make up for the shortfall in hard capacity because it is in itself dependent upon the latter. Soft power can serve as an appetiser (to make an opening) or a dessert (to cap a successful hard power push), but cannot substitute the main course that rests on hard economic and political capacity. Modi cannot continue to travel through the world with the icing because, sooner than later, people will ask for the cake. So, soft power cannot be operated entirely independently of hard power. In other words, there is no escape from hard power, something that Nehru’s India realised rather belatedly. The under-developed Buddhist pilgrimage circuits, the shoddy arrangements for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, the rudderless Nalanda University, the less-than-satisfactory performance of the South Asian University, the launch of the South Asia satellite before ground infrastructure was built in the beneficiary countries, and the poor capacity to complete overseas projects on time are illustrative of how the incapacity to complete brick-and-mortar projects on time limits the ability to harness soft power.[14]

India’s soft power resources can be nurtured and better used to advance its foreign policy interests, if the government unobtrusively provides infrastructural support for soft projects and refrains from interfering in the cultural and social lives of people. So far, Modi has cleverly used foreign policy “achievements” in domestic politics. Before long, however, he will have to factor in how his party’s domestic politics are affecting the country’s soft power aspirations and foreign policy objectives.

Postscript: Shortly after writing this article, I was struck by the fact that I had completely forgotten the fact that a decade ago, when Tata Motors launched the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, and acquired Jaguar and Land Rover around the same time, India aroused enormous interest across the world. All of a sudden India began to be seen as capable of economic and technological dynamism. In fact, for a while, it seemed that India could take over as the next workshop to the world with its cost-effective innovations. “Nano” was the buzzword in those days; everything was becoming nano, from hotels to homes. But that was precisely when “politics” took over and the euphoria – in hindsight, the hype – crash-landed. The opposition pushed the West Bengal Government into a corner by claiming that selling agricultural land for the construction of a factory was against the interests of the poor. Tata Motors had to hurriedly shift its Nano factory from West Bengal on the eastern coast to business-friendly, west coast Gujarat.[15]

[1] Most other ministers are also marginalised, but do not seem to be cordoned off from their responsibilities to the extent that the External Affairs Minister is.

[2] The old stereotypes have not entirely gone out of use, though. Writing on the West’s purportedly partial attitude towards India amidst its stand-off with China, a contributor to Global Times wrote: ‘[India] gained independence through nonviolent resistance to the British Empire. The West believes India created a peaceful model of an anti-colonial movement. Therefore in the eyes of some Western scholars, India has been well-behaved and will not invade or bully other countries.’

[3] There was criticism of the demand to remove Gandhi’s statue from within the African community, though. Also, note that in the quote accompanying the Ghanaian stamp, Gandhi seems to caution against selective engagement: ‘My life is an indivisible whole, and all my attitudes run into one another; and they all have their rise in my insatiable love for mankind.’

[4] The government is also trying to build newer platforms to engage fellow developing countries across the Indo-Pacific region because older organisations, such as the NAM, have long ceased to provide meaningful opportunities to pursue India’s interests.

[5] Of late, cricket has turned into a source of immense acrimony in the Subcontinent. India’s cricket ties with Bangladesh and Pakistan are cases in point.

[6] It is not unusual for Pakistani and Bangladeshi restaurants in the West to be named after Indian icons such as the Taj Mahal.

[7] Sanskrit is sometimes added to this list, but the language is as good as dead within India. Most of the contemporary scholarship on it is located in the West, while the traditional scholarship based within India is not amenable to being used as a source of soft power.

[8] Pakistani sportspersons and artists have been effectively banned from working in India. It would be unrealistic as well as unfair to expect others to accept Indian cultural goods if it is itself not open to their offerings.

[9] The diversity of India’s cultural resources can be gauged from the fact that it can reach out to Israel’s rivals and enemies, Saudi Arabia and Iran, with equal ease. Modi presented a replica of India’s oldest mosque to the King of Saudi Arabia during his visit to that country and released a rare Persian manuscript of Kalileh-wa-Dimneh that is based on ancient Indian collections of stories during his visit to Iran. India’s ability to connect across divides is, in fact, not limited to this triad and would hold for almost any set of estranged countries.

[10] A related example comes from the field of science and technology. In the early days of this government, members of the ruling party, including ministers, and its sister organisation inundated the media with anachronistic debates about ancient India’s scientific achievements. The government cannot simultaneously contribute to the erosion of scientific temper in society and hope to leverage technological prowess.

[11] Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani visited Lucknow in 1995.

[12] The connection has been very recently remarked upon by Gholamreza Ansari, Iran’s Ambassador to India.

[13] Hyper-nationalists in the media who ostensibly aid the ruling party not only undermine democracy at home, but also hurt India’s interests abroad.

[14] India’s urban squalor, rural poverty and social inequalities also seriously dent its soft power.

[15] Ironically, over the last decade, millions have left India’s eastern states, including West Bengal, for economically dynamic western and southern states to work in factories run by companies such as Tata Motors. While the dream of making India the workshop to the world died a premature death and investor confidence was dented for a long time to come, the anti-Tata protests in West Bengal also affected India’s national politics. The protests culminated in the downfall of West Bengal’s three decades-old communist government in a bitterly-contested election in 2011.

As part of its efforts to keep sports clean, the FEI uses regular anti-doping testing that can detect small quantities of prohibited and controlled substances, whether administered intentionally or not. Swiss researchers recently determined that at least some of those substances could be getting into horses’ bodies unintentionally via small quantities in commercial feeds, supplements, and other products.

Morphine, codeine, noscapine, papaverine, colchicine, and atropine all appeared in minute quantities in more than half of the 28 feed samples tested in the researchers’ recent study. However, this is not cause for alarm, they stressed. It’s just cause for awareness.

“We found doping-relevant substances in very small concentrations with a sensitive laboratory method (electrospray-ionisation high-pressure-liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry, or ESI-LC-MS/MS) in the feed samples,” said Conny Herholz, PD, DrMedVet, FTA, Dipl. ECEIM, ATA, of the Bern University of Applied Sciences, School of Agricultural, Forest, and Food Sciences, in Zollikofen.

“The results show that feed can contain doping-relevant substances,” she continued. “But we don’t yet know if these concentrations are sufficiently high to be detected in the blood or urine of the horse.”

In their study, Herholz and colleagues tested 28 samples of commercial horse feed, packaged primarily in Switzerland and Germany, for the presence of nine naturally occurring doping substances. This included four substances on the FEI banned list (noscapine, papaverine, colchicine, and thebaine) and five substances on the FEI controlled medications list (morphine, codeine, atropine, theobromine, and theophylline).

They found that 18 (64%) of the feeds in their study showed evidence of contamination by one or more of these substances, Herholz said. Wheat bran samples were positive for noscapine, theobromine, atropine, and colchicine. Red soybean samples contained noscapine, theobromine, and atropine. Noscapine appeared in barley. And even the hay had positive results for three substances: noscapine, papaverine, and atropine.

Meanwhile, two methods of analysis of poppy seeds from Swiss farms revealed the presence of morphine, colchicine, codeine, noscapine, and papaverine. As poppy seeds could accidentally contaminate feed or hay at any stage of production, they could possibly account for the appearance of substances in drug testing, Herholz said. This might be an explanation for the recent doping cases involving two Swiss riders whose horses tested positive for poppy-related substances.

“Doping-relevant substances like in poppy seeds can contaminate feed at any stage of the value chain—beginning from the seed, to cultivation, harvesting, feed mills and transport up to the end consumer,” said Herholz. “For the horse owner, it’s important to pay attention, for example, to the hygienic storage of feed material in the stable.”

That means keeping feed stored in well-sealed containers to prevent accidental contamination by people, animals, or even wind and air, that could unknowingly transport poppy seeds into a horse’s food supply, she said. It also means being careful of the kinds of treats you give your horse.

“Poppy seed can contain different concentrations of opioids, as we see in our study,” she said. “If a horse eats bread with poppy seeds, which contain high concentrations of opioids, it can be enough to provoke a positive doping test result (although this concentration would not result in a visible reaction of the body).”

From a health perspective, there’s little to fear about the accidental presence of poppy seeds in food, however. “Considering the amount of morphine we detected in one oat sample, in order for the horse to have a visible bodily reaction, he would need to consume 2,083 kilograms (more than 4,500 pounds) of those oat grains,” Herholz said.

Whether the small amounts present in commercial products is enough to trigger a positive doping test remains to be determined. “Very little data exists at the moment about what concentrations of doping-relevant substances (consumed) would lead to a positive test result in urine or blood,” she said. “Further research is required.”

In the meantime, owners don’t need to avoid commercial feeds out of fear of doping substance contamination, she said. And the FEI doesn’t need to redesign its doping test strategy. In general, there’s no reason to panic.

However, owners can practice good feed management, such as buying food specifically designed for horses (not other animals), checking for holes in packaging at purchase, storing feed in tightly closed containers, and keeping horse food away from other animals’ food and pharmaceutical products. Competitors should also keep package labels and a small sample of food for testing purposes in the event of a positive test, Herholz said.

The research received the support of the Swiss feed industry, “which is aware of the problem,” said Herholz. Charles F. Trolliet, DVM, president of the Swiss Equestrian Federation (SVPS/FSSE), in Bern, participated in the study.

82,82,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Tropical Storm Harvey Adds to Texas Floods as Trump Set to Visit Region - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/tropical-storm-harvey-adds-texas-floods-trump-set-visit-region,"Heavy rain continued to pour Tuesday on southeastern Texas where Tropical Storm Harvey has already caused catastrophic flooding in one of the largest cities in the United States.



The National Weather Service expected the storm to drop 25 to 50 centimeters of rain before it finally moved out of the region Thursday. That is in addition to upwards of 90 centimeters of rain that has already fallen in some areas, including around the city of Houston.



Harvey's center was sitting just off the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, drawing energy from the warm waters there and pushing band after band of heavy rain onshore. The storm is expected to make landfall in Texas again on Wednesday.

WATCH: Victims of flooding rescued



The water has flooded homes and roads and left rescuers working continuously to get people to safety.



Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said as of Monday evening more than 3,000 people had been rescued and 8,000 people were in shelters. He said there were three confirmed deaths related to the storm.



Texas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters he deployed the entire 15,000-member Texas National Guard to help deal with the disaster.



Abbott praised local leaders along the Texas Gulf coast, calling them ""humane, courageous, and heroic."" He said the way people got through the storm and that so many lives were saved is ""remarkable.""

Trump to visit Corpus Christi, Austin

President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, are traveling Tuesday to the cities of Corpus Christi and Austin to receive briefings from local and state leaders and to tour an emergency operations center.



Trump said Monday the people in flood-hit areas of Texas and neighboring Louisiana can expect ""very rapid action"" from Congress to get the disaster relief funding they will need to clean up and rebuild.



""You're going to have what you need and it's going to go fast,"" the president said.





Trump has already declared 18 counties in Texas and Louisiana as disaster areas, making them eligible for federal help. Texas Governor Abbott has made a similar designation for 54 counties to speed state aid.



Overall damage from the storm is expected to be in the tens of billions of dollars.



Trump said 8,000 federal workers are on the ground in Texas, including many with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

FEMA chief Brock Long told a Monday news conference the agency is going to be in Texas ""for several years.""



""We're anticipating over 30,000 people being placed in shelters temporarily — to basically stabilize the situation and provide for their care. Next — we are ready — and already deploying life-essential commodities.""



Long said FEMA is bracing for one of the longest periods of housing recovery ever seen.



""While the hurricane-force winds have diminished — I want to stress that we are not out of the woods yet,"" said acting U.S. Homeland Security chief Elaine Duke. ""Not by a long shot. Harvey is still a dangerous and historic storm.""



Duke said rivers in south Texas ""won't crest until later this week.""



Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said, ""The storm is more or less stationary, but to the extent that it's moving, it's actually moving towards the east in our direction and that makes this obviously a dangerous situation for our state.""

83,83,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Adult-onset obesity is triggered by impaired mitochondrial gene expression - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/8/e1700677.full,"Mitochondrial gene expression is essential for energy production; however, an understanding of how it can influence physiology and metabolism is lacking. Several proteins from the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) family are essential for the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, but the functions of the remaining members of this family are poorly understood. We created knockout mice to investigate the role of the PPR domain 1 (PTCD1) protein and show that loss of PTCD1 is embryonic lethal, whereas haploinsufficient, heterozygous mice develop age-induced obesity. The molecular defects and metabolic consequences of mitochondrial protein haploinsufficiency in vivo have not been investigated previously. We show that PTCD1 haploinsufficiency results in increased RNA metabolism, in response to decreased protein synthesis and impaired RNA processing that affect the biogenesis of the respiratory chain, causing mild uncoupling and changes in mitochondrial morphology. We demonstrate that with age, these effects lead to adult-onset obesity that results in liver steatosis and cardiac hypertrophy in response to tissue-specific differential regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. Our findings indicate that changes in mitochondrial gene expression have long-term consequences on energy metabolism, providing evidence that haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 can be a major predisposing factor for the development of metabolic syndrome.

Haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 leads to decreased protein synthesis, affects RNA processing, and results in decreased complex biogenesis, reduced oxygen consumption, and uncoupling of OXPHOS. Reduction of PTCD1 with age causes an accumulation of the short form of OPA1 and decreased membrane potential and consequently affects the morphology of mitochondria and cristae formation. The characterization of the molecular and functional changes as a result of decreased PTCD1 levels with age reveals a novel role for this protein in metabolic dysfunction and age-onset obesity through retrograde tissue-specific mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling via adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK). The heterozygous (Ptcd1 +/− ) mice undergo a metabolic switch with age as a result of lowered energy capacity and alterations in metabolic hormones, growth factors, and proinflammatory cytokines, which causes tissue-specific molecular and pathological changes, leading to late-onset hypertrophy in the heart, hepatic steatosis, and obesity.

Initially, we identified PTCD1 as a mitochondrial matrix protein that regulates mitochondrial gene expression in cells ( 16 ). Knockdown of PTCD1 affected the processing of mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) required for mitochondrial biogenesis and energy production ( 16 ). We also found PTCD1 associated with the mitochondrial RNase Z or ELAC2 protein ( 17 ), further suggesting that it may be involved in mt-RNA processing. To understand the role of PTCD1 in vivo, we created a constitutive knockout of the Ptcd1 gene in mice, enabling us to understand how its loss could affect mitochondrial and cell function. The homozygous knockout of Ptcd1 is embryonic lethal, whereas the heterozygous mice are haploinsufficient for PTCD1 and develop adult-onset obesity, providing a model to investigate in vivo how impaired mitochondrial gene expression leads to the development of metabolic syndrome.

The pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are a family of RNA-binding proteins that has recently attracted considerable interest in the gene expression field because of the sequence-specific recognition of their RNA targets ( 4 , 5 ). The PPR proteins in eukaryotes have versatile regulatory roles in gene expression within organelles ranging from transcription, RNA splicing, processing, editing, and translation ( 6 ). In mammals, there are only seven PPR proteins, all of which are mitochondrial, each with different roles in posttranscriptional regulation of mitochondrial gene expression, including transcription, processing, stability, and translation [reviewed by Rackham and Filipovska ( 7 )]. Although the roles of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) in transcription, the ribonuclease (RNase) P subunit MRPP3 in processing and ribosome assembly, LRPPRC in polyadenylation and translation, and the two small ribosomal subunit proteins PTCD3 and MRPS27 have been investigated previously ( 8 – 14 ), less is known about the PPR domain 1 (PTCD1) and PTCD2 proteins ( 15 , 16 ).

Genetic modifications and environmental signals, including diet, can alter mitochondrial fat and carbohydrate metabolism by causing defects in mitochondrial transcripts or mitochondrial proteins that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and consequently diminished energy production, a major symptom of many inherited diseases ( 3 ). There is a major gap in our understanding about how impaired mitochondrial gene expression can have downstream or retrograde effects on cell signaling and the physiology of different tissues within an organism. Because mitochondrial RNA-binding proteins (mt-RBPs) are nuclear-encoded and crucial for the regulation of mitochondrial RNA (mt-RNA) metabolism, there is a need to investigate how their expression or loss affects both mitochondrial and cellular function in vivo.

Mitochondria provide most of the energy required for life via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), making them essential for cell function. The endosymbiotic origin of these organelles has resulted in their dependence on two genomes for their biogenesis, the nuclear genome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contained within each mitochondrion. mtDNA codes for 13 polypeptides that are members of the OXPHOS system, along with 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), all of which are required for their synthesis. The remaining nuclear-encoded proteins are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes and imported into mitochondria co- or posttranscriptionally. Therefore, the biogenesis of the OXPHOS system and energy production relies on coordinated regulation of mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression. The expression of mtDNA is regulated predominantly at the posttranscriptional level by RNA-binding proteins that are involved in RNA processing, stability, maturation, translation, and degradation [reviewed by Rackham et al. ( 1 ) and Hällberg and Larsson ( 2 )]. An increasing number of mitochondrial proteins have been identified that affect RNA metabolism and protein synthesis; however, their molecular function, effects on antero- and retrograde cell signaling, and physiological consequences of their loss in vivo are still poorly characterized.

RESULTS

PTCD1 is required for balanced mt-RNA metabolism PTCD1 has an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal that localizes it to the matrix and at least eight PPRs that play a role in its association with RNA (16, 18). To understand the in vivo role of PTCD1, we generated a knockout allele of the mouse Ptcd1 gene in embryonic stem (ES) cells (fig. S1A) and subsequent transmission through the germ line to obtain heterozygous Ptcd1+/− animals. Intercrossing Ptcd1+/− mice produced Ptcd1+/− and Ptcd1+/+ mice in Mendelian proportions (genotyped pups, n = 629; Ptcd1+/−, n = 402; and Ptcd1+/+, n = 227); however, the homozygous knockout mice (Ptcd1−/−) were not viable. Analyses of essential proteins involved in mitochondrial gene expression have shown embryonic lethality at embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) (13, 19–23); therefore, we analyzed the embryos at this stage to identify that Ptcd1−/− embryos had not developed normally compared to those observed for Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice, and hence, the loss of PTCD1 was embryonic lethal (fig. S1B). Therefore, we conclude that PTCD1 is essential for embryo development and survival, much like the other three mammalian PPR proteins knocked out in mice to date: POLRMT (11), MRPP3 (12), and LRPPRC (13). The Ptcd1+/− mice develop normally; both male and female mice were fertile and their survival was similar to their wild-type littermates. However, we observed that by 30 weeks of age, the Ptcd1+/− mice appeared obese (Fig. 1A) and were significantly heavier compared to their Ptcd1+/+ littermates (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we analyzed the heterozygous mice for molecular and functional changes in their mitochondria compared to control littermate mice. We used northern blotting to investigate the steady-state levels of mt-RNAs from livers and hearts of Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice. The steady-state levels of the 12S rRNA were significantly increased in both the livers and hearts of Ptcd1+/− mice, as well as levels of specific unprocessed and mature mRNAs, such as RNA19, mt-Nd5/Cytb, mt-Co1, mt-Co2, mt-Nd4l/4, mt-Nd5, and mt-Atp8/6 (Fig. 1C). The remaining levels of mature RNAs either showed an increased trend or were unaffected in the Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls. Exceptions were the mt-Nd6 and 16S rRNA that were significantly decreased in the Ptcd1+/− mice, indicating that the reduction in PTCD1 caused differential effects on mt-RNA metabolism. In addition, we found an overall increase in mt-tRNAs, specifically tRNALeu(UUR), tRNAGln, tRNATrp, and tRNAGlu (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1 Haploinsufficiency of Ptcd1 affects mt-RNA metabolism. (A) Photographic representation of size and weight difference between control (Ptcd1+/+) and heterozygote (Ptcd1+/−) mice at 10 and 30 weeks of age.

The abundance of unprocessed and mature mitochondrial mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs in livers (C) and hearts (D) of 30-week Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice were analyzed by northern blotting;18S rRNA was used as a loading control. The data are representative of results obtained from at least eight mice from each genotype and three independent biological experiments.

(G) mt-RNA junctions were measured in total liver and heart RNA from Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− 30-week-old mice by qRT-PCR and normalized to 18S rRNA. Error bars indicate SEM. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. The effects of PTCD1 reduction in heart mitochondria of the Ptcd1+/− mice followed a similar trend to those found in liver mitochondria, but the magnitude of changes was less pronounced (Fig. 1D). In the heart, the 12S rRNA, RNA19, mt-Co2, mt-Nd1, mt-Nd2, and mt-Nd4l/4 were also significantly increased, and most of the other tRNAs and mt-mRNAs showed an increased trend in the Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 1D), as observed in the livers of heterozygous mice. These data indicate that haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 causes an increase in mt-RNA transcription and imbalanced mt-RNA metabolism. In our previous work, we showed that PTCD1 affects mt-RNA processing in cells grown in high glucose, leading to accumulation of the RNA19 that includes the 16S rRNA, tRNALeu(UUR), and mt-Nd1 region (17). Therefore, to investigate global effects of PTCD1 reduction in vivo across the entire mitochondrial transcriptome, we used an established RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) method (12), where changes in rarer transcripts, such as precursors and partially processed transcripts, can be reliably identified at greater depth. Here, we applied the same method by making libraries from hearts and livers of three Ptcd1+/+ and three Ptcd1+/− mice, where we captured longer reads across the entire mitochondrial transcriptome and excluded short RNAs, such as tRNAs, to analyze the sites most affected by PTCD1 reduction (figs. S2 and S3). We confirm the results from our northern blots that the mature mRNAs, as well as precursors such as the RNA19 region, were increased in the Ptcd1+/− mice. The effects were more pronounced in the livers of these mice compared to hearts, despite the higher mt-RNA content in the heart, where it accounts for ~30% of total RNA (24). In addition, we observed increased accumulation of precursor transcripts that span specific tRNA coding regions (figs. S2 and S3). Upon closer inspection, we identified that the accumulation was particularly skewed toward the 3′ end in both heart and liver mitochondrial transcriptomes, suggesting that PTCD1 affects these processing sites preferentially. This is particularly evident in the regions spanning tRNATrp and tRNALeu(UUR) (Fig. 1, E and F). We used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate the processing events across these junctions and confirmed that they were significantly enriched in the Ptcd1 heterozygous mice compared to controls (Fig. 1G), further indicating that there is increased RNA transcription and accumulation of precursor transcripts as a consequence of PTCD1 reduction.

Reduction of PTCD1 decreases de novo protein synthesis of mitochondria-encoded proteins and the stability of large ribosomal proteins Immunoblotting of mitochondrial proteins from livers and hearts of aged Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice showed that the heterozygous mice had ~50% lower levels of the PTCD1 protein compared to controls, indicating that haploinsufficiency underlies the molecular defects observed in these mice and this is consistent in liver and heart mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, we investigated the effects of PTCD1 haploinsufficiency on mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS polypeptides by immunoblotting in both liver (Fig. 2C) and heart mitochondria (Fig. 2D) and found no significant differences in their steady-state levels between the Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice, with the exception of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COXI), which was reduced in the livers of the heterozygous mice. Next, we analyzed the effects of PTCD1 reduction on mitochondrial proteins that regulate gene expression and RNA processing (Fig. 2, E and F). Although there were no differences in the levels of TFAM and the RNase P proteins MRPP1 and MRPP2, we found a significant reduction in the levels of the mitochondrial RNase Z enzyme (ELAC2), which is responsible for cleavage of tRNAs at their 3′ ends, in liver and heart mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 2, E and F). This further implicates PTCD1 in RNA maturation within mitochondria. Fig. 2 PTCD1 reduction causes reduced mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mitochondrial proteins (25 μg) from liver and heart mitochondria from 30-week-old Ptcd1+/+ and three Ptcd1+/− mice were resolved on 4 to 20% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted against antibodies to investigate the steady-state levels of nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) was used as a loading control. PTCD1 levels are decreased by ~50% in liver (A) and heart (B) mitochondria, indicating its haploinsufficiency. Immunoblots of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded OXPHOS proteins in liver (C) and heart (D) mitochondria. Immunoblots of nuclear-encoded mtDNA- and RNA-binding proteins in liver (E) and heart (F) mitochondria.

Relative abundance of proteins was measured using ImageJ software normalized to the loading control. Error bars indicate SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student’s t test. The data are representative of results obtained from at least six mice from each genotype and three independent biological experiments. De novo protein synthesis in liver (I) and heart (J) from Ptcd1+/+ and three Ptcd1+/− mice was measured by pulse incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine. Equal amounts of mitochondrial protein (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Representative gels from three independent biological experiments are shown. All studies in this figure were performed in 30-week-old mice. We have shown previously that impaired mt-RNA processing can affect the stability of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (12, 17); therefore, we investigated whether decrease in PTCD1 affects their stability. Immunoblotting revealed that only the levels of the large ribosomal subunit proteins MRPL37 and MRPL44 were reduced significantly in the liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice, but not in the small ribosomal subunit proteins MRPS16, MRPS34, and MRPS35 that were analyzed (Fig. 2G). The levels of the mitoribosomal proteins from both the small and large subunits were not different in heart mitochondria from Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 2H), indicating that mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in the liver are more affected by the reduction of PTCD1 compared to the heart. Next, we investigated mitochondrial protein synthesis by de novo labeling to determine whether reduction in PTCD1 affects the rate of translation of the newly produced polypeptides. We found decreased translation of most polypeptides in liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 2I). The effects on protein synthesis in heart mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice were subtle, albeit consistent with the more modest changes observed in heart mitochondria by immunoblotting and northern blotting (Fig. 2J). In older, 40-week-old mice, we observed decreased protein synthesis in both liver and heart mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice (fig. S4, A and B), indicating that the molecular changes in the heart are more apparent with age, reflecting the higher mt-RNA content in the heart (24). These changes are consistent at the steady-state protein level, where immunoblotting for the OXPHOS complexes and the mitochondrially encoded COXII and COXIII subunits show significant decreases in both liver and heart mitochondria from 40-week-old Ptcd1+/− mice (fig. S4, C and D), although the effects are still more pronounced in the liver, suggesting that the liver is more affected by the reduction of PTCD1 compared to the heart. We conclude that despite the increased levels of mature mt-RNAs, the allelic loss of PTCD1 results in decreased de novo translation, suggesting that increased transcription may be a compensatory response to decreased protein synthesis.

PTCD1 is important for mitochondrial respiratory complex biogenesis and function We measured oxygen consumption in liver and heart mitochondria to determine whether mitochondrial respiratory function was affected when PTCD1 levels were reduced. Mitochondrial state 3 and state 4 respiration using glutamate/malate or succinate as the substrates were significantly decreased in the liver (Fig. 3A) but not heart (Fig. 3B) mitochondria from 30-week-old Ptcd1+/− mice. Similarly, the maximum capacity of the respiratory chain, which was measured in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), was also significantly decreased in liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3A). We also investigated the effects of PTCD1 reduction on mitochondrial respiration in 40-week-old mice and show that in these older mice OXPHOS function is decreased in both the livers and hearts of Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (fig. S4, E and F). The effects of PTCD1 reduction on OXPHOS capacity are more apparent with aging, as 10-week-old mice have normal OXPHOS function (fig. S5, A and B). These findings indicate that mitochondrial function in the liver is affected before the heart, further indicating that the excess mt-RNA in the heart may compensate and protect its function when mitochondrial gene expression is compromised. Fig. 3 Reduction of PTCD1 affects the biogenesis of the respiratory chain, causing mild uncoupling and changes in mitochondrial morphology. Phosphorylating (state 3) and uncoupled respiration in the presence of up to 3 μM FCCP was measured in liver (A) and heart (B) mitochondria from four 30-week-old Ptcd1+/+ and four Ptcd1+/− mice using an OROBOROS oxygen electrode using either pyruvate, glutamate, and malate or succinate as substrates in the presence of inhibitors. Isolated liver (C) and heart (D) mitochondria (75 μg) from 30-week-old mice were treated with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and resolved on 4 to 16% BN-PAGE gel. Immunoblotting with the blue native OXPHOS cocktail antibody was used to visualize respiratory complexes. Error bars indicate SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, Student’s t test. In-gel activity stains were used for complex V in liver (E) and heart (F) mitochondria. Steady-state levels of OPA1 and OMA-1 in liver (G) and heart (H) mitochondria from at least eight Ptcd1+/+ and eight Ptcd1+/− mice were measured by immunoblotting using SDHA as a loading control. Error bars indicate SEM. **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student’s t test. Mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure in Ptcd1+/+ and four Ptcd1+/− livers (I) and hearts (J) were determined using TEM. The data are representative of results obtained from at least three mice from each genotype. Scale bars, 0.25 μm (bottom panels) and 1 μm (top panels).

SDHA was used as a loading control. Error bars indicate SEM. ***P < 0.001, Student’s t test. Because mitochondrial respiration was affected in the Ptcd1+/− mice, we analyzed the levels of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). We observed a noticeable reduction of the respiratory complex V in the liver of Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls, and a slight decrease in complexes I and III, but very mild changes in Ptcd1+/− heart mitochondria (Fig. 3, C and D). We further quantified the changes following BN-PAGE and immunoblotting of each complex to confirm that the levels of complex V were significantly reduced by ~20% in liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls, and there was a slight decrease in complex III (Fig. 3C); however, the levels of respiratory complexes were not significantly changed in heart mitochondria between heterozygote and wild-type mice (Fig. 3D). To investigate the assembly and activity of complex V, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, we used BN-PAGE followed by in-gel activity staining (Fig. 3, E and F). There was a noticeable reduction in adenosine triphosphatase activity, a decrease in the monomeric form of the ATP synthase, and significant reduction in the dimer and F1 subcomplexes of the ATP synthase in liver mitochondria from the Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3E). In contrast, there were no differences in the activity or levels of the ATP synthase in heart mitochondria from the Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 3F). These findings are consistent with our measurements of the ATP/ADP (adenosine diphosphate) ratio for both young and adult Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice (fig. S4, E and H), where we observe a significant decrease of ~50% of ATP levels in the livers from old Ptcd1+/− mice (fig. S4G), consistent with decreased OXPHOS function and mitochondrial uncoupling and reduced complex V activity and levels. Our findings indicate that haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 and decreased protein synthesis in mitochondria can have tissue-specific downstream consequences on the stability and function of the OXPHOS system.

Heterozygous Ptcd1 mice have remodeled cristae and altered mitochondrial morphology The dynamin-like guanosine triphosphatase OPA1 mediates mitochondrial fusion and fission and regulates mitochondrial cristae morphology (25). The processing of OPA1 by the OMA-1 and YME1L peptidases is crucial for normal mitochondrial morphology by balancing the distribution of the long isoforms of OPA1 (L-OPA1) and short isoforms of OPA1 (S-OPA1) that are important to maintain fusion and fission, respectively [reviewed by MacVicar and Langer (26)]. Recently, OPA1 and cristae remodeling have been implicated in the assembly and stability of the respiratory complexes as well as their function (27, 28). Because we found that mitochondria of the Ptcd1+/− mice were mildly uncoupled and that this uncoupling affected the respiratory complexes, we investigated whether the processing of OPA1 and its processing peptidase OMA-1 was also affected. In liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice, we found decreased L-OPA1 levels and markedly increased S-OPA1 abundance (Fig. 3G), whereas the levels of the short and long isoforms of OPA1 were not changed between heart mitochondria from Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 3H). Furthermore, the metalloproteinase OMA-1 is increased in liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− mice but not in heart mitochondria from these mice compared to their respective controls (Fig. 3, G and H). The mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in liver mitochondria from Ptcd1+/− 30-week-old mice compared to controls and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (fig. S6, A and B), consistent with the respiration measurements. Furthermore, we observed a more fragmented appearance of mitochondria in the Ptcd1+/− MEFs compared to controls, particularly when they were grown in low glucose or galactose (fig. S6C). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to investigate how decreased membrane potential and increased levels of S-OPA1 affect mitochondrial morphology in livers compared to hearts from Ptcd1+/− mice and their respective controls from Ptcd1+/+ mice (Fig. 3, I and J). In the livers of Ptcd1+/− mice, we observed mitochondria with fewer cristae compared to control mice (Fig. 3I). In the hearts of Ptcd1+/− mice, the morphology of mitochondria was less affected than in the liver, although there was a higher number of surrounding smaller mitochondria and the muscle fibers had less dense z lines (Fig. 3J). Most of the heart mitochondria had hollow parts that lacked cristae, although this was not as apparent as in the livers of Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 3, I and J, lower panels). Because we observed morphological changes in mitochondria and their cristae, we next analyzed whether the abundance of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) components was affected in the Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3, K and L). We immunoblotted for MICOS components that were associated with the inner membrane, such as APOO and APOOL, because we have found PTCD1 localized in the matrix as well as the inner mitochondrial membrane (16). The levels of these proteins were not changed in liver or heart mitochondria between Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice. However, the level of the MICOS protein CHCHD3, previously identified to interact with OPA1 (29), was increased significantly in liver mitochondria from the Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 3K) or heart mitochondria from both genotypes (Fig. 3L). Together, these data indicate that mild uncoupling of mitochondria affects their morphology and cristae as well as the MICOS components closely associated with OPA1 and shift the balance of the short and long isoform of OPA1. Haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 over time cannot be compensated by an increase in CHCHD3 in an attempt to overcome morphological changes induced by uncoupling and accumulation of S-OPA1.

Adult-onset heart hypertrophy and liver steatosis in heterozygous Ptcd1+/− mice Previously, we found that complete knockout of the endonuclease component of the mitochondrial RNase P complex, MRPP3, responsible for 5′ end tRNA processing, in the heart resulted in a severe cardiomyopathy followed by premature death at 11 weeks (12). Although the Ptcd1+/− mice do not die at such an early age, the haploinsufficiency of PTCD1 alone causes defects in RNA metabolism/protein synthesis that are sufficient with age to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and significant weight gain (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we analyzed liver and heart function of Ptcd1+/− mice compared to Ptcd1+/+ mice to investigate how decreased protein synthesis, OXPHOS uncoupling, and altered mitochondrial morphology can exacerbate dysfunction and lead to pathology. Oil red O staining of liver sections revealed extensive accumulation of small lipid droplets in the Ptcd1+/− mice, causing pronounced fibrosis with age (Fig. 4, A and B). The livers of the adult Ptcd1+/− mice are chronically injured, with a greater number of oval-shaped liver progenitor cells observed (Fig. 4A). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the liver further confirms that binucleated hepatocytes represent the major dividing cell type in the regenerating liver of Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 4B). We also observed an increase in the number of hepatic blood vessels, which may be a compensatory effect in an effort to increase blood flow to the damaged liver. Together, these results indicate that Ptcd1+/− mice have hepatic steatosis. Fig. 4 Ptcd1+/− mice develop liver steatosis and cardiac hypertrophy. (A) Liver sections cut to 5- or 10-μm thickness were stained with H&E or Oil red O and hematoxylin, respectively, from 30-week-old Ptcd1+/+ (n = 6) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 6) mice. (B) Quantitative measurement of Oil red O staining using ImageJ. Values are means ± SEM. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. (C) ECG parameters for Ptcd1+/+ (n = 5) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 5) 40-week-old mice.

Enlarged hearts were determined as a measure of heart weight relative to tibia length; *P < 0.05 compared with Ptcd1+/+, Student’s t test. Photographic representation of size difference between Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− hearts in adult mice. Impaired 3′ end tRNA processing has been shown to cause cardiomyopathy in patients with mutations in ELAC2 (30); therefore, echocardiography (ECG) was performed on the aged Ptcd1+/− and Ptcd1+/+ mice. Ptcd1+/− mice had altered cardiac function consistent with the development of cardiac hypertrophy, including a significant increase in the left ventricular posterior wall in systole and intraventricular septum in diastole (thicker walls), a significant decrease in the left ventricular end systolic diameter (narrowing chamber), and an increase in fractional shortening, which demonstrates a hypercontractile heart (Fig. 4C). H&E staining of the aged hearts of Ptcd1+/− mice revealed enlarged nuclei, which are more sparsely dispersed within the heart tissue and consistent with the enlarged size of the hearts, indicative of hypertrophy in the heart (Fig. 4D). These results suggest that a reduction of PTCD1 has pathological consequences for both the liver and heart with aging, although more severe molecular changes are identified in the livers of heterozygous mice.

Adult-onset obesity in Ptcd1+/− mice leads to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance To investigate the metabolic consequences of PTCD1 haploinsufficiency, we monitored the weight of Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice from 5 to 30 weeks of age. During this time, we kept a record of their weight gain and food intake, by measuring the input and output of food each week. Ptcd1+/− mice did not display different eating habits, appetites, or intake of food relative to Ptcd1+/+ mice between the ages of 5 and 30 weeks. Between the ages of 5 and 15 weeks, there was no significant difference in weight between Ptcd1+/− mice and their wild-type littermates (Fig. 5A). From 15 weeks, the Ptcd1+/− mice were starting to show a significant increase in weight compared to controls, and by 30 weeks of age, Ptcd1+/− mice were significantly heavier, by approximately 5 g, compared to Ptcd1+/+ mice (Fig. 5A). Measurement of intra-abdominal epididymal pad weights showed greater visceral lipid deposition in adult Ptcd1+/− mice than Ptcd1+/+ mice, no differences in lipid deposition between Ptcd1+/− and Ptcd1+/+ 10-week-old mice (Fig. 5B). Fig. 5 Reduction of PTCD1 causes adult-onset obesity and insulin resistance. (A) Percentage increase of weight gain from 5 to 30 weeks of age between Ptcd1+/+ (n = 12) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 12) mice. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, Student’s t test.

(E) Insulin sensitivity in 11- and 16-week-old Ptcd1+/+ (n = 12) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 12) mice (young mice). Quantitative values are the area under the curve (AUC) ± SEM. *P < 0.05, Student’s t test. (F) Insulin sensitivity in 30-week-old Ptcd1+/+ (n = 12) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 12) mice. Quantitative values are the AUC ± SEM. **P < 0.01, Student’s t test. Glucose tolerance testing (GTT) of Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD) showed that the Ptcd1+/− mice were glucose-intolerant at 15 and 30 weeks of age (Fig. 5, C and D). Insulin tolerance testing (ITT) revealed that early in life, at 11 weeks, the Ptcd1+/− mice are slightly insulin-sensitive; however, by 16 weeks of age, there was no difference in insulin sensitivity between Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 5E). Subsequently, by 30 weeks of age, the Ptcd1+/− mice had developed insulin resistance compared to their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5, E and F), consistent with their weight gain and glucose intolerance at this age. This shows that, with age, Ptcd1+/− mice have decreased glucose tolerance and increased insulin resistance compared to their control littermates, indicating that decreased protein synthesis with age impairs mitochondrial function and membrane morphology that leads to a metabolic switch, causing weight gain and consequent metabolic desensitization to insulin.

Reduction of PTCD1 causes early-onset hormonal changes that contribute to the development of disease in response to mitochondrial dysfunction Alterations in the levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, insulin, leptin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) have all been linked to the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome (31). Therefore, we investigated the levels of hormones and growth factors involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, and the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) in serum isolated from 10- to 30-week-old Ptcd1+/− and Ptcd1+/+ mice fed an NCD. In 10-week-old mice, the levels of insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, and IL-6 were not statistically different between the Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice, whereas leptin and FGF-21 were both significantly elevated in the Ptcd1+/− mice (Fig. 6A). In contrast, we found significantly increased levels of triglycerides, IL-6, leptin, and FGF-21 in the 30-week-old Ptcd1+/− mice compared to the Ptcd1+/+ mice (Fig. 6B). The increases in triglycerides and leptin are consistent with significant weight gain, and the elevated FGF-21 is consistent with cardiac dysfunction, as has been observed previously in other models of heart disease, which has led to its use as a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction (32, 33). Increased IL-6 levels are consistent with liver injury in the Ptcd1+/− mice involving mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic syndrome. Increases in phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), in response to profoundly elevated IL-6, were identified in the livers of 10- and 30-week-old Ptcd1+/− mice compared to Ptcd1+/+ mice (Fig. 6C). Similarly, increased SAPK/JNK phosphorylation was found in the hearts of 10- and 30-week-old Ptcd1+/− mice compared to controls (Fig. 6D), indicating activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in the development of both hepatic steatosis and cardiac hypertrophy. Fig. 6 Metabolic hormones, growth factors, and proinflammatory cytokines increase with age in the Ptcd1+/− mice. (A) Insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, IL-6, leptin, and FGF-21 levels were measured in serum obtained from 10-week-old Ptcd1+/+ (n = 6) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 6) mice. (B) Insulin, triglycerides, cholesterol, IL-6, leptin, and FGF-21 levels were measured in serum obtained from 30-week-old Ptcd1+/+ (n = 6) and Ptcd1+/− (n = 6) mice. Endogenous levels of the SAPK/JNK and its phosphorylated form (Thr183/Tyr185) were determined by immunoblotting of whole liver and heart lysates from 10-week-old (C) or 30-week-old (D) Ptcd1+/+ and Ptcd1+/− mice.

The sixth population census in Pakistan, finally carried out by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) earlier this year after a gap of nearly two decades, reveals an acceleration in the population growth rate of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), even as growth in Punjab and Sindh has slowed compared to previous results.

Pakistan houses 106.45m males, 101.31m females and 10,418 transgenders, the provisional data reveals.

The results show that 30.5m people reside in KP, 5m in Fata, 47.9m in Sindh, 12.3m in Balochistan, 2m in Islamabad, while Punjab — the largest province in terms of population — houses 110 million people.

An increase in the urban-rural ratio has been observed in all administrative units except Islamabad, which nonetheless remains the second most urbanised unit of the country.

Over 52pc of Sindh's residents live in urban areas, which has surpassed the capital territory as the most urbanised territory of Pakistan. Close to 36.4pc of Pakistanis live in urban areas, the provisional results reveal.

Balochistan, the least urbanised of Pakistan's provinces, has experienced the fastest average annual growth rate since 1998 of 3.37pc. Punjab's average annual growth rate remained the slowest at 2.13pc, slightly below the national average of 2.4pc.

The provisional results exclude data from Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which is likely to be included in the final report.

The census is likely to have important implications for the upcoming general elections, as constituencies are expected to have to be redrawn according to the newly-compiled results.","Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2017/08/59a019360ef23.jpg,"['data', 'population', 'census', 'pakistans', 'growth', 'provisional', 'urbanised', 'results', '2078m', 'average', 'pakistan', 'ballooned', 'rate']", ,none

City officials said they had rescued 2,000 people, but still had another 185 ""critical rescue requests"" to handle.

""The goal is rescue,"" said Mayor Sylvester Turner. ""Our focus is getting people out of the stressful situation they're in."" He said 5,500 people have been moved to shelters.

Forecasters expected the storm that came ashore as Hurricane Harvey on Friday night to drop as much as 25 centimeters of new rainfall around Houston and that another 40 to 60 centimeters could fall through Wednesday. The region has already seen more than 60 centimeters of rain in some places.

“While the hurricane-force winds have diminished — I want to stress that we are not out of the woods yet,"" said acting U.S. Homeland Security chief Elaine Duke. ""Not by a long shot. Harvey is still a dangerous and historic storm.""

Duke said rivers in south Texas ""won't crest until later this week.""

WATCH: Duke on possible danger ahead

Federal Emergency Management Administrator Brock Long told a Monday news conference that FEMA is going to be in Texas ""for several years.""

""We're anticipating over 30,000 people being placed in shelters temporarily — to basically stabilize the situation and provide for their care. Next — we are ready — and already deploying life-essential commodities.""

Long said FEMA is bracing for one of the longest periods of housing recovery ever seen.

Coast Guard Commandant Paul Zukunft said rescue workers are checking Google maps ""to see where calls are coming from. We want to save lives.""

Texas Governor Greg Abbott told reporters he has deployed the entire Texas National Guard — a total of 15,000 men and women.

Abbott heaped praise on local leaders along the Texas Gulf coast, calling them ""humane, courageous, and heroic."" He said the way people got through the storm and that so many lives were saved is ""remarkable.""

Trump plans Tuesday visit

President Donald Trump plans to visit Texas Tuesday. He has already declared 18 Texas counties and parts of neighboring Louisiana a disaster area, making them eligible for federal help. Abbott declared 54 counties as disaster areas, making them eligible for state aid.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said, ""The storm is more or less stationary, but to the extent that it's moving, it's actually moving towards the east in our direction and that makes this, obviously, a dangerous situation for our state.""

U.S. Weather Prediction Center lead forecaster Patrick Burke told VOA, ""The message we've been getting out today is that we've never seen a storm like this. We've never seen these rainfall amounts over such a large area, and so the damage is already catastrophic and unfortunately is going to continue to be catastrophic for days to come.""

The National Weather Service said the center of the storm was drifting slowly to the southeast early Monday on a path that would take it back out into the Gulf of Mexico sometime Monday and allow for it to possibly strengthen slightly before making landfall again Tuesday.

With the storm bringing band after band of heavy rain over the region, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced early Monday it was beginning the controlled release of water from two reservoirs in order to help prevent them from failing and to reduce the risk of further flooding. The releases will continue for weeks.

Rescue operations

Hundreds of rescue operations have taken place throughout the area with crews in helicopters and boats, and wading through floodwaters on foot. Volunteers have joined police, fire and medical crews, as well as the National Guard.

In Photos: Houston rescue effort

Every major highway into and out of Houston has become a river, and the city's two airports are closed. So far, two deaths have been blamed on the storm.

Since the storm's path was predicted in great detail well before it hit Texas, questions are beginning to be raised about why no mass evacuation was ordered.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said it was not possible to overcome logistical obstacles to a large-scale evacuation. He defended his actions at a news conference late Sunday, saying it would have been ""crazy"" to attempt a mass movement of millions of people on such short notice.

Advice from emergency officials



Turner asked where the 6 million residents of Houston and its suburbs could have gone, since the city is by far the biggest population center in that part of Texas. The mayor said his decision not to order an evacuation was smart and in the best interest of Houstonians.

For those stranded in flooded parts of the city, emergency officials said no one should seek refuge in the attics of their homes, due to a risk that water rising to record levels would trap them in an enclosed area. The advice to all was simple: Climb onto the roof and try to attract attention by waving a white cloth.

Aircraft continue to be in the skies over Houston and surrounding areas, searching for people marooned atop their homes. Hundreds of boats are searching for flood victims. Some people managed to escape the flooded areas by kayak, canoe or inflatable rafts.

People who thought they might be able to walk to safely through water waist- or chest-deep in their neighborhoods were warned to resist the urge to test strong currents.

Several Houston-area oil refineries shut down on Sunday as the storm continued. The closures take roughly 12 percent of U.S. fuel-making capacity offline, compounding concerns about fuel shortages and higher gasoline prices.

Harvey was the strongest hurricane to hit the United States mainland in more than a decade.

Variety, the industry magazine for Hollywood, first reported his death. Hooper died in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks, but the cause of death was not immediately known.

William Tobe Hooper, who was born in Austin, Texas, was a college professor and documentary producer before branching out into the horror genre in the 1970s.

A still shot from the 1982 horror film Poltergeist

The ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" was one of the most influential horror films ever made. Shot for less than $300,000 in 1974, the film grossed more than $30 million. The film was banned in several countries due to its extreme violence.

Eight years later, in 1982, Hooper directed ""Poltergeist,"" which was written and produced by Steven Spielberg. That film cost nearly $11 million to make. It was a huge box office success, although there are conflicting accounts about how much it made: $76 million is the more conservative report, while another account said it made more than $120 million.

In 1986 Hooper directed a sequel ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,"" which took a more lighthearted approach.

Hooper is survived by one son, according a correction made by the magazine Variety.

Luca Rossi tried to hang himself in a bedroom in Perugia, Italy, in 2012. Suspended by his belt from a wardrobe, he had begun to choke when his fiancée unexpectedly walked in. He struggled to safety, defeated even in this intended last act.

The 35-year-old physician had everything to live for: a medical career, plans for a family, and supportive parents. But Rossi* was addicted to crack cocaine. He had begun his habit not long after medical school, confidently assuming that he could control the drug. Now, it owned him. Once ebullient and passionate, he no longer smiled or cried. He knew he might be endangering his patients, but even that didn’t matter. He was indifferent to all except obtaining his next fix. “It pushes you to suicide because it fills you with your own emptiness,” he says. In the first months after his near suicide, Rossi didn’t drop his $3500-a-month habit. Early in 2013, he learned that his fiancée was pregnant. Frightened by impending fatherhood, he smoked even more. He didn’t—couldn’t—stop.

Then, in April 2013, Rossi’s father, a chemist, happened upon a local newspaper article describing work just published in Nature . Neuroscientists led by Antonello Bonci and Billy Chen at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) in Baltimore, Maryland, had studied rats trained to seek cocaine compulsively—animals so powerfully addicted that they tolerated repeated electric shocks to their feet to get their fixes. The rats had also been genetically engineered so that their neurons could be controlled with light. When the researchers stimulated the animals’ brains in an area that regulates impulse control, the rats essentially kicked their habit. “They would almost instantaneously stop searching for cocaine,” Bonci says.

He and his Nature co-authors suggested that targeted stimulation of the analogous region in the human brain—an area in the prefrontal cortex, which sits behind the forehead—could help compulsive cocaine users. In that Italian newspaper article, Bonci explained that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive method of triggering neural activity, might do the job.

Rossi’s father began a frenetic quest for help that led him to Luigi Gallimberti, a prominent Italian addiction physician who runs the private Villa Maria Clinic in Padua. Father and son presented themselves there, and the father handed Gallimberti the article. “My son is a cocaine addict,” he said. “Can you help him?”

In the years since Rossi visited that Italian clinic, TMS has attracted interest among a small cadre of researchers and physicians who are using it to target cocaine addiction, even as skeptics raise their eyebrows. After an initial study of 32 people hooked on the drug yielded encouraging results, Gallimberti began offering the treatment in his clinic; he and his colleagues have now treated more than 300 addicted people.

More rigorous tests of TMS’s ability to blunt the drug’s grip are now underway. Last year, a group led by neurobiologist Colleen Hanlon at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston launched the first randomized, double-blind trial of the method as a therapy for cocaine addiction. In May of this year, scientists at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City launched another. And in Baltimore, NIDA investigators are completing a pilot study in cocaine users to prepare for launching a large, controlled trial next year.

TMS isn’t new to medicine; it is already an approved therapy for depression. But in applying the treatment to drug addiction, investigators are moving into new territory. Although using TMS in depression has provided leads, no one knows for certain how best to apply it to cocaine-addicted brains—and the answers may vary among patients. “There is so much that we don’t know about TMS that I won’t be surprised if the current therapeutic trials don’t work,” says Michael Fox, a physician and brain network imaging expert at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who uses TMS to treat depressed patients. Fox nonetheless believes that “there’s a huge amount of promise” in deploying TMS to fight addiction.

Hanlon and others agree. “Basic science research in drug abuse in the last 3 to 5 years has told us, ‘Look, there is a potential for a treatment here,’” she says. And for the roughly 1 million addicted to cocaine in the United States and for another 13 million users worldwide, the need for a therapy is acute. Of the major addictions—nicotine, alcohol, and, most prominently of late, heroin and synthetic opioids—cocaine alone lacks a treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is a wicked habit to shake without help: The 1-year relapse rate in people trying to quit hovers at about 80%.

“Imagine that this does become the first approved neurobiological treatment for cocaine addiction. It’s a big deal, a game-changing therapy,” Bonci says. (In a NIDA-approved use of personal time, Bonci, a neurologist, began consulting on cases at the Padua clinic in January 2016. He and Gallimberti entered into a financial partnership that month and will open a clinic for people addicted to cocaine in Milan.)

Anthony Barker, a medical physicist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, introduced TMS in 1985 as a lab tool for probing human neurophysiology. By holding an electromagnetic coil near the scalp, above the motor cortex, and running a brief, strong, pulse of current through it, Barker and his colleagues elicited involuntary hand and leg movements. They surmised that the rapid, time-varying magnetic field generated by the coil’s current induced currents in the cortex, the brain’s outer layer, prompting neurons to fire.

At first, researchers used TMS to study how the motor cortex controls muscles and later to examine how the visual cortex works in blind people. In the 1990s, researchers began to experiment with using repetitive TMS (rTMS), which delivers sustained, closely spaced pulses, to treat several diseases. They had learned that low-frequency stimulation, at one pulse per second (1 hertz), made neurons less excitable, whereas high-frequency pulses, at 5 to 20 hertz, made the cells more prone to fire. Depressed people, they found, responded to high-frequency rTMS, presumably because it boosted the activity of sluggish neurons. By contrast, low-frequency TMS seemed to tamp down the auditory hallucinations that can plague schizophrenics.

Researchers also tried rTMS in people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, tinnitus, and chronic pain. Since 2009, they have been testing it against other addictions, primarily to nicotine and alcohol. More recently, prompted by the opioid epidemic, several groups including Hanlon’s have begun evaluating TMS as a tool to decrease pain among those at high risk for that addiction.

In 2008, the United States approved rTMS for attacking treatment-resistant depression, its only approved clinical use to date. Regulators in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere also have approved it for that purpose. But skeptics say that the supporting data are weak and that companies that make rTMS devices—more than 700 machines are in use in the United States alone—are hyping the benefits. “I have colleagues who I respect and who I think are honest who swear by it—who think it works. I don’t,” says Walter Brown, a psychiatrist at Brown University who studies the placebo effect, which he thinks may explain most of rTMS’s success with depression.

He is also skeptical that TMS can battle drug abuse. “I have no doubt that some people with cocaine addiction treated with TMS will get better. But it won’t be the effect of the treatment, in my opinion.”

Hot and cold

One morning this May, in a windowless room on NIDA’s Baltimore campus, Donald Baker, an unemployed 45-year-old with a weathered, unsmiling face and an open-necked shirt that reveals a fresh sunburn, is completing a computer questionnaire. “I am thinking of ways to get cocaine,” the survey prompts. The scaled answers run from 1 to 7, with 7 being “strongly agree.” Baker clicks 4. “If there was cocaine right in front of me it would be hard not to use it.” Another 4. “I would not be able to control how much I used.” That gets a 5.

Baker is the second subject enrolled in a pilot study that postdoctoral student Vaughn Steele is runnning in the lab of Elliot Stein, a neuroscientist at NIDA. The pilot marks the launch of its in-house effort to evaluate rTMS as a treatment for addiction. Steele is aiming for a real-world therapy. “It’s designed for somebody to come in off the street and say, ‘I need some kind of treatment; what can you give me?’ And then we can do TMS that day,” he says.

Baker has just returned from a 2-day, midtrial break. The phase I trial is meant to establish the treatment’s safety and tolerability in cocaine users, not determine whether it dulls the desire for the drug. Indeed, this morning, Baker tells Steele that he used while he was away—which a test of his urine confirms. Still, Baker reports a small victory over his demon. During his break, he earned $150 trimming bushes for his uncle—and today $120 is still in his pocket. “I smoked $30 worth and I asked myself what I was doing. I’ve never done that in 25 years. When I smoke, I can’t stop. But I did on Sunday.”

Baker has lost a marriage, a house, and too many jobs to count during his quarter-century of drug use. He has no car, no regular work, and no contact with his three adult children. Although he understands that this study isn’t designed to show efficacy, he still hopes the treatment will help him get clean—not least because he has a new love whom he wants to marry.

In a room down the hall, Baker settles into a big cushioned armchair. He puts his head in a chin rest. On a tight cap, researchers have marked the cortical structures to target. High on the left side of the skull, not far behind the hairline, is the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key part of the brain’s “cold” circuit, which overrides impulses and is often called the executive control network. Because the DLPFC is known to connect extensively to deeper brain areas that imaging studies have shown to be underactive in people addicted to cocaine, the trial aims to stimulate the region. The researchers are using a form of rTMS called intermittent theta burst stimulation, in which pulses are delivered in bursts, like machine-gun fire. (Theta refers to the frequency used.) The regimen consists of 3-minute sessions, three times a day, for 10 days.

It’s 3 minutes of pain to get rid of a lifetime of misery. Donald Baker, trial participant

rTMS is loud—the electromagnetic force behind each pulse generates an audible clicking sound—but has a strong track record of safety. That doesn’t mean it’s pleasant. The pulses cause the scalp muscle under the coil to contract; for about one-third of subjects, that tips into pain. “If someone snaps a rubber band at you, you want it to stop,” Stein says. “Your brain doesn’t feel pain, but your scalp and skull do.” Beyond that immediate discomfort, transient headaches are the only commonly reported side effect, occurring in about half of people. Rarely, subjects have had seizures during treatment.

If the 10 pilot subjects tolerate the treatment well and no safety issues arise—seizures are the primary concern—Steele’s group will launch a double-blind phase II trial with 60 cocaine users. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either the actual treatment or a sham therapy. To keep both participants and investigators unaware of the treatment given, the coil looks identical on both sides but one side replicates the sound and feel of rTMS without inducing magnetic fields. (The researchers receive a randomized code telling them which side to use.) As well as gauging whether the treatment helps the cocaine users become and stay clean, the team plans to use functional MRI to probe whether rTMS strengthens the activity of the cold, executive control circuit.

Today, Baker, now halfway through his 10-day treatment, is the center of attention. Betty Jo Salmeron, a NIDA physician administering the stimulation, holds the heavy, figure 8–shaped coil close to his scalp. Her eyes are glued to a display that tracks the coil’s position in relation to a red dot that marks the target, the DLPFC.

“You all set to go?” Steele asks Baker. “Yup.”

“It’s 10:02,” Salmeron says. “Start.”

The room goes silent but for the intermittent bursts of loud clicks. Baker focuses on a screen displaying a train of craving-prompting images of the drug and of wads of cash that would let him buy it. Meanwhile, the coil delivers 600 pulses in 50-hertz bursts—2 seconds on, 10 seconds off—in the course of about 3 minutes. One minute passes; then 2.

Baker’s eyes draw into a tighter and tighter squint. He begins blinking nonstop. His mouth becomes a straight, pursed line. Then it is over. “It’s 3 minutes of pain to try to get rid of a lifetime of misery.” he says.

Defining the parameters for effective rTMS—how many pulses to deliver, at what frequency, for how long, and to which part of the brain—remains a fundamental challenge for researchers seeking to deploy it against cocaine and other addictions. Most efforts target the cold, impulse-controlling circuit of which the DLPFC is a key part. But Hanlon, who trained under NIDA’s Stein before setting up her own lab at MUSC, has chosen a different target: a “hot” brain circuit that transmits rewardand craving-oriented impulses. It is typically active in non–drug users when they see normal rewards such as photos of delicious foods. But in cocaine users, the circuit is pathologically overactive when they are exposed to cues such as the sight of cocaine paraphernalia or the drug itself. Hanlon hopes to put the brakes on it by using continuous, rather than intermittent, theta burst stimulation.

In a study reported in the 1 September issue of Drug and Alcohol Dependence, her group found that among 25 people dependent on cocaine, this form of rTMS significantly decreased neural activity at a key way station in that circuit. The treatment also seemed to dampen activity in functionally related regions that drug cues activate, and that are overactive in cocaine abusers.

Through a sister who has struggled with heroin dependence, Hanlon has experience with addiction. She acknowledges that her study is preliminary; her team delivered the theta burst stimulation in six sessions in a single day, and weeks of treatment may be needed to alter brain circuits. But with NIDA support, in August 2016 she began enrolling cocaine-addicted people in a longer, double-blind trial that will test the treatment’s ability to dampen activity in their hot circuit. “We are optimistic,” she says, that we will “change cocaine use.”

Erasing the memory of cocaine's ""pleasure""

Gallimberti is already more than optimistic: He’s convinced. He had treated people with cocaine dependance for 20 years when Rossi and his father appeared in his Padua office in 2013. Gallimberti’s attempts to help users with psychotherapy, medications, and residential treatment had been difficult and frustrating. “Cocaine addiction is a disease of brain circuits,” he says. “But not one of the approaches we were using corrected those circuits.”

Gallimberti tried to help Rossi by prescribing an antidepressant, an antianxiety drug, and psychotherapy. Nothing worked, and Rossi quit attending the Padua clinic. His cocaine use escalated. But within 4 months of learning of the Nature article, Gallimberti had bought a TMS device, trained himself and his staff to use it, and treated two cocaine addicts. As Rossi, on the brink of fatherhood, careened toward self-destruction, the clinic asked whether he would become the third.

Rossi vividly recalls the broiling hot August day of his first treatment with rTMS. “I remember walking out of the clinic. It was beautiful. I looked at the street, the cobblestones. It was magnificent. I felt as if I had never taken drugs in my life.”

But Rossi’s fiancée, also a medical doctor, viewed rTMS as quackery. She peppered Gallimberti and his staff with questions. Afterward, she made it clear to Rossi that she didn’t believe that first treatment had helped him, and he dropped out of the program. He relapsed again. But 2 days after the birth of his daughter in late September 2013, he returned to Padua. There, he entered a 6-month course of rTMS treatments, staying at the clinic for the first week of daily sessions. He says he has not used cocaine since.

Gallimberti and his colleague, psychologist Alberto Terraneo, soon began enrolling patients in a nonblinded treatment study funded by several Italian organizations and by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. As they did with Rossi, the clinicians treated a group of 16 cocaine users with high-frequency rTMS stimulation designed to strengthen the impulse-overriding cold circuit by stimulating the DLPFC. An equal number of cocaine-using subjects in a control group received medication. During the 29-day study, the treatment group reported significantly less craving and produced significantly more cocaine-free urine tests than the controls, as the researchers, including NIDA’s Bonci, reported last December in European Neuropsychopharmacology . (Members of the control group were later offered rTMS, too; their outcomes also improved significantly, the authors reported.)

Gallimberti and Terraneo did not feel the need to wait for larger, more rigorous trials, such as NIDA’s, that would take years to complete. By the time their study was published, they had treated 220 cocaine users at the clinic in Padua—and had become believers. By 31 July of this year, that number reached 342. (On average, the clinic charges €100 for a single session, but it says people who can’t pay are treated for free.) The results remain encouraging, the Padua team says, although they won’t discuss specifics until the work is published. To Terraneo, rTMS’s effect on cocaine users is simple and clear: “It’s as if they lose the memory of the pleasure.”

Four years after finally having a full course of rTMS treatment, Rossi by all accounts remains clean. Although he and his fiancée broke up in 2015, he says he is in a new, happier relationship. He sees his daughter, nearly 4 years old, on alternating weekends. They take trips to a local park, and he makes her laugh by pretending to eat insects. He is completing a residency in general medicine and preparing to start another in angiology. He says he no longer feels tempted to use cocaine “because I focus on the important things of my life.”

Baker, too, interviewed in early August, said that he remains clean. He was spending his days writing a proposal urging policymakers to do more to help recovering users transition from rehabilitation programs to independent life. Baker was still thinking about cocaine. “But I don’t act on it. I kind of consider the consequences a little bit more than I used to.” Maybe his cold circuit—bolstered by TMS—is talking.

The NIDA team hopes that its ambitious follow-up trial, likely to launch next year, will produce more such promising results. “This TMS story presents the opportunity to directly intervene on circuits. So it’s very exciting,” Stein says. “The question is: Will it play out?”

Scott Swift said in a fleet-wide message Tuesday.

Swift’s internal note to officers in charge, obtained by Navy Times, refers to the fatal at-sea collisions involving the destroyers John S. McCain and the Fitzgerald and was issued as further guidance to the one-day “operational pause” that Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson called for on Monday.

That pause, along with a fleet-wide review of Navy operations that Richardson also called for, aims to assess systemic failures that led to the McCain’s collision with an oil barge on Monday near Singapore, and the Fitzgerald’s collision with a merchant vessel off the Japanese coast two months earlier.

Swift said the fleet had experienced “a series of unfortunate incidents, some of which claimed the lives of our shipmates,” while conducting basic duties like anchoring, navigation, surface ship contact management and carrier qualifications.

play_circle_filled ‘Water on deck!‘ ‘Get out!‘ — The Navy's official report of the Fitzgerald's catastrophe at sea Sailors had less than a minute to escape as seawater blasted through a massive hole in the destroyer Fitzgerald after a container ship struck its starboard side on June 19.

Ten McCain sailors remained unaccounted for Tuesday, but the Navy announced that some remains had been found in the ship’s flooded compartments and that Singaporean authorities had discovered other remains.

On the Fitzgerald, seven sailors died after the massive container ship known as the ACX Crystal plowed into it on June 17, flooding their living quarters.

The Navy has yet to explain how a commercial ship was able to get so close to one of the world’s most high-tech ships.

play_circle_filled Navy’s top officer calls for fleet-wide review in light of McCain disaster Declaring that the Navy “needs to get to the bottom of this,” Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson called Monday morning for a global fleet-wide operational pause that seeks to understand the causes of the service’s spate of fatal at-sea collisions this year.

Also this year, 7th Fleet’s guided-missile cruiser Antietam ran around in the Tokyo Bay, and the cruiser Lake Champlain collided with a South Korean fishing vessel.

Continuous operations cause basic skills to atrophy and give commands a false sense of their overall readiness, Swift said in Tuesday’s message.

“The phenomena that, ‘I am at the peak of my game because I have been operating’ leads to overconfidence, complacency and mistakes which in the best case leads to remedial training, and in the worst case of loss of personnel and equipment,” Swift said.

“Do not let your guard down and fall into this trap.”

Richardson’s review is expected to address the high operational tempo of ships that call overseas ports home, such as those in 7th Fleet.

Swift directed each command to take a full workday dedicated to the operational pause and focusing on individual and team fundamentals.

He said the meetings should “develop, table-top, and talk through challenging scenarios,” as well as rules of the road, standing orders, operating and casualty response procedures, and other areas.

“No one, not even you the CO, is immune from constructive feedback,” Swift said.

Amid accidents and sailor deaths, US Navy's top officer questions readiness of Japan-based ships The Navy’s top officer is eyeing U.S. 7th Fleet based in Yokosuka, Japan, after four accidents in one year have resulted in three collisions, a grounding, seven sailors dead and 10 missing as of Monday afternoon.

The officer and enlisted heads of commands across the Navy’s 7th Fleet will hold their daylong seminars Wednesday and Thursday, according to a 7th Fleet command message.

Seminar topics to be discussed include situational awareness, stress and fatigue, error chain, external and internal communications, decision making, rules of the road and lessons learned, according to the message.

“The seminar format is intended to elicit a facilitated discussion of the navigation and seamanship challenges facing our fleet to ensure that we are taking all appropriate immediate measures to support and enhance Seventh Fleet’s safe and effective operations,” it states.

A 2015 Government Accountability Office report found that ships based overseas faced lags in training, maintenance and other issues compared to ships with U.S. home ports.

While Navy plans call for a U.S.-based cruiser or destroyer to spend 41 percent of its time deployed or available for deployments, similar Japan-based ships spend 67 percent of their time deployed, according to the report.","Tue, 22 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.armytimes.com/resizer/Wqv37dnZolH5S0OAmzKoXwe-ABI=/1200x630/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-mco.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W2O2I2FQZZF6DN7Y6Z4LVNQCDU.JPG,"['7th', 'pacific', 'disasters', 'operations', 'swift', 'navys', 'ships', 'came', 'fleet', 'navy', 'ship', 'atsea', 'sailors', 'pause', 'basic']", ,flood
94,94,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Elephants unchained: 'The day has gone by when this was entertainment' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/aug/12/elephants-unchained-the-day-has-gone-by-when-this-was-entertainment,"Water streams off the edges of her giant ears, runs in rivulets down the wrinkles of her slate-grey skin. She presses her whole head into the hose’s force, the spray welling into her mouth. As she drinks, she rubs her skin against the steel fence, her eyelids drooping luxuriously, her trunk relaxing. If ever I’ve seen a captive elephant happy, it’s Flora this morning.



There are no people laughing or pointing here at the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. There are no infants crying, no children arguing. The public are not allowed into the sanctuary, whose unofficial motto is, “Allow elephants to be elephants”: give them the freedom of choice, the freedom of large areas to explore, the freedom from human gawkers (apart from via the online elecams) while still providing the kind of care that comes with a zoo.

In fact, few things are required of the 10 pachyderms here. They can sleep in the barn or they can spend the night among the pine-covered hills. They can stay in the shade or lounge in the sun. They can wander together for company like elephants in the wild or take off on a solo sojourn. They can chase turkeys or trumpet at deer. They can take a dust bath, roll in a mud wallow, or be sprayed by a keeper, as Flora chose on this day when the temperature hits 34C (93.2F).

“I don’t think we will ever get away from elephants in captivity,” Stephanie DeYoung, the director of elephant husbandry, tells me. “But is it time to change how we keep them in captivity?”

Beaten, starved, shackled The Elephant Sanctuary spreads over 2,700 rolling acres.

Watching her now, it’s hard to imagine Flora – a female African elephant, the largest and arguably most regal terrestrial animal on the planet – dressed up in a silly costume performing in a one-elephant act for 18 years. But that was her life before.



We are, as a species, generally fascinated by elephants. “We see the qualities and characteristics in elephants that we aspire to have ourselves,” says Patricia Sims, the co-founder of World Elephant Day. “Empathy, enduring family bonds, cooperation, intelligence, long memories, taking care of their environment – to name just a few.”

Some extraordinary scientific studies in the last few years have revealed just how intelligent they are. They can recognise themselves in a mirror, found scientists in 2006, one of only a few species that do this. They can have an “aha” moment to solve a puzzle, showed researchers in 2011, by witnessing a young elephant in the National zoo in Washington DC who would move a block wherever she needed it to reach food. We even know now that what makes captive elephants happy is not the size of their pen, but whether they live with other elephants, thanks to a landmark collection of papers in the scientific journal PLOS ONE last year

But our desire to be close to these incredible creatures has led us down some ugly paths. We have ridden them, dressed them up in ridiculous attire, beaten them, starved them, and slaughtered them en masse. Today tens of thousands live shackled in prisons of our making.

A video still from a report that was shown during the trial of circus trainer Mary Chipperfield, who was convicted in 1999 on 12 counts of animal cruelty.



Elephants are still gussied up to decorate weddings in India; in Sri Lanka they are locked in religious sites as living (but suffering) embodiments of a god; in Africa tourists ride trained elephants to see wild ones; in south-east Asia elephants are used to log the very forests they once called home; and worldwide elephants are still forced to perform silly tricks in circuses and zoos, tricks they are trained to do by brutalising methods, often using a bullhook, a large, sharp, medieval-looking instrument used to create pain in an elephant’s sensitive spots.

When I ask ecologist and author of Beyond Words: What Animals Think and Feel, Carl Safina, if he believes elephants are intelligent and conscious, he says that there is “zero” evidence that such animals are not conscious, while there is multiple lines of evidence – both physically and behaviourally – that they are.

In Indonesia, activists have photographed an elephant in a zoo that lives alone with its feet tied together by a chain.

So what are the implications of this? Besides their own particular form of consciousness, elephants have spectacularly good memories. Can they remember abuse and pain? Could some elephants even be described as traumatised? There have certainly been episodes that would seem to indicate this. In 1994, for example, a female African elephant named Tyke crushed her trainer to death in front of a circus audience in Honolulu. She escaped the tent and ran through the city streets for a half hour before police officers brought her down in a hail of 86 bullets. Like all circus elephants, she’d spent her life chained up, transported in trucks and beaten to perform. The only freedom she’d known was when she’d escape – and she’d done so twice before. (The 2013 documentary Blackfish, about a killer whale, Tilikum, appears to tell a very similar story about another of the earth’s largest mammals.)

Sukari in her enclosure



Over and over again, staff at the Tennessee sanctuary tell me that “elephants never kill anyone accidentally”. Like humans, they can snap. Constant beatings, solitary confinement, being chained to the floor: all this can understandably push any elephant to the brink – and some will retaliate.

In her book Elephants on the Edge, Gay A Bradshaw argues that elephants – both wild and captive – can suffer psychological traumas, leading them to become more unpredictable and violent. “When elephants lose their homes and families, are subjected to mass killing, and are captured and incarcerated in zoos, they breakdown mentally and culturally and exhibit symptoms found in human prisoners and victims of genocide,” Bradshaw said in an interview with Scientific American.

In her book, Bradshaw describes an experiment where the symptoms of an elephant were sent to five mental health officials – who had no knowledge that they were diagnosing an elephant and not a human – but all of whom diagnosed the individual with PTSD.

As our understanding of the minds of our fellow species improves, will we increasingly look back at the way we have treated them in horror and repulsion?

Unloosening the chains Shirley’s right ear was scarred when she was on a ship that caught fire and sank.



The impact of our changing understanding of elephant psychology has already been profound. Perhaps the most astounding change is at circuses. Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey, arguably the world’s most famous circuses, stopped using elephants last year – and then closed for good this May after 146 years. Britain’s last circus elephant, Anne, was rescued in 2011 after the Daily Mail revealed she was being viciously abused. Twenty countries have banned the use of elephants in circuses. Even India has banned elephants in both circuses and zoos – though the process of retiring the elephants is gradual.

“The day’s gone by of putting an animal in a cage and calling it entertainment. I think more and more people realise that is ridiculous,” says DeYoung.

Life in zoos is generally not as abusive for elephants as in circuses. Zoo elephants are not travelling overland on a weekly basis, are not usually chained up for days to weeks to years on end, and are not usually forced to perform tricks day in and day out.

But there have been enormous changes here too. Recognising the social needs of elephants, the US’s Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) now requires that any accredited zoo must have at least three female elephants, two males or three mixed genders in order to make sure elephants have peers although facilities can apply for an expectation. (There has been less progress on space: a creature known to roam hundreds to thousands of square kilometres in the wild gets as little as 500 square metres of outside space in a zoo.)

The best zoos are changing concrete cages to natural environments, adding more enrichment and taking their elephants for daily walks to increase exercise. Today, 43 zoos are members of the Elephant Welfare Initiative, which tracks real-time data on their pachyderms, all in an effort to improve conditions. And many elephant keepers now have behavioural backgrounds, an acknowledgement of the species’ deep psychological needs, explains Otto Fad, an animal behaviour and welfare specialist. “All of us ‘elephant geeks’ are paying attention,” he says.

But progress is slow, and patchy. China is buying up wild elephants from Africa, and Chinese zoos are hardly known for humane conditions. Eyewitnesses say zoos there are forcing elephants to do unnatural tricks to entertain visitors, much like circuses. Even in Europe controversy remains: In April, Peta released footage of keepers at the Hanover zoo in Germany using a bullhook and whip to train juvenile elephants to perform tricks. The European Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the AZA both still allow the use of bullhooks.

And then there are the 15,000 to 20,000 elephants around the world that still spend their lives in chains. “Harsh,” is how Carol Buckley, the head of Elephant Aid International, describes conditions in Asia. “With little exception, they live in chains when not being dominated by their mahout to perform.” The mahouts “suffer equally ... [Both] live in squalor, deprived of the most basic needs.” In Indonesia, activists have photographed an elephant in a zoo that lives alone with its feet tied together by a chain. It can’t move a single step.

So, what to do? We can’t just open the pen doors and unloosen all the chains.

If only they could all go and live in the sanctuary.

“They are allowed to express themselves” Ronnie (on the left) and Sissy in their enclosures. Out of shot are their companions. All are free to roam in 100s of acres.



No institution is perfect. Founded in 1995, the 2,700-acre sanctuary – North America’s only one dedicated solely to elephants – has seen its own set of tragedies and challenges, none worse than when a keeper was killed in 2006 by an Asian elephant.

But it is a genuine sanctuary for once abused elephants, tended to by the most devoted of staff, who practise a form of elephant care known as “protected contact” or PC, a type of training invented in the 1990s by San Diego zoo. This is in opposition to what’s called free contact, which generally depends on bullhooks and punishment. Keeper Kristy Sands Eaker says PC is about “mutual respect”, and about positive reinforcement – rewards for good behaviour – rather than punishment. “They know we are not going to enter their space ... They are allowed to express themselves … if they do not want to participate in something … they can react and there’s no punishment for that.”

At the same time, the animals are not romanticised: elephants and keepers are always separated by a steel barrier; there are always at least two keepers working with an elephant, and all are aware they are dealing with four-tonne animals capable of killing with a single strike of its trunk.

The sanctuary houses 10 female elephants – it doesn’t take males at this time. It has room for six more, but it’s surprisingly difficult to obtain new elephants. After all, elephants are money makers for circuses and zoos, which are often loathe to give them up. This is why the sanctuary is never sent young elephants: the younger the elephant, the bigger the jackpot. In an attempt to create bridges between the circus or zoo world and the sanctuary, the staff say their elephants are “retired” – not “rescued”.

The sanctuary has no interest in breeding on the site. “We’re not breeding for animals to live in captivity,” says CEO Janice Zeitlin. “And this is captivity.”

Some of these elephants have harrowing stories. Sissy, stolen from the wild in 1969, survived a flood in Texas in 1981, spending 36 hours submerged under water with just her trunk above the surface. For years she was terrified of water, but after coming to the sanctuary she started wading in pools again.

“This is what the sanctuary is about,” says Zeitlin. “These celebrations. These milestones.”

Some elephants arrived with self-mutilation behaviours, such as biting their ears or tusking their own legs. “It’s a coping mechanism, and a lot of that is based on stress,” explains DeYoung.

I spend the day at the sanctuary with remarkable women. DeYoung moved across the country to work here. Zeitlin came 20 years ago and today runs the place. Sands Eaker worked up to the day she gave birth to twins. She told me she sometimes feels she knows the elephants better than her own children. This is not a job for them, it’s a calling, a devotion, a love.

I wonder if they are aware of the similarities between them and the elephants they care for. On the one hand, we have a highly intelligent, empathetic, deeply conscious species that has survived millions of years through a powerful matriarchal society. And, on the other, are the women of another species determined to give these pachyderm ladies the best years of their life, determined to do their utmost to heal the wounds caused by our sins.

Given that they are often taking in geriatric elephants – the youngest on site is 33 – workers at the facility have become accustomed to loss. In its 22 years, they have seen 17 elephants die. In 2013, they started a new policy of euthanising elephants when they felt they were suffering from irreversible health problems causing unrelenting suffering.

“There was a philosophical change,” DeYoung says, noting that founders preferred allowing “nature to take its course”. The final decision comes down to the vets, but includes input from all the staff. Since 2013 they have humanely euthanised five elephants.

“We feel we are the stewards of this animal and it is our responsibility to take care of them – in life and in death,” adds DeYoung.

When death comes – whether due to euthanasia or other causes – the other elephants are allowed to spend as long as they need with the body. Elephants are buried on site and marker stones erected. Staff have observed elephants visiting the graves of their lost companions, especially those they were particularly bonded to. More then 10 years after Jenny’s death, Shirley still marches into the wood to mourn beside her grave.

Into the wild

But even if every zoo in the world was like the sanctuary, captivity can never replicate the wild.

Conservationists rarely consider the idea of releasing captive elephants back into the wild, but it has been done. Elephant Reintroduction, a NGO in Thailand, has reintroduced more than a hundred once-captive elephants into three protected areas since 2002. The work is challenging. Premjith Hemmawath, with the organisation, says mahouts had to teach one elephant how to drink water from the river instead of the tap. Still, many reintroduced elephants have thrived in this programme, with some even reproducing in the wild.

Fewer captive elephants have been released in Africa, but there are successes there too. Eight adult captive elephants housed in African countries (five males and three females) have been rereleased in Botswana. The most incredible example of reintroductions are Durga and Owalla, American circus elephants that were reintroduced into a park in South Africa in 1982. Both went on to have their own calves.

It’s expensive – that’s one issue. But the biggest problem, as Safina says, is that “there’s no place to free them to”. Asia is losing its habitat at record rates and surviving elephants are already coming into near-constant conflict with human populations. In Africa, the situation is even more dire due to unrelenting poaching. According to the Great Elephant Census, around 144,000 African savannah elephants have been lost in less than a decade in 18 African countries. But no one has even been able to count African forest elephants – a distinct species – which have taken the brunt of the poaching epidemic.

“Welfare is a concept that can be applied to any animal in any situation, not just wielded as a weapon to attack zoos,” said Fad. “Does anyone thinks that a starving elephant who just had her lower jaw blown off by a hakka pata [a makeshift explosive inserted in fruits and vegetables to injure or kill any animal raiding fields] takes comfort in her ‘wild’ status?”

Safina, who has spent a lot of time with elephants in the wild, adds that today wild elephants suffer from “more danger, stress, and harm … than do elephants who live in the better zoos, where they are comfortably bored”. Compared with the plight of wild elephants, he says, “captivity issues are a sideshow”.

What elephants would do

Before I left for Tennessee, I showed my six-year-old daughter a video about Shirley’s life. A 69-year-old Asian elephant at the sanctuary, Shirley survived a shipwreck, a truck crash and an attack by another elephant that left her crippled – her right hind leg forever-after bent at an irregular angle. I held my daughter as she wept through the video, but afterwards she brightened up and drew a picture for me to bring to Shirley.

I wasn’t sure I was going to see Shirley, though. The staff said she likes to wander deep into the forest, and she was the kind of elephant that would decide for herself whether to grace you with her presence.

In the afternoon, we find an Asian elephant, Tarra, and the staff proceed to give her a shower and feed her treats. But far away – just a large shadow-like shape deep among the tall Tennessee pines – stands another.

“That’s Shirley,” Sands Eaker tells me, adding that the crippled leg “doesn’t limit her. I’ve seen her climb some of the steepest hills – which I wouldn’t climb myself.”

We wait. And watching Shirley – just a silhouette in the forest – I feel that tinge – that pull – so many of us feel in the presence of an elephant, like we’re meeting a being both similar and alien, a great four-legged giant, a kind of demi-deity, a wise mother. Of course, it’s often a toxic intimacy: our desire to be close to elephants more often than not has resulted in their suffering and despair. We’re not elephants – and no human can replace an elephant for an elephant.

But maybe our greater understanding of elephant needs will allow us to let them go – to let them be free again. To make sure captive elephants are living in places where they can be elephants again. And, for those in the wild: to stop slaughtering them for trinkets, to invite them to share this world with us unmolested.

“Oh, Shirley!” Sands Eaker exclaims.

And Shirley comes out of the forest to greet us.

I take a photo for my daughter – since the sanctuary is not open to the public she’ll never get to see Shirley herself – and I hope the image will be enough to impart that awe, that wonder, that reverence that radiates off these great beings. I hope it’s enough for my daughter, and all of us, to extend our empathy to a species alien to ourselves.

After all, that’s what elephants would do.

95,95,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,The Madhouse Effect: this is how climate denial in Australia and the US compares - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/the-madhouse-effect-this-is-how-climate-denial-in-australia-and-the-us-compares-81822,"This article is part of an ongoing series from the Post-Truth Initiative, a Strategic Research Excellence Initiative at the University of Sydney. The series examines today’s post-truth problem in public discourse: the thriving economy of lies, bullshit and propaganda that threatens rational discourse and policy.

The project brings together scholars of media and communications, government and international relations, physics, philosophy, linguistics, and medicine, and is affiliated with the Sydney Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre (SSSHARC), the Sydney Environment Institute and the Sydney Democracy Network.

Michael Mann is well known for his classic “hockey stick” work on global warming, for the attacks he has long endured from climate denialists, and for the good fight of communicating the environmental and political realities of climate change.

Mann’s work, including his recent book The Madhouse Effect, has helped me, as a dual US-Australian citizen, think about the similarities and differences between the US and Australia as we respond to what has been called the climate change denial machine.

In both countries, the denialists and distortionists have undermined public knowledge, public policy, new economic development opportunities, and the very value of the environment. Climate policy is being built upon alternative facts, fake news, outright lies, PR spin and industry-written talking points.

From the carbon industry capture of the two major parties, to the Abbott-Turnbull government parroting industry talking points, to coal industry lobbyists as government energy advisers, to the outright idiotic conspiracy pronouncements of senators funded and advised by the US-based denial machine, the Madhouse Effect is in full force in Australia.

Further reading: New coal plants wouldn’t be clean, and would cost billions in taxpayer subsidies

How we can expose and counter this denialist machine? To partly lay out the task, I will discuss three points of contrast between the US and Australia.

Political culture

There is a key difference between the two countries’ political cultures. As much as the denialists have determined Australian energy and climate policy, they have not been as successful, yet, at undermining deep-seeded respect in Australian culture for the common good, for science, for expertise and knowledge.

I left the US at the start of 2011. Living in Arizona, I had experienced the full weight of the racism, the white nationalism, the anti-intellectual, anti-education, anti-fact atmosphere that has since spread all the way to the White House.

I used to tell people I left because Arizona had simply become anti-enlightenment. Folks really didn’t get it, until now, when it is the attitude that rules the country.

Shortly after I arrived in Australia, the then-prime minister, Tony Abbott, led an attack on the work of economist Ross Garnaut. Abbott slammed Garnaut’s 2011 report as anti-democratic. The report had simply pointed out the cost of climate inaction and the viability of putting a price on carbon.

Later, Abbott doubled down and dismissed the quality of Australian economists as a whole. Other denialists went further – Garnaut was called a fascist and was subject to the kind of attacks Mann is well familiar with.

Surprisingly to me, a good part of the public seemed appalled by Abbott’s trashing of an academic. This was seen an attack not just on a carbon price, or a policy recommendation, but on science and knowledge as a whole.

And there was the chief scientist on TV, defending the academy – and that’s when I learned Australia actually had a chief scientist, to whom the media paid attention. This is not something we had in Arizona.

Abbott wound up backing down from the worst of the criticism. The whole series of events illustrated to me, a new Australian, that there is a strong cultural norm here that supports science, that respects expertise and that understands that real knowledge should be used to inform good policy in the public interest.

It wasn’t a one-time event. Last year, when the government fired climate scientists at CSIRO, there was another huge public backlash. The government had to step back a bit, both on the actual science to be done and the radical agenda change away from science for the public good.

And again, when the government wanted to support the dubious work of Bjorn Lomborg, that caused an outcry from both the university sector and the public. Even though the government wound up paying more than A$600,000 on what The Australian called his “vanity book project”, they couldn’t import him and plant him at any Australian university.

Further reading: The Australian Consensus Centre: what are the costs and benefits to UWA?

As Mann says, the main issue in implementing good, sound climate policy is no longer simply the science. The main issue is the cultural understanding of, and respect for the role of science in informing political decisions.

That’s not to say there are no attacks on science – clearly, these continue (such as the recent challenges to normal Bureau of Meteorology practices). But, overall, climate denialists and their enablers are outnumbered outliers in Australia, rather the norm.

The power of the carbon industry

My second point of comparison is not quite as positive.

The problem in Australia is less a culture turning against the Enlightenment, and more the direct political power and influence of the carbon industry. This is most evident not just in our poor emissions and climate policies, but also in the fact the Australian government is hell-bent on sabotaging an entire industrial sector.

I honestly do not understand how the sabotage of the renewables industry in Australia – an all-out attack on a clearly promising and innovative sector – is not treated as a form of industrial treason.

We have had a set of politicians, under the influence of a dying industry, undermining one of the most promising areas of our own economy. They do so for the sole benefit of carbon diggers, at the expense of the rest of Australia, of the next generation and of the planet.

And the justification for this is all based on falsehoods and lies, straight from the PR team of the carbon industry. We hear arguments for energy security, energy poverty and clean coal; we hear that renewables undermine the reliability of the grid. It’s all absolute bullshit.

Further reading: On the origins of environmental bullshit

But, again, even here I think there is some hope. We have seen, over the last few years, an incredible coalition grow – one focused on the end of carbon mining, on protecting communities, on creating real jobs, and on supporting renewables.

Once-unthinkable coalitions of farmers and Aboriginal communities are fighting new mines, new attacks on sacred and fertile land and water.

We have intensive household investment in rooftop solar – and as the feed-in tariffs are undermined, those folks will increasingly invest in battery storage. And we’re finally seeing states move in this direction, with increasing development of utility-scale renewable and storage projects. As hard as the federal government and its allies resist, renewables are growing and the public supports this – even conservative voters.

This industry will be the innovator, the job creator, the future of this country’s energy system. That is a movement – a transformation – that now seems inevitable even in the face of the carbon industry, its political allies and their outright attacks on innovation.

Further reading: The solar panel and battery revolution: how will your state measure up?

Impacts and adaptation

There is one other important point to make in comparing the US and Australia – and maybe it is the most dire.

All of this talk, about the science, about the power of the denialist machine, about post-truth and the sabotage of renewables, is all about one side of the climate issue: emissions.

The other side, which is crucial to us here in Australia, is how we adapt to the climate change the denialist machine has baked into our future. This nice stable period of the last 10,000 years, the Holocene, in which humanity has evolved, built our cities, our infrastructure, our supply chains, the expectations of our everyday lives – is over.

Climate change means change, and Australia is already facing it in more severe ways than the US.

So adaptation is the next battle, and it must be just. We know who benefits from denialism and the sabotage of renewables. And it is pretty straightforward who will be harmed most if we don’t plan for coming change. We know who dies in heatwaves, for example – the poor, the elderly, those who live alone, those without resources.

This is happening right here. The Rockefeller-funded Resilient Sydney project found that the number one chronic stress is increasing health services demand, which is crucial to resilience in Western Sydney during heatwaves. If we don’t attend to that, vulnerable people will continue to die every time it heats up.

Further reading: How people can best make the transition to cool future cities

Australia needs to face up to adaptation planning on a large scale – rather than cut funds to the good work already being done. We need to focus on giving those most vulnerable to climate change a fair go by looking after their needs first.

One promising step is that the Sydney Environment Institute, with colleagues in Planetary Health and Public Health at the University of Sydney, are establishing a new research hub for NSW OEH on the Health and Social Impacts of Climate Change.

We have also partnered with Resilient Sydney to examine the actual experience of communities in shock events – the impacts on people and how policy responses can be improved. This work is all about adapting to the complex impacts of climate change in fair and just ways.

Overall, then, yes, Australia has industry-led denialists creating a madhouse effect, just as Mann writes about in the US.

But my hope is that we can use our broad political culture of respect for science and for the fair go to resist denialism and the coal profiteers, to implement a post-carbon energy transformation, and adapt fairly and justly to the inevitable changes the denial industry has locked in here.

Saturday afternoon: Oceanbeach Rd, Omanu. He walks out of George Cafe's al fresco area like he's stepped out of a surfing magazine. Long curly hair, patterned shorts, skateboard, and headband headphones.

Tom Paterson isn't feeling the cold, he's ""hot"".

Rewind nine months, and he might be mistaken for Tom Hanks' double in the epic survival blockbuster, Cast Away. He had a longer, ratty beard. Dark tan, and hadn't showered in 40 days.

Tauranga men pitted their wits against each other and other contestants on Survivor NZ

Nearly a year on from filming Survivor New Zealand, the first runner-up of the show is still adjusting to the finer things in life.

Sipping on a $5 cappuccino, the school teacher and local surfie was worse for wear when he returned from rugged South America to populous Mount Maunganui.

His mouth was riddled with ulcers. He had lost 11kg through stress, hunger and lack of sleep. By his own admission, he was ""weird looking"".

It took weeks for his bed to feel comfortable again - it was too soft. Sugar gave him headaches. Rich food made him vomit. The silence of being home alone and enclosed in a room was eerie. After staring at a fire for hours on end on a remote island, the internet was fast and over-stimulating.

He was recovering from ""passive aggressive bullying"". He second guessed conversations around him. What had they meant? Did they want something from him? No, the game was over.

""Your mind is having trouble flicking between the two worlds when you come back ... I feel like the biggest surprise for me was how soaked into that world you get,"" the 26-year-old says of the ultimate test of mind and body. ""Your memory starts to dilute everything else in the real world. You just hone in and it's survival.""

The New Zealand adaptation of the long-running hit reality show was screened over 20 episodes and filmed in Nicaragua - a place where fireflies dance to the rhythmic beat of the ocean. The night's presentation of stars resembles a spillage of silvery sugar pearls. And when phosphorus bombshells burst, the explosion showers black sand into light. During the day, temperatures soar to a heady 30C to 40C.

""When you did physical stuff, you got dizzy ... You knew you weren't going to finish (a challenge), go have a drink, go hang out in air-con. One day we actually ran out of drinking water pretty early in the day.""

Selected as one of 16 Kiwi competitors out of a pool of 8000, he entered a video, which had originally been filmed as an unsuccessful entry for TV's The Amazing Race.



""That audition tape was kind of a satire of audition tapes ... I didn't have a video for Survivor so it was just kind of on a whim. Throw it in, throw in a random photo, and then they found it funny.""

He's a humorous guy, he says.

""I would have been typecast. There would've been me versus some other teacher somewhere fighting for a place.""

He bossed the game, but it was brutal.

""You get a pretty hard line from the producers: 'You're on Survivor, get into gear'.""

He was comfortable in front of the cameras, and hasn't ruled out a career change. He's just resigned from his job as a teacher at Otumoetai Intermediate School to travel and relief teach.

He is engaged to Australian model and writer, Christina Macpherson (no relation to the famous Elle) who has 72,000 social media followers on Instagram. The pair are currently travelling and working together on upcoming creative projects, as well as talking with TVNZ about other opportunities yet to be made public. He might not have won Survivor, but he has X-factor.

""I don't just want to be 'Tom from Survivor' ... The weirdest opportunities are coming out of it (and) if there's good enough offers, you'd have to consider them and be smart ... I'm not really worried about failure.""



Of the show, he says supplies were limited to bare essentials - rice and beans. Water had to be sourced from a well, and the 16 contestants - two from Tauranga (the other was Mike Sparrow) had only water and sand to scrub their bodies.

He recalls feeling like a true Robinson Crusoe when he and fellow contestant Jak Thomas went for a walk and spotted a group of tourists looking for surf breaks.

""We sat up on a hill and were just watching them. It was the weirdest thing ... We'd almost forgotten about (civilisation). Another time, two guys on motorbikes came into camp through the jungle. We went up to them: 'You guys got any food?""'

It's a curious thing to go from city boy to deserted island ruffian.

He would find himself sneaking away as the first sun peeped over the sapphire sea, padding his feet over soft sand, and evaporating into the jungle.

""I was really tired but I'd go away and if we got 'tree mail' the day before (a hint of what was to come), I'd try and de-code it. I'd go and train. So I was in a bush, throwing rocks trying to do weird little things ...""

He was happy they filmed in Nicaragua. The only place he would have hated to compete inwas Guatemala, after watching a particularly gruelling Survivor US series filmed there in 2005.

Kiwi contestants were placed into two competing tribes - Mogoton and Hermosa - they later merged into one tribe, Casar, as cast members were eliminated one by one by their peers. They competed in challenges and formed alliances with the last sole survivor, Avi Ducker-Jones, winning $100,000 in the live final.

The prize is ""no way"" enough. A better sum would have been $500,000. In the US, the winner gets $1 million. ""(But then) a different prize would create a different social dynamic. Create a different tension. One is life-changing, and the other could be depending on who won.""

Competitors, who must provide for themselves, had been whittled down to three by the end - Paterson, Ducker-Jones and Barbara ""Barb"" Raos.



Paterson suspected it would come down to himself and Ducker-Jones but didn't expect it to be a landslide victory: 6-1. ""There was over variables (over why I didn't get votes) that I've just got to be okay with, otherwise it'll eat me up. People like an underdog and I'm essentially still that.""

He was ""genuinely stoked"" for Ducker-Jones.

""I think that in this version of Survivor, in this season, he played the game that would get the best result.""

Returning home, he wasn't ready to face anyone, but was grateful for routine and the distraction of work.

Filming finished in September last year but the live final was only held this month . ""That time, until a couple of weeks back, has just been holding this weird secret.""

On conclusion of filming, the three finalists gorged themselves on food and alcohol back at the crew's resort. ""They just gave us money and said: 'Get what you want', so we went mad"".

Paterson, whose favourite food is eggs, chose a lobster, on top of a steak, with a side of cocktails.

""I actually was throwing up a lot of the food I was eating because my stomach couldn't handle anything.""

A highly competitive and physical person, he got what he wanted out of the game and that was to push himself to his limits. His hypothesis: ""What does adversity do to me?""

He won't concede he's a sucker for punishment but he would do it again.

Describing himself as ""goofy"", even on his worst days he could laugh. ""Whereas I think other people cracked a bit. You see the best and worst of people.""

Alliances and enemies were formed early on, with contestant Shayna ""Shay"" Tapusoa, instantly putting Paterson on her hit-list. To put it simply: ""We just clashed. We just butted heads in the game."" There's no ill-feeling.

His incredible mental stamina and physical prowess saw him win five immunity challenges in a row - equal with the most won on any international Survivor series.

One task saw him balancing a vase on a plank with his foot, for three hours. He fell off at the end and got concussion.

""I think I played the hardest. I think I probably pulled out all of the stops when they needed to happen at the right times.""

He hit out at the treatment of a fellow finalist, Barbara Raos, saying the last episode before the live final turned into a roast by eliminated contestants that crossed a line. It was revealed even more harsh words were spoken that didn't make it to air.

""Everyone was kind of angry at Barb. In essence, they kind of just got outplayed by someone who was a strategist. It didn't sit well with me.""

Born Thomas Paterson to a Maori father and European mum, he grew up with two siblings in Timaru.

He represented New Zealand when at boarding school in basketball (he can shoot a half court), and moved to Australia after university. He came back two-and-a-half years ago with fiancee Macpherson.

Keen on surfing, photography and classic and alternative rock, his portrayal on the show was accurate.

""Every day, I was freaking out for the first half of it. By the end, I'd found my feet.""

He's been contacted by super fans as far away as Canada and Indonesia and school kids think he's something else. Who he is, most agree, is a pretty cool teacher.

Being young, he wasn't relying on prize money.

""I don't think I was at a junction at my life where I needed money ... I haven't got heaps (but) when you come back from an experience like that, you think of little things of importance pretty quickly.""

With so much time on his hands when filming wasn't happening, he reached a state of meditative bliss.

""I spent a lot of time just sitting on the beach, because you've got hours and hours each day. You have a lot of thinking time. By no means am I a hippy, but it really made me have to think about deeper things that I didn't have time to think about before. I'm more goal driven now ... It was a good sense of achievement. I want to (continue) to improve myself and my position in life.""

99,99,Indonesia_Aug17_water_stress,Furor Over Charlottesville Follows Trump Home to Manhattan - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/furor-over-charlottesville-follows-trump-home-manhattan,"NEW YORK - President Donald Trump is back in the New York skyscraper that bears his name as the furor over his reaction to race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend shows few signs of dying down.



Protesters on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue tried to spoil Trump's homecoming Monday night with signs bearing messages like ""stop the hate, stop the lies"" and chanting ""shame, shame, shame"" and ""not my president!""



After two days of public equivocation and internal White House debate, the president condemned white supremacist groups by name on Monday, declaring ""racism is evil.""



In a hastily arranged statement at the White House, Trump branded members of the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists who take part in violence as ""criminals and thugs.""



The groups are ""repugnant to everything that we hold dear as Americans,"" he said.



Calls for removal of White House aides

The move didn't quiet the uproar, however. The leaders of four minority House caucus groups wrote a letter to Trump calling for the removal of White House staff aides Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka.



The heads of the black, Hispanic, Asian and progressive caucuses are calling in the letter for the firings of the Trump administration officials in the wake of a violent, racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The letter asserts their continuing presence in the White House is emboldening a resurgent white supremacist movement in America.



This came a day after Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired as White House communications director after a less than two-week stay, called for Bannon's ouster.



In his initial remarks on the violence Saturday, Trump did not single out the groups and instead bemoaned violence on ""many sides."" Those remarks prompted stern criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, who urged him to seize the moral authority of his office to condemn hate groups.



Trump's softer statement Saturday had come as graphic images of a car plowing into a crowd in Charlottesville were playing continually on television. White nationalists had assembled in the city to protest plans to take down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and counter-protesters gathered in opposition. Fights broke out, and then a man drove into the opponents of the white supremacists. One woman was killed and many more badly hurt. Twenty-year-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio is charged with second-degree murder and other counts.

Loath to appear to be admitting a mistake, Trump was reluctant to adjust his remarks.



The president had indicated to advisers before his initial statement Saturday that he wanted to stress a need for law and order, which he did. He later expressed anger to those close to him about what he perceived as the media's unfair assessment of his remarks, believing he had effectively denounced all forms of bigotry, according to outside advisers and White House officials.

Rising tide of criticism

Several of Trump's senior advisers, including new chief of staff John Kelly, had urged him to make a more specific condemnation, warning that the negative story would not go away and that the rising tide of criticism from fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill could endanger his legislative agenda, according to two White House officials.



The outside advisers and officials demanded anonymity to discuss private conversations.



Aides were dispatched to Sunday talk shows but struggled to explain the president's position. A stronger statement was released - but attributed only to an unnamed spokesperson.



Tougher condemnations began Sunday night with Vice President Mike Pence, traveling in South America, declaring that ""these dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life.""



On Monday, Trump had planned to interrupt his 17-day working vacation at his New Jersey golf club to travel to Washington for an announcement he hoped would showcase some tough talk on China's trade practices.



But by the time he arrived at midmorning, it was clear all other messages would be drowned out until he said more about Charlottesville.



Trump returned to a White House undergoing a major renovation. With the Oval Office unavailable, he worked from the Treaty Room as aides drafted his remarks.



Reading from a teleprompter, he made a point of beginning with an unrelated plug for the strength of the economy under his leadership. Then, taking pains to insist ""as I said on Saturday,"" Trump denounced the hate groups and called for unity.



""We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence,"" he said.



Trump for the first time mentioned Heather Heyer by name as he paid tribute to the woman killed by the car.



At the trade event later in the day, he was asked why it took two days for him to offer an explicit denunciation of the hate groups.



""They have been condemned,"" Trump responded before offering a fresh criticism of some media as ""fake news.""



He followed with a tweet declaring ""the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied.""","Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/6A8FBBEA-195D-4CBE-BE26-0439AFAFFB2F.jpg,"['follows', 'charlottesville', 'advisers', 'statement', 'trump', 'furor', 'house', 'president', 'violence', 'white', 'manhattan', 'hate', 'york', 'groups']", ,none
