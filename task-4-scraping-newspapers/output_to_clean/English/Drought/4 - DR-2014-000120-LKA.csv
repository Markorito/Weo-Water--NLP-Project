2,2,Drought Sri Lanka,10 Years after the tsunami: Is Sri Lanka better prepared for the next disaster? - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/41629,"Source(s): World Bank, the (WB)



Story Highlights

The December 2004 Tsunami was a wake up call to many countries in the Indian Ocean to be better prepared to face natural disasters.

Many development partners are working closely with the Government of Sri Lanka Disaster Management Center to reduce the impact of the next natural disaster.

The World Bank through its current operations in Disaster Risk Management is supporting the Government of Sri Lanka to be better prepared to reduce the economic impact of disasters.

Sri Lanka, along with neighboring countries, was not equipped to face the Indian Ocean Tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. A total of around 230,000 people lost their lives in countries located along the Indian Ocean. The need for an early warning system and to be better prepared to manage disasters to save lives and livelihoods was the biggest lesson learnt in the aftermath of the tsunami 10 years ago. According to the Disaster Management Center of Sri Lanka, the country now has better early warning systems to detect tsunamis and other disasters and is better equipped to respond to future disasters.



Many development partners came forward to support Sri Lanka in the emergency phase and recovery phase of the tsunami. The World Bank with the lessons learnt through initial operations in the aftermath of the tsunami (Tsunami Emergency Reconstruction Program) is working with the Government of Sri Lanka to be better prepared for the next disaster by reducing the economic impact of such external shocks. Such operations would reduce the negative impact of disasters on the overall development and poverty reduction efforts of the country.



Early Warning



“I thought people were joking when they said the sea is coming inland. Then I saw a gush of blackish water coming towards my house which is more than 100m from the sea…I grabbed my sleeping children and shouted out to my husband to run. This was the only warning we got,” said K.K. Sriyani from Talpe in Galle, who is now the Secretary of the community based disaster management committee. At that time, they did not know which direction to run. Today, with the coordination of the DMC and its community based activities including early warning drills, the village is now prepared to congregate at the temple which is situated on higher ground, and is equipped to give refuge to people in time of a disaster.



With the lessons learnt following the 2004 tsunami, the Disaster Management Center (DMC), under the Ministry of Disaster Management has been leading efforts to enhance disaster risk management in close collaboration with development partners working in Sri Lanka. Working together, this group has been able to create a “culture of safety in Sri Lanka. Establishment of early warning systems including robust communications links with local and international technical agencies, an around the clock emergency operations center, and engaging people from the grassroots level in both disaster awareness and mitigation activities.



“We now have an early warning tower and people are more aware on what needs to be done” said K.P. Pradeep from the DMC Galle explaining his role as an Assistant Coordinator engaged in community based activities promoting awareness among villagers, coordinating early warning drills and gathering disaster risk related information to report to the DMC Galle, which is based in the District Secretariat in Galle. “The tower can be activated in any part of the country through the DMC in Colombo,” said Pradeep, further explaining the early warning system that is in place.



Disaster Risk Management



The fiscal and physical impacts of natural disasters in Sri Lanka have been sizable over the past decade, particularly flooding and drought. In recognition of the social and economic effects of climate-related hazards, the Sri Lankan Government with the assistance of the World Bank is taking steps to strengthen the country’s resilience to natural disasters and climate change through a comprehensive program of support involving adaptation enhancing investments and a Catastrophe Deferred Draw-Down Option (CAT-DDO).



The Climate Resilience Improvement Project (CRIP) aims to reduce the vulnerability of exposed people and assets to climate risks and to improve the government’s capacity to respond effectively to future disasters. These objectives will be achieved through evidence-based investment planning and urgent risk mitigation measures. The development policy loan with CAT-DDO instrument offers immediate funds to the Government upon declaring a state of an emergency in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, thereby strengthening its fiscal resilience to natural disasters.","Tue, 23 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.preventionweb.net/files/41629_largeImage.jpg,"['warning', 'tsunami', 'prepared', 'lanka', 'sri', 'early', 'risk', 'management', 'disasters', 'disaster', 'better']",

That’s the finding of a reconstruction of North American drought history over the past 1,000 years, done by scientists from NASA and Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Their study, to be published in the Oct. 17 issue of Geophysical Research Letters, concludes the drought of 1934 during the Dust Bowl years in the North American Plains was 30 percent more severe than the next worst, which occurred in 1580, NASA said.

The scientists used tree ring records from 1000 to 2005 along with modern observations. They found that the 1934 drought extended across 71.6 percent of western North America, compared with 59.7 percent during the 2012 drought. ""It was the worst by a large margin,"" said Ben Cook, climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and lead author of the study. The scientists found two main reasons: a winter high-pressure system over the West Coast that blocked precipitation and spring dust storms that suppressed rainfall.

KILINOCHCHI, Sri Lanka, Oct 3 2014 (IPS) - Gazing out over the parched earth of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province, one might think these farmlands have not seen water in years. In fact, this is not too far from the truth.

The World Food Programme (WFP) last month allocated 2.5 million dollars to assist hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans in the throes of an 11-month drought that has shown no signs of abating.

The WFP said on Sep. 1 that 2.3 million dollars worth of supplies, including rice rations, would be provided to the drought victims. The assistance scheme will also provide 277,000 dollars in cash grants to needy families.

The drought has so far impacted over 1.6 million people, of whom at least 190,000 are in need of urgent food assistance, while there are concerns about the food security of an additional 700,000.

Over half of those impacted by the drought are from the northern and eastern provinces of the country, two of the poorest in the nation.

While the situation calls for immediate assistance, the WFP also warned that the affected would need long-term help to adapt to the impacts of changing climate patterns.

The World Bank estimates that the annual risk to Sri Lanka posed by climate-related disasters stands at some 380 million dollars. The worst disaster to date, a severe flood in 2010 and 2011, caused damages to the tune of 50 billion dollars.

FOCUS AREA: PREPAREDNESS

Results & Achievements

After an initial grant of US$70,000, a program involving the World Bank, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), and the Government of Djibouti has leveraged over $40 million in funds for disaster risk management projects.

GFDRR efforts also leveraged the creation of a $5 million national safety net to ease financial stresses caused by disasters.

The GFDRR-funded program installed 5 new hydrometeorological stations in different climatic areas around the country.

The program also catalyzed a $3 million water project to better manage resources in rural areas, along with a $5.2 million power access and energy diversification project.

GFDRR-funded projects have inspired the Djibouti government to pursue preparedness and resilience in cybersecurity, pandemics, and other sectors.

Situated on the Horn of Africa, Djibouti is highly vulnerable to prolonged droughts and flooding. The last major drought claimed nearly 4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) annually between 2008 and 2011 and impacted more than half of its 860,000 residents.

With funding and guidance from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), a vulnerability/risk assessment and communication platform was established comprised of hydrological early warning systems, flood and drought early warning systems, and seismic and floods risk/vulnerability assessment—the first of its kind in Africa.

With nearly 75 percent of its population concentrated in its capital city, Djibouti is at particular risk for water shortages and severe flooding, both of which profoundly impact its growing but fragile economic sector. The 2008-2011 drought caused upwards of $51 million in damages, and more than $157 million in losses. Additionally, given current growth rates, the country’s population is set to double in less than 15 years, increasing strain on Djibouti’s already stressed fresh water resources and its vulnerability to natural hazards (Djibouti’s fresh water availability per capita is only one fifth of neighboring Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia), with changes in climate only exacerbating these issues.

Approach

GFDRR and The World Bank have been partnering with the Government of Djibouti since 2007 in an effort to improve resilience and absorb natural shocks to the region’s burgeoning population and economic activity. GFDRR was able to leverage more than $40 million to fund various projects in disaster risk management and recovery, including the establishment of the Middle East and North Africa’s region first comprehensive risk assessment platform to address:

outdated preparedness and emergency plans;

improvements to weather monitoring systems;

needed seismic and flood vulnerability assessments;

inadequate flood and drought early warning systems.

Lessons Learned

Successful disaster risk management requires a multisectoral approach. The Government of Djibouti recognizes that disaster risk management is not a stand-alone activity, but is rather a cross-cutting practice that needs to be mainstreamed through all sectors to ensure sustainable results in development efforts. With trade logistics comprising nearly 85 percentof GDP, the Government has made it a priority to disaster-proof its economy, taking cues from the successful Comprehensive Approach to Risk Assessment in Djibouti (CARAD) project completed in partnership with GFDRR and the World Bank.

A multiplicity of voices can further risk reduction. Because input from both the regional and national level inform disaster management policies and implementation, GFDRR is helping solidify an institutional framework that will streamline communication between governance levels, ensuring that local knowledge is effectively incorporated into national policy.

Next Steps

A proposed third phase of technical assistance spanning 2014-2015 will consist of (1) operationalization of the risk assessment and communication platform that will inform infrastructure investments, (2) detailed spaceborne cartographic mapping of the entire country, and (3) integration of the recently finalized risk/vulnerability assessments for Djibouti-Ville in World Bank urban developments and efforts. Inspired by previous programs. The Government of Djibouti has also reached out to GFDRR to assist in implementing risk management techniques in novel sectors, including cyber-security and public health.","Mon, 18 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Results/drm/dj-gfdrr-impact-djibouti2.jpg,"['million', 'world', 'managing', 'sustaining', 'water', 'drought', 'risk', 'assessment', 'management', 'gfdrr', 'growth', 'disaster', 'djibouti']",

About 150 homes at the Meeriyabedda tea plantation in the district of Badulla, most of them small rooms constructed in a line and attached to one another, were crushed under mud around 7:30 a.m. It had been raining for days in the area, disaster management officials said. Most of the missing were tea plantation workers who lived in the homes, officials said.

Beyond the recovered bodies, many more are believed to be beneath 10 to 15 feet of mud.

“We don’t know how many people are under the soil,” said Udaya Kumara, assistant director at the Disaster Management Center, who is responsible for the district where the landslide occurred, adding. “I think more than 100 people will be dead.”

Mr. Kumara said the recovery of more bodies was impeded by rain that continued Wednesday afternoon.

10,10,Drought Sri Lanka,Climate change in Nicaragua pushes farmers into uncertain world - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/dec/10/climate-change-nicaragua-farming-drought-flood,"Mercedes Azevedo lost her house and 17 relatives when a mudslide triggered by hurricane Mitch engulfed her village in October 1998. More than 2,500 people died in the Casita Volcano tragedy, one of the worst in Nicaragua’s recent history.

Now, 51-year-old Azevedo and her fellow survivors find themselves under threat from the weather once again. This time it’s too little rain, not too much. “I lost all my crops in the first harvest: three manzanas (5.2 acres) of corn and one manzana of beans. Everything, gone … I rent my land and now have debts I can’t repay,” she says, standing on the porch of the house in Santa Maria, Chinandega province, where she was resettled after the hurricane.

Drought, floods and price hikes

She’s not alone. A severe four-month drought during this year’s “wet” season hit agricultural production in two-thirds of the country’s 153 municipalities. More than 100,000 farmers were affected, according to official figures.

At the height of the drought, thought to be the worst in Nicaragua for 44 years, the government needed to provide subsidised rice and beans to stave off a hunger crisis. At one stage, it even advised people to supplement their diet by breeding iguanas for consumption.

“It’s been tough. We’ve had to substitute beans for rice, tortillas and potatoes,” says 49-year-old Julieta Bucardo, a shopper in the central market of León. “The price of beans, for example, reached more than 37 cordovas (£0.89) recently. At the start of the year, we used to think 15 was a lot.” When the prolonged drought eventually ended in late August, it did so with such violence that the government announced an emergency to cope with the flash floods. Only with the recent arrival of the year’s second harvest has the price of staple grains begun to fall. Nicaragua’s recent weather patterns will not surprise many climate scientists. The 2013 global climate risk survey (pdf) places the Central American nation of 6 million people fourth in its list of countries most affected by climate change.

“The variability of the climate is starting to become an almost normal process, with long periods of drought and then floods,” says Germán Quezada, a climate specialist at Centro Humboldt, a Managua-based NGO.

“The problem is that the usual pattern of cultivation has been thrown up in the air. People just aren’t sure when to plant or what to plant,” says Quezada. “Small farmers are the worst hit because they don’t have the resources or irrigation that the large farmers have.”

A recent study (pdf) by the International Centre of Tropical Agriculture predicts that if temperatures continue to rise, Nicaragua could see its annual corn and bean production drop by up to 34,000 tonnes and 9,000 tonnes by 2020, respectively.



Counting the cost … coffee-growing in Matagalpa region, Nicaragua. Photograph: Oliver Balch

Nicaragua’s coffee industry is already counting the cost. The country’s second largest agricultural export earner registered losses of up to $60m in 2012-13 due to an outbreak of coffee leaf rust, which spread to 37% of the crop.

“Coffee leaf rust only used to affect farms below around 800 metres. With the changes in climate, we’re now seeing the disease reach as high as 1,300 metres,” says Santiago Dolmos, an agronomist with Cecocafen, a major coffee exporter.

Climate-friendly agriculture

“Treating these kind of losses as an emergency situation is not the answer. It has to be part of a longer-term development solution,” argues Azevedo.



For Nicaragua’s agribusiness lobby, such a solution lies in the greater use of chemicals and more advanced technological inputs. Upanic, for instance, an influential industry group, held the country’s first conference on agricultural biotechnology in October.

Environmental groups are pushing for a different approach, arguing that the best defence against climate change is a more diversified, more ecological approach to farming. Their arguments chime with Nicaragua’s strategy for food sovereignty and security (pdf), which includes a law promoting organic and agro-ecological production.



“Large-scale agriculture isn’t the answer,” argues Rafael Henríquez, a spokesman for Oxfam Nicaragua. “Ironically, it’s the poorest farmers that are closest to the agro-ecological model, although it’s more through necessity than environmental conviction.”

The national roundtable for risk management in Nicaragua, an alliance of 20 smallholder organisations, is working to formalise these incipient, ad hoc efforts with research and training in best practice.

Nicaragua’s commitment to small-scale, ecological agriculture is by no means secure, says Martín Cuadra, a rural development expert at Simas, a Managua-based research institute and member of the roundtable. He points to loopholes in a proposed law on the registration of seeds that could open the door to genetically modified crops. “The effects of climate change combine with global pressures from agribusiness companies to introduce GMOs,” says Cuadra, who believes such a move would ultimately imperil smallholders’ freedom. “Those who control the seeds control the stomach. And those who control the stomach, control life itself.”","Wed, 10 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/24/1416843034860/e9ef4200-4edf-48fa-8694-38cb256fee90-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4c1e8dc772ac02d8541c8a94b3c5a3b4,"['farmers', 'nicaraguas', 'world', 'uncertain', 'worst', 'pushes', 'change', 'climate', 'recent', 'drought', 'beans', 'nicaragua', 'price', 'control']", 
11,11,Drought Sri Lanka,Inbee Park Ends Asian Golf Drought – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2014/08/inbee-park-ends-asia-golf-drought/,"Advertisement

After struggling for nearly a year to rediscover her dominant form, South Korea’s Inbee Park finally ended her – and Asian golfers’ – major drought by winning last week’s Wegmans LPGA Championship in a playoff.

After Park won last year’s LPGA Championship, the four subsequent majors were won by Norway’s Suzann Pettersen and three Americans – Lexi Thompson, Michelle Wie and Mo Martin. The four-major stretch without a win was the longest drought for Asian golfers since they began dominating women’s golf in 2008.

For the former World No. 1, the victory in Pittsford, N.Y., ended a long stretch of near misses. After winning last year’s U.S. Women’s Open in June, Park went almost a year without a victory until winning the Manulife Financial LPGA Classic this June. Her performance in the majors also took a dive, as she finished outside of the top 35 in three consecutive tournaments.

Park was able to prevail last week thanks in part to the late collapse by Brittany Lincicome, who only needed a par on the final hole to claim her second major victory. But she botched an easy two-putt and then fell in the first playoff hole when she was unable to get up-and-down to save par.

By repeating as the LPGA champion, the 26-year-old Park now has five major victories, tying her for 13th on the all-time list. She won’t have to wait long to attempt to increase that total as the fifth LGPA major of the year, The Evian Championship, will be held September 11-14.

While Park has regained her championship form, another former World No. 1 is still trying to rediscover hers.

Taiwan’s Yani Tseng, who became the youngest golfer (male or female) to claim five major titles when she collected her fifth at the age of 22, finished tied for 30th at the LPGA. While that hardly measured up to her previous lofty standards, at least she’s making some progress.

After winning the Women’s British Open in 2011 to cement her status as the top player in the world, Tseng finished third in her next major at the 2012 Kraft Nabisco Championship, and then began a long descent into golf purgatory. She failed to finish in the top 25 in 11 of her next 12 majors, with five missed cuts and a T-19 at last year’s LPGA her best finish.

An attempt at a swing change worked to her detriment and as a result, a complete loss of confidence in her game plagued Tseng. Once one of the longest and most accurate drivers of the ball, Tseng contracted the same disease that befell another famous former world No. 1, Tiger Woods.

But Tseng’s sudden fall from golf superstardom was more stunning than Tiger’s in that she was not beset by injuries or personal issues. And despite a six-year drought in the majors, Woods did manage to lead the PGA Tour with five victories as recently as last year. Tseng last won an LPGA event in March 2012.

Tseng’s struggles are thus more reminiscent of yet another former world No. 1, David Duval. After winning his lone major championship at the 2001 British Open and finishing a stretch of top 16 or better in eight straight majors, his game completely fell apart. He’s never won another PGA Tour event and, save for a surprise T-2 at the 2009 U.S. Open, never had another top 10 in the majors.

During this year’s Women’s British Open at Royal Birkdale, Tseng was seen walking down the fairway with tears streaming down both of her cheeks during a ghastly round of 82 on Friday as she missed the cut. She now speaks wistfully about her better days as if it’s an out-of-body experience.

“Yani is still in there somewhere,” she said last Wednesday before the LPGA Championship. “My skill is still inside me. I just have to trust myself and let it out.”

She said she’s been getting advice from all sorts of people, “thousands,” ranging from LPGA hall of famers to random fans everywhere. And it’s not necessarily helping.

“That’s why I’m so confused,” Tseng said. “My left brain is fighting my right brain. Juli Inkster used to tell me that when you start to doubt yourself, that’s when you have a problem.

“When I started to doubt myself, I started to wonder if all those people were right. And then I’d start second-guessing myself all over again. … I have to stick to what I believe and trust it. But it’s so hard. It’s so much easier to say.”

It’s uncertain whether Tseng will ever regain her form that kept her on top of the world for 109 consecutive weeks. At this point, it’s probably a longshot that she’ll ever be a factor again in LPGA majors, even though at 25 she’s only entering the prime for most golfers.

Tseng is already eligible for induction into the World Golf Hall of Fame after the criteria was changed in March. She’s done enough by the age of 22 to warrant enshrinement, but that can’t happen until she either turns 40 or been retired for five years.

UNHCR Photo © UNHCR Photo

GENEVA, September 16 (UNHCR) - The UN refugee agency reported on Tuesday that forced evictions, drought, conflict and lack of livelihoods have prompted more than 100,000 Somalis to flee their homes so far this year, and displacement within Somalia and across its borders shows no signs of easing.

""The vast majority - some 80 per cent - are internally displaced in Somalia; while newly arrived Somali refugees have registered in Yemen, Kenya and Ethiopia during the first eight months of the year,"" UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told journalists in Geneva. ""Insecurity was the main cause of internal displacement, with some 80,000 people fleeing their homes because of military conflict,"" he added.

This displacement is attributed to military offensives by the Somalia government and African Union peace-keepers against the militant group Al Shabaab in south-central Somalia. It is expected to be temporary, with people returning to their homes once it is safe. Efforts to assist the displaced are, however, hampered by limited access to towns affected by military activity, with airlifts often the only way to get supplies to people in need.

Baloch said the forced evictions of internally displaced people (IDP) from both private and government-owned land and buildings had uprooted almost 23,000 people. Worst affected are the capital Mogadishu and the port city of Kismayo.

""UNHCR is engaged in dialogue with its counterparts among the Somali authorities to advocate for policies and measures to counter evictions that violate basic human rights. UNHCR distributed basic relief items to 3,000 displaced families in Kismayo in recent weeks, but additional distributions are required,"" the UNHCR spokesman said.

He added that many people were living in sites lacking basic services. They slept in shelters made of sticks, grass and cardboard. Baloch said incidents had been reported of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, against girls and women by militias operating outside the settlements.

Migration in the region continues into neighbouring Kenya and Ethiopia as well as Yemen which receives new arrivals by boat across the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. Most of the new arrivals come from the six regions in south-central Somalia most affected by drought, food insecurity and poverty. The total number of Somali refugees in the region stands at 957,000.

""This continuing displacement comes at a time when the internally displaced are bearing the brunt of the current food insecurity crisis in the country. IDPs spend proportionately more - up to 75 per cent - of their available income on food, compared to Somalis in rural and urban communities.

According to a recent survey by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), IDPs have the highest rates of severe acute malnutrition, while malnutrition rates are critical in seven of the 13 IDP sites surveyed. The under-five death rate among Mogadishu IDPs is six times the average.

""While UNHCR and other agencies are scaling up response, our Somalia operation requires more than US$40 million, and remains underfunded at 38 per cent,"" Baloch noted.","Tue, 16 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.unhcr.org/thumb1/541852e96.jpg,"['idps', 'homes', 'displaced', 'drought', 'food', 'lack', 'somalia', 'livelihoods', '100000', 'flee', 'displacement', 'military', 'evictions', 'force', 'somali', 'mogadishu', 'insecurity', 'unhcr']",

16,16,Drought Sri Lanka,8 ways Big Data helps improve global water and food security | Greenbiz - GreenBiz.com,https://www.greenbiz.com/article/8-ways-big-data-helps-improve-global-water-and-food-security,"Big Data is transforming agriculture, and just in time. The demand for food is expected to double by 2050 as the world's population heads toward 9 billion people and increasing incomes allow many more to afford a better diet. Lack of water is a critical constraint to increasing food production, particularly as droughts and other consequences of climate change are making water scarcer.

To help solve this enormous challenge, the agriculture and water communities are harnessing Big Data to ramp up food production with less pressure on our water resources. Experts from around the world gathered in Seattle this week at the Water for Food Global Conference to discuss ways to harness this data revolution in agriculture. Hosted by the Robert B. Daugherty Water for Food Institute at the University of Nebraska in association with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the conference focused on mobilizing Big Data to improve global water and food security.

With that in mind, here are eight ways Big Data is helping to create a more water- and food-secure world.

1. Satellite imagery and data

Satellites gather vast amounts of data that are used at global and local scales. For example, satellites can track atmospheric patterns, precipitation and ocean currents. Combined with weather data, researchers are using satellite data to develop better forecasting and risk-management tools to help farmers, whether in Nebraska or Ethiopia, make better decisions, and to help governments better plan for droughts and floods. Satellite data also can be used to home in on local areas to precisely map landscapes, analyze soils or assess crop yields, among many other uses.

2. Groundwater monitoring

Globally, agriculture consumes 70 percent of all freshwater withdrawals, primarily for irrigation, and groundwater is a key source of irrigation water. Data regarding aquifer conditions, groundwater withdrawals and other metrics are critical for water managers to prevent catastrophic aquifer depletions. Although water metering to potentially regulate use is unpopular — most recently in California as the state undertakes new groundwater management rules — it's been successfully used in areas of Nebraska for more than 40 years to help maintain groundwater levels, despite having the most irrigated acres in the nation.

3. Viewing advantages

These days, most people are familiar with the potential of drones outside the military. In agriculture, drones will help farmers, water managers and researchers peer into places otherwise difficult to see. They capture images of entire fields and can zoom into individual leaves to determine the plant's condition. Researchers are developing drones to go beyond capturing images to actually interact with the environment, taking leaf samples, gathering water samples, measuring crop height or applying herbicides to individual plants.

Cameras — and the ability to process huge data files — are giving us new perspectives on our world. In one example, the Platte Basin Timelapse Project from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln placed more than 40 cameras along the entire length of the Platte River watershed, from the headwaters in the Colorado Rockies through Nebraska to the Missouri River. The cameras take a picture every daylight hour. The visual timeline gives scientists, resource managers and the public a greater understanding of the influences agriculture, municipal water supplies, geological processes, restoration projects and other activities have on the watershed, leading to better watershed management.

4. Precision agriculture

Precision agriculture defies the stereotype of farmers as low-tech traditionalists. Today, a host of technology from GPS-equipped tractors to remote-controlled or even automated irrigation systems is turning farming into a high-tech business.

Water sensors placed throughout a field monitor soil moisture in real-time, which help a farmer decide when and how much to irrigate. Fed to computer-controlled irrigation systems, that information allows precise water applications rather than a single amount across an entire field.

In another example, computer-equipped combines gather data during harvest to create detailed yield maps, which are used to create a precise prescription of fertilizers and other inputs to improve productivity the following year. Such advances translate into higher yields using less water and energy. And, thankfully, the high-tech nature of agriculture is also attracting young people back to farming.

5. Global atlases

Where in the world do we have existing farmland with the capacity to produce much higher, stable yields? Which river basins are running dry, and why? Researchers are gathering and analyzing satellite, atmospheric, on-the-ground and historic data to create mapping tools and models that help governments and others improve agriculture and conserve water.

For example, the Global Yield Gap and Water Productivity Atlas, a global collaboration led by the Water for Food Institute, identifies existing farmland worldwide where significant gaps exist between actual and potential yields for different crops. The atlas estimates global yield trends and food security for global analyses and, perhaps more important, helps individual countries identify production potential to improve policy and to better strategize resource allocations and trade opportunities.

6. Regional mapping

Countries are taking on their own Big Data projects to better plan for the future. Sri Lanka, for example, recently began mapping many of its primary river basins and modeling climate risks to develop a comprehensive flood and drought mitigation plan. In the Dominican Republic, I participated in a project that created a spatial database of the country's entire irrigated properties. The data allows water managers to better maintain the country's extensive irrigation canal systems, conserve water and create equity among water users.

7. Smartphones

Big Data analysis and modeling can reach even subsistence farmers in remote areas. Many farmers in poor, rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, long isolated by insufficient phone service and roads, have cellphones. They now have access to weather forecasting and market information to make better decisions, manage money and develop a wider support network, thereby improving livelihoods as well as local water and food security.

8. Research advances

Science is driven by data. Greater data gathering and computing power is allowing researchers to develop drought-resistant crop breeds, better understand climate change and create models that help us understand risks and opportunities moving forward, among other research goals.

Much data is flowing in agriculture, creating numerous opportunities to increase food production without compromising limited water resources. But many challenges remain to ensure the data flows efficiently and to those who need it most.

17,17,Drought Sri Lanka,China’s water diversion project starts to flow to Beijing - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/12/china-water-diversion-project-beijing-displaced-farmers,"On Friday afternoon, China quietly inaugurated one of the biggest engineering projects of all time: the South-North Water Diversion, a £48bn, 2,400km network of canals and tunnels, designed to divert 44.8bn cubic metres of water annually from China’s humid south to its parched, industrialised north.

At 2.32pm, the project’s “middle line” officially began carrying water from the Danjiangkou reservoir in central China’s Hubei province to Beijing – the distance from Corsica to London. The project, officials say, will save China from a water crisis that could set its development back years.

It has also destroyed Wang Yanhe’s life. Wang was born near the Danjiangkou reservoir in 1979, married young and had two children – the family lived between a small stream and a leafy hillside, and grew a variety of grains. In 2009, seven years after the project was approved, officials informed him that the reservoir’s water levels were rising and that his village would be submerged. About 345,000 villagers have been displaced by the project to date, and Wang soon became one of them. The government gave him a home in the Heba New Migrant Village by a dusty highway in rural Pingdingshan, a coal-rich municipality in neighbouring Henan province whose name translates to “flat mountain”.

Then came the drought. This summer was Pingdingshan’s driest in 63 years – Wang’s corn crop only grew to knee-height, forcing him to abandon his harvest. “Nothing is as good as before,” he said, chain-smoking cigarettes in his concrete-floored living room. His roof leaks; he can’t speak the local dialect. Officials promised him 0.2 acres of land, but only gave him 0.15. “After we arrived, we realised that the land was all dry,” he said. “So it doesn’t even matter what they promised us.”

The Henan Daily newspaper announced the line’s inauguration in a pithy microblog post on Friday. “Being a peoples’ engineering project, in keeping with a frugal and pragmatic working style, celebratory activities will be kept as simple as possible,” it said. “No officials will take part in the ceremonies.”

China’s booming economy over the past three decades, coupled with a long-held mandate to “grow first, clean up later”, has been cataclysmic for the country’s once-bountiful lakes, rivers and aquifers. More than half of China’s 50,000 rivers have vanished over the past two decades, according to China’s first national census of water, published last year. About 70% of its remaining fresh water is polluted. “If we continue with our business-as-usual model, China will basically run out of water,” said Feng Hu, a water analyst with the Hong Kong-based research group China Water Risk. “It won’t have enough water to power its economy.”

The project has roots in an offhand comment by Mao Zedong who, on an inspection tour in the early 1950s, said: “The south has plenty of water, but the north is dry. If we could borrow some, that would be good.” The project has three sections: a 1,150km eastern line, which runs from the lower Yangtze River to Tianjin; the middle line, from Danjiangkou to Beijing; and a western line, which could some day link the headwaters of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers across the high-altitude Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The eastern line began delivering water to coastal Shandong province last winter. The western line remains largely conceptual, so grand in scale that it may ultimately prove impossible to build.

While the project could provide some much-needed relief, it “will never solve north China’s water problem”, said Jennifer Turner, director of the China Environment Forum at the Wilson Center in Washington DC. She called the project a “Band-Aid” rather than a long-term solution. “The challenge in the water sector, writ large, is that it is so hooked into supply-side management,” she said. “It’s like the engineers in China have a special tattoo that says ‘nothing is too big’ – they’ll move water massive distances rather than get deep and dirty into the mess of pushing effective water conservation.”

In February, Qiu Baoxing, vice-minister of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, called the project unsustainable. “As the scale of the project gets bigger and the distance gets longer, it is more and more difficult to divert water,” he wrote. “Recycled water could replace diverted water. Most Chinese cities are capable of finding more water if we develop water desalination technology and collect more rain water.”

Experts say the south may no longer have enough water to spare. They say the project could decimate the Han River, an important tributary of the Yangtze – about 40% of the river’s water will eventually be diverted north, despite acute water shortages that already plague the cities along its banks. In 2011, five months of drought in Hubei province left 315,000 people short of drinking water. The Danjiangkou reservoir dropped to four metres below “dead water” level, rendering it unusable. Speculation that the South-North Water Diversion project caused this year’s drought grew so heated that state media issued a denial. “Henan province is the recipient of benefits from the [project],” Yang Biantong, a spokesman for Henan’s flood control and drought relief department, told the People’s Daily in late August. “Not only has it not had a negative effect, the [project] has also been extremely helpful.”

Christine Boyle, founder of Blue Horizon Insight and an expert on China’s water issues, said the issue boils down to how one defines a drought. In addition to crippling weather droughts – periods of little rainfall – China is also suffering from economic droughts, which occur when the demand for water outstrips supply. “You can’t say the South-North Water Diversion is causing a weather drought,” she said. “But you can say it’s intensifying an economic drought.” Many Chinese farmers are already economically squeezed, and increasingly erratic weather patterns, perhaps related to climate change – freezing winters, blistering summers, floods and droughts – are now pushing them into a state of emergency.

The South-North Water Diversion project began sending emergency water supplies to Pingdingshan in mid-August and, according to the official newswire Xinhua, the diversion was a success. The middle line delivered more than 50m cubic metres of water to the city’s Baiguishan reservoir over a month and a half, it said, “effectively relieving the scarce water supply of Pingdingshan city’s one million-plus residents”.

While that water has flowed into the taps of Pingdingshan’s urbanites and the cooling systems of its coal-fired power plants, farmers on the city outskirts have been left to fend for themselves. Chang Xiangdang, 40, lives with his family of six in Malou Village, population 1,000, a dense cluster of cinderblock houses only a few hundred metres from the project’s main channel. From his small patch of radish and cabbage, high concrete embankments stretch to the horizon and an arch-like sluice rises like a mirage. “The channel runs through our town, but there’s no way to get the water, no gap in the wall,” he said. Villagers rely on groundwater for bathing and cooking. In previous years, they could dig 20 metres to reach the aquifer. This year, even 80-metre wells are running dry.

Chang said the lack of water has thrown his life into flux. Like Wang, the displaced farmer, he has given up on this year’s corn harvest. His family has been subsisting on a compensation package that project officials gave him four years ago, when they requisitioned much of his farmland. Another dry summer, he says, would leave him destitute. He has considered taking a construction job in the city. “There’s no more water here,” he said. “I’ll do what it takes to survive.”","Fri, 12 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/12/1418391720718/China-south-north-water-p-012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a936110efabf998dafb3af5df684619c,"['line', 'flow', 'china', 'metres', 'province', 'diversion', 'water', 'drought', 'beijing', 'say', 'project', 'officials', 'chinas', 'starts']",

19,19,Drought Sri Lanka,Takeo rice farmers pray for rain - The Phnom Penh Post,https://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/takeo-rice-farmers-pray-rain,"Farmer Nhem Tum says there has been much less rain this year than in previous years

Takeo rice farmers pray for rain

After hours spent tunnelling through the wall of an irrigation channel, water finally flows out of Nhem Tum’s makeshift drain onto his dry quarter-hectare rice field. The success in tapping one of the few water sources in Takeo province is a small victory in the farmer’s ongoing struggle to cope with climate change.

“I have sown rice seed twice from May to July, but it does not grow,” Tum said earlier this week. He has lost $130 spent on rice seeds for his tiny patch.

Children by the roadside in Takeo province

“There has been no rain this year, which is so different from previous years, when I would sow the rice seed and the rain would come, making enough water for rice to grow,” he added.

While reports of flooding and its mounting death toll have become fixtures in local media, Tum is among thousands of farmers in Takeo affected by a very different problem: drought.

A yearly dry spell that typically only lasts for a few weeks of July has this year stretched well into August. According to provincial authorities, more than 25,000 hectares have been damaged by drought across Takeo over the past four weeks – five times the figure recorded last year.

Authorities estimate that up to 60,000 hectares of rice fields across 10 provinces have been damaged this year, with Takeo hardest hit.

“I can say that this year is the worst for Takeo province,” said Nheb Sron, director of the agriculture department there.

Sron’s provincial government is pumping water from receding Mekong-fed reservoirs into dry irrigation channels, but he says that their resources are stretched. They do not have the means to pump directly into each rice field, leaving farmers to weigh up the cost of paying the fuel costs for pumping water against the hope that it might rain.

“It is quite difficult for us to make sure there is enough water for farmers. The weather is unpredictable,” he said.

Irrigation channels, one of the few options available to farmers in times of drought, are estimated to benefit just 20 per cent of cultivated land in Cambodia.

In the distance, the clouds are dark

“In many areas, they have irrigation systems, but the problem is, they don’t have the distribution channels for that and they don’t have the pump,” said independent economist and agriculture expert Srey Chanty.

Chanty added that a lack of funds for seeds to replant a lost crop and fuel to pump water from the irrigation channels compound a farmer’s inability to respond to natural disasters.

In a country prone to natural disasters, drought has damaged more than 775,000 hectares of land since 1996, a figure second only to floods, which account for 1.7 million hectares of damage, according to data from the National Committee of Disaster Management (NCDM).

Flooding, which often follows the July dry spell, presents a different set of problems to drought. As well as damaging agricultural crops, rising waters can wreak havoc on schools and hospitals.

Last year alone, the NCDM estimates that flooding caused more than $355 million in damage across agriculture, infrastructure and people’s homes.

The NCDM estimates that the future disaster recovery needs for the agriculture sector to battle flooding is about $76 million.

This covers funding in the first six months to immediately rehabilitate irrigation systems following flood damage and funding allocated to the longer term – some 18 months and beyond – for construction of new irrigation canals.

Keo Vy, chief of cabinet at NCDM, said yesterday that they are still counting the costs of this year’s drought, though the rain is beginning to fall in some of the affected provinces, bringing the dry spell under control, he said.

The earth is dry and cracked after weeks of drought

“Farmers are still depending on rainfall for most of their crops,” he said.

“The government has also been paying attention to improving and building more irrigation systems, so farmers can access to water to increase rice production, so that they are less dependent on rainfalls.”

But not everyone can wait.

Takeo rice farmer Hem Lim recently spent $30 on fuel to pump water from the canal to his rice field.

Looking at the darkening skies on the horizon he said: “The rain and the dark clouds always seem to be heading towards Phnom Penh, where there are no rice fields.”","Sat, 23 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/drought-photos-dan-5.jpg,"['farmers', 'dry', 'rain', 'pray', 'pump', 'water', 'drought', 'irrigation', 'takeo', 'hectares', 'rice']",

Rajapaksa, who cut fuel and electricity prices last month, increased state employees’ wages, boosted pensions and raised guaranteed prices for commodities on Friday, presenting the 2015 budget to parliament. He unveiled plans to narrow the budget deficit to an almost 40-year low of 4.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) amid an expansion rate of about 8%.

Rajapaksa is seeking a third term in office as the island nation prepares for elections two years before schedule. The fiscal gap has shrunk each year since the end of a three-decade civil war in 2009, boosting room for him to court votes with spending even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) calls for reduced reliance on debt financing.

“It could be seen as an election-related budget,"" said Adrian Perera, chief executive officer at Lanka Ratings Agency Ltd. “Maintaining growth will be key to achieve the revenue targets to narrow the deficit.""

Rajapaksa set the minimum wage for state workers at 15,000 rupees ($115) a month, while raising a cost of living allowance to 10,000 rupees, and pledged to eradicate salary anomalies among railway employees. He offered a guaranteed price of 60 rupees a liter for milk and raised that for paddy to 40 rupees per kilogram from 34 rupees while keeping fertilizer subsidies.

The president also cut the value-added tax to 11% from 12%, lowered milk powder prices and unveiled a 10% reduction in water tariffs for the first 25 units of a bill. The measures will help boost consumption, according to Bimanee Meepagala, fund manager at NDB Wealth Management Ltd. in Colombo.

‘Boost Demand’

“The budget is in line with the plan to narrow the deficit and takes steps to boost consumer demand,"" she said.

Economic growth may accelerate to 8% in 2015 from an estimated 7.8% this year, with exports growing faster than imports and credit growth recovering, the central bank said in a report on its website on Friday. Inflation is seen around 4% for the rest of 2014 and “appropriate forward-looking monetary policy measures are expected to be implemented to maintain inflation at a level below 5%,"" the monetary authority said.

The fiscal shortfall is estimated at 5% of GDP this year, Friday’s budget document showed.

Losing Ground

A provincial poll last month saw Rajapaksa’s United People’s Freedom Alliance coalition lose about 21% vote share as higher prices of rice, wheat flour and milk powder—partly due to a drought this year—drove up living costs.

“We voted for Mahinda in the past,"" said P. Senathiraja, 32, who was among voters in Uva and said he can no longer pay the mortgage for his truck as food costs are eating into his disposable income. “He won the war and also built roads. But even if he built roads, we also have to eat and live.""

Harin Fernando, opposition lawmaker who won the highest preferential votes at the Uva election said that “until this time there was a perception that this government will never fall."" Investment in infrastructure hasn’t filtered through to benefit people who still “struggle for their living,"" he said.

Monetary policy alone can’t sustain Sri Lanka’s growth momentum and the government needs to boost and diversify investment, ensure a consistent regulatory framework and improve infrastructure, Eteri Kvintradze, resident representative for the IMF, said in a 26 September interview in Colombo.

Previous Election

Rajapaksa won almost 58% of the 10.4 million votes cast in a January 2010 poll, compared with 40% for former army chief Sarath Fonseka, after his troops defeated the separatist Tamil Tigers.

That was the strongest mandate in 16 years and gave Rajapaksa a second six-year term. Under constitutional changes ending term limits that were passed in September 2010, he’s able to run for a third time.

Rajapaksa also heads Sri Lanka’s key defence and finance ministries, together with ports, highways and aviation, while his brother Basil Rajapaksa is minister of economic development, sibling Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the defence secretary and son Namal is a member of parliament.

Rajapaksa would still be the frontrunner in this presidential poll as he has “the power of the state machinery behind him"" and the opposition remains divided, Sasha Riser- Kositsky, Asia Associate at Eurasia, wrote in an 10 October email.

The impact on the economy of a Rajapaksa loss would depend on who the new president is and the strength of the opposition coalition, according to Riser-Kositsky. “A weak replacement president would be on balance unlikely to be willing or able to make the macroeconomic adjustments that Sri Lanka’s economy needs to continue to grow rapidly,"" Riser-Kositsky wrote.

21,21,Drought Sri Lanka,Geothermal Energy Collides With Drinking Water Needs in High Sierra - NBCNews.com,https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/geothermal-energy-collides-drinking-water-needs-high-sierra-n218201,"A bitter battle is playing out on the eastern slopes of the Sierra and it’s all about water: hot versus cold.

The town of Mammoth Lakes is marshaling forces against a geothermal company that wants to substantially increase the amount of hot water it’s pumping from a source deep underground. Mammoth residents fear that the expanded pumping could threaten the aquifer that sits hundreds of feet above the hot water zone and supplies 70 percent of the community’s drinking water.

That cold water aquifer has taken on even greater significance during California’s persistent drought.

Locals say they aren’t against geothermal power; they just want the company to commit to drilling dedicated deep wells that would allow constant monitoring of changes in the hot water zone and provide a warning of any threat to the cold water aquifer.

""Somewhere a compromise has to be struck.""

The company agrees that monitoring is important, says Bob Sullivan, a senior vice president at Ormat Technologies. But Sullivan doesn’t believe there’s a need to drill expensive deep wells solely to keep track of water pressures and chemistry. He says the hot zone can be monitored by taking working wells off line periodically to gather measurements.

It’s not as if the water is removed permanently from the geothermal zone. It’s put back after its heat has been used to create electricity — but not in the same spot it came from.

The geothermal zone can be looked at as an underground river that starts west of the town and flows eastward until it hits the surface at a lower-elevation spot called Big Hot Springs in the Hot Creek Gorge.

Ormat essentially pumps hot water from this “river” and then returns it, cooler, through a well further downstream.

What has people concerned is the distance between where the water is removed and where it is returned. It’s possible that removing that water could cause a pressure drop in the geothermal zone that might then draw down water from the cold water reservoir, says Bill Evans, a research chemist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif. Or, it might cause steam and other gases to shoot up into the cold water aquifer, potentially contaminating it. That scenario, Evans says, is less likely.

Ormat would increase the amount of pumping by about 50 percent overall but double the amount from wells in the area that the water district says are most sensitive. The water coming up would be much hotter than the current flow, allowing Ormat to double its power output to about 60 megawatts. The plant’s power flows off to homes and industries in Southern California and San Francisco.

While everyone agrees there should be some sort of monitoring, the battle is being waged over how it should be done.

Currently the town is asking that four deep wells be drilled along with an assortment of shallower ones.The USGS is suggesting at least one, but preferably two new deep wells. Ormat is arguing that no dedicated deep monitoring wells are needed and that enough measurements can be taken from production wells.

“We make recommendations for monitoring,” Evans says. “But we’re not an enforcement agency. We just say that these are the wells you should have and how often they should be measured. Neither side has to follow our recommendations. But somewhere a compromise has to be struck.”

Patrick Hayes, the general manager at the Mammoth Community Water District, said he can’t begin imagine how much damage would result should the water supply be compromised.

“The counties of Mono, Inyo, and Alpine all depend on tourism in the summer and winter,” Hayes says. “Without a reliable water supply there isn’t much viability in the community.

Mammoth Lakes, for example, has about 8,000 permanent residents, but that number swells to about 35,000 during tourist seasons, Hayes says.

“Ormat wants the risk to be borne by the community,” Hayes says. To him, the deep monitoring wells are his community’s “insurance.”

For his part, Sullivan says that the decision not to drill deep monitoring wells isn’t written in stone. But he’s going to have to be convinced that there is a need.

Evans suspects that ultimately the project will go smoothly, but he points to places in the area where steam rises to the surface.

“You have to look at those and say there are through-going faults, pathways where hot and cold could be connected,” he says. “So, in my opinion, despite all the groundwater models you draw and the predictions you make, ultimately you have to have monitoring in place to make sure there isn’t an impact.”","Sat, 04 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2014_40/700251/141003-mammoth-lakes-plant-2014-700251.jpg","['needs', 'wells', 'hot', 'drinking', 'water', 'monitoring', 'energy', 'mammoth', 'cold', 'geothermal', 'zone', 'hayes', 'collides', 'deep', 'high', 'sierra']",

Xi Jinping pointed out that this is our fourth meeting this year. China and Kazakhstan have maintained close high-level exchanges, which fully embodies the high level and uniqueness of China-Kazakhstan comprehensive strategic partnership, playing an important role in guiding the development of bilateral relations. You paid state visit to China and attended the fourth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) this May, and the various consensuses we reached then are now being effectively implemented. As for the issue of expanding Kazakhstan's export of agricultural products and mineral resources to China concerned by you, I have already instructed relevant Chinese departments to study and they are now actively working out a solution.

Xi Jinping stressed that during my visit to Kazakhstan last year, I put forward the initiative of building the Silk Road Economic Belt, in which the cooperation in infrastructure construction, economy, trade, energy, investment and other fields serves as a key direction. Kazakhstan is our important cooperative partner, and China is willing to, together with Kazakhstan, further promote energy cooperation in crude oil trade, gas field development, oil and gas equipment manufacturing and so on, expand the scale of local currency swap, and intensify youth exchanges. Both sides should also enhance cooperation in law enforcement security and jointly combat the ""three evil forces"".

Nursultan Nazarbayev said that under President Xi Jinping's personal care and promotion, Kazakhstan-China relations have reached a very high level with smooth high-level exchanges and fruitful strategic cooperation. All of their meetings enjoy an atmosphere of sincerity and mutual-trust. He cherishes the friendship with President Xi Jinping, and is willing to continuously maintain close exchanges with President Xi Jinping to jointly promote bilateral cooperation and make Kazakhstan-China relations a model in relations between regional countries. Kazakhstan hopes to take the opportunity of jointly building the Silk Road Economic Belt to expand bilateral cooperation in fields such as energy, two-way investment, processing and manufacturing and transit transport, well build the Central Asia-China natural gas pipeline and elevate the level of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, as well as the Central Asian countries and China. The Ili River basin is hit by drought this year, and China has conquered difficulties and urgently carried out water diversion to Kazakhstan, which has alleviated drought in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan appreciates it.

Xi Jinping stressed that the Dushanbe Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) this time is very successful. China and Kazakhstan should jointly promote the member states to enhance unity and cooperation, constantly advancing the SCO.

Xi Jinping noted that the successful holding of the fourth CICA Summit symbolizes that the CICA has entered a new development stage. China is willing to, together with Kazakhstan, grasp the general direction of the CICA development, advocate and promote the practice of Asian security concept and strengthen the institutionalization construction of the CICA so as to build a solid and strong CICA and advance it in a stable and far-reaching way.

Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed that he fully agrees to President Xi Jinping's speech at today's SCO Summit, especially the proposition on enhancing cooperation among the member states. Kazakhstan thanks China for successfully holding the CICA Summit and for its significant contributions to advancing the CICA as the rotating presidency of the CICA.

24,24,Drought Sri Lanka,California Super Storm Climate-Driven? Still Insufficient to Quell Drought - Insurance Journal,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2014/12/12/349932.htm,"A Pineapple Express “super storm” now lashing California may be driven by climate change, a report states.

Yet however strong the storm and no matter what’s causing it, California’s ongoing storm would need to be replicated at least five more times for meteorologists to declare an end to the state’s historic drought, according to a Bloomberg news story.

The storm is one of the most powerful to hit the state in years. A National Weather Service flood advisory was in effect for California’s San Joaquin Valley through noon today.

“Doppler radar indicated heavy rain causing urban and small stream flooding in the advisory area. up to two inches of rain have already fallen,” an NWS flood alert states. “Some road flooding has already been reported…including parts of highway 99.”

Rain is forecast throughout the day all over the state. In San Francisco today’s forecast calls for showers, thunderstorms and high surf advisories. Rain, thunderstorms and wind gusts are forecast for Los Angeles, while in San Diego wind gusts of 20 mph are expected along with rain and thunderstorms.

The state’s mountain areas are also expected to get plenty of snow. Blizzard warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra Nevadas. Two to 6 inches of snow were expected at lower levels and up to 9 inches at higher levels, on top of several feet of snow that has been falling over the past week.

However, below-normal rain and snowfall have left reservoirs at less than a third of capacity, so at least five similar storms would have to follow to replenish the deficits, Alan Haynes, service coordination hydrologist at the California Nevada River Forecast Center in Sacramento, told Bloomberg.

“We need a much wetter-than-normal season to recover,” Haynes said. “If we don’t get the precipitation up in the mountains, we don’t address the long-term supply issues that we’re facing.”

The moisture is coming from long streams of clouds and atmospheric vapor, many of which originate from Hawaii or beyond and are known as the “Pineapple Express,” brought from the Tropics.

“It’s essentially a fire hose of water brought up from the tropics that comes up and crashes into the West Coast,” said Michael Dettinger, an atmospheric scientist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla.

According to Climate Nexus, a communications group that works to highlight the impacts of climate change and clean energy solutions in the U.S., atmospheric river storms are responsible for 30 percent to 50 percent of all the precipitation in California and are also responsible for over 80 percent of major flooding events.

A report by Climate Nexus issued late Thursday states that climate research indicates that the impacts of these storms are expected to escalate dramatically if carbon emissions continue to be produced, and that atmospheric rivers may already be impacted by current warming:

As the world heats up and more heat is carried in the atmosphere as water vapor, heavy precipitation events are becoming more intense.

Climate models project that atmospheric river storms in California will become more frequent and intense in the future, which means it is likely that the current storm is a taste of what’s to come.

Surface temperatures off the coast of California during this particular storm are much warmer than usual, helping to pump even more moisture into the storm.

According to Climate Nexus, computer models predict that climate change will cause the very worst atmospheric river storms hitting California to become much more frequent and larger.

“One model illustrating the impacts of a large-scale atmospheric storm, similar in scope to the infamous river storm of 1861 that turned the Central Valley into an inland lake, found that such an event would inflict over $400 billion in damages in modern day California,” the group states.

25,25,Drought Sri Lanka,Grow more food with less water? There's an app for that - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/sep/25/water-scarcity-drought-food-tech-california-israel,"Today some 2.8 billion people face insufficient supplies of fresh water, and according to the United Nations that number is set to increase to half the world’s population by 2030. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that 40% of the world’s food depends on irrigation, which accounts for almost 70% of fresh water used.



It makes sense then that farmers are turning to new and old technology in an attempt to manage their water.



Measure twice, pump once

The old business dogma, “If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”, holds especially true with water usage. But in many places around the world the amount of water diverted from rivers or pumped from the ground to irrigate crops is not measured. Even California groundwater was totally unregulated until this month.

That’s a political rather than a technological problem, said Peter Gleick, co-founder of the Pacific Institute, an independent research organization focused on water issues. Flow meters to measure water use are neither new nor expensive, Gleick said. But in many places groundwater has long been considered a property right, so farmers have seen no need measure or justify how they use it.

But with drought and over-pumping dropping water tables, some are beginning to recognize that better water use tracking will help to keep a dwindling resource flowing.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Wellntel, a water technology company, is answering that need with a water-measuring system that uses sound sensors to detect the water level in a well – without touching the water or opening the well. The sensors transmit data to the Wellntel website, where customers can log in to private accounts and see their water level at various points: when pumping, after rainfall, and over time.

In an attempt to mollify farmers, Wellntel specifically touts a farmer’s right not to share data on the amount of water used with anyone else.



Waste not, want not

The first place to save water is in conveyance: as much as 60% of the water withdrawn for irrigation is lost through leaks in canals, spillage and evaporation, according to the FAO.

Another part of the problem is flood irrigation – the most common method of field irrigation globally. About half the water on flood irrigated fields isn’t absorbed by crops, according to the US Geological Survey. Instead it runs off, taking with it fertilizers, pesticides and topsoil that pollute water bodies around the world and cause dead zones, areas where too much fertilizer causes algae to bloom, which in turn sucks oxygen out of the water, killing other life.

Flood irrigation is commonplace because it’s cheap. But in response to strained water supplies, some farmers have made the shift to much more efficient underground irrigation or precision micro-sprinkler and drip irrigation systems that deposit tiny amounts of water directly above the roots of crops. These systems also help farmers earn more money by allowing them to plan more acreage while using less water than before.



The up-front cost of a drip system is significant – about $500 to $1000 per acre, according to the FAO. Even though these investments pay for themselves within a few years thanks to better water-use efficiency and lower irrigation-related energy bills, many farmers don’t have the cash – or credit access – to install them.



However a Middle Eastern firm has developed a new low-tech solution that also places water right at the roots of crops and can work with or without drip irrigation – and comes with a much smaller price tag.



In Israel, where water scarcity has been a way of life for decades, Tal-Ya (“God’s dew” in Hebrew) manufactures trays that capture dew and funnel it to plants, often tree crops. The 28- by 22-inch polypropylene trays trap air underneath themselves as well, insulating plants from extreme temperatures and catching moisture evaporating from the earth to create a perpetually moist soil pocket around the roots. They also block weeds that would otherwise compete with crops for water.



Each tray costs $3 to $5 apiece.



Mickey Chesla, Tal-Ya’s vice president of marketing and sales, said the trays can reduce water use by up to 90% although 50% is more typical. They can also reduce fertilizer use by 30% because the trays direct the nutrient straight to the plant’s roots.



While introducing more plastic into the environment might not seem like a great idea, Tal-Ya states that its trays last for up to 10 years and are 100% recyclable. Since beginning commercial production in 2013, farmers in Israel, the United States, China, Chile, Georgia, Sri Lanka, and Australia have adopted them according to the company’s web site.



This past spring Tal-Ya was a runner-up in the Imagine H20 food and agriculture competition. Its tray system “improves agricultural yields without increasing resource allocation”, said Scott Bryan, Imagine H2O’s chief operating officer. “These solutions that enable farmers to produce more with less are proving crucial to surviving the California drought,” he said.



Just in time

Another way to avoid waste is to avoid watering when it’s about to rain or the soil is still moist. A variety of systems – including Measure-Tek, Ranch Systems and Pure Sense – use weather-monitoring stations and soil moisture probes that send data via radio or cellular signals to a grower’s computer or smart phone. Some can be programmed to turn irrigation off and on as needed.



Taking this concept to the extreme, Oakland, California-based Fruition Sciences has created a web application that crunches data from more than 40 sensors to determine whether crops need more water. The system tracks crop nutrient uptake, aerial photos, and weather and soil conditions. One special sensor tracks sap flowing through grapevines.



“People are overwatering,” said Thibaut Scholasch, founder and vice president of research and development for the company. “Everywhere we go, from Spain to Argentina to California to Italy to France, we measure a plant response showing that vines are much more resilient than we think.”



“We are teaching people to un-train their eyes: drippy-looking leaves do not mean the plant needs water”, Scholasch said. “Often it simply means the weather is hot even if there is still plenty of water in the root system.”

Fruition Sciences is working with farmers in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District on a project to save water. “So far we have saved anywhere from 40% to 100% of water used for irrigation,” Scholasch said. The range reflects a big swing in how much a grower is over-irrigating as well as the spatial variability and climate dryness of a given vineyard.

The systems aren’t cheap however. Costs range from $40 to $5,000 for a “site” which can be as large as 50 acres – if the field is planted with a single crop – but is often much smaller.

The expense has so far limited the appeal of Fruition Sciences’ system to use with wine grapes. But Scholasch said the firm is currently testing the technology with other cash crops.

From restraint to reuse

An even more nuanced way to manage watering is a strategy called regulated deficit irrigation. The goal is to irrigate crops just enough to maximize crop-water productivity by reducing irrigation at the point of diminishing returns. For example, reducing water by 50% might result in a yield reduction of just 10%. Some crops, such as wine grapes and certain nuts, actually benefit from water stress during drought-tolerant life stages.

Regulated deficit irrigation can be implemented with any type of irrigation system. It is sometimes used with rain-fed crops, adding a bit of irrigation during droughts or in sensitive growth stages, such as when the plants are producing vegetation and during final ripening.

Reuse is also growing in appeal, with urban wastewater being lightly treated and directed to landscaping, industry, power plant cooling, groundwater recharge – and crop irrigation.

“In Monterey and Salinas Valley, much of the strawberries and artichokes are grown with recycled wastewater effluent,” said David Sedlak, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley.

A new technology from Calgary-based Livestock Water Recycling is treating animal waste for reuse on row crops in what amounts to a little sewage treatment plant. The nutrients in the treated sewage benefit the crops by reducing the need for fertilizer inputs, and reduce pollutant runoff because the plants absorb some of the nutrients.

It’s an improvement over the common lagoon system, in which waste sits in a pool for multiple months, to allow solids to settle out before being sprayed on crops. These pools emit toxic gases and can leak into nearby water bodies.

Farmers can also capture flood irrigation runoff and reuse it. This kind of reuse is easier and more cheaply done in organic farming, where the water contains fewer fertilizers and pesticides, than in more conventional agriculture.

And dry-land farmers have developed many strategies to collect rain via barrels and cisterns for direct use, and to resupply groundwater using bioswales (land features that filter water), buffer strips, off-stream storage reservoirs and natural wetlands.

Right-cropping

Not all countries or regions may be able to be self-sufficient in food production. Fifty-one percent of the world’s population may rely on food imports in 2050, according to a study last year in Environmental Research Letters. Certain crops need less water and are well suited to dry environments, whereas others such as rice, cotton, or alfalfa – notoriously thirsty crops – are probably better left to wetter regions. Choosing to grow the right crops for the climate – right-cropping – is important in making the most of available water.

Countries in the Persian Gulf are turning increasingly to international food imports after decades of depleting their groundwater.

Israel, too, is spending more of its limited water resources on industries other than agriculture, earning money to buy food internationally. “There may be no countries in the Middle East that have enough water to be self-sufficient in agriculture,” said Gleick of the Pacific Institute.

However, some countries are buying land in wetter countries to grow their food, a practice that can jeopardize local food security, environmental justice and human rights. A study last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found land grabbing inextricably linked to gaining water rights, with 60% taken by the United States, the United Arab Emirates, India, the United Kingdom, Egypt, China and Israel. Forty-seven percent of such land purchases occurred in Africa and 33% in Asia.

There is also a growing debate over whether some non-food crops should be grown at all in an increasingly water-scarce world. Feedstocks for biofuels, for example, take hundreds of gallons of water per gallon of fuel to produce. The International Energy Agency predicts a 317% percent increase in water consumption by biofuel crops by 2035.

Happy soil, happy plant life

While modern industrial agriculture has tended to treat soil merely as a medium that props up plants – first bombing it with insecticides and pesticides, then applying fertilizer to pump up the plants – healthy soil has built-in plant nutrients, absorbs water more deeply and retains it better.

Many traditional agricultural practices – such as reduced tillage, crop rotation, planting cover crops, applying compost, manure, or mulch – nurture the microscopic critters that live in soil. But ways to increase soil moisture and water efficiency are also coming to conventional farming.Polymer soil additions have been researched for 20 years as a means to help soil retain moisture. The idea is that when the farmer irrigates, the polymer absorbs water that would otherwise run off and holds it around the seed.

Bay Area-based mOasis, which produces a soil polymer called BountiGel, claims its product is a significant advance on this concept: it doesn’t break down before the plant can use it, said Steven Hartmeier, mOasis’ CEO. But it does break down. It’s harmless to soil microorganisms because it is highly diluted in the soil at about 10 parts per million, he said.

Made of ingredients already approved for human use and consumption, BountiGel has been approved for use by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Roda Group, a venture capital firm based in Berkeley, Calif., has invested more than $5m in mOasis.

In use the polymer has shown the potential for 25% higher crop yields due to decreased stress on plants, 25% reduced water use overall, and 15% savings on water-related energy utilities, Hartmeier said. “We had a tomato grower this year that would normally drip-irrigate every seven days, and with our product, they stretched it out nine to 11 days.”

Although BountiGel costs about $150 an acre, an average grower can generate about $900 more per acre thanks to increased yield and water savings, according Hartmeier.

The farmers he works with, like farmers nearly everywhere around the world, “need to figure out how to grow more with less water”, Hartmeier said. “We have a water problem in California, and it’s not going away.”

This article was amended 29 September to correct the spelling of mOasis CEO Steven Hartmeier’s name.

SAN FRANCISCO — The ancient Mayan civilization collapsed due to a century-long drought, new research suggests.

Minerals taken from Belize's famous underwater cave, known as the Blue Hole, as well as lagoons nearby, show that an extreme drought occurred between A.D. 800 and A.D. 900, right when the Mayan civilization disintegrated. After the rains returned, the Mayans moved north — but they disappeared again a few centuries later, and that disappearance occurred at the same time as another dry spell, the sediments reveal. [In Photos: Stunning Sinkholes]

Although the findings aren't the first to tie a drought to the Mayan culture's demise, the new results strengthen the case that dry periods were indeed the culprit. That's because the data come from several spots in a region central to the Mayan heartland, said study co-author André Droxler, an Earth scientist at Rice University.

Rise and decline

From A.D. 300 to A.D. 700, the Mayan civilization flourished in the Yucatan peninsula. These ancient Mesoamericans built stunning pyramids, mastered astronomy, and developed both a hieroglyphic writing system and a calendar system, which is famous for allegedly predicting that the world would end in 2012.

But in the centuries after A.D. 700, the civilization's building activities slowed and the culture descended into warfare and anarchy. Historians have speculatively linked that decline with everything from the ancient society's fear of malevolent spirits to deforestation completed to make way for cropland to the loss of favored foods, such as the Tikal deer.

The evidence for a drought has been growing in recent years: Since at least 1995, scientists have been looking more closely at the effects of drought. A 2012 study in the journal Science analyzed a 2,000-year-old stalagmite from a cave in southern Belize and found that sharp decreases in rainfall coincided with periods of decline in the culture. But that data came from just one cave, which meant it was difficult to make predictions for the area as a whole, Droxler said.

The main driver of this drought is thought to have been a shift in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), a weather system that generally dumps water on tropical regions of the world while drying out the subtropics. During summers, the ITCZ pelts the Yucatan peninsula with rain, but the system travels farther south in the winter. Many scientists have suggested that during the Mayan decline, this monsoon system may have missed the Yucatan peninsula altogether.

Deep history

To look for signs of drought, the team drilled cores from the sediments in the Blue Hole of Lighthouse lagoon, as well one in the Rhomboid reef. The lagoons surrounded on all sides by thick walls of coral reef. During storms or wetter periods, excess water runs off from rivers and streams, overtops the retaining walls, and is deposited in a thin layer at the top of the lagoon. From there, all the sediments from these streams settle to the bottom of the lagoon, piling on top of each other and leaving a chronological record of the historical climate.

""It's like a big bucket. It's a sediment trap,"" Droxler told Live Science.

Droxler and his colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of the cores, in particular the ratio of titanium to aluminum. When the rains fall, it eats away at the volcanic rocks of the region, which contain titanium. The free titanium then sweeps into streams that reach the ocean. So relatively low ratios of titanium to aluminum correspond to periods with less rainfall, Droxler said.

The team found that during the period between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1000, when the Maya civilization collapsed, there were just one or two tropical cyclones every two decades, as opposed to the usual five or six. After that, the Maya moved north, building at sites such as Chichen Itza, in what is now Mexico.

But the new results also found that between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1100, during the height of the Little Ice Age, another major drought struck. This period coincides with the fall of Chichen Itza.

The findings strengthen the case that drought helped usher in the long decline of the Mayan culture.

""When you have major droughts, you start to get famines and unrest,"" Droxler said.

Or you might have that lesson administered by Sehan Jayathunga, at his father’s Lanka Grocery; he will pull down every third product from the shelves, eager to tell you how to use it. A dish that gets him especially excited is kottu roti, which is part food, part show: flaky flatbread, stir-fried and chopped with eggs and aromatics, finished with a pour of curry that sizzles into a cloud of fragrant spice as it hits the heat.

32,32,Drought Sri Lanka,Ceylinco Life on Sri Lanka's burgeoning insurance industry - World Finance,https://www.worldfinance.com/markets/insurance/ceylinco-life-on-sri-lankas-burgeoning-insurance-industry,"Transcript

The insurance sector is burgeoning in Sri Lanka, especially life insurance, which became its largest segment in 2010. World Finance speaks to Rajkumar Renganathan, CEO of Ceylinco Life, about how his company has embraced the country’s specific challenges to maintain their position as market leaders for the past decade.

World Finance: Well Mr Renganathan, maybe you can start by telling me how developed is the insurance sector in Sri Lanka and how much coverage does your company have in the country?

Rajkumar Renganathan: The insurance industry was nationalised in 1962. Then in 1988 the industry was once again liberalised. Over the past 26 years all 15 players have received their licenses. These companies have had to establish themselves, build trust and design products to compete indeed to the state monopolies. We at Ceylinco Life achieved market leadership 17 years after we entered the industry, and we have been market leaders for the past 10 years.

World Finance: Sri Lanka has been plagued by severe weather against a backdrop of social unrest. This must have created a lot of challenges within the insurance sector – so how have you dealt with these?

Foreign investment is welcome, especially in the areas of infrastructure and hospitality

Rajkumar Renganathan: We have extremes of drought and flood but we have trained our sales force in the area of new business and collections. We have advised them to adopt different modes of collection and we have trained them in how to change into a new market. Sri Lanka did have an internal ethnic conflict over the past 30 years, this ceased in the year 2009. Since then the government of Sri Lanka has embarked on an accelerated investment programme. Foreign investment is welcome, especially in the areas of infrastructure and hospitality. The Northern and Eastern provinces were the most effected areas during the conflict. These areas have now opened up and there is a new market for life insurance.

World Finance: And how safe is Sri Lanka for conducting business today? And, as a result, what funds do you invest in?

Rajkumar Renganathan: Subsequent to the cessation of the internal ethnic conflict, Sri Lanka is a good place to invest in. As a life insurance company we would invest our funds in gilded securities such as government securities and rated banks. We also invest a part of our money in real estate.

World Finance: Why has demand for life insurance increased so much over the past years?

Rajkumar Renganathan: 26 years ago the insurance industry was liberalised, this has resulted in almost 15 new companies coming into the insurance industry. All of them have adopted their advertising programmes, thereby creating a greater awareness for the need, not only for protection, but for retirement planning as well.

World Finance: Ceylinco Life has subsidiary companies in the healthcare services. How do these companies compliment each other and what are the benefits for your clients?

Rajkumar Renganathan: When we analysed our claims we found that the largest number of claims was in the area of diabetes and cancer. We therefore thought it was right to diversify into the healthcare industry. We set up a subsidiary, it’s called Ceylinco Healthcare Services Ltd. It was set up over 10 years ago. We now operate two centres of excellence – one for diabetes and one for the treatment of cancer.

We now operate two centres of excellence – one for diabetes and one for the treatment of cancer

We were the first to install a Linear Accelerator in Sri Lanka and in December last year we installed a thermo therapy heat unit – the only unit that is available in South-east Asia today. The centre is based on Colombo, so most of the medicals necessary is carried out at this centre. And as far as pour policyholders are concerned, they are entitled to special discounts if they seek treatments at these centres.

World Finance: How is technology revolutionising the insurance sector?

Rajkumar Renganathan: We are equipping ourselves first, both the salesmen and our supervisors, with android tablets and laptops, to provide a better service to our customers. We also have a sophisticated core insurance system, which provides us with a lot of data, which we use effectively for our marketing.

World Finance: Finally, what are you targeting for future growth?

Rajkumar Renganathan: Ageing is a problem all over the world. But this is most specific in South-East Asia, specifically in Sri Lanka – we have a rapidly ageing population. However awareness about retirement planning is at a very low level. As part of our awareness campaign, we have declared the month of May as the retirement planning month. Our entire sales force is mobilised and they will go from house to house talking to the occupants about the need for retirement planning.

We are hopeful of introducing annuity plans for the rising population in the near future.

World Finance: Mr Renganathan, thank you.","Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ceylinco-life-on-sri-lanka’s-burgeoning-insurance-industry-940x198.jpg,"['renganathan', 'ceylinco', 'insurance', 'lanka', 'sri', 'lankas', 'finance', 'retirement', 'market', 'life', 'industry', 'past', 'burgeoning']", 
33,33,Drought Sri Lanka,Everest tribute for cricketer Hughes - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/everest-tribute-for-phillip-hughes-63-not-out-trademark/2014-12-26,"A bat belonging to Phillip Hughes will be placed at the summit of Mount Everest as the cricket world continues to commemorate the popular batsman.

Speaking during lunch at the Boxing Day Test, Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards outlined the unusual tribute, which has been proposed by the Cricket Association of Nepal.

Edwards said the proposal was a poignant reminder of how Hughes' tragic passing in November has touched cricket lovers around the world.

A 63-over game will also be played in Nepal as part of the tribute, with an item of Hughes' clothing and a Cricket Australia flag also to be taken up Everest during the next climbing season in March/April next year.

""So although we enter the festive season with heavy hearts, the community's response has been comforting and in many ways uplifting,"" Edwards said.

Cricket Australia will work with their Nepal counterparts to ensure that the tribute goes ahead.

Hughes was 63 not out when he was hit in the head by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales and subsequently died of his injuries.

It has emerged that Cricket Australia has trademarked the phrase ""63 not out"".

""Cricket Australia registered the trademark in conjunction with Phillip's management purely as a defensive registration to prevent others trying to exploit Phillip's memory,"" a CA spokesman said.

34,34,Drought Sri Lanka,Climate change: adapt now or perish - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/FF2CtAZCyT6W9XbflxaYuM/South-Asia-adapt-now-or-perish.html,"Climate change will sow confusion and concern as it unfolds across South Asia in coming decades. Home to a quarter of the world’s population, this vast region will be hit harder than just about anywhere else. Sudden flooding, storms, droughts and other hazards will upend lives, livelihoods, and economies.

As this grim future takes shape, the price of global inaction is rising each year. Up to 9% will have been stripped annually from South Asia’s economy on average by 2100 if no further action is taken globally on climate change, says a new report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Assessing the Costs of Climate Change and Adaptation in South Asia. There’s an outside chance of those losses blowing out to 24% given the uncertainty surrounding climate change’s future impacts.

What can be done? The region’s countries have taken steps to cushion the impact of a warming world, but bolder action is needed. Given the slow pace of global mitigation efforts, the worst-case scenario of huge economic losses might end up being South Asia’s future by default.

While only global action will halt climate change, countries should not wait on it before taking adaptive measures. They can be as straightforward as placing sand-filled geotextile bags along riverbanks to stall erosion as happened recently in low-lying Bangladesh, where an area up to twice the size of Shimla city is swallowed annually. Or they can be more wide-ranging, such as a recent initiative of the UK government, the Rockefeller Foundation and ADB to boost climate resilience at 25 cities in Asia by helping to integrate climate risks into city plans and develop resilient infrastructure.

Those efforts must now be mainstreamed into national development plans, with governments, the private sector and civil society working together. Moreover, as climate change ignores national borders, South Asia’s countries must respond cooperatively through a regional framework to promote technology transfer, dialogue, and sharing of best practices.

The sooner this happens, the better. Though some areas may benefit temporarily from a see-sawing climate, overall it will be very bad news for South Asia’s 1.5 billion people if nothing is done globally. Maldives and Nepal would lose 12.6% and 9.9% of their economies, respectively, each year by 2100. Losses in Bangladesh would tally 9.4%, India 8.7%, Bhutan 6.6% and Sri Lanka 6.5%.

But the damage would be significantly less if global action is taken on climate change, with just 2.5% culled from the region’s potential gross domestic product by the end of the century.

Obviously this best-case scenario is preferable, particularly in South Asia which due to its geography, huge population and widespread poverty faces acute climate risks. Extreme weather events will become a more destructive fact of life. Droughts will be longer and more intense, while storm surges from rising sea-levels and floods from heavier rain will be constant threats. Flooding will also occur as lakes formed by melting glaciers burst their banks, and frequent landslides will dump debris into rivers, endangering lives and infrastructure.

This will make it tougher for South Asia’s economies to achieve rapid growth, but the human toll is even more alarming. Those likely to suffer most are the 600 million South Asians living in absolute poverty—more than half the world’s total poor. Escaping from poverty will become an even more daunting challenge, as many poor people depend for their livelihoods on climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, forestry and traditional fishing.

Nearly half of India’s 29 states are vulnerable to sea level rise. Gujarat and West Bengal would be inundated for varying periods, while 10% of Maharashtra’s population would be affected by encroaching waters. Storms and rising sea levels will sharpen risks of flooding at heavily populated mega-deltas.

Across the subcontinent, impacts will include patchier energy supply and higher electricity bills, erosion and reduced household water stocks. Hard-hit communities may have to relocate to survive.

These are just some of the climate shocks that will jolt South Asia in coming years. Just how hard they hit will depend, to a degree, on global action—or lack thereof—on climate change. But that only makes the case even more compelling for better climate change adaptation. Just a few of the many adaptive options available include using drought, flood and salt-resistant crop varieties, reforming water policy, and building better drainage systems.

And the time for action is now. Because the longer South Asia waits to step up its adaptive response, the more it will cost.

If temperatures and sea-levels rise appreciably amid global inaction, the annual average cost of climate change adaptation could hit $73 billion between now and 2100, but only $41 billion under a more optimistic scenario. Upgrading adaptation from today will make the cost more manageable, no matter what happens globally.

South Asia has made huge strides recently in boosting prosperity and reducing poverty. It would be a tragedy if climate change were allowed to roll back those gains.

35,35,Drought Sri Lanka,SLT and MoE Strengthen “Children-Parent” Communication through “Sisu-Connect” - The Official Government News Portal of Sri Lanka,https://www.news.lk/news/business/item/2624-slt-and-moe-strengthen-children-parent-communication-through-sisu-connect,"Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), the National ICT Solutions Provider together with the Ministry of Education (MoE) and Ministry of Telecommunications & Information Technology launched “Sisu-Connect”, an especially architected virtual telephone platform to bridge the much-needed “Children-Parent” communication gap that occurs when children are away from their parents. The “Sisu-Connect” communication service was launched under the patronage of the Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of Telecommunications & Information Technology and Bandula Gunawardena, Minister of Education at a special ceremony held at the Ministry of Education

SLT “Sisu-Connect” virtual telephone service for students has been especially designed as one of the Corporate Responsibility initiatives of the Company for the year 2014 to protect the country’s future generation even when they are physically away from their parents. Parents are naturally uncomfortable and concerned when their children are away at school or tuition classes etc. The SLT team has put in a great effort to implement this hassle free communication system for both children and parents. Unlike a child using any other communication device, SLT’s “Sisu-Connect” telephone system creates a better environment for students to connect with their parents or guardians in the most secure and easy to access manner, and also enables them to enjoy crystal clear voice quality communications.

SLT has already started the process of installing these special telephone units inside the school premises or education institutes selected by the MoE under the 1st phase of “Sisu-Connect” program. Further, the company has plans to expand this system to other schools and education institutes around the country in the near future with the guidance of both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Telecommunications & IT.

The most special feature of this “Sisu-Connect” telephone platform is that students do not need cash to operate the telephone and get in touch with their parents / guardians so it is a ‘Cash-less’ telephone service provided by SLT for students. A unique and simple PIN number will be given to students upon registering for the service after which they can access the “Sisu-Connect” IVR system. Upon the press of a single key which has been pre-assigned at the time of registering, the child can dial any fixed or mobile numbers that has already been assigned by the parent / guardian. Up to 4 numbers can be programmed including both fixed and mobile phones of father, mother, home, office, school van etc.

Lalith de Silva, the Group CEO of SLT commenting on this special service, said “We believe SLT’s “Sisu-Connect”, Children-Parent communication system will be a revolutionising service to create better understanding, better communication and a better secured future for our country’s dynamic future generation. Under the “Mahinda Chinthanaya” future vision, Sri Lanka is marching towards a Knowledge Hub, which is the vision of the education sector and thus all our corporate stewardship initiatives are focused on making the country’s future vision a reality. We, the SLT team believe that we are a part of that vision and we ensure that we strengthen, both directly and indirectly, the values of the socio-economic ecosystem in Sri Lanka. SLT is making significant investments with national interest to install these special telephone units in nearly 200 school premises during the first phase.”

“Sisu-Connect” platform is linked with SLT Megaline and SLT Citylink telephone systems and therefore any SLT telephone customer is able to add the “Sisu-Connect” feature to their customer account as a value-added feature at a fixed monthly rental of Rs. 50/=. Number of calling minutes made through the system will be added to the respective SLT telephone monthly bill. Dial 1212 hotline from any telephone or log on to www.slt.lk for more details.

36,36,Drought Sri Lanka,The curious case of Bucky and Watto | cricket.com.au - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/chris-rogers-shane-watson-partnership-curious-case-of-bucky-and-watto/2014-12-26,"If opposites attract, the alliance between Chris Rogers and Shane Watson makes perfect sense.

On face value, it would appear no two players in this Australian XI are more different than the 37-year-old opener and 33-year-old allrounder.

Left and right, subtle and swashbuckling, defence and attack.

But the long and the short of it is they have now combined for 100 runs or more in five of their 15 innings together, an average of 64.93 per partnership.

""We enjoy being out there together, we have a bit of a laugh,"" Rogers said after the pair put on 115 for the second wicket on day one of this third Commonwealth Bank Test at the MCG.

""Maybe the different styles; he goes at it pretty hard and I let it come to me a bit.

""Maybe we feed off each other but definitely we've done well together and it was good to spend some time out there.

""I think we had a few memories of last year chasing down the English total (when the pair put on 136 in the 2013 Boxing Day Test).

""It was nice to get another 100-run partnership.""

Today's 202-ball stand was without a dominant partner; Rogers scored 57 with 17 singles and five boundaries, Watson 52 with 18 singles and four boundaries.

And it's the 35 singles that underlines the impressive understanding between them.

Watson, a muscular 93kg monster not known for his ability to run between wickets, picked up four singles with nothing more than defensive pushes on the off-side and clear, concise communication, while the pair also hustled six threes in their two-and-a-half hour stay at the crease.

""We have a pretty good connection so we can understand those singles,"" Rogers said.

""I think he realises as well that turning the strike over is going to help him, particularly with soft hands on the off side.

""That gave us a bit of momentum as well so all credit to him.""

One thing Rogers and Watson do have in common is the scrutiny they find themselves under whenever big runs are not forthcoming.

With career averages the wrong side of 40, and ages the wrong side of 30, Rogers said it's something that he's used to.

""That's the nature of the beast,"" he said.

""It's a tough business and you guys (journalists) have got things to write about.

""You try and avoid it but you know you're going to come under criticism, particularly at my age if you're not scoring runs.

""I'm not stupid enough to think that I own a place in this side and it's still a privilege so I'm going to make the most of it.""

The only possible explanation Rogers offered for the strong partnership with his No.3 was his ability to lift on the rare occasions that David Warner fails to get out of first gear.

Rogers's opening partner was well caught by Shikhar Dhawan for a duck on Friday morning, just the third time in 65 Test innings that he has failed to get off the mark.

Rogers regularly thrives when Warner falls cheaply; three of his four Test hundreds have come in innings where his partner has been dismissed for 25 or less.

""Maybe there's a bit more desire to help out the side (when Warner falls cheaply),"" he said.

""I know it probably doesn't seem like it but at times it can be a little bit intimidating batting with Davey.

""He scores so quickly that you can look up and think 'I'm not scoring quick enough, I'm not being aggressive enough'.

""So I think at times I've probably got out trying to force it a little bit up the other end from Davey.

""Maybe it helps me just calm down a little bit after he gets out.""","Fri, 26 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2014/12/26WattoBuck.ashx?w=1600,"['little', 'warner', 'pair', 'curious', 'case', 'watto', 'bucky', 'singles', 'watson', 'bit', 'think', 'rogers', 'test', 'partner']",

Law and Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to India Sudharshan Seneviratne, Member of Parliament Meenakshi Lekhi and Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh were among those present on the occasion.

""Dharmapala, was one of the founding contributors of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism and was also a pioneer in the revival of Buddhism in India,"" Mukherjee said.

Dharmapala had represented ""Southern Buddhism""--term used for Threvada at that time, at World Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 where he met Swami Vivekananda and was impressed by him.

Earlier, the Sri Lankan government had released the commemorative postage stamp on 150th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda where the official of Sri Lankan government had shared the idea of a postage stamp on Dharmapala, recalled Prasad.

""The honour extended to Swami Vivekanand by Sri Lankan government and reciprocal gesture extended by India by honouring Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala this year shall take forward the illustrious legacy of collective wisdom and shared responsibility between India and Sri Lanka and shall continue to guide the entire Asia,"" Prasad said.

In 1891, Dharmapala went on a pilgrimage to the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, where Lord Buddha had attained enlightenment. He decided to work towards restoring it's glory.

Accordingly, the Maha Bodhi Society at Colombo was founded in 1891.

Dharmapala joined the Theosophical Society and spearheaded the reform and revival of Ceylonese Buddhism and its propagation.

He later entered the order of Buddhist monks as Venerable Sri Devamitta Dharmapala and is considered a Bodhisattva in Sri Lanka. He was ordained a bhikkhu at Sarnath in 1933 and died there in December of the same year.","Sat, 25 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1141025/full-114102500465.jpg,"['india', 'commemorative', 'lankan', 'buddhist', 'sri', 'lanka', 'dharmapala', 'stamp', 'postage', 'swami', 'monk', 'released']",

Pure gold: medal drought broken after four decades

Cambodia’s 44-year long wait for Asian Games glory was emphatically ended yesterday evening as taekwondo sensation Sorn Seavmey struck gold in the women’s under-73kg event at the Ganghwa Dolmens Gymnasium in Incheon, South Korea.

The 19-year-old Cambodian, a SEA Games gold medalist in Myanmar last year, stormed back from a three-point deficit in the first round to command the next two and emerge a 7-4 victor of the final against Fatemeh Rouhani of Iran.

Seavmey will return home tomorrow night with the glorious glow of a gold, Cambodia’s first in its 60-year history of participation at the quadrennial competition, hanging around her neck.

She can also expect to cash in on the Government’s subdecree, which rewards athletes for success at international sporting competitions.

According to the subdecree, a gold medalist will receive 80 million riel ($19,600) from the government. Seavmey is also set to bank additional sums from official sponsors such as Angkor Beer and NagaWorld.

Cambodia’s flag bearer at the opening ceremony had earlier showed scant regard for her quarter-final rival Umida Abullaeva of Uzbekistan’s imposing record as the 2012 Asian Championships winner and recent Nanjing Youth Summer Olympic silver medalist, in a fight she dominated start to finish to seal on points 29-7.

With the full-throated chorus of support from the entire Cambodian contingent spurring her on, Seavmey used her impressive height to score vital points against Abullaeva, who had struck a confident note in her 4-0 pre-quarter final win over Feruza Yergeshova of Kazakhstan.

With a historic podium place guaranteed, Seavmey then faced the imposing figure of Filipina Kirstie Elaine Alora for a place in the gold medal match.

Seavmey commanded the first two rounds, jumping to a 6-1 lead. The Cambodian held on through a nervy last round to secure a 6-5 victory and avenge her older sister Davin’s loss to Alora in the gold medal match of the over-73kg women’s event at the 2013 SEA Games.

Sorn Davin was also in the hunt for a medal in Incheon yesterday, but succumbed to a comprehensive 8-1 points defeat by Iranian Akram Khodabandeh in their women’s over-73kg quarter-final.

Meanwhile, Cambodia’s remaining taekwondo athlete, Ban Khemara, lost 20-8 to Afghanistan’s Abdul Wahab Zazai in their men’s under-54kg round of 32 clash.

Cambodia’s last medal winning performances came at the 1970 Bangkok Asian Games when the Kingdom brought home four medals – two silvers and as many bronzes.

Cambodia was forced to stay out of the Asian Games between 1970 and 1994 surrounding the brutal reign of the Khmer Rouge regime.

“This is an incredibly big prize for Cambodian sports. It is not just that our long and frustrating wait for a medal is over, it is also the start of a new chapter in our history,” National Olympic Committee of Cambodia secretary general Vath Chamroeun told the Post.","Sat, 04 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/26-story-1_5.jpg,"['medal', 'broken', 'round', 'games', 'womens', 'gold', 'asian', 'cambodian', 'drought', 'seavmey', 'pure', 'sorn', 'taekwondo', 'decades']",

Mumbai: A group of lottery agents in Mumbai have written letters to Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Phadnavis and other ministers seeking a special draw to collect money in order to help the drought-hit farmers in the state.

Suresh Bhagat, one of the lottery agents, said today that the state government should come forward to hold a special lottery draw on January 26 to provide help to the farmers.

He suggested that the minimum price of lottery tickets should be Rs 100 and the tickets should also be sold through post offices and government offices.

The lottery agents reminded that special draws were conducted during the Kargil War and Gujarat earthquake, and Rs 65 lakhs were collected by the government.

New Delhi, Nov 12: A belated birthday gift it may be but marquee player Alessandro Del Piero would still be happy, and more importantly relieved, if Delhi Dynamos FC are able to break their four-match winless streak when they take on FC Goa in a match of laggards in the Indian Super League (ISL) 2014 here tomorrow. The match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium will be an opportunity for the two bottom-placed teams to make an effort to climb up ladder.

While the Dynamos are struggling at the seventh place following four draws, two losses and a solitary win, FC Goa are at the bottom with four defeats, two draws and a win in the eight-team franchise-based league. Any more slip-ups could cost both the teams dear, virtually ruling them out of semi-finals contention in the inaugural edition of the league.

Despite the presence of legends such as Del Piero, Zico (Goa’s coach) and Robert Pires in their ranks, both Delhi and Goa have struggled to find their bearings, often lacking in ideas when it came to converting chances. Dynamos will hope that the trio of Juventus legend Del Piero, a World Cup winner with Italy in 2006, Morten Skoubo and Mads Junker combine upfront to give the goals.

Wim Raymaekers will be there at the heart of defence alongside Souvik Chakraborthy, and they are expected to be supported by Stijn Houben and Indian players like Naoba Singh and Anwar Ali. Besides, the home team will have an option in Brazilian Gustavo Santos who has been doing a good job in the middle of the park as well as in creating openings. On the wings, Steven Dias, who did not play in their last goal-less draw against Kerala Blasters, will be expected to play a crucial role alongside Shylo Malswamtluanga.

In the midfield, the hosts will also have the services of Pavel Elias and Hans Mulder. After their back-to-back defeats at the hands of FC Goa away and Mumbai City FC, Delhi Dynamos were searching for a win in their last match to boost their confidence but all they could manage was a draw, and coach Harm van Veldhoven’s boys would be keen to end the winless streak in front of the home crowd.

Dutchman Veldhoven was sent off in their last match and is unlikely to sit in the Dynamos dugout. Moved he may be by the reception he had received on his 40th birthday, but only a win can be an appropriate gift for Del Piero and the other players. Rooted at the bottom of the table with five points, FC Goa also have problems in plenty with the team not able to deliver the goods despite being coached by the legendary Brazilian who is often called the greatest footballer to have not won a World Cup.

One of the best players to have played for English Premier League giants Arsenal, Frenchman Pires will have to inspire what looks like a dejected outfit. While Pires will be holding fort in the midfield along with Romeo Fernandes, Mandar Rao Desai and Bruno Pinheiro, the attack will be taken care of by Australian Tolgay Ozbey.

The Goan defence will be manned by Gregory Arnolin, Narayan Das, Debabrata Das and Youness Bengelloun. While the Ranti Martins can be used upfront, the Goa team has the option of playing Indian footballers Alwyn George and Clifford Miranda.

The appointment seems to have helped.

The country’s largest cellular telephone operator reported its first growth in profit, after 15 consecutive quarters of fall in net profit, in October-December 2013, the same quarter he took over. Since then, Bharti Airtel has reported growth in profits every quarter, ensuring better performance in the next one.

However, while Vittal was able to take tough but needed corrective steps to ensure an India growth story, Africa continues to add pressure on the balance sheet. Added to its woes from abroad are Bangladesh and Sri Lanka now.

Even a couple of quarters earlier, Bangladesh had reasonable performance. But the numbers in July-September showed Bharti needs to re-look at its business there. As for Sri Lanka, it has never shown Bharti any profit.

In the July-September quarter, Bharti Airtel reported a net profit of Rs 1,383 crore, a 170 per cent rise from the corresponding quarter of 2013-14. It could have reported a much stronger result if it did not have to bear the increasing pressure from operations in Africa, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India alone has generated a net profit (before exceptional items) of Rs 2,449 crore; however, it had a loss of Rs 753 crore in Africa and Rs 153 crore in Bangladesh and Lanka. The corresponding figure for these regions last year was a loss in Africa at Rs 288 crore and one of Rs 133 crore in Bangladesh and Lanka.

Net income (before exceptional items) in India was at Rs 967 crore. The figure jumped 2.5 times in July-September as against the same quarter of FY14. The loss from operations in Africa, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka jumped 1.6 times.

Also, total revenue in Africa dropped to Rs 6,895 crore from Rs 7,025 crore earlier. That from Bangladesh and Lanka dipped to Rs 389 crore from Rs 454 crore earlier.

Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margins in Africa came down to 23.6 per cent in the quarter from 26.9 per cent in the corresponding quarter last year, a fall of 330 basis points. Operations in Bangladesh and Lanka also underperformed, with the customer base declining 11 per cent and total minutes of usage by 17 per cent. Net addition of subscribers in South Asia (Bangladesh and Lanka) dropped by a huge 3,123 per cent, mainly because of poor performance in Bangladesh.

Average revenue per minute (Arpu) in the voice segment dipped six per cent in Africa, to $4.1 and realisation from voice by seven per cent, to $0.03. As in India, the non-voice revenue contribution also rose to 23.8 per cent from 21.5 per cent at the end of the June quarter. Data usage per customer increased by 10 per cent but realisation from data dipped nine per cent, Data Arpu remained flat.

But, Christian de Faria, its CEO for Africa, said after the results announcement that the impact was in line with expectations.“We are optimistic about the potential in Africa, despite these aberrations,” he added.

South Asia Arpu also dropped to Rs 125 from Rs 138, and data Arpu rose to Rs 45 from Rs 38 in the previous quarter.

Thumbs-down on elsewhere

Analysts have remained sceptical about Bharti Airtel’s operations abroad. “At this stage, it would be very difficult to correct operations in Bangladesh. Sri Lanka never paid back. And, pressure in Africa has been increasing. Bharti has been looking for a buyer for its Sri Lanka operations for quite a long time but is yet to find a suitor. The way Bangladesh is going, it might have a similar fate,” said a top analyst with a global management consulting firm, with experience of working for a rival telco.

Axiata and Etisalat have been named as potential suitors for Bharti's Lanka operations in the past but there was no deal. “Geographical expansion did not work for Bharti and it only increased its burden. While India continues to show better performance, sustainability in the overseas market is becoming an issue for Bharti,” added the analyst.

The African operations continue to be a sore point. Credit Suisse, in a note after the company’s quarterly results, stated that with rising capex and notoriously high tax levels, the management target of cash flow self-sufficiency in Africa was getting pushed into the future.

However, the company said in a quarterly investor note: “The contraction in voice revenue (in Africa) was primarily on account of seasonality,regulatory and environmental factors. Operating expenditure increased…primarily on account of investments in network and sales & marketing costs.”



“Initially, Airtel needed to grab subscriber market share to penetrate the market. Now, it is time to inculcate value out of it, which is yet to see any indication,”said a Mumbai-based analyst.

The performance in Africa is seen as the “biggest key negative” by analysts, including Morgan Stanley.

There is also rising debt, of Rs 62,215 crore ($10.09 billion). It began rising after it bought Zain Telecom’s Africa assets to enter one of the most under-penetrated markets, in 2010. But, unlike its competitors, it did not have a comprehensive infrastructure back-end and required fresh investments.

To date, Bharti is yet to achieve any of the targets ($5-bn revenue from African operations, with an Ebitda margin at 40 per cent and 100 million subscribers by March 2013) that it had cited when it entered Africa. At the end of September 2014, it had 71 million subscribers, $1.1 billion of quarterly revenue and the Ebitda margin was 23.6 per cent. If Mittal stays with his dream of cracking the African continent, analysts say it will remain a pain for a few years, unless a miracle happens.","Wed, 05 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2013-03/19/full/1363689546-4083.JPG,"['rs', 'lanka', 'sri', 'cent', 'overseas', 'operations', 'continue', 'quarter', 'bharti', 'bangladesh', 'airtels', 'struggle', 'africa', 'crore']",

Now, five separate studies published today conclude that the blazing summer was linked to human-caused climate change.

The papers are part of a larger report, Explaining Extreme Events of 2013 From a Climate Perspective, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS). It includes 22 separate studies focusing on 16 different extreme weather events that occurred last year. And while researchers concluded that human activity had increased the likelihood and severity of Australia’s heat wave, they reported that it was hard to see any direct link between climate change and other extreme events last year—including the last 2 years of California drought and Colorado’s extreme rains.

The report highlights the value—and limitations—of “attribution research,” said Thomas Karl, the director of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina, at a press conference today. Still a young science, attribution research seeks to strengthen understanding of the factors that contribute to extreme events. That, Karl said, is tricky because extreme events are “very complex,” and multiple factors—including precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, snowpack availability, and human land and water usage—all come into play. “It’s a new task scientists have taken on in the last few years,” he said. “It’s still in the early stages. We have learned that our ability is significantly different in some variables compared to others”—for example, the influence of climate on temperature changes is easier to trace than on precipitation.

One strength of the report is that several of the scientific teams focused on the same event, said Thomas Peterson, a co-editor on the report and also of NCDC, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Five groups, for example, examined the Australian heat wave and found a strong climate link. “Just one paper increases the value, but five together … it’s a very powerful signal,” he said.

Three different groups that studied the California drought, however, did not come up with a clear picture of how long-term climate change might have driven that event. One study found that climate did directly affect the “geopotential heights” in the region—corresponding to high and low pressure in the atmosphere—but did not find a direct link between those pressures and actual changes in temperature and precipitation leading to the drought. Another looked at long-term sea surface temperature increases, but also found no direct link to California drought risk. And a third found that climate-induced sea-surface temperature anomalies over the northeast Pacific were driving storms (and moisture) away from California, but the warming also caused increased humidity—two competing factors that may produce no net effect.

“[Attribution science] is hard, cutting-edge research,” said Stephanie Herring, of NCDC in Boulder, Colorado, and the report’s lead editor. “It remains incredibly challenging.”","Mon, 29 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/Australia%20heat%20wave.jpg?itok=sU8E5KQ7,"['link', 'australias', 'extreme', 'humancaused', 'heat', 'report', 'waves', 'wave', 'temperature', 'research', 'change', 'climate', 'events', 'drought', 'studies', 'california', 'conclude', 'linked']",

46,46,Drought Sri Lanka,Preventing water wars: how to build bridges over river disputes - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/30/water-wars-conflict-peace-nile-africa,"Fifty years ago, Lake Chad in Africa had a surface area of 25,000 square kilometres. Today, it has less than 2,000. The surface area of the Aral Sea in central Asia has dropped by half, from 66,000 to 33,000 square km, and the Dead Sea in the Middle East from almost 1,000 to 650 square km.

Fifty years from now, Lake Chad is at risk of disappearing altogether. Thirty years from now, the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea may become small lakes. China, the emerging superpower, may soon see Lake Poyang, its largest freshwater lake, evaporate – as many as 3,000 small lakes in the source region of the Yellow River have done so in the last two decades.

As lakes disappear, rivers are either being depleted or severely polluted. Large stretches of the Ganges, the Nile, and the Yangtze are already biologically dead. Over the next thirty years, some of the mightiest rivers in the world – including the Yellow and the Yangtze, the Ganges and the Indus, the Euphrates and the Jordan, and the Nile – will see a reduction of at least 25-30% in their flow from evaporation, desertification, climate change, and pollution.

The climate change debate is highly focused on atmospheric pollution and energy use, but there is a growing realisation of the close links between climatic and environmental factors and the future flow and quality of water through melting glaciers, deforestation, changes in precipitation, and emission of waste into fresh water.

The next thirty years will also see a strong increase in demand for water – for hydroelectricity, irrigation, and urbanization. At the same time, the 25-30% reduction in water flow will lead to a drop in food grain production in China, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Middle East.

The net result of this decrease will be a gap between demand and supply of food grains of approximately 200 to 300 million tons by 2040 in international markets. China and India, reasonably self-sufficient in 2014, may become major importers of food grains by 2040. If all this unfolds, commodity prices will skyrocket, affecting the poor worldwide and making food riots, migration, and conflicts within and between countries inevitable.

The main theatre of crisis and conflict driven by depletion of water resources will be from south-east Asia via South Asia and Central Asia to Turkey and from Egypt along the eastern and central parts of Africa to Kenya and Burundi.

What could change this ominous scenario? The good news is that mere decline in the availability of water does not necessarily lead to violence. Singapore and Senegal are examples of how to avoid conflict through good water governance and transboundary cooperation. A recent study by Strategic Foresight Group (SFG) on 205 shared river basins from 148 countries concludes: “any two countries engaged in active water cooperation do not go to war for any reason whatsoever, including land, religion, economy or terrorism.” The key to peace thus lies in the intensity of cooperation as measured by the water cooperation quotient (WCQ) the report introduces.

The WCQ is a new tool developed by SFG and introduced to the international community by Jordan’s Prince Hassan, chair of the United Nations Secretary-Generals’ Advisory Board on Water & Sanitation. It uses ten parameters – including economic, environmental, institutional, legal, political, and technical factors – to examine both legal and operational cooperation between countries that share a water body. Countries are assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with countries at risk scoring below 35.

To promote active water cooperation, the Blue Peace framework – which defines a structured process to turn water from a source of potential crisis to an instrument of cooperation – is essential. Specifically, it consists of creating regional mechanisms for cooperation, engaging mainstream political leaders from rival river-boardering countries, and enabling them to negotiate trade-offs between water and other public goods. Such mechanisms are already in place in Europe, North and South America, and West Africa.

The next decade will see the emergence of global mechanisms – innovative legal and diplomatic instruments – for resolving water-related disputes and promoting transboundary water cooperation. If the international community mobilises political will behind the new architecture of water and peace, the alternative grim scenario of water war can still be averted before the world crosses the tipping point.

The impressive domestic form of pace pair Jason Behrendorff and Gurinder Sandhu has them on Ponting's radar, while the triple World Cup winner says 20-year-old Aston Agar could be included as a specialist spinner.

""Jason Behrendorff from the Perth Scorchers has been a standout for me so far in the Big Bash and his domestic record is also good,"" Ponting told SEN's Summer Breakfast program.

""And Gurinder Sandhu is the other one. I think he's a terrific short form bowler.

""He bowls well at the death in T20 games which is probably an area that Australia haven't really ever excelled in the limited-overs game.

While the young duo wouldn't look out of place in Australian colours, Ponting concedes there are a number of fast bowlers ahead of them in World Cup queue.

""They're a couple of guys I think that will definitely be smokies.

""If you look at Johnson and Starc and Cummins and Hazlewood and these boys, they're probably the boys who have their names up in front of the selectors first and foremost, as they should.""

Ponting says Agar, who made his Test debut at Trent Bridge last year, scoring a remarkable 98 batting at No.11 in world-record stand with Phillip Hughes, could provide Australia a dynamic spinning option.

""I would actually throw Ashton Agar's name in there as a bit of a smokey.

""I haven't talked much about this before but I was just looking and thinking about what they might do with a spinner for the World Cup, and we know that Agar's a very handy lower batsman and a good fielder as well.

""I think he's someone who could slot into a World Cup one-day side really nicely.""

Another dynamic player in the frame for the World Cup selection is Glenn Maxwell.

The Victorian has come under scrutiny in recent times following a below-par Calrton Mid ODI series against South Africa in November, and a run of low scores for the Melbourne Stars in BBL|04, highlighted by his bizarre dismissal in last night's one-run loss the Brisbane Heat.

But Ponting says Maxwell has the same raw ability and x-factor of a former teammate that helped win Australia a World Cup.

""I think expectation is the thing that's weighing him down a little bit at the moment,"" Ponting said of Maxwell's poor form of late.

""As I try to say to him, that's just down to the way he plays his cricket.

""He's got so much talent … the ability to do some unbelievably freakish things.

""He's got to find a way within himself to become a consistent cricketer for the Stars and Victoria and hopefully for Australia.

""The one thing we can't forget with some of these guys that are relatively new to international cricket is one, they haven't been in the spotlight for that long before and two, they haven't played as much cricket back-to-back and consecutively as some of these guys are doing right now.

""And someone like Glenn, he's the sort of guy who needs some time away and needs to have other vices in his life, rather than just sitting back and thinking about cricket 24/7.

""It's a tough adjustment period for some of these guys but we hope he (Maxwell) can come through the other end of it and make sure he's playing well leading into that World Cup, because he's the sort of player, like we had with someone like Andrew Symonds in 2003, that could win a World Cup for Australia.""","Mon, 29 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2014/12/29PontingWC.ashx?w=1600,"['form', 'smokies', 'hes', 'world', 'cricket', 'havent', 'guys', 'cup', 'names', 'think', 'australia', 'ponting']",

Rubatheesan Cash, gifts and army parades to entertain the voters View(s): View(s):

Food, household goods and cash are being scattered around the Uva Province as campaigning for the provincial election draws to a close, while the army is engaging in heroic parades in the area with, election monitors alleged, the aim of boosting the ruling United People’s Freedom Alliance.

The final rallies of all the main parties have been fixed for Wednesday – the last day of the official campaign.

There are varying claims of the level of election irregularities and violence. Independent election monitoring bodies said they had received more than 300 complaints. The Election Secretariat said there had been 212 complaints, 134 of them from Moneragala, while police said they had received 54 election-related complaints and made 30 arrests since the day of nominations.

Moneragala District Secretary A. Patthinathan said he had requested police to set up permanent checkpoints in the district.

“Buttala junction, Thanamalwila junction and Hulandawa junction are the main entrance to the city. If they deployed police patrols day and night we can identify suspicious vehicles and unregistered vehicles,” he said.

Police rejected Opposition allegations that they had been inactive in controlling violence, particularly in Moneragala.

Police spokesman SSP Ajith Rohana said 11,000 additional police would be brought in from other provinces such as Sabragamuwa and the Eastern Province and deployed on election duty in Uva from this coming Thursday to September 24.

SSP Rohana said the Elections Commissioner had instructed the Inspector-General of Police not to grant bail to offenders. “We will produce them in court and the court will decide whether to grant bail,” he said.

The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) said that despite an assurance from the Inspector-General of Police that the situation would be under control, two JVP offices had been destroyed within 24 hours.

“This is a clear indication that the police either don’t have the powers to control violence or the willingness to address this problem,” the CMEV said.

The independent body also raised concerns over preparations by the military to conduct a military parade in Badulla, saying this was a bid to gain political advantage for the UPFA. A similar parade was held in Monaragala last week.

Military spokesman Brigadier Ruwan Wanigasooriya disputed this, saying the military parades had nothing to do with war victory celebrations or gaining political advantages.

“We have been conducting these kinds of military tattoos in every part of the country on an annual basis,” he said. “We had this type of tattoos in Anuradhapura, Jaffna, and Polonnaruwa.”

People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi

alleged that the Economic Development Ministry headed by Mr. Basil Rajapaksa was trying to distribute Rs. 2,500 in drought relief to each and every household in the Moneragala district.

“If it is drought relief it has to be given through the Disaster Management Ministry. How did the Economic Development Ministry allocate such an amount, particularly for the Monaragala district?” he asked.

He said more than seven other districts had been severely affected by the drought but had failed to receive these grants.

Mano Ganeshan, leader of the Democratic People’s Front alleged that even after the Human Rights Commission has warned the government not to engage the state workers in to propaganda work there were many instances where state employees had been brought from other districts.

“Around 100 Samurdhi officers were brought from Jaffna last week to do campaign work in the province. They were given accommodation with a special payment as well,” he said.

Western Australia have ended a nine-year drought in the domestic one-day competition with a crushing 64-run victory over New South Wales.

The Warriors outclassed the Blues in all departments. Michael Klinger led the way with a commanding innings, falling just four runs short of a century, while Jason Behrendorff claimed a five-wicket haul as WA's pace attack killed off NSW's chase in just 44.1 overs.

Only Shane Watson provided any serious threat as NSW struggled to overcome the loss of early wickets.

It was the perfect start to Klinger's first season with the Warriors under Justin Langer. The former South Australia captain was toiling as a part-time first-class player in Victoria when WA last lifted a one-day trophy at the end of the 2003-04 season. Now, after enjoying several successful years with the Redbacks, the 34-year-old's transfer to the west has brought immediate rewards.

After winning the toss, WA's innings began as brightly and breezily as the conditions at the SCG.

It was NSW's first match of the season at their spiritual home but the dusty-looking pitch offered little assistance to their five-pronged pace attack, and with Nathan Lyon and Steve O'Keefe on international duties, only the part-time spin of Nic Maddinson offered any variation.

Warriors' opener Marcus Harris looked both comfortable and threatening as he cantered to 33 but the left-hander chased Gurinder Sandhu's full and wide opening delivery and top edged to Watson at first slip.

That combination of caught and bowled could have been repeated on at least two more occasions but for the slowness of the pitch, Sandhu watching the ball clip the edge of Simmons' bat only for it to fall frustratingly short of Watson.

While the departure of Harris eased the run rate somewhat, Simmons and Klinger built solidly, adding 83 before Simmons departed in typically aggressive fashion, trying to hoist Pat Cummins over the square-leg boundary.

Klinger's partnership with Adam Voges was almost as fruitful and when Voges was beaten by a Sean Abbott ball, a good length delivery which nipped back and clattered into middle and leg, the Warriors had cruised to 204 for 3.

Doug Bollinger's two wickets in three balls put the brakes on WA's scoring before Ashton Turner chimed in with a lusty cameo which helped lift the total to 255.

NSW's chase began in dismal fashion, the hosts losing two wickets in the first four overs.

Maddinson had already suffered a painful blow while fielding, colliding awkwardly with Kurtis Patterson in the outfield as the pair unsuccessfully attempted to prevent a boundary.

Maddinson limped to the dressing room and didn't return to the field but recovered sufficiently to open the batting. Four balls later he was trudging to the Members' Stand once more, his stumps shattered by Behrendorff.

The Warriors had injury worries of their own. Joel Paris, who entered the final as WA's equal highest wicket taker for the tournament, exited early after suffering a quad strain during his second over.

Captain Adam Voges brought himself into the attack and struck with his first delivery, an arm ball that skidded on, removing Phil Neville and leaving the Blues in disarray at 10 for 2.

Watson's start was streaky and he was yet to score when a leading edge off the dangerous Behrendorff popped up only to drop a fraction short of Turner at backward point.

From that moment, Watson, playing solely as a batsman as he continues his recovery from a calf injury, set about giving his state a fighting chance of reaching the target, ably supported by Patterson.

Twice Watson sent the ball sailing into the Ladies Stand, and once over the long-on boundary, and the familiar sight of his powerful front-foot cover drives was encouraging.

At the same time as his Australian team-mates were struggling to combat spin on a dusty Dubai pitch, Watson made the most of what spin was on offer in Sydney, singling out Ashton Agar and Adam Voges for special treatment.

But if there was a familiarity about Watson's style, there was also a frustrating sense of deja-vu when he fell, to the faintest of feathered edges off Agar, just as he was closing in on a century.

NSW's chances all but evaporated with his departure, as WA's fast men ripped through the middle-and lower-order.

The visitors were also sharp in the field, and Nathan Coulter-Nile took two outstanding catches to remove Ben Rohrer and Sandhu, both off the bowling of Behrendorff.","Sun, 26 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/196300/196363.3.jpg,"['simmons', 'title', 'voges', 'spin', 'wa', 'watson', 'south', 'behrendorff', 'short', 'australia', 'warriors', 'ball', 'klinger']",

Ten years later, CBC sent cameras looking for her again in Sri Lanka.

She's all grown up now and still somehow hanging on to a Canadian connection from long ago.

In those days, a decade ago, surrounded by death, the impulse of all affected was to try to seek out and cling to life.

Our CBC film crew watched plenty of life on a beach outside Colombo back then. Sadly, much of it was grieving men who often sat and stared at the Indian Ocean waiting to see if it would give them back their families.

Abirami Velai, seen here at the age of 10 with a smile that belies the reality that everything she owned was gone, save for the green and white dress she was wearing. Mercifully her family survived the tsunami, largely because they were away from the sea that day. (Ian Kalushner / CBC)

They had been out at sea fishing, or out of the country working, while their wives and little ones stayed home.

That means that when the tsunami came for the coastal communities of Sri Lanka, it just seemed so hungry for the women and children. Many thousands of men were left just to wander the beaches and ruined patches of land alone.

We watched them pick up bits of clothing, silently stare at mangled pieces of furniture tossed into the trees, surely wondering if what remained was really theirs.

That is when we also met 10-year-old Abirami, dressed in a green and white dress, playing on the sand and collecting translucent bugs.

Such a deceptively happy scene. The truth was, though, that the dress was all Abirami Velai had left. And she was collecting the bugs for food, not fun.

Like so many of Sri Lanka's poor she had been living in a shack between the tracks and the sea. By some miracle of timing, she was away from the sea that day, only to return to find everything she owned smashed and pulled back into the ocean.

Not entirely able to process the magnitude of what happened, she focussed on what she knew, that a little cupboard she had bought with the money from a Canadian sponsor family was gone, splintered into tiny pieces and scattered in the water.

We spent most of the day with Abirami, made connections with the charity that had helped support her over the years and promised to try to stay in touch.

So did the Rosta family of British Columbia. They were the sponsor family who had provided the money for that cupboard.

Over the years, connections were kept up, more at first, then very few. But now, 10 years after the tsunami, we just had to find out what had happened to Abirami.

We contacted a local charity called Community Concern that knew exactly where to look. And within a few days, there she was – 20-year-old Abirami.

She earns a bit of money cooking and cleaning for a family. And she has a new treasure, a sewing machine with which she is making striking quilts and clothes.

She bought it with the money that same Canadian family, the Rostas, has managed to send over the years. A promise kept.

She remembers them, and they her, and all remember the panicky pit everyone felt that awful Boxing Day in 2004.

But time has been soothing and the little girl in the Christmas dress is now a woman ready to make plans.","Fri, 26 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.cbc.ca/1.2881915.1419290146!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/abirami-velai.jpg,"['little', 'sea', 'dress', 'tsunami', 'canadian', 'christmas', 'sri', 'abirami', '2004', 'day', 'girl', 'money', 'family']",

Author: Faraz Ahmad; Publisher: Vitasta; Pages: 312; Price: Rs.495

This is as incredulous an account of Rajiv Gandhi's assassination as it can get. If journalist-author Faraz Ahmad is to believed, a lot of people knew that Gandhi was going to get killed on the night of May 21, 1991; the LTTE hand in the killing is bogus, the Sri Lankan government perhaps was the real killer? If the surmises in the book are true, then it must be equally true that LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran never died in May 2009.

The author says he had always been sceptical about the official version of Gandhi's assassination at an election rally near Chennai by a woman suicide bomber and that ""the LTTE thesis is too full of holes to believe"". As for the CBI that probed the killing, it was ""more keen on a cover-up than unravelling the mystery"".

According to the book, then Chief Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan ""may have also been privy to the conspiracy to kill Rajiv Gandhi"". Ahmad feels it is possible that Sivarasan, the LTTE man who masterminded the killing, could have been ""a LTTE renegade working at the behest of the Sinhalese Sri Lankan government"". And that Maragatham Chandrasekar, the Congress candidate for whom Gandhi went to campaign in Sriperumbudur only to die, ""played a vital contributory and accessory role in the assassination"".

The author goes on: ""There were other accessories to this crime like the central government of then Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar and the union home ministry."" There is more: ""It is now proven that in their own way both Chandra Shekhar and (P.V.) Narasimha Rao appeared privy to the conspiracy (to kill Gandhi).""

Some questions Ahmad raises to ""disprove"" the LTTE hand in the killing display a poor understanding of the Tamil Tigers and the way the group functioned over the years in Sri Lanka and abroad including India. He wants to know for example why the camera used by the young photographer who clicked Gandhi's final moments were not removed by the LTTE. The fact is the camera would have certainly disappeared if only the man who hired the photographer had not been prevented from reaching the murder site by mobs that took over the streets following the killing.

There are certain factual inaccuracies in the book. I will mention two. The late Radha Vinod Raju of the CBI never headed the Jammu and Kashmir Police. And Sriperumbudur is not on the seashore. So there is no way the killer gang could have got away in a speedboat after Gandhi was blown up when he was leading the Congress to a possible win in general elections.

57,57,Drought Sri Lanka,"Reflections on economic growth, unemployment and poverty | The Sunday Times Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/141116/columns/reflections-on-economic-growth-unemployment-and-poverty-128166.html,"Reflections on economic growth, unemployment and poverty View(s):

There has been significant economic growth in recent years. Unemployment and poverty, too, have been reduced. These developments have been especially manifest in the five years after the war. There is visible evidence of economic growth, decreased unemployment and reduced poverty. Exogenous factors and foreign borrowing have played an important role towards these achievements.

However, there has been scepticism about official estimates of economic growth, unemployment and poverty. Economists have pointed out certain inconsistencies in statistics that lend support to the view that economic growth is not as high as estimated. One such evidence is the falling revenue to GDP ratio. When the GDP and per capita incomes of a country are increasing, the proportion of revenue to GDP is expected to increase. In Sri Lanka it has decreased in recent years. This has led to the questioning of the GDP estimate that is the denominator.

Another is the trend of decreasing exports as a proportion of GDP. Despite economic growth exports have declined and imports have increased resulting in large trade deficits despite high economic growth. The increasing agricultural output in years when crops have been adversely affected by drought and floods also adds to such scepticism. One can give explanations to these paradoxes but these explanations may in turn lack adequate facts and figures.

Weaknesses in statistics

No doubt there are serious weaknesses in national statistics. Their sample design, collection and computation may leave much to be desired. Nevertheless there are no alternate statistics with which these may be compared. It is best to consider these estimates as ordinal measures than as precise cardinal values.

Incomes have risen

There is adequate visual evidence countrywide that there has been economic growth, that incomes have increased, that consumption levels have increased, and that unemployment has declined. However, the reasons for these improvements are not entirely the economic growth in the country but significant other exogenous and endogenous factors.

Remittances

One of the important reasons for improvements in income is the large amount of remittances that come into the country. The majority of these remittances are from Sri Lankan migrant workers in the Middle East, but there are workers employed in many other countries as well. There are significant amounts of remittances from European countries, East and South East Asia, Australia and even the Maldives and Bangladesh.

In 2013, total remittances amounted to US$ 6.4 billion and are expected to exceed US$ 7 billion this year — about a tenth of this year’s projected GDP. This gives an idea of the enormity of these funds. It is most likely that the actual amount of remittances is higher as there are informal ways by which monies are remitted that are inadequately captured in the official statistics. These considerable remittances are mostly to the lower income segments of the country. Consequently incomes in rural areas as well as in lower income urban populations are enhanced and are an important causal factor for the reduction of poverty in the country.

The economic and social impacts of these remittances are an important explanation for the increased incomes and improved livelihoods of a large number of households. Remittances have improved housing of low income earners and rural homes have television, electronic and electrical appliances. Many households have three wheelers or motor cycles and some have vans. All these improvements have been due to remittances and consumer durables brought in by these workers.

Unemployment exported

The exodus of large numbers of the labour force abroad is a reason for the reduction of the unemployment rate. About 20 per cent of the labour force is estimated to be employed abroad.

Wages of armed forces

The wages of armed personnel is another significant factor for the improvement of incomes. These wages that are a high proportion of the large defence expenditure go mostly to lower income groups in rural areas. Incomes have consequently increased though their impact is not of the same magnitude as remittances.

Employment in the armed forces and the absorption of large numbers of educated youth to an already bloated public service, as teachers and into state banks have reduced unemployment, though their productive deployment is questionable.

Economic impacts

Both these income sources have multiplier impacts and backward linkages. Quite apart from raising incomes and reducing poverty, these resources have been used for economic enterprises: financing a three wheeler, obtaining tools for small industrial enterprises, obtaining educational services and technical training. In addition the increased consumption has led to stimulating trade and increased demand for consumption goods.

The rapid growth of towns in the hinterland owes much to the increased demand for consumption goods. The wide variety of goods available makes small shops and boutiques miniature super markets. This phenomenon is evidence of the impact of these income flows.

Concluding perspectives

Exogenous factors rather than internal economic developments have been mainly responsible for improvements in employment and incomes and stimulating growth. The large foreign funding of investment, consumption and the consequent high foreign indebtedness have raised doubts about the sustainability of the growth momentum.

The sources of growth also leave much to be desired: increased wages and salaries of public servants, foreign-funded government investment in infrastructure rather than increased manufactures and growth in certain services have raised concerns.

Assessing the nature and sources of growth and the causes for the improvements in employment and poverty are more important than quibbling about the veracity of statistics. The official estimates can be taken as ordinal measures of high growth, a reduction in unemployment and a lowering of poverty. The reasons for these improvements are largely exogenous or owing to foreign borrowing that has increased foreign debt beyond safe threshold levels. Consequently there is apprehension on whether the growth momentum is sustainable in the long run. This is the issue rather than whether the economy has grown by the amount estimated or unemployment is as low as estimated and whether poverty has been reduced to the extent assessed. These economic indicators have improved but the ways and means by which they have been achieved creates doubts about the quality and sustainability of growth, employment and incomes.","Sun, 16 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/common_library/favicon.ico,"['reflections', 'economic', 'large', 'incomes', 'income', 'remittances', 'poverty', 'unemployment', 'increased', 'improvements', 'growth']",

Angelo Mathews' ten sixes in his unbeaten 139 against India Angelo Mathews' ten sixes in his unbeaten 139 against India in Ranchi earlier this month was actually one short of the Sri Lankan record. That was set by Sanath Jayasuriya, who belted 11 sixes in his 65-ball innings of 134 against Pakistan in Singapore in April 1996.

What was Don Bradman's strike rate in Tests? And did he ever have a lean patch with the bat? asked Waqar Ahmed Afridi from Pakistan

Don Bradman's batting strike rate isn't shown on ESPNcricinfo, as the database doesn't have full details for some of his innings. But BJ Wakley's forensic examination of his career, in his 1959 book Bradman the Great, says the Don scored his 5028 runs against England from 8586 balls, an average of 58 per 100 balls - and scored at 36 runs per hour in all Tests (34 v England). As for a lean patch, one of the amazing things about Bradman's career was that he never had what anyone else would recognise as a bad trot. The longest he went between Test centuries was 11 innings, spread over seven Tests in the 1932-33 Bodyline series and in England in 1934 - and he was feeling below par for much of that England tour, suffering with what turned out to be appendicitis. It didn't stop him ending that mini-drought with an innings of 304 in the fourth Test at Headingley (and adding 244 in the final Test at The Oval)!

Was Meg Lanning the first player to score a hundred at the Bradman Oval? And is she also the youngest player to captain Australia in international cricket? asked Maria Gibson from Australia

Meg Lanning's Meg Lanning's 135 not out for Australia Women against West Indies Women earlier this month was the first century in international cricket at the Bradman Oval. The ground in Bowral has staged one women's Test (in 2007-08, when Australia's Lisa Sthalekar had a near-miss, being out for 98) and five women's ODIs. There has been one senior men's one-day game at the ground, in the ING Cup in 2002-03: Brad Hodge made 101 for Victoria, but was trumped by Simon Katich's undefeated 136 for New South Wales. There was also one Under-19 ODI, in 1995-96, when Chris Gaffaney - now a Test umpire - hit 113 for New Zealand against an Australian side containing Chris Rogers and Brad Haddin. Lanning was 21 years and 300 days old when she captained Australia for the first time, in a one-day international against England inMelbourne in January 2014: that's about eight months younger than the youngest male captain, Ian Craig, who died recently. He was 22 years 194 days old when he captained in a Test against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1957-58.

By a concerned economist View(s): View(s):

“Mahinda Chintana (Vision for the Future)” reiterates that Sri Lanka aspires to become a “poverty-free” middle income country by 2016 with US$ 4,000 per capita income. What is the true picture of poverty, its depth and breadth? The intention of this brief article is to revisit selected government statistics on peoples’ income and assess how close we are to the goal of a poverty-free country.

According to the 2014, budget speech, Sri Lanka’s poverty level is 6.4 per cent — meaning, that 6.4 per cent of the total population of about 20 million live below the official poverty line (OPL). The figure was 15.2 per cent in 2006. This shows a commendable reduction of poverty. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) declares that the OPL is Rs. 3,781 per person per month — or Rs. 126 per day. The figure is derived using the absolute poverty line approach. In other words, this is the income that one person needs to meet the cost of basic needs which include the cost of food to provide 2030 kilo calories per person per month, clothing, housing, education, transport, and medicine. The cost of food takes about 44 per cent of the income.

Income and non-income poverty

There are at least two facets to poverty: income and non-income poverty. The OPL refers only to the income poverty. The non-income poverty is represented mainly by achievements in education and health. The Human Development Index (HDI) that is regularly estimated by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the progress. It was 0.750 in 2013 – a notable improvement from 0.557 in 1980. The index ranks Sri Lanka 73 out of 187 countries and places the country in the high human development category. Given the improving non-income poverty levels, what is meant by “poverty free” is the alleviation of income poverty.

Of the 4.9 million total households (based on the DCS figures), 313,600 are in the poverty group. A family from this group with four members, which is the average family size in the country, lives at or below the monthly income level of Rs. 15,124 (Rs. 3,781 x 4). No doubt, such families are poor. By international standards they are in absolute poverty, earning only $0.96 per day per person, whereas $1.25 is the accepted international poverty line which meets basic needs. While the goal is to bring the poor families above the OPL and make them non-poor, what is the income status of the rest of the population in the country? By definition they should be non-poor. Using the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) of 2012/2013 of the DCS, the income situation of the non-poor is reviewed.

The HIES estimates that the average household income of four members as Rs. 46,207 per month. The 4.9 million households in the country thus earn a total of Rs. 226,414 million in a month. For the purpose of this article let us divide these households into three groups, namely the rich accounting for 20 per cent, the middle-income group 73.6 per cent, and the poor the balance 6.4 per cent. According to DCS estimates, the rich 20 per cent had a share of 52 per cent of the total income in 2012/2013, meaning they pocketed Rs. 117,735 million leaving Rs. 108,679 million to share among the other two groups. Taking poor households’ total income of Rs. 4,743 million (i.e. Rs 15,124 times 313,600 households) out, 73.6 per cent of the middle income households get an average monthly income of Rs. 28,819 million (i.e. Rs 103,936 million shared among 3.6 million households) or Rs. 7,204 per capita monthly income which is Rs. 240 per person per day. The difference between the average income of the poor and the middle class households is just Rs. 114 per day (Rs. 240 – 126). The implicit indication of this is that, on average, a middle class person will have to push her/his living standards above the basic level, which is the poor person’s living standard, only with an additional income of Rs. 114 per day. On the other hand a middle class family can fall back to the poor group by missing Rs. 114 per day. The adequacy of this additional income to push a family above the poverty line and provide a decent living standard is highly questionable.

The average per capita daily income of Rs. 240 is $1.84, just above the international poverty line of $1.25 a day per person and this is for 74 per cent of the households of the country. To enjoy lower middle income country status, one person needs to start getting a daily income of at least $2.9 and reach to $11.3, according to the World Bank figures. On average one person among the 20 per cent rich people in the country is earning $ 7.7 per day. One can envision our national income distribution status and how far the large majority of the population should progress to get into a decent living standard which is on par with middle income status.

Regional poverty and its causes

The main economic engagement of the people determines their income and thus the poverty level. Therefore it is obvious that the Western Province has the lowest poverty level, which is two per cent. The Mullaitivu district has the highest poverty level, 29 per cent, followed by the Badulla district 12 per cent and Moneragala district 21 per cent. These districts have been lagging behind for the past decade or so. The highly unequal distribution of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) among the provinces explains regional poverty and inequality. With the Western Province taking almost half of the national GDP, 44 per cent to be exact in 2012 and sharing with 23 per cent of the country’s population, the other eight provinces are left to share the balance.The primary reason for the low GDP is the type of employment. The earnings in terms of wages, according to the government labour force survey (2012), are the lowest in the agriculture sector, averaging Rs. 12,541 per earner per month whereas the figure in the industrial sector is Rs. 17,142 and the services sector is Rs. 21,886.

The same study reports that more than 50 per cent of the labour force in the lagging regions is engaged in agriculture. When more people are involved in a less viable sector, higher will be their poverty level. Agriculture is less viable and it will further lose its relative importance if the current status continues. Just to show the national status, there are 2.6 million employees and their families in the agriculture sector in 2012 which is 32 per cent of the workforce.

It is often argued that industrial, mainly garment exports, remittances of migrant un-skilled and semi-skilled labour and spillover effects of the massive infrastructure development work in the country have positive influence on poverty. Yes, partially. A more important question, however, is how much of that income gets infiltrated into the hands of the poor and what proportion of that income gets invested in viable and sustainable ventures. A large portion of such income ends up in supporting consumption rather than investment. It has been estimated that almost 80 per cent of the remittance income, which is nearly Rs. 780 billion a year, is consumed for housing, purchasing domestic goods and other items. Therefore it has limited impact in breaking the vicious cycle of poverty. It is highly doubtful that the debt-financed infrastructure will have a short or even long-run impact on poverty reduction unless and until income-generating avenues and a congenial investment climate with opportunities are available for the poor.

Achieving the goal and conclusion

It is needless to emphasise that the disparities in income should be managed and minimised if Sri Lanka is to be a poverty-free country with middle income status. It needs a well-planned, holistic, inclusive and widely spread development programme with adequate budgets. The agriculture, industrial and the services sectors should receive required investment with an emphasis on the lagging regions. While it is impossible to present an account of such a development plan, this article emphasises the strong potentials that exist in the agriculture sector to contribute to that development. This is especially because it is the mainstay in almost all the lagging regions, sole livelihood of a majority of the poor, and has vast potential to spur the growth of other two sectors. ‘Unstoppable Sri Lanka 2020’, the planning document of the government, refers to a number of strategies which foster inclusive development. Their effectiveness, however, depends on adequate budget allocations. For example, the current budgetary allocation of 1-2 per cent of GDP for agriculture is grossly inadequate for the required growth to minimise inequality. With the current level of widespread poverty, it is highly unlikely that the country will achieve its goal of poverty-free society by 2016. However, adequate budget allocation and providing a congenial environment for investment in rural areas will take the country to the goalpost slowly but steadily. For that the Government’s commitment is essential.","Sun, 14 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/common_library/favicon.ico,"['2015', 'rs', 'million', 'income', 'lanka', 'sri', 'dream', 'cent', 'free', 'poverty', 'country', 'households', 'reality', 'person', 'middle', 'poor']", 
62,62,Drought Sri Lanka,Alarm over rising seas but villagers keep returning to risky shore | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/140824/news/alarm-over-rising-seas-but-villagers-keep-returning-to-risky-shore-114753.html,"Alarm over rising seas but villagers keep returning to risky shore By Nadia Fazlulhaq Ports, hotels will cause erosion near and far View(s): View(s):

For Shanthi of the Sri Dharmaarama Road fishing village in Ratmalana and Kamala Fernando of Ransigamawella off Wennappuwa, the coming days are a struggle to protect their houses from the strong waves that are rapidly swallowing up the shore.

Thousands of families living bordering the south-western coasts and north-western coasts are at a growing risk of coastal erosion, experts fear.

The latest danger was reported in Ratmalana where about 20 houses were destroyed with chairs, mats, pots and pans of poor fishing families sailing away with the waves.

Prof. W.N. Wilson, senior lecturer in geography at the Colombo University, said more than half the country’s population lives in coastal areas and the coastline from Kalpitiya to Tangalle is more prone to coastal erosion-related disasters.

He said the beaches of Mt. Lavinia, Ratmalana, Wellawatte, Wattala, Poruthota, off Wennappuwa, Marawila, Kalpitiya, Weligama, Beruwala, Ahangama, Hikkaduwa and Unawatuna would be more affected by erosion due to human-made factors and natural factors such as the south-west monsoon, disturbances in the atmosphere, rough seas and strong currents.

He said crystalline rocks, corals, beach sand and rock debris found in the coastal terrain acted as natural barriers but these were being destroyed in places.

“Coral mining, mining in rivers and estuaries, rock-blasting to build harbours, drilling into coastal soil layers to build hotels, apartments etc. are among the leading causes for the increased coastal erosion,” Prof. Wilson said.

If another tsunami struck, the western and southern belts would experience greater destruction due to increased development activities and settlements bordering the ocean

“With natural barriers destroyed and coast eroding one metre annually, strong waves can easily enter the land. Environment impact assessments and vulnerability studies should continue with erosion prevention given priority. Most of the wooden groynes, structures built out from seashore to control erosion, were destroyed by the 2004 tsunami,” he said.

Prof. Wilson said the northern parts of the country were vulnerable due to turbulences and rain disturbances in the Bay of Bengal.

Thousands of families live along the southern and western coasts that are highly vulnerable to coastal erosion.

Swarna Perera, member of a 300-strong fishing community off Negombo, said she is currently living in her ninth house with all previous houses, whether built of brick or wood, lost to the sea.

“Where are we supposed to go?” she asked. “The authorities give us money but that is not sufficient to buy a plot of land and build a house.”

Kamala Fernando, a resident of Ransigamawella, a coastal village off Wennappuwa, said during the 40 years the sea had encroached about 300m into the land.

“There used to be so much space for me to rear pigs and poultry. Now there is no space at all. After the tsunami, coastal erosion

accelerated,” said Kamala, whose house is on the border, with strong waves hitting the temporary walls made of dried coconut leaves.

Last week’s sea erosion heightened by strong waves damaged 18 houses out of 60 in the coastal village along the Ratmalana coastline. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), the erosion affected 355 persons in 85 families.

Mangala Wickremanayake, Director General of the Department of Coast Conservation Department (CCD), the main body in charge of ensuring the protection of the coast said building harbours had adverse impacts on the coast in adjacent areas, and constant monitoring and erosion prevention measures should be taken.

She said the Oluwil harbour had caused coastal erosion in surrounding areas in the east, and solutions such as offshore breakwaters and groynes had to be continuously maintained and monitored.

She said the Colombo port expansion project would have more coastal erosion impact towards the north than the south.

“The Wennappuwa, Marawila, Kalpitiya shorelines are severely affected due to many years of sandmining in Maha Oya that is finally prohibited. Sand nourishment is taking place with sand being pumped last year, and with the increasing erosion we will be doing it next year as well,” she said.

According to Ms. Wickremanayake, development activities, including the construction of tourist hotels, should be carried out only after obtaining permits from the Coast Conservation Department.

The permit application has criteria including whether the area has been subjected to erosion in the recent past, and these will be investigated by the CCD before issuing a permit, she said.

Under the CCD Act “development activity” is defined as “any activity likely to alter the physical nature of the Coastal Zone in any way, and include the construction of buildings and works, the deposit of wastes, other materials from outfalls, vessels or by other means or removal of sand, coral, shells, natural vegetation, sea grass or other substances, dredging and filings, land reclamation, and mining or drilling for minerals, but does not include fishing.”

Ms. Wickremanayake said at present, hotel projects in coastal areassuch as Negombo and Unawatuna had caused soil erosion.

She also said the destruction of houses in the Ratmalana sea erosion incident was due to the residents building unauthorised constructions on sand dunes.

“Under the Coast Conservation Act we can take extreme measures and stick to the no-build zone of 100m. But political pressure has led us to limit the use of our powers due to the vote bank. Despite providing them with housing schemes and handing over money, families still settle near the shore,” she said.

Dr. Jagath Munasinghe, a senior lecturer at the Department of Town and Country Planning at the University of Moratuwa and Secretary to the Institute of Town Planners, said previously institutions relating to town planning such as the Urban Development Authority (UDA) lacked power to take action and there were insufficient technical officers to provide advice or guidance, unlike today.

“With the increased coastal erosion there is a need for proper infrastructure for these fishing families. Workstations should be built for fishermen so their boats and fishing equipment can be stored safely while their houses should be moved away from the risky sea shore.

“Law enforcement is a must. The first generation will complain but gradually they will move to better settlements,” he said.

The Sunday Times learns that some affected families had received Rs. 500,000 when their houses had been previously washed away and some residents also received houses at housing schemes in Ratmalana.

The villagers allege, however, that the houses had been provided to supporters of local politicians, with some owning 10-15 housing units.

Last week, a new Asian Development Bank (ADB) climate and economics report for South Asia said the country’s vast and diverse coastal region, covering nearly a quarter of the island, is likely to see serious damage to fisheries and coastal ecosystems from more frequent storms and a potential one metre rise in sea level, which would badly affect the Jaffna and Gampaha districts, which include several coastal areas affected by erosion.

The report said the country should respond to climate threats by adopting saline-resistant crop varieties, more integrated coastal zone management, increased efficiencies in the energy sector, improved disease and vector surveillance, more protection of groundwater resources and greater use of recycled water.","Sun, 24 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/common_library/favicon.ico,"['coastal', 'sea', 'families', 'coast', 'fishing', 'villagers', 'risky', 'returning', 'alarm', 'erosion', 'strong', 'rising', 'ratmalana', 'shore', 'houses', 'sand', 'seas']",

ODDUSUDDAN, Sri Lanka, Aug 24 2014 (IPS) - In this dust bowl of a village deep inside Sri Lanka’s former conflict zone, locals will sometimes ask visitors to rub their palms on the ground and watch their skin immediately take on a dark bronze hue, proof of the fertility of the soil.

Village lore in Oddusuddan, located in the Mullaitivu district, some 338 km north of the capital Colombo, has it that the land is so fertile, anything will grow here. But Mashewari Vellupillai, a 53-year-old single mother, knows that rich farmland alone is not enough to ensure a viable future.

Thirty years of civil war in the Northern Province, where the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were defeated by government forces in May 2009, are not easily forgotten, and five years of peace have not yet resulted in prosperity for many residents in this former battleground.

“You have to do things on your own otherwise there will be no money."" -- Velupillai Selvarathnam, a former lorry driver from Mullaitivu



Schemes to provide relief and employment opportunities for civilians and rehabilitated combatants are few and far between , and several villagers tell IPS that survival here is dependent on creative thinking to make the most of the few income generation options available.

At least 30 percent of the population in the province derives their income from agriculture or related areas, and a 10-month-old drought is wrecking havoc on farmers who tend to focus on a single crop at a time.

After taking a 50,000-rupee (384-dollar) financial hit following a failed harvest last year, Vellupillai has diversified the two-acre plot that surrounds her half-built house and planted everything from onions and bananas to cassava, aubergines and tobacco.

In addition, she has leased out her two acres of paddy land, and hires workers intermittently to see to its harvest.

Vellupilla’s most profitable crop is tobacco; a single, good-quality leaf fetches about 10 rupees (0.77 dollars), giving her an income of about 10,000 rupees (about 76 dollars) monthly.

“I can’t take a chance by depending on one source of income, I have to be sure that I have alternatives,” she tells IPS, citing cases of villagers here falling victim to a buyers’ market, as was the case in 2011 when most Oddusuddan residents grew aubergines and were forced to part with their yields for dirt cheap prices as buyers from Vavuniya Town, 60 km south, manipulated the market.

Over 400,000 people like Vellupillai have returned to the north after fleeing the last days of fighting between armed forces and the LTTE.

Since then, the government has poured over three billion dollars into massive infrastructure projects in the region, including rail-links, new roads and electrification schemes.

But despite such impressive figures, life in general remains hard. Poverty is rampant according to the latest government figures released for the first quarter of this year.

Four of the five districts that make up the province recorded rates higher than the national figure of 6.7 percent.

Three of them – Kilinochchi, Mannar and Mullaittivu – recorded poverty rates of 12.7 percent, 20.1 percent and 28.8 percent respectively, according to the latest government poverty head count released in April. Experts say this comes as no surprise, since these districts were hit hardest by the war, and are suffering the worst of its long-term impacts.

Unemployment also remains above national levels. There are no official figures for full unemployment rates in the Northern Province, but in the two districts where figures are available – Kilinochchi at 9.3 percent and Mannar at 8.1 percent – they were over twice the national rate of four percent.

Economists working in the region feel that unemployment could be as high 30 percent in some parts of the province.

A dearth of proper housing adds to the troubles of the north, with only 41,000 out of a required 143,000 houses being handed over to returning residents, while some 10,500 homes are still under construction.

According to UN Habitat, initial funding was for 83,000 units, including those already built, but no funds are available for the remaining 60,000 homes.

“Those who can make the situation work for them, or use what they have in them […] will fare better,” Sellamuththu Srinivasan, the additional district secretary for the Kilinochchi District, told IPS.

That is precisely what Velupillai Selvarathnam, a former lorry driver from Mullaitivu, has done.

Since the war’s end, he rents a small vehicle and commutes between Colombo and his hometown, covering a distance of over 300 km each week to bring ready-made garments from the capital to his small shop close to the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu.

“I can make a 25,000-rupee profit [about 192 dollars] every month,” he told IPS.

That is good money, especially if it is constant in a district that is one of the poorest five in the country and where the average monthly income is less than 4,000 rupees (about 30 dollars).

Selvarathnam, who has a deep scar on the side of his chest running down to his abdomen caused by a shell injury, tells IPS, “You have to do things on your own otherwise there will be no money.” His next aim is to travel to India to purchase garments in bulk, so that he can cut down on costs even more.

Like him, Velvarasa Sithadevi, another resident of Oddusudan has her hands full. She has to take care of a 25-year-old son who suffers from shellshock and a husband who is yet to recover from his wartime injuries.

When the family received a 25,000-rupee (192-dollar) grant from the U.N. Refugee Agency upon returning to their home village in 2011, Sithadevi invested the money in setting up a small shop. “We live in the back room, that is enough for us,” she told IPS.

Sithadevi is a good cook, and sells food products in her roadside shop. “It is a good business, especially when there are people working on roads and other construction [sites],” she stated, adding that she makes about 4,000 rupees (30 dollars) a day.

But for every single individual success story, there are thousands of others unable to break out of the suffocating cycle of poverty in the region.

Public official Srinivasan said that if assistance were to increase, the overall situation would improve. That, however, is unlikely to happen any time soon.

“The next option is to attract private sector investment […]. We are talking with companies in the south, there is some progress, but we need more companies to come in,” he stressed.

64,64,Drought Sri Lanka,Preserving Lebanon's Water before the Wells Run Dry - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2014/09/30/preserving-lebanon-s-water-before-the-wells-run-dry,"“Water, water, the water’s come!” shouted Umm Majd, as she leaned over her balcony to check if what she had just heard really was water trickling in through the pipes. She and her neighbors rushed into their apartments to fill bathtubs and whatever containers they could find before the water went off again. Not a single drop had reached her home for eight days.

If there is one thing the Lebanese agree on, it is how bad the water situation is. Even electricity (which also suffers cuts) is mostly mentioned in the context of whether the power will be on when the water comes back—to run the washing machine, for example, or enable private tankers to pump water up into roof-top tanks.

Ahmad Sbeity, a grocer in Beirut, can’t understand how a country like Lebanon—known for its rivers and springs—can be so short on water. He says he pays about US$1,200 for tanker water a year, and an additional US$600 for bottled drinking water. Added to that, the US$170 yearly flat fee per household for the municipal water supply, and Ahmad is spending a considerable part of his income on the most basic need of getting water into his home.

For years, Lebanon struggled with water shortages in the summer and fall but, in 2014, the combination of a particularly severe drought and the strain more than a million Syrian refugees were placing on Lebanon’s infrastructure, made the problem more acute. Lebanon stores-up only six percent of its fresh water supplies, though the Middle East and North Africa region’s average is much higher than that. As a result, a significant portion of Lebanon’s fresh water supply is lost.

Compounding the problem in the long-term, are the estimated 20,000 illegal wells or boreholes operational in the Greater Beirut area, most supplying private water tankers and, simultaneously, depleting underground water reserves. Nabil, who operates a water tanker, hesitates to reply where the water he is filling the tanks of a Beirut apartment building with, comes from. Those who can afford bottled water, drink it. The half million or so people who live on less than US$4 a day, boil their water to reduce their risks from drinking dirty water.

To help tackle the water shortages faced by Lebanese consumers, the World Bank has approved its largest ever project in the country—a US$474 million loan to increase municipal water supplies. The Islamic Development Bank and the Government of Lebanon are also providing parallel financing (of US$128million and US$15million respectively), toward the total cost of US$617million.

The Water Supply Augmentation Project will target the Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon Area, where half of Lebanon’s population of about 4 million lives. A dam will be constructed on the Bisri River in South Lebanon and will store 125 million cubic meters of water, filling up naturally in the winter and spring for use during the summer and fall. Water will flow to Beirut entirely by gravity and will not incur pumping costs through a 26-kilometer underground tunnel and be treated at a plant on the way.

The project’s implementing agency—the Council for Development and Reconstruction—set-up an international panel of experts on dam safety, which reviewed every aspect of the design, construction and operations. Some of the world’s most renowned experts in hydrology, seismology, and geology took part in the process.

In addition, Lebanese counterparts recognized the importance of environmental and social factors, with the government borrowing the funds to create a benefit-sharing program for communities impacted by the project.","Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['dry', 'million', 'lebanese', 'preserving', 'wells', 'supply', 'tankers', 'lebanon', 'underground', 'water', 'run', 'lebanons', 'beirut', 'project']",

Melbourne, Dec 28: After scoring his third Test hundred of the tour, Virat Kohli Sunday said he was left with no good reason to respect pacer Mitchell Johnson and some of the other Australia players after verbals flew “throughout the day” at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The squabbling reached its peak when Johnson fielded in his follow-through and threw back at the striker’s stumps. There was a genuine case for Johnson trying to run Kohli out and the throw was headed for the stumps when it hit Kohli, who was trying to get back into his crease, reports espncricinfo.com.

“I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball, and I told him that’s not on. ‘Try and hit the stumps next time, not my body’,” Kohli said. “You have got to send the right message across. I am not there to take to some unnecessary words or chats from someone. I am going there to play cricket, back myself. There’s no good reason that I should respect unnecessarily some people when they are not respecting me.” Also Read - Post WTC Final Period Likely to Give India Freedom in England

Kohli said this attitude from Australia helped him play better, which he said might be one of the reasons why five of his nine hundreds have come against them. “It was going on throughout the day, They were calling me a spoilt brat, and I said, ‘Maybe that’s the way I am. You guys hate me, and I like that.’ I don’t mind having a chat on the field, and it worked in my favour I guess,” the Indian vice-captain said.

“I like playing against Australia because it is very hard for them to stay calm, and I don’t mind an argument on the field, and it really excites me and brings the best out of me. So, they don’t seem to be learning the lesson.” According to Kohli, Australia have been saying things about India’s habit of crumbling under pressure only because they are up in the series.

“They have the right to talk, I guess. They are two-nil up right now. Would have been interesting if it had been 1-1. When you are on top you can say anything you want. It’s when the chips are down that you have got to stand up. Say what you have to say and then go out there and prove it,” Kohli said.

“When we played in India, there weren’t so many words coming back from them. We are two-nil down, we still took them on today and showed what we can do with the bat, which is the character of this Indian team.” Kohli said he still had respect for some of the Australian players but Johnson wasn’t one of them.

“I respect quite a few of them, but someone who doesn’t respect me I have no reason to respect him. I am out here to play cricket, not to hear anyone’s respect,” Kohli said. “I have got a nice friendship with a few of them. But someone who is not backing off, someone who is saying anything that comes to mouth, I have no reason to respect him.”","Sun, 28 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://static.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mitchell-johnson-and-virat-kohli.jpg,"['mitchell', 'right', 'respecting', 'cricket', 'johnson', 'finds', 'reason', 'stumps', 'kohli', 'virat', 'read', 'say', 'australia', 'respect']",

Brisbane was awash with pre-Christmas revelry on Friday night and those party folk who didn’t quite make it to the Gabba in time for the resumption next morning could have conceivably felt they hadn’t missed much.

As the late morning cloud, if not quite the personal fog began to lift and the lunch break beckoned, stragglers would have noted that the batting pair who had carried India to 1-71 and within sniffing distance of an overall lead the previous evening – Shikhar Dhawan and Cheteshwar Pujara – were still in occupation.

But having eased into their seats and let their glazed eyes focus slowly on the ground’s large electronic scoreboards, they must have then wondered if they had slept through an entire day.

Or if it was the Gabba software rather than their own internal computational gear that was malfunctioning.

India six wickets down and not yet 50 runs in front?

With their number two and three batsmen at the crease?

That a fifth day that had promised such delicate balance and intrigue was being made redundant by Australia’s steamrolling towards their eventual four-wicket with more than a day to spare to gain a two-nil stranglehold on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy?

What was in that final round of fruit-laden cocktails? How many hours did I lose standing in that never-ending taxi queue?

It was only when Pujara lost his wicket 10 minutes before lunch and the board rolled the vision of the morning’s carnage that the picture, though most likely not the throbbing heads and bewildered minds, became a little clearer.

For the early risers, the session of dramatic twists and India’s downward turn in a match where they had established and held a deserved ascendancy for the first two days began even before the players took the field.

Dhawan, the explosive opener who had threatened but failed to ignite in Adelaide and in the first innings at Brisbane, had reportedly been struck on the right forearm while having a warm-up hit in the Gabba nets and was about to head to hospital for precautionary x-rays.

While uncertainty surrounded the nature of the injury, the extent of the damage and whether it had been inflicted by an over-enthusiastic local net bowler or a member of India’s coaching staff serving up a few gentle ‘throw downs’, the Indian team made its displeasure known.

Quick Single: India unimpressed with practice pitches

A hasty, testy statement was drafted and released claiming they had been asking for days for access to the pristine practice pitches being prepared for teams competing in upcoming KFC T20 Big Bash League matches and that Dhawan’s injury justified their concerns.

Queensland officials countered the “worn out” practice wickets did not differ greatly form the cracked, increasingly unpredictable fourth-day surface on which both team’s batsmen would encounter out in the middle, but the tourists held to their belief they had been done a disservice.

What’s worse, Virat Kohli, the batsman despatched prematurely to join Pujara in the middle when Dhawan was unable to resume had also been struck while preparing before play, which might explain why the dual century-maker from the first Test looked so out of sorts this morning.

A nervous moment when struck on the pads by Mitchell Johnson without offering a shot was replaced by dread shortly after when Kohli’s angled bat deflected the ball to his right thigh and, from there, back on to his stumps.

India’s grievance was about to give way to another of those freefalls into disaster that has come to characterise so many of their Test performances during a year that has delivered MS Dhoni’s team a solitary Test win from nine attempts.

In all but one of those – the drawn Test against New Zealand at Wellington remembered for Brendon McCullum’s triple century – India has suffered collapses in which five, six, eight or (as at The Oval in August) all 10 wickets have fallen in a clatter for the addition of less than 100 runs.

This morning’s calamity was 6-72 in fewer than 25 overs but even those confronting numbers don’t do full justice to the speed and indignity with which India hurtled towards defeat.

In keeping with the stage set by yesterday’s counter-productive baiting of Johnson that helped spark his match-altering innings, the Australian spearhead who had struggled for rhythm and impact until that moment rediscovered his menace and completed the rebuttal of his taunters.

Having skittled the stumps of Kohli, whose chirpiness in the field yesterday gave way to silent disbelief when he stood as if frozen for what seemed a minute before dragging himself from the scene, Johnson followed up with a brutal throat ball to Ajinkya Rahane in his next over.

Rahane’s instinctive parry gifted Nathan Lyon the first of two of the simplest catches any gully fielder could hope for, and then Johnson narrowed his sights on Rohit Sharma who he had identified as India’s chief provocateur from the previous afternoon.

One story circulating then suggested Sharma had greeted Johnson – who had bowled without success in India’s first innings – with a “how many wickets have you got in this match?”, or something similar.

It’s unknown if Johnson responded with “more than you’ve made runs in the second dig” after he had Sharma caught behind for a second-ball duck, but he certainly flashed him one of those smiles most famously unleashed on England’s James Anderson in Adelaide last summer.

At that point Johnson had snared 3-10 in the space of 11 balls, and when Dhoni ambled across his stumps and was immediately told he should keep walking back to the dressing room that was by now in turmoil, India had lost four specialist batsmen for a combined contribution of 11 runs.

Which meant half the team was gone with them still 10 runs in deficit.

Plans to send Dhawan to hospital were hurriedly revised and he was instead marched to the middle, where he handled the pace and bounce Johnson and Josh Hazlewood were still enjoying on the deteriorating surface with greater competence than his teammates who hadn’t been traumatised in the nets.

Despite the regular loss of wickets at the other end, Dhawan closed to within 19 runs of what would have been a remarkable rearguard century but fell to Lyon when his attempt to improvise with a lap sweep shot saw the ball miss bat and front pad, but struck his right thigh in front of middle stump.

There was a time not so far from the present when Australian nerves would have jangled at the thought of a fourth-innings target of 128.

Even more so had India been able to push it towards 200.

And pulses might have quickened further when the batsmen most likely to chase down that tally before palms had a chance to sweat up – belligerent opener David Warner and brutal No.3 Shane Watson – were both dismissed for single-figure totals inside the first 10 overs.

Of equal concern was the blow that Warner took on his left thumb, which initially raised fears he might join Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) in doubt for the Boxing Day Test that begins in Melbourne on Friday.

But those haunting memories – which became indelible with the failed pursuit of 117 against a Fanie de Villiers-inspired South Africa in Sydney in the summer of 1993-94 – harked backed to days before Steve Smith had started school.

And even though the scorecard shows Australia’s pursuit was far more fraught than they would have liked – and would have been more so had Smith not been missed by Kohli in the slips on nine – the skipper’s decisive 63-run partnership with Chris Rogers (55 from 57 balls) made sure of his perfect captaincy record to date.

It was left to the younger Marsh to hit the winning runs – a classy cover drive for four, no less – after his older brother was out for a run-a-ball 17, and Brad Haddin (one) again missed out with just six runs required.

Fittingly, it was Johnson, the man who started it all some six hours earlier, who was left unbeaten at the other end as his namesake made it two-nil heading to Melbourne for Boxing Day.","Sat, 20 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2014/12/20johnson.ashx?w=1600,"['fires', 'india', 'johnson', '20', 'struck', 'runs', 'magic', 'mitch', 'day', 'test', 'indias', 'dhawan', 'middle', 'wickets', 'lead', 'aussies']",

Earthquake events hit around the world in August, in Peru, Ecuador, Iran, Algeria, and South Africa. But one of the biggest took place on Aug. 24 in the Napa Valley/San Francisco Bay Area in the U.S., causing a tremor of at least magnitude 6.0. Aon Benfield/Impact Forecasting said that total economic losses from the event could hit the $2 billion mark, with insured losses only in the hundreds of millions of dollars because of the small levels of residential insurance penetration in Napa County and areas close to the epicenter (5.3 percent, versus 10 percent in surrounding counties).

There was also the magnitude 6.1 earthquake that unsettled Yunnan Province in southwest China on Aug. 23, killing at least 617 people and causing injury to more than 3,143 additional people. This event makes the Napa Valley quake pale in comparison in terms of damages, with economic losses predicted to reach $6.3 billion. More than 25,800 homes collapsed after the quake and 200,000 more sustained damage, according to the report.

Other major weather events that struck in August include:

Major flooding in parts of the U.S. Midwest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic due to excessive rainfall. At least one person was killed, and massive rain struck Detroit, Baltimore, and Long Island, N.Y. in particular. The report predicts that the combined events likely surpassed $2 billion in economic losses, with insured losses to both the federal flood insurance program and private insurers surpassing $500 million.

Heavy rains and thunderstorms also affected several parts of China during the month. According to the report, more than 40,000 homes sustained damage or were destroyed outright. Thousands of acres of crops were left submerged under water and at least 37 people died. Total economic losses: at least $1.2 billion.

Monsoonal rains and subsequent flooding and landslides killed hundreds in parts of India, Nepal, Japan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan and South Korea.

Hurricane Iselle slammed into Hawaii’s Big Island, killing one person and causing at least $66 million in agriculture-related damages.

Super Typhoon Halong collided with Japan at the strength of a tropical storm, killing 10 people, injuring 96 and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage. The storm affected the southern and central parts of Japan and dropped more than 42 inches of rain during 72 houses on parts of Shikoku Island.

Meanwhile, severe drought conditions got worse in August in Guatemala and Sri Lanka, threatening both countries’ agricultural sectors.

STOCKHOLM, Sep 23 2014 (IPS) - A gift of nature, or a valuable commodity? A human right, or a luxury for the privileged few? Will the agricultural sector or industrial sector be the main consumer of this precious resource? Whatever the answers to these and many more questions, one thing is clear: that water will be one of the defining issues of the coming decade.

Some estimates say that 768 million people still have no access to fresh water. Other research puts the number higher, suggesting that up to 3.5 billion people are denied the right to an improved source of this basic necessity.

As United Nations agencies and member states inch closer to agreeing on a new set of development targets to replace the soon-to-expire Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the need to include water in post-2015 development planning is more urgent than ever.

“In the next 30 years water usage will rise by 30 percent, water scarcity is going to increase; there are huge challenges ahead of us."" -- Torgny Holmgren, executive director of the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI)



The latest World Water Development Report (WWDR) suggests, “Global water demand (in terms of water withdrawals) is projected to increase by some 55 percent by 2050, mainly because of growing demands from manufacturing (400 percent), thermal electricity generation (140 percent) and domestic use (130 percent).”

In addition, a steady rise in urbanisation is likely to result in a ‘planet of cities’ where 40 percent of the world’s population will reside in areas of severe water stress through 2050.

Groundwater supplies are diminishing; some 20 percent of the world’s aquifers are facing over-exploitation, and degradation of wetlands is affecting the capacity of ecosystems to purify water supplies.

WWDR findings also indicate that climbing global energy demand – slated to rise by one-third by 2030 – will further exhaust limited water sources; electricity demand alone is poised to shoot up by 70 percent by 2035, with China and India accounting for over 50 percent of that growth.

Against this backdrop, water experts around the world told IPS that management of this invaluable resource will occupy a prominent place among the yet-to-be finalised Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in the hopes of fending off crises provoked by severe shortages.

“We are discussing the goals, and most member [states] agree that water needs better coordination and management,” Amina Mohammed, the United Nations secretary-general’s special advisor on post-2015 development planning told IPS on the sidelines of the annual Stockholm World Water Week earlier this month.

What is needed now, Mohammed added, is greater clarity on goals that can be mutually agreed upon by member states.

Other water experts allege that in the past, water management has been excluded from high-level decision-making processes, despite it being an integral part of any development process.

“In the next 30 years water usage will rise by 30 percent, water scarcity is going to increase; there are huge challenges ahead of us,” Torgny Holmgren, executive director of the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), told IPS.

He added that the way the world uses water is drastically changing. Traditionally agriculture has been the largest guzzler of fresh water, but in the near future the manufacturing sector is tipped to take over. “Over 25 percent of [the world’s] water use will be by the energy sector,” Holmgren said.

For many nations, especially in the developing world, the water-energy debate represents the classic catch-22: as more people move out of poverty and into the middle class with spending capacity, their energy demands increase, which in turn puts tremendous pressure on limited water supplies.

The statistics of this demographic shift are astonishing, said Kandeh Yumkella, special representative of the secretary-general who heads Ban Ki-moon’s pet project, the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative.

Yumkella told IPS that by 2050, three billion persons will move out of poverty and 60 percent of the world’s population will be living in cities.

“Everyone is demanding more of everything, more houses, more cars and more water. And we are talking of a world where temperatures are forecasted to rise by two to three degrees Celsius, maybe more,” he asserted.

South Asia in need of proper planning

South Asia, home to 1.7 billion people of which 75 percent live in rural areas, is one of the most vulnerable regions to water shocks and represents an urgent mandate to government officials and all stakeholders to formulate coordinated and comprehensive plans.

The island of Sri Lanka, for instance, is a prime example of why water management needs to be a top priority among policy makers. With climate patterns shifting, the island has been losing chunks of its growth potential to misused water.

In the last decade, floods affected nine million people, representing almost half of Sri Lanka’s population of just over 20 million. Excessive rain also caused damages to the tune of one billion dollars, according to the latest data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Ironically, the island also constantly suffers from a lack of water. Currently, a 10-month drought is affecting 15 of its 25 districts, home to 1.5 million people. It is also expected to drive down the crucial rice harvest by 17 percent, reducing yields to the lowest levels in six years. All this while the country is trying to maintain an economic growth rate of seven percent, experts say.

In trying to meet the challenges of wildly fluctuating rain patterns, the government has adopted measures that may actually be more harmful than helpful in the long term.

In the last three years it has switched to coal to offset drops in hydropower generation. Currently coal, which is considered a “dirty” energy source, is the largest energy source for the island, making up 46 percent of all energy produced, according to government data.

Top government officials like Finance Secretary Punchi Banda Jayasundera and Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga have told IPS that they are working on water management.

But for those who favour fast-track moves, like Mohammed and Yumkella, verbal promises need to translate into firm goals and action.

“If you don’t take water into account, either you are going to fail in your development goals, or you are going to put a lot of pressure on you water resources,” Richard Connor, lead author of the 2014 WWDR, told IPS.

The situation is equally dire for India and China. According to a report entitled ‘A Clash of Competing Necessities’ by CNA Analysis and Solutions, a Washington-based research organisation, 53 percent of India’s population lives in water-scarce areas, while 73 percent of the country’s electricity capacity is also located.

India’s power needs have galloped and according to research conducted in 2012, the gap between power demand and supply was 10.2 percent and was expected to rise further. The last time India faced a severe power crisis, in July 2012, 600 million people were left without power.

According to China Water Risk, a non-profit organisation, China’s energy needs will grow by 100 percent by 2050, but already around 60 percent of the nation’s groundwater resources are polluted.

China is heavily reliant on coal power but the rising demand for energy will put considerable stress on water resources in a nation where already at least 50 percent of the population may be facing water shortages, according to Debra Tan, the NGO’s director.

For ages now, every year of theirs has felt like a pretzel inside a roundabout on Groundhog Day: winding here, winding there, tacking right sharply, u-turning, screeching to a halt, speeding up again. Then ending up where you began. Or is that just the career of Misbah-ul-Haq as played out in the head of Shahid Afridi?

For is it not these two who, evermore, have come to represent, well, something of Pakistan cricket in this modern age? What that something is I don't know, nor do I know how it could even be possible for two such contrasting men to represent one entity, but again this year, Pakistan lived a whole year as Afridi and a whole year as Misbah.

Like Misbah, they were so good in Tests in the UAE that at times it felt like this was the Pakistan of the '80s and '90s, and that Dubai and Abu Dhabi were as impregnable as Karachi, and Sharjah as unbreachable as Sharjah again.

Through all their finest moments stood Misbah; the unbeaten 68 in that scampering Sharjah chase (and almost as memorable, the moustache-twirling ode to Dav Whatmore); the twin hundreds against Australia and the series win this winter. By the end what was more difficult to believe? That Misbah was Pakistan's most successful Test captain of all? Or that he had equalled Viv Richards for the fastest Test hundred of all time?

Abroad, like Misbah, Pakistan were not so good, losing two Tests carelessly to Sri Lanka. So of course they won and lost four Tests apiece. Far be it from Misbah and Pakistan to provide conclusiveness to anything.

They did not win a single ODI series this year, and in fact were not very good at the format at all. But they were, like Kim Kardashian, impossible not to watch, no matter what they were doing, breaking the internet on good, bad and ridiculous days.

It was much in the mould of Afridi himself. He may not have been the officially appointed full-time ODI captain, but in his own head he was and to a considerable degree, spiritually it was he, not Misbah, who was the more pervasive influence.

It wasn't only because he was responsible for some of the most memorable interventions. He was also the only player other than Ahmed Shehzad to play all 16 ODIs Pakistan played this year. And Shehzad, incidentally, is nothing if not a walking postmodern homage to Afridi.

The lack of series wins is an important statistic, given how fluid Pakistan's ODI line-up was this year. Only three men who played in the first ODI XI of the year played in the last (Umar Akmal was the third). As preparations go for a World Cup, it is pitch perfect.

Much the same applies to their board. All those court cases for control crippled its work, yet somehow not only did the PCB start the year as the most confusing beacon of morality since Robin Hood, it also ended up with probably its most democratic and right-minded constitution. And still nobody will say today that it is a particularly slick-functioning board.

They also ended it afloat, which, as this was the year that marked the fifth anniversary of the terror attacks on Sri Lanka, is perhaps reason for quiet cheer. As Kenya visited, the first non-Asian international team to do so since then, it marked the first, tiniest step on a long road back. Nobody can say when international cricket will return, but we are a year closer to it.

High point

In more impulsive moments, one might opt for the Afridi-inspired win over India at the Asia Cup. But on reflection how can any moment top the toppling of Australia this winter in the UAE? To do so at all, given Pakistan had not beaten them in 20 years, was some feat. To do so without Saeed Ajmal and Junaid Khan, with an attack as green as Pakistan's, against a team like Australia, was gonzo cricket. It was near enough the most perfect series of Test cricket Pakistan have played in years, maybe ever. Their batsmen, led by Younis Khan (disgruntled, as ever, coming in) not only scored runs, they broke records; each of their bowlers took wickets, and the fielders their catches. When Misbah goes, this series will be the greatest gift of his era and his career.

Low point

The series losses in Sri Lanka were pretty poor but the greatest loss came during the first Test, when Saeed Ajmal's action was reported. For three years Ajmal had been Pakistan's leading man across all formats, the one guy in whom all of Pakistan would invest their most fervent hopes: take this wicket, save these runs, win this match. When he was suspended soon after, it took away the one bit of stardust in what has been a pretty staid era (with apologies to Afridi). His suspension evoked similar emotions as it had once done for Murali, namely that he was just too nice and decent a guy for this to happen. And when Pakistan moved on and started winning without him, it felt even worse. He is still not back and may never return the same as he was. A little light has gone out.

New kid on the block

Perhaps this should be a collective award to the Test attack Pakistan unveiled in the first Test against Australia. Sure Rahat Ali and Zulfiqar Babar had played Tests, but they only debuted in 2013. Imran Khan and, most impressively, Yasir Shah were proper debutants. And what a quartet they made: right-arm and left-arm pace, left-arm orthodox spin and a leggie. Yasir was probably the most equal of them, if only because he was so refreshing. He was Pakistan's first proper legspinner since Danish Kaneria debuted all the way back in 2000, and he bowled like a veteran. Good control, unfazed by being hit, and above all, patient: none of the twitchiness of Mushtaq Ahmed and Danish Kaneria in resorting readily to the googly. And if he's good enough for Shane Warne, who are we to say anything else?

What 2015 holds

Not much really. A World Cup. Then series at home against England and, possibly, India. Potential retirements for Misbah. One for Afridi. Should be a doddle. Here's a prediction: they'll probably still be here same time, same place next year.","Mon, 29 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.espncricinfo.com/db/PICTURES/CMS/200600/200657.jpg,"['series', 'awful', 'cricket', 'odi', 'good', 'awesome', 'cup', 'whites', 'colour', 'pakistans', 'played', 'test', 'pakistan', 'misbah']",

73,73,Drought Sri Lanka,Tamil film industry conducts fast in solidarity for Jayalalithaa - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/tamil-film-industry-conducts-fast-in-solidarity-for-jayalalithaa-114093000650_1.html,"The Tamil Nadu film industry today stopped working and came onto the streets for a one-day protest expressing solidarity with the former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, who was convicted in a corruption case by a court in Bangalore and sentenced for four years. This will be the second time this year the industry has come to roads to protest. Earlier this year the industry staged protest against Sri Lanka’s alleged war crimes.

“Let me state that this is not a protest. We are shocked and saddened by the verdict and this is to show our support to her in these difficult times. We are hoping she would soon be acquitted from the case and come back as Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister,” said Director Vikraman, President of Tamil Nadu Film Directors Association. Most of the representatives, who have participated in the fasting, have said while they don't want to argue about the verdict but the way Jayalalithaa has been treated is not acceptable.

Radharavi, an advocate-turned-actor and politician said: “She was the Chief Minister of a state for three times, she is a lady. Making her sit in a bench, and making her walk up to the jail is not good."" He alleged that going by the sequence of incidents it is all well planned. The day chosen for the verdict, which is followed by Dasara holidays, so that an appeal cannot be filed immediately.

“We are not here under any compulsion or threat from anyone. The CM has supported the film industry in many ways, which is why we are here to support her,” said actor-turned politican Sarath Kumar. Actor Srikanth said, ""She is a part of or our family. This is not a protest; we are expressing solidarity with her at this hour of crisis.""



The loss for the film industry owing to the one-day strike would be around Rs 50 crore, according to industry sources.

While emotion and solidarity is one side of the story, the other side of the story is the film faternity has more attachment to Jayalalithaa compared to DMK Supremo.

Industry sources said that during AIADMK regime the industry has benefitted more than DMK's. They alleged that there were instances of political interference in the industry in the previous regime and its alleged attempts to dominate Tamil film industry.

AIADMK Government in the past has provided incentives to small producers by increasing subsidy and providing Rs 50 lakh for the Chennai International Film Festival and including more and more workers from the film industry in the list of beneficiaries of welfare schemes.

Above all, it was during AIADMK's regime when video piracy was brought under the Goonda Act, which is being hailed as exemplary by other States. Her administration has also granted a piece of land to establish an office for the directors' association.

On today's protest among those who attended the fast included Vikraman, Selvamani, S A Chandrasekhar, Sarath Kumar, Suriya, Prabhu, Vikram Prabhu, Keyar, Sathyaraj, Sibiraj, Ibrahim Rowther, Vijayakumar among others.

The prominent faces missing include Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan, Vijay.

The industry representatives have observed a ‘moun vrat’ or a ‘vow of silence’ and a day’s fast at the State guest house in Chepauk to protest against what it termed ‘trumped-up charges’ and an ‘unfair verdict’ against Jayalalithaa.

Questioning the cine industry's protest, Meeka Entertainment's Dhayanidhi Alagiri, who is also the grandson of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) supremo M Karunanidhi, tweeted, ""Is the Cine Industry protesting and fasting today in support of Jayalalitha or condemning the court's decision ??? the Cine Industry has to keep in mind the TAX issues imposed of the movies, THALAIVA & VISHWAROOPAM release problems b4 doing all this.""



He futher posted. ""SELF RESPECT ! I think there are a lot of people in the tamil cine industry who lack that... Shame on us... BAYAM(Fear) ! ... Lol.""","Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-09/30/full/1412074498-271.jpg,"['tamil', 'film', 'state', 'conducts', 'solidarity', 'cine', 'alleged', 'verdict', 'industry', 'support', 'protest', 'fast', 'jayalalithaa']",

Pure gold: 44-year medal drought broken

Cambodia’s 44-year long wait for Asian Games glory was emphatically ended this afternoon as taekwondo sensation Sorn Seavmey struck gold in the women’s under-73kg event at the Ganghwa Dolmens Gymnasium in Incheon, South Korea.

The 19-year-old Cambodian, a SEA Games gold medalist in Myanmar last year, stormed back from a three-point deficit in the first round to command the next two and emerge a 7-4 victor of the final against Fatemeh Rouhani of Iran.

Seavmey will return home on Sunday night with the glorious glow of a gold medal, Cambodia’s first in its 60-year history of participation at the quadrennial competition, hanging around her neck.

She can also expect to cash in on the government’s subdecree, which rewards athletes for success at international sporting competitions.

According to the subdecree, a gold medalist will receive 80 million riel (US$19,600) from the government. Seavmey is also set to bank additional sums from official sponsors such as Angkor Beer and NagaWorld.

Cambodia’s flag bearer at the opening ceremony had earlier showed scant regard for her quarter-final rival Umida Abullaeva of Uzbekistan’s imposing record as the 2012 Asian Championships winner and recent silver medalist at the Nanjing Youth Summer Olympic, in a fight she dominated start to finish to seal on points 29-7.

With the full-throated chorus of support from the entire Cambodian contingent spurring her on, Seavmey used her impressive height to score vital points against Abullaeva, who earlier in the day had struck a confident note in her 4-0 pre-quarter final win over Feruza Yergeshova of Kazakhstan.

With a historic podium place guaranteed, Seavmey then faced the imposing figure of Filipina Kirstie Elaine Alora for a place in the gold medal match.

Seavmey commanded the first two rounds, jumping to a 6-1 lead. The Cambodian held on through a nervy last round to secure a 6-5 victory and avenge her older sister Davin’s loss to Alora in the gold medal match of the over-73kg women’s event at the 2013 SEA Games.

Sorn Davin was also in the hunt for a medal in Incheon earlier today, but succumbed to a comprehensive 8-1 points defeat by Iranian Akram Khodabandeh in their women’s over-73kg quarter-final.

Meanwhile, Cambodia’s remaining male taekwondo athlete, Ban Khemara, lost 20-8 to Afghanistan’s Abdul Wahab Zazai in their men’s under-54kg round of 32 clash.

Cambodia’s last medal winning performances came at the 1970 Bangkok Asian Games when the Kingdom brought home four medals – two silvers and as many bronzes.

Cambodia was forced to stay out of the Asian Games between 1970 and 1994, a time period that encompassed years of civil war and the brutal reign of the Khmer Rouge regime.

“This is an incredibly big prize for Cambodian sports. It is not just that our long and frustrating wait for a medal is over, it is also the start of a new chapter in our history,” National Olympic Committee of Cambodia secretary general Vath Chamroeun told the Post.

In the men’s marathon this morning, Kuniaki Takizaki, who is popularly known in Cambodia and his native Japan as Neko Hiroshi, finished last among 14 finishers, with a time of 2:34:16, which fell just outside of his personal best time.

However, it was a case of deja vu for the Kingdom’s most successful long distance runner, Hem Bunting, who failed to finish the race, bringing back sad memories of a similar happening at the Guanzhou Games in China four years ago.

Bahrain’s Mahboob Ali Hasan Mahboob crossed the finish line in 2:12:38 to take the gold, just a second ahead of Kohei Matsumura of Japan, whose compatriot Yuki Kawauchi claimed bronze.

Not so soft

Soft tennis made its Asian Games debut in Incheon as a demonstration sport and it turned out to be a humbling experience for Cambodia both on and off the court.

While one of the country’s female players, Yi Sophany, was disqualified after a pre-competition drugs test found traces of a banned substance in her sample, Orn Sambath and his partner Ngoun Meng Chheng lost all four of their men’s doubles group matches on Thursday at the Yeorumul Tennis Center.

The Cambodian pair suffered 5-0 thrashing against South Korea’s Kyucheol Park and Sanggwon Lee in the opening tie, followed an hour later by a loss of the same margin to Japan’s Hidenori Shinohara and Koji Kobayashi.

In the third group contest, the Mongolian duo of Enkhjin Bolortuya and Damdin Altankhuyag also delivered a shut out to Sambath and Chheng. Nepalese combination of Sohan Dhauvadel and Sthapit Ujjol beat the Cambodian hopefuls 5-1 in the fourth match.

Earlier in the week, Orn Sambath, who was part of Cambodia’s tennis team that took part in the Guanzhou Games four years ago, failed to get past the preliminary stage after a record of two wins and two defeats in the singles event.

Though Sambath managed to beat Negmatullo Rajabaliev of Tajikistan and Taiwan’s Ting Chun Lin, those wins were too little too late since he had lost the first two matches in Group A to Hyeongjun Kim of South Korea and Takuya Katsura of Japan.","Fri, 03 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/taekwondo_gold_asiangames2014.jpg,"['medal', 'broken', '44year', 'games', 'asian', 'gold', 'womens', 'cambodian', 'incheon', 'drought', 'sambath', 'seavmey', 'pure', 'taekwondo']",

ST JOHN’S – The West Indies Cricket Board selection panel yesterday announced that Devon Smith had been selected to replace Christopher Gayle in the West Indies Test squad to South Africa.

Gayle has been replaced due to injury.

Smith is in fine form, coming off a first innings century against the Leeward Islands Hurricanes in the third round of the Professional Cricket League Regional 4 Day Tournament. Smith scored 145 of the Windward Volcanoes 308 for 5 declared in the match being played in his native Grenada.

He has represented the West Indies in 33 Tests since debuting in 2003 against Australia in Guyana. The pugnacious left-handed opener has scored one Test century and five half-centuries and averages a shade under 37 in first class cricket.

Fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell will depart the Caribbean on Friday to join the Test squad in South Africa. The selection panel had requested that Cottrell play in the third round of the PCL 4 Day to allow the panel an opportunity to determine his match readiness after sustaining an injury on the West Indies A team tour to Sri Lanka.

Cottrell took 5 for 42 for the Jamaica Franchise against Trinidad and Tobago Red Force as the Jamaicans took first innings points.

78,78,Drought Sri Lanka,“Rainwater harvesting in vogue during Chozha dynasty’’ - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rainwater-harvesting-in-vogue-during-chozha-dynasty/article6422107.ece,"Discovery comes to light during desilting of tank on the premises of a Chidambaram temple

The Chozha dynasty was known for its scientific water management practices. It evolved a foolproof system in which the impact of floods and drought condition could be effectively mitigated and tackled.

The system also served as the rain water harvesting system by enabling rain water to flow through tunnels to the resources such as temple tanks. The existence of such mechanism was recently unearthed when desilting was done at the Sivapriyai tank located on the premises of the Thillai Kaliamman temple in Chidambaram.

Ganapathy Murugan and A.Muthukutty, director and president of the Dravidian Historical Research Federation respectively (both are also Assistant Professors of History, Annamalai University), told The Hindu that it was a historically significant finding.

A well laid-out tunnel was found near the arch put up on the North Street of Chidambaram leading to Thillai Kaliamman temple, connecting a network of three temple tanks, including that of the Sivapriyai tank, the Sivagangai tank on the premises of the Lord Nataraja Temple and another tank on the campus of the Sri Anantheeswarar temple.

After the Sivagangai tank got filled up, the excess water would be carried through the tunnel to the other two tanks. At the entry point of the tunnel, a stone inscription written in “manipravala style,” a combination of Tamil and Grantham dating back to the 14-15th centuries was found.

The wordings “Devi Nayagan Sadha Sevai” had been etched on the stone plate embedded in the wall of the tunnel.

The historians said it meant that a staunch devotee of Goddess Kaliamman had undertaken the renovation work on the tunnel built by Vikkirama Chozhan who ruled from 1118 to 1135 AD.

The historians further noted that the Chozha dynasty was mainly dependent upon the Cauvery for cultivation. However, the region was known for recurring floods and drought.

Therefore, the Chozhas had thought of a system which could speedily drain the floods and also fill up the water sources that would ward off the drought condition in interior areas.

Vikkirama Chozhan was the descendant of Kulothunga Chozhan who later spent his life in the service of Lord Nataraja of Chidambaram.

It was the latter who provided accommodation to the Podhu Dikshithars in the surroundings of the temple, they said. Kulothunga Chozhan’s lieutenant Kalingarayan constructed the Sivagangai Theertha Kulam with granite and constructed a separate shrine for Goddess Sivakami at Chidambaram.

“Therefore, it could be said for sure that during the Chozha dynasty a well-evolved water management system was put in place in which the water sources were well protected and rain water harvesting system was in vogue,” Mr Ganapathy added.","Thu, 18 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article11105018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18TEMPLE,"['system', 'tanks', 'dynasty', 'rain', 'harvesting', 'chozha', 'vogue', 'water', 'sivagangai', 'temple', 'tank', 'rainwater', 'premises', 'tunnel', 'kaliamman']", 
79,79,Drought Sri Lanka,Ethiopian famine: how landmark BBC report influenced modern coverage - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/22/ethiopian-famine-report-influence-modern-coverage,"The 30th anniversary of a key moment in modern TV journalism will be marked on 23 October: Michael Buerk’s broadcast of a “biblical famine”, filmed in a remote part of northern Ethiopia. The images shot by Kenyan cameraman Mohammed Amin, together with Buerk’s powerful words, produced one of the most famous television reports of the late 20th century.

Long before satellite, social media and YouTube, the BBC news item from Ethiopia went viral – transmitted by 425 television stations worldwide. It was even broadcast on a major US news channel, without revoicing Buerk’s original English commentary – something that was almost unheard of. Bob Geldof viewed the news that day and, as a result, that famine report eventually became the focus of a new style of celebrity fundraising. This produced another key television memory, the Live Aid extravaganza in July 1985, which itself became a transforming moment in modern media history.

In the aftermath of Buerk’s news story there were handwringing postmortems within aid agencies and governments. Why had no one been able to focus crucial media attention much earlier, when the widespread food shortages were first becoming evident? The conclusion was that often a famine is only judged to be newsworthy once horrible images are present. But, worryingly, after the famine in east Africa in 2011, similar criticism of media interest coming too late was still being made.

Today, the same thing is happening elsewhere in Africa. BBC correspondent Mark Doyle tweeted in July 2014 that “famines are sexy, predicting them is not,” drawing attention to a report on the approaching disaster in South Sudan. Just as in 1980s Ethiopia and 2011 Somalia, the conclusions of Amartya Sen are being played out: famine is not a natural disaster but a result of social and political factors, where vulnerable groups lose their entitlement to food.

The preference for keeping the story simple omits the crucial social and political context of famine. In 1984 the authoritarian Ethiopian regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam was fighting a civil war against Tigrayan and Eritrean insurgents. It is no accident that these were the areas starving because, to a large extent, the government was deliberately causing the famine. It was bombing markets and trade convoys to disrupt food supply chains. Defence spending accounted for half of Ethiopia’s GDP and the Soviet-backed army was the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.

Yet this story of man-made misery was sidestepped. Instead, the reporting was about failing rains, which kept things simple for both journalists and aid agencies. This also suited an authoritarian government that did not want foreign journalists nosing around. The UK government also stuck to the simple narrative. The urgent departmental response group, which met daily to brief senior ministers in reaction to the BBC news reports, called itself the Ethiopian drought group – in the belief that this was what the problem was all about.

It was not only the simplification that impaired the reporting but crucial omissions and a misunderstanding of much of the aid effort. The Tigrayan guerilla leader, Meles Zenawi, later Ethiopia’s prime minister, admitted how easily the rebels could fool the western agencies and use the aid for military purposes.

The Ethiopian government also had deliberate strategies to manipulate donations in pursuit of its brutal resettlement policies. Victims of famine were lured into feeding camps only to be forced on to planes and transported far away from their homes. Some estimate the number of deaths from this policy to be higher than those from famine.

And again, the secrecy and brutality of Mengistu’s regime made it relatively straightforward to divert aid and deceive outsiders. Some aid agencies, including Médecins sans Frontières, realised what was happening and protested – leading to their expulsion from Ethiopia. Others preferred to keep quiet and stay. The minutes of the Band Aid Charitable Trust reveal inklings of misuse and misappropriation of aid, but indicate a view was taken that it was better not to object.

Little of this messy complexity was conveyed by the media at the time to audiences who had empathised with the victims, donated generously and wanted to see suffering relieved. Aid agencies know that straightforward natural disasters are much easier to communicate than trickier man-made crises.

Fundraising for the humanitarian disaster in Syria has been difficult – a complex story without clear goodies and baddies is not an easy one to convey, either for journalists or NGOs.

So how much has changed since Buerk reported from Ethiopia? In 1984 the only voices were from a white reporter and a European aid worker. A contemporary news report would be more inclusive. But much is the same. Not only has the problem of the media ignoring famine until it is a catastrophe and then simplifying the explanation recurred many times, but also some of the same abuses associated with resettlement are still taking place in Ethiopia.

There is also the vexed question of stereotypical depictions of Africa. After 1984 there was much examination and criticism of “African-pessimism” and negative framing of the continent. But many images used in fundraising and reporting Africa still rely on those same tropes.

80,80,Drought Sri Lanka,Zomato wants to be the Google of food - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/management/zomato-wants-to-be-the-google-of-food-114090801209_1.html,"When Zomato, the India-based restaurant search service, acquired two of its peers in Czech Republic and Slovakia (Lunchtime and Obedovat), it quietly increased its presence to 15 countries. It operates in UK, UAE, South Africa, New Zealand, the Philippines, Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Turkey, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Qatar, and over 25 cities across India. But why did it go global to serve markets as distinct as Sau Paulo, Dubai, Auckland and Manila?



''We want to be the 'Google' of food. Our vision is to be the global platform when someone is looking for food locally,"" says Pankaj Chaddah, co-founder & COO, Zomato, the Rs 31-crore firm backed by Info Edge (owner of Naukri.com) and Sequoia Capital.

The big markets for restaurants are in the US, Germany, Japan, Russia, Australia and the UK. The space is dominated by local-business search giant Yelp, which is present in 28 such markets. There are others like JustEat (13 countries) and Open Table (20) but they are focused on food-ordering and table-bookings, respectively, and don't aid discovery like Zomato or Yelp.

BECOMING A DISCOVERY CHANNEL ONLINE Provides restaurant information on-the-go for diners. Began in 2008 as Foodiebay.com with 1,200 restaurants in NCR Delhi, before expanding. In 2010, rebranded as Zomato, an easy-to-remember name, reminiscent of food (rhymes with tomato). Dedicated teams collect menus and upload photo of restaurants

Sanjeev Bhikchandani, founder of Naukri.com and chairman of Info Edge, came across Foodiebay in 2010, and invested in it. Zomato has raised $53.5 million in five rounds of funding, with Sequoia Capital and Info Edge infusing $37 million in the last round in 2013.

Its revenues have grown from Rs 2.04 crore in 2011-12 to Rs 31 crore in 2013-14.

Zomato has entered markets where these players are not market leaders. After covering 60,000 restaurants and 12 million monthly visitors in India, in the next five months, it plans to enter 10 new markets including Canada, Ireland, Poland, and countries in Southeast Asia and West Asia.

For now, it has stayed away from key markets like the US, where Yelp is the undisputed leader or Germany, where Yelp acquired a local player, Qype. ''We will need much more bandwidth and money to go into the US. We have to do at least 50 cities very quickly to disrupt the player already huge there,'' says Chaddah, who co-founded Zomato with fellow IITian Deepinder Goyal.

Cracking the UK market

The UK is one market where it has faced global competition. UK has Yelp, Open Table, JustEat and TimeOut. With 23,000 restaurants, Yelp has become one of the biggest players in the UK; the next player, Trip Advisor, has 14,000 restaurants and only user-generated content. When Zomato entered, it found that that a lot of diners kept going to the same place every time, as they could not figure out which were the other good places. Zomato felt consumers in the UK needed a curated list.

So, it came up with collections - the best places for taking your kids or pets, or for cocktails, Carribean food, breakfast or barbeque. The segmentation worked. In the UK, people are used to table-bookings; so it tied up with Open Table, ResDiary, and Bookatable. ''We are the discovery layer and they are the transaction layer,'' says Chaddah. Zomato aids restaurant discovery, the merchant pays Open Table for a booking, which shares a part with Zomato.

As in other markets, it worked with bloggers to bring in early adopters. It advertised heavily on the Tube and made sure the right lifestyle publications spoke of it. Luckily, Yelp did not respond in the UK. A spokesman Yelp says, ''We maintain our focus on developing the Yelp brand and community and ways for consumers to interact with local businesses. The arrival of other potential competitors does not detract from our focus. ''



Zomato's international foray began in the UAE in 2012, as it was culturally the closest to India. Localisation helped there too, as it detailed places serving shishas and Iftar during Ramadan.

Home market

Launched in India in 2008, Zomato had no early-mover advantage. There were players like burp.com, dineout.com, placetodine.com. Chaddah says content worked: ""No one had the quality, the menus; no one had a product which was as good as ours, where you could discover the menu"". He says it is not easy to replicate: ''If it was so, Just Dial or Google would have done it two years back"".

A user and fellow online entrepreneur, Ambareesh Murthy, CEO of Pepperfry.com, says, ''What I like about them is that they also put out the delivery menu.'' ''It has done well in aiding discovery of restaurants. But I am not sure if it is spreading too thin,'' says a senior executive with a rival portal.

Ad income

""Given that our biz model is hyper-local, restaurants and businesses can display ads to hungry consumers looking for options in a specific area,"" says Chaddah. Globally, over 3,500 restaurants advertise on Zomato and online ads form a sizeable part of its revenues.

Zomato would now look to sit at the big boys' table with its rapid expansion.","Mon, 08 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-09/08/full/1410197997-7698.jpg,"['india', 'markets', 'restaurants', 'google', 'table', 'open', 'wants', 'food', 'zomato', 'chaddah', 'uk', 'yelp', 'discovery']", 
81,81,Drought Sri Lanka,International Day for Disaster Reduction: Older people are a resource for resilience - HelpAge International,https://www.helpage.org/newsroom/latest-news/international-day-for-disaster-risk-reduction-resilience-is-for-life/,"By Sarah Marzouk

On 13 October, International Day for Disaster Reduction, HelpAge and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) issued a joint call for greater involvement of older people in disaster management efforts worldwide. (c) Artemio Andaya/COSE

There is strong evidence that older people suffer disproportionately from disasters even in developed countries. In 2005, 75% of those killed by Hurricane Katrina were over 60, even though they made up just 15% of the population in New Orleans.

In 2011, 56% of those who died in the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami were 65 and over, despite comprising just 23% of the population.

Resilience is for life

International Day for Disaster Reduction (IDDR) raises awareness and advocates for inclusive disaster risk reduction, each year focusing on the role of important actors.

This year the focus is on older people. It is vital to acknowledge them as a resource for resilience and ensure that they can take part in resilience building. This year's IDDR has a clear message: Resilience is for Life.

Older people should be heard

A survey conducted for today's IDDR demonstrates that older people are often excluded or marginalised when disaster management plans are being drawn up at community level.

The responses showed that:

58% of respondents did not know who was responsible for disaster preparedness in their communities.

70% noted their wish to explain older people's special needs and vulnerabilities.

43% wanted training to help their community in disaster preparedness and response.

32% said they wished to share their experiences on how to cope with disaster situations.

A Charter for older people

With UNISDR, we are calling on governments to sign up to Charter 14 for Older People in Disaster Risk Reduction. This Charter commits governments to including older people in all facets of disaster management planning with a strong emphasis on early warnings and evacuation procedures.

UNISDR Head, Margareta Wahlström, said: ""Demographic change means we are living in an ageing world. It is important to include older people in disaster management for both their improved protection and to make full use of their experience, skills and knowledge in support of that.""

As shown in our Global AgeWatch Index, people aged over 60 currently constitute 11% of the global population. By 2050, this will have doubled, to 22% – that is, 2 billion older people.

Governments must act now

Toby Porter, HelpAge's Chief Executive, at the global launch event for IDDR in Rustenburg, South Africa said: ""Older people bear the initial brunt of disasters often because they cannot flee.

""Governments and disaster management agencies need to address older people's vulnerabilities and tap into the years of experience, knowledge and skills that they bring to help reduce the effects of disasters.""

Our work with older people

We work with older people around the world to ensure they are included in disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. Some of our work includes:

Training older people or ""White Brigades"" in Bolivia to prevent and plan for natural disasters.

Working with older volunteers after Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines to provide counselling to their peers who had been affected by the disaster.

Supporting older people in Jamaica to set up insurance schemes to give community members access to emergency funds after disasters strike.

What else is happening for IDDR?

To mark IDDR, we are launching guidelines on how to include older people in disaster preparedness and response, as well as mitigation, protection and planning activities; Disaster Resilience in an Ageing World: How to make policies and programmes inclusive of older people.

Our global ageing network is also organising events across the world to raise awareness of older people's contributions in protecting their communities from disasters. Events are happening in Nepal, Pakistan, Jamaica, South Africa and Haiti to name a few.

82,82,Drought Sri Lanka,Vatican cricket team may need divine intervention in match with Church of England - National Catholic Reporter,https://www.ncronline.org/news/world/vatican-cricket-team-may-need-divine-intervention-match-church-england,"Canterbury, England — A recently formed cricket team from the Vatican may need some divine intervention as it gets ready to take on more experienced English players at a historic game Saturday.

The Vatican team will play against the British Army chaplains as part of a ""Light of Faith"" tour at the Kent County Cricket Club, a stone's throw away from Canterbury Cathedral, where it will play again next week against the Church of England's team.

""Realistically, we are rank underdogs with a very outside chance, but that's OK,"" said Fr. Eamonn O'Higgins, spiritual director and manager of the Vatican club. ""What we hope for, above all, is a good match.""

The captain of the Vatican team is an Englishman, Fr. Tony Currer.

""Win or lose,"" he said, ""the first cricket match in history between the Vatican and the Church of England will be an event to remember and to build on.""

The initiative to set up a Vatican team was the idea of Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy, who is an avid cricket fan.

Players are drawn from seminaries and pontifical universities in Rome and include several players from India and Sri Lanka, both famous cricketing countries.

The Pontifical Council for Culture stresses on its website that the Vatican batsmen and bowlers will be praying as well as playing during the eight-day tour of England with the Vatican players visiting several holy sites and raising money for the Global Freedom Network, which fights against modern slavery and human trafficking.","Fri, 12 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ncronline.org/sites/all/themes/ncr_zen/images/logo_facebook2.jpg,"['match', 'need', 'tour', 'cricket', 'play', 'holy', 'vatican', 'church', 'pontifical', 'team', 'england', 'divine', 'intervention', 'fr', 'players']",

84,84,Drought Sri Lanka,"Remittances to Developing Countries to Grow by 5 Percent This Year, While Conflict-Related Forced Migration is at All-Time High, Says WB Report - World Bank Group",https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2014/10/06/remittances-developing-countries-five-percent-conflict-related-migration-all-time-high-wb-report,"WASHINGTON, October 6, 2014 – Remittances by international migrants from developing countries are on course for strong growth this year, while at the same time forced migration due to violence and conflict has reached unprecedented levels, says the World Bank’s latest issue of Migration and Development Brief, released today.

Officially recorded remittances to developing countries are expected to reach $435 billion this year, an increase of 5 percent over 2013. The growth rate this year is substantially faster than the 3.4 percent growth recorded in 2013, driven largely by remittances to Asia and Latin America.

Remittances to developing countries will continue climbing in the medium term, reaching an estimated $454 billion in 2015.

Global remittances, including those to high-income countries, are estimated at $582 billion this year, rising to $608 billion next year.

Remittances remain an especially important and stable source of private inflows to developing countries, as they bring in large amounts of foreign currency that help sustain the balance of payments. In 2013, remittances were significantly higher than foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries (excluding China) and were three times larger than official development assistance.

""Remittances to developing countries grew this year by 5 percent. Remittance inflows provided stable cover for substantial parts of the import bill for such countries as Egypt, Pakistan, Haiti, Honduras, and Nepal. India and China lead the chart with projected remittance inflows of, respectively, $71 and $64 billion in 2014. In addition, India and the Philippines benefit from having migrants with the most diverse destination spread, thereby creating buffers against regional shocks. Given the growing importance of this sector, the World Bank’s Migration and Development Brief has become an essential tool for global development policy experts,” said Kaushik Basu, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist of the World Bank Group.

The brief notes that the global average cost of sending remittances continued its downward trend in the third quarter of 2014, falling to 7.9 percent of the value sent, compared to 8.9 percent a year earlier. However, the cost of sending money to Africa remains stubbornly high, exceeding 11 percent.

Remittance flows are expected to grow robustly to almost all regions of the developing world, except Europe and Central Asia, where the conflict in Ukraine and associated sanctions are contributing to an economic slowdown in Russia, home to a large number of migrants from the region. The East Asia and Pacific and South Asia regions will continue to attract the largest remittance flows.

India, with the world’s largest emigrant stock of 14 million people, will remain in the top spot this year, attracting about $71 billion in remittances. Other large recipients are China ($64 billion), the Philippines ($28 billion), Mexico ($24 billion), Nigeria ($21 billion), Egypt ($18 billion), Pakistan ($17 billion), Bangladesh ($15 billion), Vietnam ($11 billion) and Ukraine ($9 billion).

As a share of GDP (2013), the top recipients of remittances were Tajikistan (42 percent), Kyrgyz Republic (32 percent), Nepal (29 percent), Moldova (25 percent), Lesotho and Samoa (24 percent each), Armenia and Haiti (both 21 percent), the Gambia (20 percent) and Liberia (18 percent).

In a special analysis on forced migration, the brief notes that forced migration due to conflict is at its highest level since World War II, affecting more than 51 million people. An additional 22 million people have been forced to move due to natural disasters, bringing the total affected by forced migration to at least 73 million, according to the latest available data.

“Despite the encouraging outlook for remittance flows, the circumstances of many migrants are troubling. With so many people on the move against their will and many others undertaking desperate and dangerous journeys, it is clear that more effort is needed to make migration safer and cheaper by exploring economically viable policy options,” said Dilip Ratha, Lead Economist, Migration and Remittances, at the World Bank’s Development Prospects Group and Head of the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development (KNOMAD).

Forced migration is typically viewed as a humanitarian issue but affects growth, employment and public spending for both origin and destination countries. The issue needs to be examined also through a development lens, says the brief.

Forced migration is a major challenge in several regions. In developing Europe and Central Asia, 1 million people in Ukraine have been displaced, while the high-income countries of Europe are receiving record numbers of asylum seekers. Applications to the entire region rose to over 480,000, an increase of 68 percent from 2009.

Pakistan and Iran top the world list of refugee host countries, as millions of people from neighboring Afghanistan remain displaced after more than 35 years of conflict. At the end of 2013, nine out of 10 refugees were being hosted in developing countries.

The war in Syria has displaced half the country’s population, with 3 million refugees crossing borders and 6.5 million people displaced internally. Most Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, joining millions of Iraqi and Palestinian refugees already there. In 2014, Syrians overtook Afghans as the second largest refugee group, outnumbered only by Palestinian refugees.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, internal conflict (including renewed instability in South Sudan and Boko Haram activities in Nigeria) together with persistent drought in the Horn of Africa, are resulting in increased forced migration in the region.

Regional Remittance Trends

Strong growth in remittances continues to support macroeconomic stability and economic growth in the East Asia and the Pacific (EAP) region. Remittances to the region are projected to increase by 7 percent this year, faster than any other region, to reach $122 billion. China and the Philippines are the region’s largest recipients, in value terms, but the smaller Pacific islands are most dependent on remittances, where they are a significant share of GDP. Remittances to the region are expected to grow by 4.9 percent in 2015 to exceed $127 billion.

Weakening economic growth in Russia, the ruble depreciation, and sanctions imposed on Russia by western countries as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, are expected to slow the growth of remittances to the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region this year to 2.2 percent (from 7.5 percent in 2013), bringing remittance flows to $49 billion in 2014. Russia is the largest source of remittances to countries in the region, and Ukraine is ECA’s largest remittance-recipient country. Dependency on remittances is high in several ECA countries, particularly in Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic and Moldova. Remittances to the region are expected to remain broadly unchanged in 2015.

Remittance flows to the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region are likely to bounce back this year, following a weak 2013. Recovery in the United States will benefit Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, which together account for more than half of the remittance flows to the region. In contrast, high unemployment in Spain is negatively impacting remittances to Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru. Intraregional remittances from Chile will continue on an upward trend. Remittances to the region are expected to increase by 5 percent this year, compared to 1 percent last year, to $64 billion, rising to $67 billion in 2015.

In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, officially recorded remittances are on course to expand moderately this year, rising by 2.9 percent to reach $51 billion in 2014. Flows remain volatile, especially in the three largest recipient countries – Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco. After the sharp fall in flows to Egypt in 2013, remittances are expected to stabilize in 2014, helped by attractive investment opportunities in the planned expansion of the Suez Canal. The ongoing economic crisis and high unemployment rates in Europe will continue to dampen remittances to Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. Flows to the region are expected to strengthen in the coming years, growing by 4 percent in 2015 to reach $53 billion.

Remittances to the South Asia region are increasing more robustly this year, accelerating from slower growth in 2013. Although flows to India, the region’s largest remittance recipient, will grow modestly by 1.5 percent in 2014, partial year data point to very strong growth in flows to Pakistan (16.6 percent), Sri Lanka (12.1 percent) and Nepal (12.2 percent). The expansion is being led by flows from the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, where skilled and unskilled workers are finding renewed job opportunities. As a result, the growth rate of remittances to the region is expected to more than double this year to 5.5 percent (from 2.7 percent in 2013), boosting volumes to $117 billion in 2014 and rising further to $123 billion in 2015.

Growth in remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa is picking up modestly this year. The importance of remittances varies greatly across the region. Remittances as a share of GDP are most significant to Lesotho, the Gambia, Liberia, Senegal and Cabo Verde. Flows as a share of foreign exchange reserves are highest in Sudan, Senegal, Togo, Mali and Cabo Verde. Remittances to the region are expected to reach $33 billion this year and $34 billion in 2015.","Mon, 06 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['migration', 'wb', 'forced', 'countries', 'report', 'grow', 'remittances', 'conflictrelated', 'billion', 'region', 'developing', 'flows', 'remittance', 'growth', 'high', 'expected']",

87,87,Drought Sri Lanka,Farmers fight Coca-Cola as India's groundwater dries up - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/farmers-fight-coca-cola-indias-groundwater-dries/,"Savitri Rai winces as she recounts how police beat her when she protested against groundwater extraction at a Coca-Cola Co plant near her farm in India. A decade later, she said her water supplies keep dwindling.

“We have to dig ever deeper wells,” the 60-year-old said outside her mud house in Mehadiganj village in Uttar Pradesh state, blaming the beverage company’s bottling line a kilometer (0.6 miles) away. Coca-Cola, which declined to comment on Rai’s allegations, in August scrapped a $24 million expansion at the site, citing delays in permits to extract more water.

Such flashpoints add pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to improve groundwater management in the world’s biggest user of the resource as he seeks to transform India into a manufacturing hub. Growing aquifer overexploitation by farms, businesses and cities imperils India’s development goals, according to the World Bank, signaling challenges for industries from mining to brewing in need of reliable water sources.

“You have unregulated use of a resource which is not easily renewed,” said Upmanu Lall, a professor of earth and environmental engineering at Columbia University in New York. “It’s a really significant concern over the whole country.”

India draws 230 cubic kilometers of groundwater a year, more than a quarter of the global total, World Bank data shows. Agriculture uses the most, growing about 70 per cent of India’s grains with it, followed by industry.

Arm’s length

The $1.9 trillion economy operates the world’s biggest food subsidy program, and about 742 million people live in rural areas, making farming an economic lifeline.

While groundwater is the main drinking water for more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, pollutants such as arsenic make it unfit for humans in a third of India’s 600 districts, WWF India and Accenture Plc said last year. The country faces some of the world’s worst water challenges, they said.

“ The key is for more companies to engage with communities and fellow water users in reducing shared water risk Joe Phelan, director at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in New Delhi

In Mehadiganj, about 20 kilometers from the holy city of Varanasi, 28-year-old farmer Sabita Rai said she used to extract water with buckets attached to ropes only as long as her arm. Then the wells dried up.

“We’re too poor to drill deeper,” she said, adding that her searches for water now extend further from her home.

Kamlesh Sharma, a spokesman for Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt., Coca-Cola’s Indian business, said the company had no further comments about the plant at Mehadiganj beyond an Aug. 22 letter to the Uttar Pradesh state government.

Shared risk

In the letter, the company said an “inordinate” delay in getting clearances from the Central Ground Water Authority for greater extraction set back the 1.45 billion rupee ($24 million) expansion, causing financial losses.

The area is classified as “critical” for groundwater, according to the letter, and the company took required steps such as rainwater harvesting to recharge twice the amount of water to be abstracted.

Coca-Cola said it plans to find a new Uttar Pradesh site for the planned 600 bottle-a-minute plant while continuing to run its 15-year-old returnable glass bottle line at Mehadiganj.

Water quality and availability in India are “already interrupting operations for some companies,” said Joe Phelan, a director at the World Business Council for Sustainable Development in New Delhi. “The key is for more companies to engage with communities and fellow water users in reducing shared water risk.”

‘Go dry’

A 2009 study by the University of California, Irvine, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed groundwater depletion in northwestern India from 2002 to 2008 was equivalent to a net loss triple the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest man-made reservoir in the US.

Depletion in northwestern India, covering Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab, has continued at about the same rate, said Matthew Rodell, chief of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.

“As groundwater levels decline, people’s wells will continue to go dry and they’ll have to dig deeper,” he said. “Eventually, they’ll reach the bottom of the aquifer or water quality will decline to the point where it becomes unusable.”

Modi’s steps to address water shortages include initial implementation of a plan to connect 30 rivers, a project estimated a decade ago to cost $92 billion.

India’s Central Ground Water Board said in July it plans to build rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge structures around the country.

Convincing states

The central government is trying to convince states, which administer the resource, to pass a law to curb overuse. Thirteen of India’s 36 states and union territories have enacted the legislation, the federal administration said in August.

Companies such as SABMiller India Ltd. and United Breweries Ltd, both based in Bengaluru, said they are taking steps to conserve water. SABMiller is working with farmers near its units in Rajasthan, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh to raise groundwater levels, vice president Meenakshi Sharma said.

SABMiller said it uses 3 liters (0.8 gallon) of water per liter of beverage, and United Breweries said it uses about 3.5 liters. PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt said audited reports show it uses 2.08 liters. While Atlanta-based Coca-Cola didn’t provide its usage for this article, it’s reported a 1.9 per cent annual improvement in water efficiency and has trimmed water usage 8 percent since 2010.

Soil moisture

The risk is conservation steps fail to address the scale of the task. The river-linking initiative, for example, ignores the reality that groundwater dependence will last many years, the South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People has said.

Columbia’s Lall said technology can be part of the solution, such as soil-moisture sensors costing as little 450 rupees that help farmers prevent excessive crop watering. Once groundwater is depleted, dealing with drought becomes very difficult, he said.

Government data shows a groundwater drop in 56 per cent of wells in 2013 compared with the average for the decade through 2012, based on levels before the July-to-September monsoon.

At the same time, tension over water is evident. Jayaji Suryavanshi, leader of Jayakwadi Pani Sangharsh Kruti Samiti, a farmers’ organization, said he led protests against breweries in Aurangabad in Maharashtra state last year. He plans to contest local elections to help farmers.

In Mehadiganj, 35-year-old Urmila Vishwakarma said she takes water from 240 feet down versus 65 feet in prior years.

88,88,Drought Sri Lanka,India has second-highest number of child marriages: Unicef - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/India-has-second-highest-number-of-child-marriages-Unicef/article11131187.ece,"The highest rate of child marriage is in Bangladesh (where two out of every three girls marry before age 18), followed by India, Nepal and Afghanistan.

India had the highest number of unregistered children under age five between 2000 and 2012 and the second-highest number of child marriages, according to a U.N. report which said the country still needs to improve immunisation coverage and stop gender-based sex selection.

The report “Improving Children’s Lives, Transforming the Future — 25 years of child rights in South Asia” by the United Nations’ children agency, Unicef, analyses the progress made over the last quarter century on key issues that directly affect the lives of children in the region.

At 71 million, India had the largest number of children under the age of five whose births were not registered between 2000-2012.

The report said that birth registration levels in South Asia have increased since 2000, but progress has been slow.

India, along with Afghanistan, Bangladesh and the Maldives, has been recording “significant improvements” in birth registration but about 100 million children in the region are still not registered at birth.

India has the greatest disparity between the poorest and richest households, with children in the poorest households being three times less likely to be registered than those in the richest.

Religion also appears to play a role as Muslims have the lowest level of birth registration in India (39 per cent) followed by Hindus (40 per cent) while the Jains have the highest (87 per cent).

46% of South Asian girls marry by 18

Almost half of all girls in South Asia marry before the age of 18. One in five girls are married before the age of 15. These are the highest rates in the world.

“These figures confirm that child marriage is rooted in gender norms and in expectations about the value and roles of girls,” the report added.

In India, 43 per cent of women aged 20-24 were first married by the age of 18 between 2005-2013. Girls with no education are 5.5 times more likely to marry or enter into union as those with at least 10 years of education.

On gender-biased sex selection, the report said the practice is more prevalent in the west and northwest part of the country. The child sex ratio, which is the number of girls per 1,000 boys, among children aged 0-4 in India was 924.

On immunisation coverage, it said some countries in South Asia, particularly Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, have made significant improvements since 1990 but coverage is still far too low in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.

The report was released to commemorate 25 years since the 1989 U.N. adoption of the Convention of the Rights of the Child. It pointed to some improvements over the past two decades as South Asian government adopted policies to protect child rights.

The prevalence of children with stunted growth in the region dropped from more than 60 per cent in 1990 to 38 per cent in 2012 as nutrition improved, the report said. Still, the report said regional averages mask disparities, with stunting far more pervasive among children from poor families, rural areas and oppressed ethnicities.

It said more than 2 million South Asian children die before their fifth birthday of preventable causes, and nearly 38 per cent of children have chronic malnutrition.","Fri, 12 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article11100481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10-MARRIAGE-BRSC,"['india', 'child', 'secondhighest', 'report', 'age', 'cent', 'children', 'girls', 'unicef', 'south', 'number', 'marry', 'marriages']",

The passing of Phillip Hughes rocked everyone in the game and there are some fitting tributes lined up tomorrow to honour his life.

It will be an emotional day for Australia’s entire team, and the bowling group will need to get through that if they have first use of the wicket.

I’ve run my Bowlologist’s eye over the group, including 12th man Josh Hazlewood, and here’s my verdict.

Johnson was devastating on a relatively flat track in Adelaide last summer // Getty Images

Watch out, Binga!

Mitchell Johnson is sitting on 270 Test wickets and has four Tests this summer to hit the magical 300. Can he do it? Forget 300, if he bowls like he did in the Ashes summer, I reckon Brett Lee (310 Test wickets) will be looking over his shoulder!

Seriously though, even the fact we’re contemplating him getting 30 wickets in four Tests shows what a 12 months it’s been for Mitch. This is a guy who didn’t go to the Ashes in England only last year. Now he’s the ICC Player of the Year and the most hostile Australian quick of the generation.

There were still hints of his brilliance on the pancake wickets of Abu Dhabi and Dubai recently, where he bowled very well despite not taking many wickets.

His control was impressive, and he was consistently quick, but the Australian pitches will take him to another level.

We’re going to find out what this Indian batting order is made of when they play Mitch. He’s 33, a super-fit athlete, and while he might not quite match the output of wickets from last summer, I am expecting the same consistency of pace, SWING, and that ability to not only fluster the Indian top order, but also intimidate their tail.

Mitch’s 150kph thunderbolts are kryptonite to NERVOUS tail-enders. We saw how effective he was against England last year – it was six out, all out.

He’ll glue me to the screen and hopefully I get to commentate his first spell. As much as we love watching dynamic batsmen like Warner, Kohli and co, there’s nothing like a fast bowler IN FULL FLIGHT!

A couple of spells from Mitch at the Gabba and in Adelaide were the highlights of last summer. I was at functions at the ground on both occasions and people just emptied the room to go out and watch. He’s the man the crowds come to see. When he’s up, they’re on edge every ball.

Harris has not bowled as many overs as he would've liked leading into the first Test // Getty Images

Ryno set to charge

Averages 19 with the bat in Test cricket. Not many of us fast bowlers have managed that in Test cricket… though he’s yet to score a Test 71 not out, unlike yours truly.

But I digress, his bowling.

Hasn’t quite bowled as much as he would’ve liked in the lead-up to this Test but Queensland coach Stuart Law was encouraged by what he’s done in the Shield, and that’s good signs for Australia.

Just getting back onto the paddock seems to erase all the pain and doubts for this bloke who is as competitive a beast as we have in this Australian team.

He’s also highly skilled – I have him up with James Anderson in that regard.

In the Bowlology skill-set, there’s hardly a ball he can’t bowl. He’s still bowling over 140kph, he has a fantastic ability to swing the old and new ball, and he reads pitches and build plans superbly.

His yorker is one of his most under-rated weapons, and the best example of that was the way he closed out that Cape Town Test on one leg against South Africa in March.

First, he came over the wicket and bowled a reverse inswinging yorker to knock over Dale Steyn. Then he came around the wicket to bowl an inswinger to knock over Morne Morkel – another pitch-perfect yorker.

Not many people in the world can bowl quality reverse swing for a start, let alone at that pace, but to then come over and around the wicket to york a right- and left-hand batsman is just pure Bowlology bliss.

So there’ll be soreness for him coming back but hopefully, with those seven months off, his knee will be better than it has been for years and once he gets going, he’ll be right for the four Tests.

Siddle ran through South Australia in his last effort in Adelaide, taking 5-31 // Getty Images

Siddle, the unsung soldier

I felt sorry for Sidds missing that Cape Town Test in March after such a sensational summer – it would’ve been nice for him to finish things off with Johnson, Harris and Lyon so that bowling group could reflect in years to come about just what a golden summer it was.

But it sounds like Darren Lehmann has given him a bit of an ultimatum – saying we need guys who can bowl over 140kph – which I don’t totally agree with. If you’re under 140kph and can make the ball move, you can take a lot of Test wickets.

BUT… Siddsy probably doesn’t have that ‘wow’ factor, though what he does have is a massive heart, and he’s put on five kilos on his ‘Vegan Venom’ diet and is getting back to that 140kph mark.

After he bowled solidly without luck on some unkind pitches in the UAE, the word from the Victorian dressing room was that his performance on that final day of Shield action in Adelaide three weeks ago was outstanding.

The pitch was still flat, it probably should’ve been a draw, but Peter just ripped it open with 5-31.

He was quick, bouncy, bowled stump to stump and got himself a couple of wickets bowled and lbw. That’s exactly the report you want to hear.

Now he’s got another shot at the same venue, he can show everyone that he’s back bowling over 140kph, bowling all day, not getting injured and complementing the other guys perfectly.

Lyon has 12 wickets in three Tests at the Adelaide Oval // Getty Images

Spin and you’re winning

I’d have played Nathan ‘Gazza’ Lyon in Brisbane, so I definitely would’ve played him in Adelaide.

You need that variety in your attack and, to go with Lyon, I think Mitchell Marsh is going to develop into a dangerous fast-medium bowler in Test cricket.

He’s got pace, he can swing the ball, and that means Shane Watson doesn’t need to bowl as much, which I think is really important.

All that means Lyon’s offies will provide a good change of pace, and with 12 wickets in three Tests at Adelaide Oval, he’s proven himself an effective option at the ground.

Sure, Gaz looks about 45 and might have been better suited in the Allan Border cricket era listening to his favorite band Australian Crawl on vinyl, but he’s definitely our frontline spinner.

People forget that he’s still got a lot of cricket development in him as he is still only 27!

Twelfth man Josh Hazlewood shapes as the future of Australian fast-bowling // Getty Images

The next Pidge … no, really

If you’re Australian, you’re tall, and you’ve got a bit of pace and bounce, you get labelled ‘McGrath-like’. I reckon we’ve had 20 fast bowlers since Glenn retired with the ‘McGrath-like’ attributes (that is McGrath attributes like pace and bounce, not reading habits such as Pig Shooter Monthly!) but he’s the one closest to Glenn.

That’s not to put pressure on Josh, because hopefully in a few years we’re just talking about him and his performances.

But you want a tall fast bowler in your ranks, because they don’t get any shorter on flat pitches and their bounce is always going to be difficult to master.

He’s had a few injuries and didn’t seem to be bowling much over 130kph, but through this ODI series against South Africa, he was up over 140kph and he made the ball move with just a little bit of outswing.

He’s mainly a seamer though, he seems an intelligent young man and I reckon with 90 first-class wickets at 26 it’s about the right time for a debut.

I think he’s the right selection as the extra quick in the squad; if one of our front three quicks goes down, he’s the man who should step up.","Mon, 08 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2014/12/08bowlers.ashx?w=1600,"['australian', 'boys', 'summer', 'hes', 'pace', '140kph', 'bowled', 'adelaide', 'test', 'bowling', 'wickets']",

The Yauatcha restaurant at Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) seems to be in love with loud music. There is music playing loudly from the area in front of the hotel from speakers hidden in the shrubbery. Up a narrow staircase, past the wine coolers, is the dining area and the music has followed us there as well, even to the ""quietest"" place that the staff can find for us. We ask if it can be turned down a bit but are informed politely that it is all part of the ambience.

Chitra Ramakrishna, who was part of the first team at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) that succeeded in turning off the noise on the trading floors over 20 years ago, seems to be having no problem with the high decibel level at the restaurant, which is just a couple of minutes away from Exchange Plaza, NSE's headquarters since 2001. The original venue for the lunch was the seventh floor lawns at Exchange Plaza where, we were told, we can eat anything we want, though Ramakrishna would stick to her favourite curd rice. But the plan was changed on account of the rains.

Though the restaurant is full, the starters - an elaborate variety of fried turnip cake, crispy asparagus pumpkin & corn rolls and stir fried chicken - come pretty fast.

Ramakrishna's passion for Carnatic music and playing the veena has been much talked about as her ""only interest outside work"", but Ramakrishna says her mother will not be amused if she claims she does practice regularly. Her passion, thus, is limited to attending sundry Carnatic music concerts. ""Getting the best seats even at the last moment is easy now. It seems people are too busy to spare time for music,"" Ramakrishna says, even as she checks her mobile for incoming mail.

The world of Carnatic music may have lost a possible concert performer but NSE is unlikely to regret that. Ramakrishna is currently the third woman to head an exchange in the Asia-Pacific region after Sri Lanka's Colombo Stock Exchange and China's Shenzhen Stock Exchange. And she's been part of the NSE's explosive growth since its inception, so in some senses her journey has been NSE's journey.

She has much to be proud of. In March 1995, the exchange had 135 companies and the daily average turnover for equities was barely Rs 17 crore. Today, it has over 1,600 actively traded companies and the average daily turnover in the cash segment has grown 43 per cent annually to around Rs 15,000 crore. Today, NSE has a combined daily average turnover at Rs 2.40 lakh crore and a market share of 75 per cent in both the cash and derivatives segments.

To put all of that in perspective, NSE's combined average daily turnover is almost three times higher than BSE's. In the last financial year, the exchange had a net profit of Rs 966 crore and the return on equity is 17 per cent, compared to seven per cent for BSE.

That's quite a journey from the days when Ramakrishna was one of the five hand-picked by the legendary S S Nadkarni, then chairman of IDBI (she had joined IDBI in 1983 after her chartered accountancy). NSE, which was set up as a part of the government's efforts towards transparent trading, operated from a small office at Mahindra Towers in Mumbai's Worli. ""We were perceived by many as a bunch of outsiders who would never succeed. That in a way worked to our advantage as we had nothing to lose and were free to experiment,"" Ramakrishna, 52, says, helping herself to a small portion of dumplings.

Among many other things, she was instrumental in setting up a pan-India VSAT network and building the infrastructure and legislative framework for India's first depositor.

Though she has never invested in stocks, her interest in the world of securities developed in the late eighties when she joined a team that was closely involved in drafting the legislative framework of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). Though little came of it, Ramakrishna says the exposure was fascinating because she gained knowledge of global best practices in securities and came in direct contact with some of the finest minds in Indian industry.

It's time for the main course. Curd rice is obviously not on the menu, but noodles are and there is also rice along with stir-fried French beans, vegetable chive dumplings and chicken clay pot.

Ramakrishna says there is a need for more players in the exchange space to boost competition, prompting us to ask whether that view is different from the regulator's. After all, among other things, Sebi has raised barriers for entry through net worth norms for stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories.

Her lengthy answer will no doubt please the regulator. ""After the 2008 crisis, there is a greater awareness and sensitisation across the world to systemic risk, market integrity and the quality of markets that we are creating. So regulators across the world, not just in India, are thinking about ways to make the markets safer and sounder,"" she says.

The answers to other questions are played with an even straighter bat. For example, how does she look at the controversial regulatory move to take away a quarter of exchange profits to a fund to guarantee exchange settlements? Or, why hasn't the long-awaited volatility index derivative taken off yet? Or, how does she react to a few of NSE's minority investors' pet peeve that the exchange isn't doing much on their concerns for a decent return on their investments even though it is sitting on Rs 2,847 crore of cash?



The answers are quick one-liners. Decisions on profit transfers are a regulatory call; products take time and tweaks will depend on market feedback; and shareholders will decide on the issue of returning cash.

The answers to other issues are far more affirmative. She wants to take the Nifty to more countries. Exchanges in London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Korea already have Nifty Exchange Traded Funds or ETFs. And so do Germany, Singapore, Italy and Tokyo.

""With India becoming an attractive destination, everyone wants a proxy. And Nifty is the logical proxy for anyone to invest in. So I have a huge amount of work remaining in ensuring that Indian assets are available and distributed in a lot of other destinations"" (Nifty is now in 32 destinations).

Ramakrishna says there is a huge opportunity to grow inorganically in a market which has not even scratched the surface. She is an ardent advocate of ETFs, which are low-cost, easy to understand and transparent. She believes the product has huge potential to grow in India as the proportion of household savings in equities is still in single digits.

There are two different requirements - institutional and high-end investors require complex, sophisticated products meeting different needs of their risk profile and so on, while the mass retail investors need simple products that they can invest in. ""As an exchange, it is our business to provide both ends of the spectrum,"" Ramakrishna says, adding if we can have good broad-based ETFs, that will be the kind of passive investment vehicle that any retail investor should be looking at.

She makes a case for channelling long-term retirement funds into the equity market. The reason is simple: A huge section of salary earners is really government employees and the reality is that the eight to nine per cent returns that they get don't even beat inflation. The challenge, therefore, is how to provide sound retirement planning through better fund management, diversification of portfolios, etc. ""See, the Indian markets are one of the best benchmarked markets in the world in terms of delivery, costs and so on. It's only fair that the vast majority of savers benefit from this prosperity through better options and choices,"" she says.

Will the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) listen? So far, it hasn't. Even in its last meeting last week, the Central Board of Trustees of the EPFO rejected suggestions from the finance ministry on investing a portion of the funds in the equity market.

It's been over one and a half hours now and Ramakrishna is clearly in a rush, with the occasional buzz from her phone getting more frequent. She, however, joins us for dessert - beautifully presented chocolate hazelnut mousse - which she finishes quickly, and the closing bell for our lunch rings.","Fri, 05 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-09/05/full/1409937490-3171.jpg,"['nses', 'rs', 'world', 'music', 'exchange', 'chitra', 'bs', 'stock', 'market', 'ramakrishna', 'crore', 'nifty', 'lunch']",

For some reason, the Pacific Realist has never been a fan of the old mantra, “when it rains, it pours.” Something about the combination of its overuse and lack of insight has always just annoyed me.

However, one area where its wisdom does seem to hold true is in the book publishing world. Specifically, in my mind at least there is a clear never-ending cycle of countless high quality and exciting new books being released in a short period of time, followed by a drought of new books that I look forward to reading. This is necessarily speculative — obviously what books one wants to read differs greatly from person to person — but for me at least, this cycle seems to hold true.

Without question, this fall is one of those periods where a bunch of exciting must-read new books are being released in rapid succession. In fact, there are far too many of them for me to list them all but I felt it was worth saying a few words about a few of them (disclaimer: To avoid any thorny issues, I have left off anything written by Diplomat columnists like Aaron Friedberg’s Aldephi series book on Air-Sea Battle and Kerry Brown’s recent book on China’s Princelings.)

Also, to be clear, I haven’t read any of these books in full yet, and many of them aren’t even on bookshelves yet. I’m currently reading the first one, and I have read parts of an earlier draft of the fourth. Still, I have no doubt all will be well worth your time based on the authors’ previous books and the summaries and/or book reviews I’ve read of these new ones.

This should be obvious given that this is the Pacific Realist’s book list. It has also already been discussed by many, including fellow Diplomat writers.

2. Francis Fukuyama: Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy.

This is the second and final part of Fukuyama’s project to trace the development of governance (particularly with a focus on developing institutions) across the globe and throughout all of human history. This is obviously a Jared Diamond-esque undertaking in its ambition, but thankfully Fukuyama is one of the few living scholars who has the chops to pull it off.

It’s worth noting that though this book, much like Kissinger’s, may be mostly about the history of centuries ago, it could hardly be more timely for as diverse set of actors. Given the U.S. and Western policy world’s continued desire to actively try to shape the political development of most of the rest of the world — even as their own political institutions fall apart — one would hope some of those in power in Washington and Brussels would give Fukuyama’s book a close read. Meanwhile, much of the non-Western world — and particularly the most important non-Western countries — are undertaking herculean reforms to their own systems. They too owe Fukuyama a great deal of gratitude for these two books.

Finally, I’d just note that it’s somewhat fitting that Fukuyama has come to focus so heavily on institutions as that was one of the two main themes running through his mentor’s entire body of work. That mentor of course was Samuel Huntington, whom Fukuyama still constantly (and rightly) praises even though they were the leading members of two starkly different camps in the most important debate in U.S. foreign policy between the end of the Cold War and 9/11.

3. Ian Morris: War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots.

The thesis of this book is an argument that has been made ad nauseam. Still, it’s still largely unappreciated outside of academia, as well as important enough that another book on it can be justified. And Ian Morris’ bibliography is reason enough to read just about anything he publishes.

4. Dale C. Copeland: Economic Interdependence and War.

I’ve previously written about Copeland’s first book, The Origins of Major War, and continue to believe it is one of the most important and underappreciated international relations theories in existence. While one constantly hears Robert Gilpin’s War and Change referenced in discussing the rise and fall of great powers — and for good reason given all the insights in his work — Origins of Major War discredited one of Gilpin’s main contentions in the book: namely, that in hegemonic wars it was the rising power who sued for war against the declining power. First through logic and then through empirical analysis, Copeland demonstrates that it is the declining power who provokes the war in a desperate attempt to stave off its decline. The rising power, Copeland convincingly noted, has every incentive to delay war since it is becoming more and more powerful with every passing day.

We’ve had to wait quite a while for Copeland’s follow up to Origins of Major War (one suspects the herculean task of getting tenured might be partly to blame for this), but his sophomore effort will not disappoint. This book seeks to finally solve the ongoing debate about whether economic interdependence strongly deters two states from going to war, doesn’t really have much of an impact, or actually makes them more likely to go to war.

Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.

It’s long been obvious that the answer to this question has to be: it depends. There are clear cases of economic interdependence causing a war, and other clear cases of trade making war unthinkable among states. Copeland’s achievement is finally answering the obvious follow up question: what does it depend on?

Random sidenotes: As he himself points out, Copeland is taking a page out of Gilpin’s book in integrating political economy with security studies. Also, Copeland’s first book was published as part of the Cornell Studies in Security Affairs, which I have always considered to be hands-down the best series for strategic and security studies books of any university press. This new book is published as part of the Princeton Studies in International History and Politics and I have to say — if one only considers their releases from the past five years or so, I’d say Princeton Studies in International History and Politics has got CSSA beat by a long shot. Seems to me that a hegemonic transition is brewing.

5. William C. Martel: Grand Strategy in Theory and Practice: The Need for an Effective American Foreign Policy.

Advertisement

Fletcher Professor and Friend of The Diplomat William Martel has been leading a one-man campaign to force U.S. foreign policymakers to adopt a clear and overtly stated grand strategy. The ambitiousness of such a mission is only topped by its importance. The foreign policy community long ago seemingly came to an internal consensus it will use the absurd notion that “the world today is too complicated for a grand strategy” as an excuse to avoid the difficulties of devising one. And it’s no coincidence that the foreign policy community has long produced one strategic failure after another despite the enormous resources the American people and geography have put at its disposal.

6. Karen Armstrong: Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence.

The Pacific Realist has never been very religious personally or even very much interested in religion. I find these to be excellent qualifications for me to say that I think Karen Armstrong is the best scholar on religion, at least for a general audience. I don’t believe that simply because she can make her subject matter interesting to someone like myself who isn’t all that knowledgeable or interested in it. It’s more that her books are just oozing with interesting insight after interesting insight — a trait most great authors, from Jared Diamond to Jon Krakauer to Mark Twain, share.","Mon, 06 Oct 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2014-10-03_07-54-27.jpg,"['fukuyama', 'world', 'book', 'mustread', 'fall', 'political', 'read', 'studies', 'power', 'history', 'books', 'war']",

Jaipuria said the proposed IPOs would help RJ Corp support his estimated $600-million investment in the two for expansion through the next few years. He plans to double the group's turnover from about Rs 10,000 crore in 2015 to about Rs 20,000 crore by 2017. Through the past few years, the group had been growing at about 40 per cent annually through natural expansion and acquisitions across segments, he added.

According to Jaipuria, the promoters intend to dilute about 10 per cent stake in each of the through the IPOs; private equity (PE) investors are likely to make exits during the public listing. Jaipuria, averse to public listing a few years ago, said the two RJ Corp entities had to be scaled up, which would need more funds and professionals.

""IPOs will be the best way to stabilise businesses,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Jaipuria is also talking to PE investors to raise $100-125 million for about 10 per cent equity stake in Varun Beverages in a pre-IPO deal. ""We hope to close this by the end of December,"" he said. Standard Chartered PE holds about five per cent stake in the company.

Varun Beverages, which acquired all company-owned bottling operations from PepsiCo in north India earlier this month, was set to go public by the end of 2015 or early 2016, Jaipuria said. While half its business is accounted for by PepsiCo in India, Varun Beverages also has bottling plants abroad, including Sri Lanka, Mozambique, Zambia and Morocco.

Fast-food entity Devyani International, in which Temasek has about 15 per cent stake, is likely to be valued at about $1 billion when it goes public. ""About 10 per cent of the promoters' equity stake will be offered during the IPO in 2016,"" Jaipuria said.

""Through the next two-three years, we will expand all our businesses, both existing operations and through acquisitions,"" he said, adding he would be interested in taking over Yum! Brands' businesses in west and south India. ""We are open, and we'll talk to them. We already have the rights in the north and the east. National rights will certainly make sense,"" he said.

Devyani International holds the franchisee rights for Pizza Hut, KFC, and Taco Bell in north and east India.

Jaipuria said he was also approached by Burger King, but he didn't take the proposition forward, as it would have meant ""conflict of interest"" with KFC. ""We won't look at anything that might be conflicting,"" he said, adding he might look at Mexican, Thai and Chinese food as categories for expansion.

""For fast food and beverages, we will be expanding in India, the African continent and the Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) region,"" he said. For expansion, Varun Beverages is eyeing new markets such as Zimbabwe and Bhutan.

Jaipuria, who is already present in the ice cream market across the country with Creme Bell, now plans to expand in the dairy segment, too. ""We will be putting a new large plant next year, in addition to our existing three. Besides ice cream, we have plans to get into other dairy products such as yogurt, milk, butter and cheese. Essentially, these will work in the backward integration for our fast-food businesses.""



He said he intended to disrupt the dairy market in 2016. Besides India, Jaipuria is also eyeing the market in Africa for his dairy products.","Thu, 27 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2014-11/27/full/1417031457-4095.jpg,"['india', 'rs', 'mn', 'bottler', 'raise', 'cent', 'plans', 'beverages', 'varun', 'jaipuria', 'stake', 'public', 'ravi', '16', '300', 'dairy']", 
97,97,Drought Sri Lanka,China's Looming Water Shortage – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2014/11/chinas-looming-water-shortage/,"Advertisement

The Diplomat has previously covered China’s water pollution crisis, with the Chinese government reporting that nearly 60 percent of China’s groundwater is polluted. But water scarcity, while obviously exacerbated by pollution, is also a severe problem for China, one that is tied up with complex questions about energy use, urbanization, and modernization.

Water issues were highlighted recently by Premier Li Keqiang. He urged local governments to accelerate their work on dealing with water issues, from water conservation to water diversion projects. In a visit to China’s Ministry of Water Resources, Li suggested providing more government funding for these projects and better support in the form of favorable policies. Trying to sweeten the deal, Li said such projects would also help “stabilize economic growth” by raising employment and investment levels.

Li’s personal attention to the matter emphasizes the urgency of addressing water issues in China, According to the World Bank, China has renewable internal freshwater resources of 2,071 cubic meters per capita, well above the UN definition of water scarcity as 1,000 cubic meters per person. But China’s water resources are not distributed equally. According to Choke Point: China, nearly 70 percent of water used in China goes to the agriculture sector, while 20 percent is used in the coal industry. Both of these industries – agriculture and coal – are concentrated in China’s north, which also happens to be an area of scarce rainfall, receiving only 20 percent of China’s total moisture. As a result, demand for water is outstripping supply. In northern China, the average water per capita is only around 200 cubic meters. In Beijing, consumption levels were 70 percent greater than the total water supply in 2012.

As Li’s remarks indicated, the Chinese government is very aware of the problem and is taking concrete steps to solve it, both by increasing efficiency and decreasing water use. Still, Beijing is struggling to adapt to the central problem. Thanks to urbanization and modernization, China’s water consumption is growing (projected to reach 670 billion cubic meters a year in the early 2020s, according to Choke Point: China) even while its water resources are dwindling – down 13 percent since 2000.

To solve the problem, since 2002 China has been working on a mega-project to bring water from the moisture-rich south to the arid north. The South-North Water Diversion Project will use three canals to move 44.8 billion cubic meters of water each year from the south to the north, according to The Atlantic. All told, the project is expected to cost over $60 billion; the Eastern and Central Canals are already functioning. But simply supplying more water won’t solve the underlying problem of inefficient water use and growing demand. In fact, the newly completed Central Canal won’t even make up the entire shortfall in Beijing’s water supply – and demand will only continue to increase.

There are potential solutions, but these have faced political opposition. The Economist argued that China could best address its problems by simply raising the price of water, particularly in regions where water is scarce. Officials have been reluctant to do this, however, for fear of driving away industries that support local economies. Without a strict policy on water conservation at the central level, local officials are unlikely to take action. As a result, China’s war on pollution, particularly air pollution, may prove to be simple in comparison to the potential water crisis currently brewing.","Sun, 30 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2014-11-29_19-31-15.jpg,"['according', 'problem', 'meters', 'cubic', 'water', 'central', 'resources', 'pollution', 'shortage', 'chinas', 'china', 'looming']",

HAVANA (AP) – Dairo Tio cruises the streets of Havana in a gleaming black 1954 Buick with polished chrome highlights and the diesel motor from an electric plant bolted beneath the hood.

When the brakes failed in his beautiful Frankenstein of a taxicab, Tio couldn’t work for 15 days as he waited for a machinist to hand carve the necessary screws.

The half-century-old embargo on most United States exports has turned Cubans into some of the most inventive mechanics in the world, technicians capable of engineering feats long lost to the modern world of electronic ignitions and computerised engine calibration.

President Barack Obama’s announcement that he is loosening the embargo through executive action has Cubans dreaming of an end to the era of cannibalising train springs for suspensions and cutting tire patches by hand.

One of the measures announced by Obama last week would allow U.S. exports to Cuba’s small class of private business owners, which includes thousands of mechanics and taxi drivers who shuttle both Cubans in battered sedans for about 50 cents a ride and tourists in shiny, restored vintage vehicles for $25 an hour.

While the details of Obama’s reforms remain uncertain, Cubans are hopeful that their publication in the coming weeks will end a five-decade drought of cars and parts.

“Maybe it will be possible to get parts faster, at better prices,” said a hopeful Raul Arabi, 58, who spoke with The Associated Press while seated behind the wheel of a cherry-red 1952 Chevy convertible that still runs on its original 6-cylinder engine. “If they opened a specific store for this, even better.”

Cuba long restricted car ownership almost entirely to prominent bureaucrats, high achievers in their fields and professionals who completed government service abroad.

That limit was dropped last year but replaced by markups drove prices as high as $262 000 for a Peugeot that lists for the equivalent of about $53 000 outside Cuba. That leaves classic cars as one of the only options for Cubans needing private transportation for themselves or a business, although prices around $20 000 for old cars mean buyers on the island often need help for the purchase from relatives abroad.

With so much invested in their cars, new engines, hoods, fenders and transmissions is a dream for the owners of what were once known as “Humphrey Bogarts” and that remain a fixture of the landscape.

“It’s pretty complicated,” said Tio, 27. “The government won’t sell you glass for these old cars. They won’t sell replacement parts for these old cars. Everything is made by hand.”

A few years ago, the only way Tio could get new tires for his car was to rely on the generosity of a relative who brought some back from Venezuela.","Sat, 27 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.nationnews.com/nationnews/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/12/ea84a2507ff04eb902f8985c361bc746.jpg,"['world', 'numbered', 'remain', 'days', 'cubans', 'wont', 'tio', 'old', 'prices', '000', 'classic', 'cars', 'sell', 'cubas']",

Our work in Pakistan: Disaster risk reduction, health and rights

I am just leaving Pakistan, after five days here with our Country Director Ajeeba Aslam and her wonderful team of staff and partners. I seemed to have crammed a lot into a short period of time – learning all about HelpAge’s history and current programme here.

This included chairing a discussion at the 5th Annual Conference of the Health Services Academy of Pakistan, discussing a UN convention on the rights of older people with senior Government officials and meeting Dr Boi Khan, founder and CEO of Pakistan Medico International, one of our longest-standing affiliates.

Impact of our work

I also spent three days in northern Sindh province, meeting women and men from older people’s associations and spending time with our partner Sindh Rural Support Organisation (SRSO).

Above all, it gave me the privilege of seeing first-hand what a difference our programmes are making to the lives of older people, and how the advocacy work carried out by older people’s associations is slowly changing attitudes towards older people and older age.

Pakistan is considered, and considers itself, a “young” country. At present, only 7% of the population is over 60. This figure will rise slowly, projected to reach only 16% by 2050. But the numbers of older people are impressive – already Pakistan is one of only 10 countries in the world with more than 10 million citizens over 60. This number is forecast to rise to 43 million by 2050.

Innovation in disaster risk reduction

HelpAge opened an office in Pakistan in 2010, after the terrible monsoon floods. Since then, we have developed an expertise in age-friendly emergency response as well as modelling and implementing DRR activities that are inclusive of older people. I visited two villages where older people are at the centre of community DRR awareness building and preparedness activities through their local older people’s associations.

In the first village, in Jacobabad district, older people were engaged in a hazard mapping exercise – recalling the patterns of past flood waters, where the waters reached and the parts of the village which stayed safe.

I saw one of the best examples of innovation I have seen in my time with HelpAge, as the older people’s association leaders took out and started to play a specially designed game of Ludo.

The game is explicitly built around the theme of DRR, with each of the squares representing a step in being prepared for a flood in the community. Ludo is a much loved game in Sindh, and you could tell that it had been hugely successful in engaging them in the programme. Good fun, good innovation, good impact.

Communities prepared for disasters

In the next village we visited, we saw all of the community involved in a drill - practising early warning, evacuation and how to administer basic first aid.

We have been working on DRR in Sindh province since just after the 2010 floods, funded for the first three years mainly by Age International funds raised from the UK public. The latest phase, which will end on July 2015, is funded by CordAid, a member of our HelpAge global network.

On the evidence of the high quality work and the boost from older people globally being the focus this year’s UN Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, I am confident that we will be able to find partners in Pakistan and around the world to help us continue and expand this work.

Lack of adequate health services

We went on from there to visit a health clinic. While we were all taken by the commitment of the doctor on duty there, it was clear that the services offered were in no way adequate to help older people enjoy the best possible health and active ageing process.

His was one clinic, understaffed, and serving a catchment population of almost 40,000. Thanks to HelpAge, he had some basic equipment on top of what the Government provided, such as a blood pressure monitor.

There had been some significant, life-transforming successes from the project that had linked older people through the older people’s associations to his clinic and onwards to the local hospitals.

The most obvious impact is where he had referred patients for successful cataract surgery, which has an immediate and wonderful effect on the life of an older person and their family.

Health system under strain

But overall, the public health system in Pakistan is still a long way from being able to diagnose, treat and manage the most common non-communicable diseases which, if left untreated, pose the gravest threat to the health and wellbeing of older people.

At the last older people’s association we visited, I asked a group of around 15 older men to raise their hand if they had had their blood pressure checked in the past five years. Only two hands were raised.

Undiagnosed hypertension remains the number one cause of premature death for older people the world over. Equipment to test blood pressure is neither expensive, nor difficult to administer, and there are a number of low cost treatments available where cases are diagnosed.

Older people not a priority to health service providers

I gained an insight into why this was the case when I had chaired a session on the health of older people at the Health Services Academy earlier in my visit. The physicians were impeccably trained, and in obvious agreement with those speaking up with better health services to be made available for older people.

But their answer was that there were other more pressing priorities – safe child birth, higher rates of immunisation coverage, more effective family planning etc…

At one point, the senior representative there said that there would come a time when more thought and investment would have to go into health services for older people, but only when the overall percentage of older people in the population was very much higher.

This is a very good illustration of why older people need national and international policy-makers to adopt a rights-based approach to development. It also again highlights the importance of a UN convention for the rights of older people.

Older people's rights need to be better protected

I made this point directly at a meeting in Islamabad with Mr Shoaib Mir, Additional Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights. This Ministry has responsibility within Pakistan for international legal instruments.

Without international and national legal protection, it is clear that older people will always be expected to take their place at the end of queue when it comes to health and other social services.

“Not a priority”, “not now”, “maybe we can do this when there are more of them” are phrases we heard a lot over the course of my visit. But they have no place within a narrative of human rights, which are universal.

Older people have the same rights as any other segment of population to the best possible health, and every reason to expect Governments and international donors in countries like Pakistan to design and finance primary health services for all their citizens, regardless of their age.
