0,0,Drought Sri Lanka,Persistent Drought in Sri Lanka Forces Farmers to Rethink Methods - Global Press Journal,https://globalpressjournal.com/asia/sri_lanka/decades-farming-drought-sri-lanka-forces-farmers-rethink-methods/,"CHEDDIKULAM, SRI LANKA — On a beautiful evening, just before sunset, Mutthusami Selvareththinam crouches in the garden in front of his house, weeding between beanstalks and wrapping creepers around their supports.

Selvareththinam has grown beans, nuts and vegetables here for three decades. But recently, widespread water scarcity in this part of Sri Lanka has made his work difficult.

The region used to receive frequent heavy rain year-round, he says. “We could cultivate at any time. Now, since the rain is less, we cultivate during the rainy season only.” Due to the drought throughout Yala season – the dry season that runs from May to August – his 1 acre of land yields half as many groundnut crops as years past.

Selvareththinam, and others farmers in this northern region, face a new reality. He is forced to rely on the small amount of water that seeps into his well during the rainy season to irrigate the farm twice a day. He limits well-water use at home, he says, so he can use more of it on his crops. But he still struggles to give them enough. Sometimes he’s compelled to use water from his neighbors’ wells. He thanks them with occasional gifts of vegetables and groundnuts.

“Earlier we had water in the pond, and because of this, the wells had sufficient water,” Selvareththinam says. “Now the pond itself is dry, so how can water be in the well? How to cultivate?”

By October 2019, more than 634,000 people across the country were affected by drought, according to Sri Lanka’s disaster management center.

The local government supplies drinking water to people affected by the drought, but they do not provide additional assistance to farmers. Data from the local government shows that about 1,000 families in the north’s Vavuniya district received drinking water during the dry season.

A thriving private water trade has sprung up to address the decrease, with some individuals buying supplies from households closer to the paddy fields that have more water in their wells than those farther away.

Thayalini Indrakularasa, GPJ Sri Lanka Kunasekaram Ariyasri harvests vegetables from his plot of land in Cheddikulam. Ariyasri has recently switched to a drip irrigation system in response to dwindling groundwater. \

Nadarasa Santhamurthi used to make all of his income from farming, but for the past three years he has sold water on the side. Santhamurthi buys 5,000 liters (1,320 gallons) of water for between 200 and 400 Sri Lankan rupees ($1-$2). He sells it to people in need of water for 700 to 1,500 rupees ($4-$8).

But the business isn’t stable. At any given time, he has anywhere from four to 50 customers, he says, and they are often unreliable.

“After travelling 7-8 kilometers (5 miles) to deliver, [customers] will say, ‘We have bought it somewhere else,’” he says. “Sometimes I get very angry.”

Sivakumar Subramaniam, head of the civil engineering department at the University of Jaffna, partly blames the dwindling water supplies on intense rice cultivation during Yala season. More than 1,500 hectares of land were cultivated in the district during the 2019 Yala season, according to data from the Department of Agriculture.

Subramaniam says farmers should consider switching to grains and crops that require less water, such as lentils, beans or mangos.

Rather than changing crops, some farmers have adapted their methods.

Thayalini Indrakularasa, GPJ Sri Lanka Ariyasri says his new irrigation system has allowed him to quadruple the area he farms during Yala season.

Kunasekaram Ariyasri, 60, has farmed in the region since he was 13. But in recent years, he says he’s switched to drip irrigation to reduce water loss. After investing 400,000 rupees ($2,200) in a new watering system, he’s able to irrigate 2 acres of land during Yala season, he says, versus the half an acre he managed before.

“Twenty years ago, we had water in the well just 15 feet deep,” he says. “Now, even if we dig the ground more than 32 feet deep, we cannot see the water.”

The Sri Lankan government is trying to combat the drought’s effects by restoring abandoned ponds and increasing their depth as well as digging canals with help from the United Nations-backed Green Climate Fund, says Rajaratnam Vijayakumar, assistant district commissioner of the Vavuniya Department of Agrarian Development.

And though the drought has been tough, Selvareththinam has no intention of giving up.

“I’ve been farming for 30 years,” he says. “It’s the only job that I know. Whatever the challenges may be, I will continue.”

COLOMBO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Natural Hazards Early Warning Center Tuesday issued an ""extreme heat"" alert for several districts of the country as temperatures were expected to rise to over 40 degrees in coming days.

In a statement, the center said extreme heat would be experienced in the Eastern, North-Western, North-Central, Western and Southern provinces as well as several areas in the north.

According to the advisory, the temperature felt on the human body is expected to increase up to ""Extreme Caution"" level, especially in the noted areas.

The Meteorology Department said the public have been warned of possible heat cramps, exhaustion and even heat strokes, especially in the worst affected districts.

""The public are advised to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade as often as possible while at work, check up on the elderly and the sick while indoors, never leave children unattended in vehicles, limit strenuous outdoor activities,"" the Meteorology Department said.

Due to the excessively dry weather, Sri Lanka is also facing a drought in many parts of the country.

Drought mitigation in Pakistan: current status and options for future strategies*.* Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute (IWMI) vii, 47p. [IWMI Working Paper 85 / IWMI Drought Series: Paper 3]

Executive Summary

Droughts are typical in Pakistan as in most of southwest Asia and continue causing multiple adverse impacts. This study is a part of the Regional Project on Drought Assessment and Potential for Mitigation in Southwest Asia, which is being implemented by IWMI in collaboration with regional partners and which is aimed to review the current status of drought-related issues and measures in Pakistan. This paper reviews factors affecting, or associated with, droughts, focusing on the target areas (Baluchistan and Sindh provinces), identifying gaps in the institutional and policy arenas with recommendations for remedial measures, providing analyses of coping strategies adopted by stakeholders in mitigating droughts, and documenting lessons gained during previous drought cycles.

Pakistan frequently experiences several droughts. The Punjab province experienced the worst droughts in 1899, 1920 and 1935. The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) experienced the worst droughts in 1902 and 1951, while Sindh had its worst droughts in 1871, 1881, 1899, 1931, 1947 and 1999. The most severe droughts at the national scale were perhaps the most recent, which occurred in 19992000 prolonging up to 2002. The rainfall is erratic and river flows have dropped. Water in the Tarbela dam reaches the dead level in late February or early March almost every year. The current live reservoir capacity in the Indus basin has been reduced due to siltation. The recent drought has also exposed the vulnerability of the Indus basin irrigation system and environmental issues in deltaic areas.

Agricultural growth suffered a severe setback during 20002001 as a result of drought. While major crops registered a negative growth of almost 10%, the overall agriculture recorded a negative growth of 2.6%. The drought persisted throughout 20012002, resulting in water shortage of up to 51% of normal supplies as against 40% of the previous year. The total flows of water in major rivers also declined to 109 billion m3 against an average of 162 billion m3. Rainfall has also been below normal. The canal head withdrawals have also witnessed significant decline. Notwithstanding severe water shortages, the farmers in Pakistan undertook various measures to minimize their adverse effects. These include judicious use of water, exploitation of groundwater, purchase of water from tube wells, improvements in cultural practices, and better overall management. As a result, overall agriculture registered a positive growth of 1.4% in 20012002 as against a decline of 2.6% during 20002001. Droughts have also affected the performance of nonagriculture sectors. Pakistans nonagricultural GDP growth remained stable at around 4.3% in 20012002. Therefore, when adjusted for drought impact, the real GDP is provisionally estimated to grow by 4.7% against 5.2% in 20002001. The slower growth in real GDP over these 2 years was caused by drought. If there had been no drought, Pakistans economic growth would have been 5%.

Water harvesting, management and use are common practices for drinking or farming either directly harvesting the runoff or by storing it in small surface and subsurface reservoirs. The stored water is used for supplemental irrigation and other consumptive uses. In nonirrigated areas, the majority of farmers are still practicing traditional water-harvesting systems, sailaba or spate irrigation and khushkhaba or runoff farming. These harvesting systems were adversely affected by the introduction of new technological interventions (like deep tube wells) and by recurring droughts.

The descriptive information on traditional and new technological interventions is available, but there is a complete gap of quantitative knowledge on how the new technologies have affected the traditional and sustainable interventions like karezes. There is hardly any information available regarding the impact of new technologies on lowering of the water table and mining of groundwater in Baluchistan. Similar impacts were observed in the arid zones of the Sindh province, where indiscriminate use of groundwater using deep tube wells led to drying up of the shallow dug-wells and intrusion of saline water. There is a unique opportunity in Baluchistan to document the impacts of deep tube-well technology on the drying of karezes, resulting in shifting the benefits of electricity tariff subsidy to the resource-rich farmers. Baluchistan provides a unique opportunity to the Region in the assessment of the impacts of new technologies on the karez system. A comprehensive research study is needed to address this issue in a scientific manner.

The institutional arrangements are reasonably well defined for the drought-relief activities, but there is hardly any institutional mechanism for drought preparedness and mitigation to address the long-term issues. The strategy for technological development in Baluchistan and arid areas of Sindh should be based on the assessment of the potential resources available for development through integrating activities of spate irrigation with the objective of spreading of floodwater to increase the command area and recharging the regional groundwater resources.

The study conclusions and recommendations are:

• The existing system of monitoring drought and its impacts on various sectors is weak. There is a need to develop a policy for access to information related to drought and water management. Such information databases themselves are limited at present. A similar situation exists at the regional level. Sharing and exchange of information regarding drought monitoring and impact assessment are also limited among the countries of the region. India is ahead in this regard and Pakistan can learn from the Indian experiences. Similarly, exchange of information and building joint programs between Pakistan and Iran would help the two countries.

• Farmers are not aware of actual crop water requirements, and irrigation-scheduling practices are still largely based on the amount of water available with the farmer and the situation of the farm. Farmers tend to overirrigate to cover the unleveled fields. Efforts are needed to help farmers in efficient conveyance and application of pumped groundwater. The water-management technologies developed in the Indus basin regarding conveyance and application of water at the farm are very promising, as Pakistan was ahead of the countries in the region. Even then such technologies were hardly tested and adapted in the drought-prone areas.

• Pakistan can provide a unique opportunity to share the experiences of the watercourse improvement program, laser leveling, furrow-bed irrigation, skimming wells and salinity management. Reciprocally, Pakistan can learn from India and Iran in the area of drip and sprinkler irrigation systems as both these countries are ahead in this regard. A regional research and development program for drought and water management seems justified for exchange of experiences and knowledge and to build future activities.

• Farmers should be encouraged and motivated to use indigenous water-harvesting technologies for sailaba (spate irrigation) and khushkhaba (localized runoff farming) areas. These systems of water spreading if integrated with recharging the groundwater can provide cost-effective interventions for mitigating the drought impacts.

• Due to the excessive exploitation of groundwater coupled with the successive drought, water tables in different parts of Sindh and especially in Baluchistan have considerably declined. Communities should be directly involved in the campaign of recharging the aquifers and in the conjunctive use and management of surface water and groundwater resources. Pakistans Indus basin experiences of conjunctive use of water have to be used and adapted in the drought-prone areas of Baluchistan and Sindh provinces. Such experiences if translated to the nonirrigated areas can provide an excellent opportunity for the countries of the region.

• Efficient irrigation methods, farm layout, balanced use of fertilizer and pesticides, and integrated nutrient management remain limited and are the key factors underlying low productivity in Sindh and Baluchistan. The productivity of agriculture and livelihoods of communities are dependent on the availability of the right type of tools, which can extract water from larger depths.

• Farmers should be encouraged, motivated and trained in the adoption of efficient wateruse technologies, such as sprinkler and drip irrigation, laser leveling, raised-bed planting, rainwater harvesting, watercourse lining and water-storage tanks, which have proven successful in different arid environments of Pakistan. The experiences of India and Iran are available for other countries of the region.

• Presently, there is no comprehensive drought-mitigation infrastructure and strategy at the federal and provincial levels. Institutional arrangements and their capacities are inadequate at the federal and provincial levels to effectively launch the early warning systems, preparedness and contingency plans, and rehabilitation measures, while such arrangements are nonexistent at the district level. In fact, this is the weakest area in the region as a whole. This justifies a regional initiative to evaluate the existing institutional setups and mechanisms for drought mitigation and build an effective structure and mechanisms, which can be adopted by the countries of the region. A collaborative effort is needed in the region with the active involvement of IWMI.

• For formulation and implementation of the National Drought Policy, there is a need to establish an apex organization for the planning, coordination and monitoring of the policy interventions at the federal level. This organization may be entrusted with the responsibility for providing an enabling framework to the provincial governments, where they are motivated to establish a similar organizational setup at the provincial levels to provide linkages and coordination among the line departments and the district governments.","Mon, 16 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1478388-WOR85.png?itok=v4gaASel,"['farmers', 'strategies', 'options', 'future', 'droughts', 'water', 'region', 'drought', 'irrigation', 'groundwater', 'management', 'mitigation', 'status', 'pakistan', 'baluchistan', 'current']", ,drought
3,3,Drought Sri Lanka,Plantation sector estimates 40-pct drop in tea production from 3-month drought - Lanka Business Online,https://www.lankabusinessonline.com/plantation-sector-estimates-40-pct-drop-in-tea-production-from-3-month-drought/,"Apr 16, 2020 (LBO) – Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA) estimates a 40 percent drop in estate tea production solely resulting from unprecedented drought for the past 3 months.

PA Chairman, Sunil Poholiyadde releasing a statement said that the loss in crop had already created an increase in the cost of production.

However, given the unprecedented global supply chain disruptions unfolding as a result of the pandemic, Sri Lankan tea has attracted significantly improved prices by the close of the very first tea e-auction which took place on 3rd April 2020.

Poholiyadde warned that while improved prices would be useful in a crisis situation, currency depreciation also posed a serious challenge for the industry when considering its impact on increasing input costs, which together with lower production volumes – would negatively impact an already high cost of production.

In the case of the rubber sector, six auctions were delayed for a period of three weeks owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite increased production driven by favourable weather conditions in rubber growing regions. Poholiyadde noted that the interruption in auctions had caused acute difficulties for RPC cashflows.

Full statement

SL Plantation sector presses forward amidst tightened safety precautions, unprecedented drought

· Reiterates commitment to protect health of workers, resident estate community from COVID-19

· Calls for unity among stakeholders in the face of unprecedented challenges

· Estimates 40% drop in production solely resulting from unprecedented 3 month drought

· Commends RPCs for systematic resumption of work with only 4 days interruption

· Expresses gratitude to industry for success of first ever e-auction of Ceylon Tea

Following the Government declaration of the Plantations sector as an essential service, the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA) stated that RPC operations immediately gathered momentum amidst stringent new measures to protect workers and the wider estate community against the COVID-19 pandemic.

Expressing gratitude to all industry stakeholders and Government authorities for successfully enabling plantation sector to resume critical operations, PA Chairman, Sunil Poholiyadde stated:

“While work on the estates was halted by 13th March, as soon as the COVID pandemic worsened, most RPCs were able to resume work after only 4-days interruption. This was due to the remarkable initiative taken by the RPCs with the assistance of health authorities to institute stringent health and safety protocols, while ensuring that all workers and the wider estate community had their essential needs met.

“The challenges around COVID-19 add to the already pressing difficulties of tea producers who have been facing an unprecedented drought for the past 3 months which is estimated to have caused as much as a 40% reduction in estate production. The loss in crop had already created an increase in the cost of production (COP).”

Moving forward, he reiterated the total and continuing commitment of all RPCs to ensure that all possible precautions are taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among workers and the estate community, in compliance with guidelines issued by health authorities.

Poholiyadde also commended the success of each RPC in ensuring that employees were provided with food parcels as well as advances for food and other essentials, as well as special measures taken in partnership with Government authorities. Through such partnerships, rations were delivered directly to the estates, in order to avoid situations where community members would have otherwise been forced to stand in long queues.

At present, the RPC tea sector maintains a workforce of approximately 135,000, and is also responsible for the welfare of a wider estate community with an approximate population of 1 million since most the migrant workers have also returned to the estates.

“Having safely commenced work on the plantations, the next hurdle was the sale of produce at the Colombo Auction. After a lapse of two weeks, all stakeholders were able to agree and establish an electronic platform for the auction – this was and advancement which was on the cards for several years, but had not materialised.

“Hence we are grateful to all stakeholders for banding together and changing a system which is over one century old. In this manner, every aspect of the plantation supply chain – from production to transport, sale and export has now been restarted, under the strict oversight of Government. This is a remarkable achievement. Moving forward we will continue to work in partnership with the Government to monitor the situation and follow its directives, while making every effort to support the State with vital export earnings at this critical juncture,” Poholiyadde stated.

Given the unprecedented global supply chain disruptions unfolding as a result of the pandemic, Sri Lankan tea attracted significantly improved prices by the close of the very first tea e-auction which took place on 3rd April 2020. Higher prices were primarily a result of lower production, where weekly auction volumes were approximately 40% lower than in a normal cropping month, and sharp currency depreciation.

However, Poholiyadde warned that while improved prices would be useful in a crisis situation, currency depreciation also posed a serious challenge for the industry when considering its impact on increasing input costs, which together with lower production volumes – would negatively impact an already high cost of production.

In the case of the rubber sector, six auctions were delayed for a period of three weeks owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite increased production driven by favourable weather conditions in rubber growing regions. Poholiyadde noted that the interruption in auctions had caused acute difficulties for RPC cashflows.

“The resumption of auctions has been an extremely welcome development for the rubber sector as well. Prices have remained at relatively similar levels to before the COVID outbreak, however we will need to pay careful attention here given the sharp declines which were seen in global oil prices,” he stated.

Moving forward, the PA stated that its membership would continue to maintain protocols to ensure systematic hand sanitation strict hygiene practices and social distancing while all workers were issued protective equipment. Meanwhile, all staff and worker dwellings, as well as factory premises will continue to be disinfected on a regular basis.

“RPC mangers and staff are also on the frontlines in order to ensure that all estate communities are safeguarded and supported through this unprecedented global pandemic. All of this is being done at a time when up-country estates are experiencing an unprecedented and severe drought, meaning that there is low cropping.

“Despite the challenges, RPCs are fully committed to ensuring the health and safety of its employees. The PA and its members will also be carefully monitoring the situation as it develops, and will be ready to implement any further directives issued by the Government and health authorities on an urgent and immediate basis,” PA Media Spokesperson, Dr. Roshan Rajadurai stated.","Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lankabusinessonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tea-PA.jpg,"['sector', 'estimates', 'drop', '3month', '40pct', 'unprecedented', 'poholiyadde', 'drought', 'estate', 'production', 'prices', 'pandemic', 'tea', 'plantation', 'workers', 'pa']", ,drought

COLOMBO, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka produced 13.2 million kgs of tea in March, a 50 percent drop compared to the same period last year, statistics from the Sri Lanka Tea Board showed here Monday.

Statistics showed that this is the lowest rate of production since February 2009 when the tea production totaled 12.8 million kgs.

Local media reports quoting industry specialists said that the steep drop in tea production in March was due to the ongoing measures taken by the authorities to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the country which has so far infected over 700 people and caused 7 deaths.

However, experts pointed out that in addition to the curfew imposed to prevent the virus outbreak, the drought was also a factor that contributed to the drop in production levels.

Sri Lanka produced 300 million kgs of tea in 2019, a slight decline from the 303 million kgs produced a year earlier.

In January this year, the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) said it was aiming for 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in earnings from the export of Ceylon Tea in 2020 and hoped to increase tea production to 340 million kg.

5,5,Drought Sri Lanka,Hollowed Lands - Earth Island Journal,https://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/magazine/entry/hollowed-lands/,"At the same time as Sri Lanka faces the impacts of climate change, it has also been transforming into an upper middle-income country. Cities like Kandy, Galle, and Jaffna are rapidly growing in population. The nation’s economy has grown on average 6.2 percent a year since the end of the civil war, and is transitioning from being predominantly rural and agricultural to focusing on urbanized manufacturing and services, and is growing in popularity as a tourist destination.

Still, agriculture continues to be the country’s most important source of employment with millions of families engaged in smallholder farming. In some places, the local economy is entirely dependent on it. This means that the declining predictability of rainfall puts immense pressure on the fabric of village life. “There is not much difference in the total annual rainfall, but high rainfall intensity causes floods, while non-rain periods grow longer in certain parts of the country,” explains R.P. Samarakkody, additional director general of the country’s Disaster Management Centre.

Under drought conditions, whole families survive off a monthly income of less than 10,000 rupees ($55 US), relying on their kitchen gardens and the roof over their heads to survive. Some try to cope by reducing their food intake, pawning their jewelry or other assets, or borrowing from banks. Others receive benefits such as Samurdhi, a government relief program that provides food stamps, loans, and other services to poor households, or help from family and neighbors. But it is difficult to make ends meet.

Migration is always the last resort, a choice many unwillingly make once these options are depleted. In a 2019 survey of Trincomalee farmers carried out by SLYCAN Trust, a Sri Lankan think tank working on climate change, less than 6 percent named “abandoning agriculture” as a possible climate adaptation strategy. Their roots in the villages run deep. Leaving means abandoning the only way of life they know. They will no longer be able to visit their neighbors, their Buddhist temple, their kovil (Hindu temple), mosque, or other local gathering places and institutions. They will not be able to keep their cows or their chickens. Besides, it is unlikely they will find jobs in urban areas that fit their skillset.

“Our family bonds are very strong. People do not want to move from their villages. If a proper resilience mechanism can be established, they will stay,” Samarakkody says.

AS WITH MOST OTHER countries, Sri Lanka’s internal migration patterns lead from rural to urban areas like Colombo, Gampaha, and Kandy, though there is cross-border migration to countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates as well.

The impact climate migration is having on those being left behind, especially women, is barely receiving any attention.

One in four people in the urbanized Western Province has migrated there. However, because many maintain strong connections to their homes the number of new migrants is difficult to record. Many migrants tend to return home for short periods every month or two, or during harvest season to help out in the fields.

Another survey by SLYCAN Trust found that 80 percent of respondents across several Trincomalee villages had a migrating family member, almost always the working-age male. Though a growing number of women are migrating as well, it is still overwhelmingly men who leave in search of work.

“The cultural concept is that the breadwinner of a family is the man,” says Priyantha Kulathunga, Sri Lanka program officer for the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration. “Basically, who leaves first tends to be the males in the family, either the main breadwinner or other male family members.” Kulathunga’s colleague Rangitha Balasuriya adds that “individuals between the age of 19 and 50, usually 30 to 35, are most likely to migrate. Men are looking for unskilled jobs in the construction sector or skilled opportunities such as carpentry or masonry. Women leave home to work in the garment industry or the domestic sector,” usually as housecleaners.

“What the workers earn in the city is very marginal, but they make sure they send some money back,” Kulathunga says. “What they send would not be sufficient for investment, just to sustain the family at home. They save to send the children to school, to buy some food.”

If migration due to the slow-onset impacts of climate change hasn’t been receiving much attention in South Asia, the impact it’s having on those being left behind, especially women, is receiving even less. What research does exist suggests the impact is significant.

In the 50 households SLYCAN Trust surveyed across Bakmeegama and three other villages, 40 families had at least one member who had left. Of the 42 total migrants, 36 were men. The departure of working-age men from villages places an additional burden on women who are left with little regular income. Most of them have to run their household and care for children (and often elders as well). They may also take on farm work or find other avenues of additional income like selling sesame balls or other snacks at local markets, or sewing, given the money the men send back can be unreliable and sporadic.

M.H. Dinusha Madurangi from Pulikandikulama village, a few kilometers from Bakmeegama, says she has to do almost everything, from housework to farming, herself. “I grow pumpkin and okra for home consumption,” she says. “My husband migrated about a year ago to [the district capital] Trincomalee. He works there as a day laborer and comes home once a month. Our two children are without a father, and I have to do all the work alone.”

Even though the absence of men increases women’s decision-making power on everyday matters, cultural norms, policies, and laws limit their empowerment and access to investment opportunities. In Sri Lanka, as in most of South Asia, even when men are away for most of the year, they are often the de facto household head. A 2018 United Nations report found women headed only 25.8 percent of households in Sri Lanka. “Gender disparity is rampant,” Kulathunga says. “Even if the men are living in other countries, they are controlling the entire network of the family. Of course, some women get a certain amount of power when the husband is not around. They get to decide how to spend the money or what to buy, but the big decisions are either negotiated or coming from the man.”

The women left behind are struggling to cope, but policies in Sri Lanka and the rest of South Asia are failing to account for the scale and impact of this trend, notes the ActionAid report on South Asia’s climate migrants. The report’s authors say promotion of women’s empowerment, as well as women-led planning and disaster response, must be part of the solution to this emerging issue.

THE SRI LANKAN GOVERNMENT recognizes that, in addition to putting in place disaster management measures, the country needs to urgently implement climate mitigation and adaptation initiatives, especially in the agricultural and water-management sector. It is pulling a leaf out of the country’s ancient history, in this regard.","Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:51:13 GMT",https://www.earthisland.org/images/uploads/sriLankaOpener.jpg,"['migration', 'left', 'men', 'villages', 'women', 'lanka', 'sri', 'climate', 'south', 'hollowed', 'lands', 'family']", ,none

7,7,Drought Sri Lanka,Mainstreaming technology provides key solutions for disaster risk mitigation - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/mainstreaming-technology-provides-key-solutions-disaster-risk-mitigation,"Giriraj Amarnath, Research Group Leader – Water Risks and Development Resilience (WRDR)

The recently published World Water Development Report 2020 (WWDR 2020) highlights current impacts and anticipated future risks associated with extreme weather events, and the need for sustainable solutions for climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Scientists at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) were invited to contribute to a number of chapters in WWDR 2020, including chapter 4 (Water-related extremes and risk management).

Water-related natural disasters are major impediments to human security and sustainable socioeconomic development. Climate change has made extreme weather events more severe by altering their frequency, timing, intensity and duration. Around 74% of all natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were related to water. According to EM-DAT, the international disaster database, the past 20 years have seen the total number of deaths caused by floods and droughts exceed 166,000 with these extreme weather events also affecting over three billion people and causing economic damage amounting to approximately USD 700 billion. Without proper adaptation hundreds of millions of people will be at greater risk of hunger, disease, energy shortages and poverty due to water scarcity, pollution or flooding.

At IWMI, we are working under the CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) and Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE), together with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), to increase the resilience of South Asia’s smallholder farmers to climate shocks by promoting integrated disaster management and improving water management.

Increasing resilience

Since 1900, more than 11.7 million people have died and more than 2.7 billion have been affected as a consequence of drought, more than the loss and damage caused by any other natural hazard (EM-DAT – accessed on March 21, 2020). With the aim of helping farmers affected by drought, IWMI launched the South Asia Drought Monitoring System in 2016. The system allows national authorities to assess exactly when and where disaster relief efforts are needed. Every eight days it publishes detailed maps showing drought severity across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The maps depict seven categories, from healthy vegetation to extreme drought, through analysis of historical satellite data. Drought relief can then be deployed more effectively. IWMI-led efforts to expand applications of technology to drought preparedness are underway in Southern Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia.

IWMI’s efforts to support nations and regions prepare for climate shocks involve enhancing farmers’ resilience. In recent years, the Institute developed an index-based flood insurance (IBFI) product to compensate farmers whose crops were ruined as a result of floods (see chapter 4 in WWDR 2020). The technology uses satellite data and modeling tools to estimate when the depth and duration of flooding exceeds predefined limits, triggering automatic payouts. Between 2017 and 2019, the IBFI scheme supported insurance payouts in India (USD 22,000) and Bangladesh (USD 31,500) to 1,306 out of 2,300 eligible farming households, to increase their resilience to floods and minimize their vulnerability to natural hazards.

A new trial seeks to build on the success of IBFI by bundling SMS-based weather information and advice on crop and water management methods and fertilizers together with the insurance product. The trial covered 1,000 households with 450 benefitting from a total insurance payout of approximately USD 12,500.

We must balance hard (structural) and soft (policy instruments) approaches by enhancing water storage, building climate-proof infrastructure, improving crop resilience, forecasting, early warning systems and strengthening policies for greater climate investments in regions of priority. One such innovation to address the dual challenges of floods and groundwater depletion is ‘Underground Transfer of Floods for Irrigation’ (UTFI), which involves targeted recharging of aquifers using excess wet season flows to protect lives and assets downstream while also boosting agricultural productivity in the region.

Looking ahead, our focus at IWMI will be to mainstream climate analysis, and planning and investment to identify future climate finance opportunities which are aligned to the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) supported by the Green Climate Fund, World Bank and others. The aim will be to push over USD 100 billion in financing per year through green bonds, subnational climate funds and public-private partnerships to meet both the climate and water goals for sustainable water management (See chapter 12 in WWDR 2020).

IWMI recently announced a partnership with Digital Earth Africa which will aggregate petabytes and decades worth of satellite data to build applications that will address some of the big challenges in water management and climate adaptation. We need to promote more and new knowledge and solutions to build resilient societies, and maximize the synergies between CCA and DRR. With an increasing understanding of how we can capitalize on technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of things, big data platforms, modeling tools and remote sensing technologies, we can significantly improve environmental monitoring, flood forecasting and early warning.","Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['solutions', 'technology', 'floods', '2020', 'wwdr', 'mainstreaming', 'risk', 'weather', 'climate', 'mitigation', 'resilience', 'world', 'provides', 'water', 'drought', 'key', 'management', 'disaster', 'usd']", ,flood_and_drought
8,8,Drought Sri Lanka,China Limited the Mekong’s Flow. Other Countries Suffered a Drought. - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/world/asia/china-mekong-drought.html,"“There was just a huge volume of water that was being held back in China,” Mr. Basist added.

The Mekong is one of the most fertile rivers on earth, nurturing tens of millions of people with its nutrient rich waters and fisheries. But a series of dams, mostly in China, have robbed the river’s riches.

Those who depend on its inland fisheries say their catches have declined precipitously. Persistent droughts and sudden floods have buffeted farmers.

Beijing’s control of the upstream Mekong, which provides as much as 70 percent of the downstream water in the dry season, has raised hackles, even though the Southeast Asian nations depend on trade with China. While the Chinese government has introduced a global development program that it says will benefit poorer trading partners, a backlash is growing among countries that feel they are losing out.

“The problem is that the Chinese elite see water as something for their use, not as a shared commodity,” said Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia program and author of “Last Days of the Mighty Mekong.”","Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/world/13mekong1/13mekong1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=769ba00c6335c747fa9f1c4c72c70860aeec6b3acbc8cb864bfc6495b125d3a4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"['mekong', 'chinese', 'waters', 'suffered', 'flow', 'countries', 'program', 'southeast', 'rivers', 'mekongs', 'water', 'drought', 'depend', 'limited', 'china', 'fisheries']", ,flood_and_drought
9,9,Drought Sri Lanka,Romania's grain outlook hampered by drought | 2020-05-19 - World Grain,https://www.world-grain.com/articles/13706-romanias-grain-outlook-hampered-by-drought,"BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Due to a lingering drought, Romania’s grain production in 2020-21 is forecast to fall by 2.6% despite a 2.2% increase in planted area, according to a May 18 Global Agricultural Information Network report from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

As a result, total grain exports for the coming marketing year are projected to decline by 5.5% following a 9.5% increase in exports in 2019-20.

“Amid fears that grain and oilseed stocks would run low, the Romanian government suspended temporarily oilseed and grain exports to non-EU markets in mid-April,” the USDA said.

The decision was reversed a week later as pressure from producers as well as the European Commission led the government to rescind its export ban.

The USDA estimates a decline in wheat production in 2020-21 to 8.3 million tonnes from 8.6 million tonnes, despite a 5.2% increase in planted hectares.

Romania’s corn acreage will remain stable at 2.65 million hectares and the USDA projects a slight decrease in output to 14 million tonnes during the coming marketing year, which starts July 1.

Barley production is forecast to decline by 3% to 1.55 million tonnes in 2020-21, the USDA said.

Barley is primarily an export crop in Romania.

“Exports are forecast marginally lower due to the forecast shorter harvest, with 85% of Romanian barley exports shipped to non-EU markets,” the USDA said.","Tue, 19 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/Article-Images/2020/05/wheat-drought_AdobeStock_24231357_E.jpg?height=635&t=1589890832&width=1200,"['forecast', 'exports', 'million', 'tonnes', 'decline', 'grain', 'romanias', 'drought', 'outlook', 'usda', 'production', 'hampered', 'increase', '202021']", ,drought
10,10,Drought Sri Lanka,Rice prices hit 6-year high as Thailand and Vietnam face drought - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Commodities/Rice-prices-hit-6-year-high-as-Thailand-and-Vietnam-face-drought,"HANOI/BANGKOK -- International prices of rice have surged as droughts keep production low in key exporters Thailand and Vietnam, while panic buying amid the coronavirus pandemic is also tightening supply.

The benchmark export price of Thai-grown rice reached about $550 a ton in late March, the highest since August 2013, according to the country's trade commission. Vietnamese rice also exceeded $400 a ton, a level not seen since December 2018.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in February projected 2020 global rice trade of 45.3 million tons, down 700,000 tons from its January forecast. The world produced roughly half a billion tons of rice a year, but mostly for domestic consumption. Trade volume is less than for flour, making rice prices susceptible to wild swings in international supply and demand.

Thailand shipped abroad about 11.1 million tons of rice in 2018, and Vietnam roughly 6.6 million tons, according to the USDA. They trailed only top-ranked India and were responsible for 23% and 14% of the market. A trade group in Thailand sees the nation's exports falling to 7.5 million tons in 2020. No significant increase is expected for Vietnamese rice, either.

One issue is a shortage of water. Thailand's main growing areas sit along the Chao Phraya River, while Vietnam's are in the Mekong River delta. Rainfall in upstream areas has been down about 30% from normal levels since August 2019, according to media reports. This crisis is worse than in 2016, which was the most serious of recent years, according to the head of an organic farming research institute in Vietnam.

Booming dam construction is another factor. The upstream area of the Mekong River in southern China is home to 11 dams, with plans for about 10 more. The flow rate in downstream regions has decreased, even allowing seawater to flow upstream.

Should the drought continue until June, the February-July rice harvest in Thailand will fall by half on the year, predicts the SCB Economic Intelligence Center, a unit of Siam Commercial Bank.

Urbanization means less land for rice farming. Vietnam had 7.47 million hectares available as of October, down 1.2% on the year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Higher prices are feared to lead to inflation in such buyer countries as China, Indonesia and Nigeria. Import prices are rising in these developing or oil-producing countries, as their currencies have weakened amid the global economic slowdown and falling crude prices. If rice prices continue to climb, consumption in these economies could cool significantly.","Tue, 31 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F6%252F6%252F8%252F4%252F25884866-6-eng-GB%252FCropped-1585573662TX5042P032720%25E3%2582%25B3%25E3%2583%2594%25E3%2583%25BC%25EF%25BC%2589%25E6%25B0%25B4%25E4%25B8%258D%25E8%25B6%25B3%25E3%2581%25A7%25E3%2583%2599%25E3%2583%2588%25E3%2583%258A%25E3%2583%25A0%25E5%258D%2597%25E9%2583%25A8%25E3%2581%25AE%25EF%25BC%2595%25E7%259C%2581%25E3%2581%25AF%25E7%25B7%258A%25E6%2580%25A5%25E4%25BA%258B%25E6%2585%258B%25E3%2582%2592%25E5%25AE%25A3%25E8%25A8%2580%25E3%2581%2597%25E3%2581%259F%25EF%25BC%2588%25EF%25BC%2593%25E6%259C%2588%25E3%2580%2581%25E5%258D%2597%25E9%2583%25A8%25E3%2583%2586%25E3%2582%25A3%25E3%2582%25A8%25E3%2583%25B3%25E3%2582%25B6%25E3%2583%25B3%25E7%259C%2581%25EF%25BC%2589%25E2%2596%25A0%25E5%259B%25BD%25E5%2596%25B6%25E3%2583%2599%25E3%2583%2588%25E3%2583%258A%25E3%2583%25A0%25E9%2580%259A%25E4%25BF%25A120200330090432807_Data.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['river', 'face', 'million', 'high', 'drought', 'hit', 'vietnam', 'prices', 'trade', 'vietnamese', 'according', 'thailand', 'tons', '6year', 'rice']", ,drought

""This appears to be just the beginning of a more extreme trend toward megadrought as global warming continues,"" the authors wrote in the study. A team of researchers from Columbia University conducted the study. They described the ongoing dry spell, which has helped intensify wildfire seasons and threatened water supplies for people and agriculture, as an ""emerging megadrought,"" according to The New York Times.

Of course, nothing is guaranteed. By comparison to the previous 19 years, 2019 was actually a fairly wet year. Unpredictable climate variability may also bring enough rain to the region to end the drought, but global warming boosts the chances that the drought will endure. ""We know that this drought has been encouraged by the global warming process,"" said lead author A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, as The New York Times reported. ""As we go forward in time it's going to take more and more good luck to pull us out of this.""

Scientists have suspected for a while that that the dryness is evolving into a megadrought. The new research not only confirms their suspicion, but also concludes this megadrought may be as bad or worse than anything known before. ""We now have enough observations of current drought and tree-ring records of past drought to say that we're on the same trajectory as the worst prehistoric droughts,"" said Williams, in a statement, as USA Today reported. This is ""a drought bigger than what modern society has seen."" The researchers say that man-made global warming caused about half of this drought. Changes in the climate have contributed to dwindling reservoirs and harsher wildfire seasons. It all could get much worse.

""Anthropogenic global warming and its drying influence in (southwestern North America) are likely still in their infancy,"" the study warns, as CNN reported. ""The magnitude of future droughts in North America and elsewhere will depend greatly on future rates of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions globally."" Without a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, these droughts are just the beginning. ""The effects of future droughts on humans will be further dependent on sustainable resource use because buffering mechanisms such as ground water and reservoir storage are at risk of being depleted during dry times,"" the study continues, according to CNN. To conduct the study, the researchers performed a comprehensive long-term analysis of thousands of square miles, stretching across nine states from Oregon and Montana down through California, Arizona, New Mexico and part of northern Mexico.

12,12,Drought Sri Lanka,Direct and seasonal legacy effects of the 2018 heat wave and drought on European ecosystem productivity - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaba2724,"In summer 2018, central and northern Europe were stricken by extreme drought and heat (DH2018). The DH2018 differed from previous events in being preceded by extreme spring warming and brightening, but moderate rainfall deficits, yet registering the fastest transition between wet winter conditions and extreme summer drought. Using 11 vegetation models, we show that spring conditions promoted increased vegetation growth, which, in turn, contributed to fast soil moisture depletion, amplifying the summer drought. We find regional asymmetries in summer ecosystem carbon fluxes: increased (reduced) sink in the northern (southern) areas affected by drought. These asymmetries can be explained by distinct legacy effects of spring growth and of water-use efficiency dynamics mediated by vegetation composition, rather than by distinct ecosystem responses to summer heat/drought. The asymmetries in carbon and water exchanges during spring and summer 2018 suggest that future land-management strategies could influence patterns of summer heat waves and droughts under long-term warming.

Each of the recent extreme heat and drought events in Europe provides a unique opportunity to study the response of ecosystems to heat and drought events and evaluate how they affect the terrestrial carbon cycle. The extreme spring warming in 2018 is a good case study to assess seasonal legacy and compensation effects from warm springs in ecosystem water and carbon exchanges. Here, we focus our analysis on geographic Europe including western Russia (32°N to 75°N and −11°E to 65°E) and perform a set of factorial simulations with a group of 11 dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) to (i) quantify the anomalies in carbon fluxes during spring and summer in 2018, (ii) evaluate possible seasonal compensation effects between spring and summer responses to 2018 climate anomalies, and (iii) identify the seasonal legacy effects of spring and summer climate to the SM and carbon exchange anomalies during DH2018 event and over 2018.

While several studies have analyzed the impacts of DH events resulting from concurrent SM deficits, heat stress, and fire activity (direct impacts) on ecosystems’ carbon balance, less attention has been devoted to the influence of preceding climate conditions in the ecosystems’ response to the summer extremes (legacy effects). All three DH events in Europe were preceded by warm springs, with reduced rainfall and sunnier conditions. The climate anomalies in spring can affect the annual carbon balance by (i) directly affecting ecosystem productivity, (ii) altering the water and energy balance in the following seasons due to land-atmosphere feedbacks, and (iii) affecting the response of ecosystems to climate anomalies in subsequent seasons by altering their baseline state. Warm and sunny conditions in early spring directly result in earlier vegetation green-up and growth, which might partly compensate for the summer productivity losses from drought and extreme heat ( 9 , 13 ). However, spring climate conditions can have different legacy effects to the summer and annual carbon balance. Previous studies have highlighted the role of spring precipitation deficits, increased solar radiation and warming in amplifying the high temperature anomalies in extreme summers in Europe due to SM depletion ( 1 , 6 , 14 ), and thereby the impact of summer on ecosystem productivity. Increased spring growth may also negatively affect the ecosystem carbon balance in summer or autumn if the additional biomass cannot be sustained (e.g., due to summer drought), by increasing plant respiration and by SM depletion from increased evapotranspiration (ET). Reduced SM could reduce assimilation and maintenance respiration in summer and limit heterotrophic respiration, but increased soil temperatures also lead to increased heterotrophic respiration. Furthermore, spring drought and warming might contribute to increased summer fire activity through higher fuel loads and more flammable fuel. Whether early drought amplifies carbon losses in summer would depend on the net of these effects. A question that remains open is to what extent the earlier vegetation growth in response to increased radiation and warming in spring contributes to earlier SM depletion, possibly amplifying subsequent carbon losses ( 15 ).

Several studies have shown that both DH2003 and DH2010 resulted in strong reductions in vegetation productivity due to soil moisture (SM) deficits, high water vapor pressure and heat stress, increases in ecosystem respiration, and increased fire activity, leading to a reduction of the net CO 2 uptake in ecosystems ( 2 , 6 , 7 ). The SM deficits associated with summer heat waves seem to explain most of the decrease in productivity in DH2003 ( 2 , 8 ) and, to a smaller extent, in DH2010 ( 9 , 10 ). Some ecosystems affected by DH2010 showed, however, increased summer productivity, possibly because high temperatures in 2010 were still favorable for vegetation growth, especially in higher latitudes ( 9 ). Differences in impacts of summer heat and drought on ecosystems may also be related with different trajectories in water-use efficiency (WUE; i.e., unit of carbon gained through photosynthesis per unit of water lost through transpiration) over the growing season ( 8 ). In DH2003 and DH2010, grasslands and croplands were more strongly hit than forests, because forests have deep-water access, and are also more conservative in the use of water over the growing season ( 9 , 11 , 12 ).

Continental Europe refers to the domain within 32°N and 75°N and −11°E and 65°E.

In the past two decades, Europe has been stricken by major summer heat waves and drought, with heavy impacts on food production, public health, air pollution, and ecosystem carbon uptake ( 1 – 3 ). For instance, the drought-heat events of 2003 and 2010 in central Europe and western Russia, respectively (referred to here as DH2003 and DH2010), broke, at the time, the >500-year-long summer temperature record over the continent ( 1 ). While these events were exceptional at the time, their likelihood will increase in the coming century due to anthropogenic global warming ( 1 ). In 2018, the European summer land temperature anomaly broke the record yet again, although with distinct spatiotemporal patterns ( 4 ). The 2018 summer was characterized by extreme drought in central and northern Europe ( Fig. 1A , referred to, for consistency, as DH2018), with several countries suffering major economic costs from crop failure. Compensations to farmers from crop losses due to drought in 2018 reached €340 million in Germany and €116 million in Sweden ( 5 ).

RESULTS

Features of the 2018 drought and heat event In 2018, Germany, southern Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland registered extreme summer agricultural drought, given by SM anomalies (SM anom ) from the ERA5 reanalysis (see Materials and Methods) in June to August (JJA) (Fig. 1A). Severe drought affected most of central and eastern European countries and Scandinavia. For different definitions of extreme drought (see Materials and Methods), 2018 registered the largest extent affected by extreme drought (24 to 38 Mha) compared to 2003 (20 to 28 Mha) and 2010 (14 to 18 Mha). Severe drought affected 23 to 44 Mha in 2018 compared to 19 to 45 Mha in 2003 and 18 to 38 Mha in 2010. For most regions, severe or extreme summer drought co-occurred with warmer and drier than average summer conditions and increased solar radiation, relative to the 1979–2018 record, although summer temperature anomalies were generally not as strong as in 2003 and 2010 (fig. S1). Record-high summer temperature and radiation and record-low summer rainfall were mainly confined to central Europe (fig. S1). Compared to other years in the 40-year-long record, though, 2018 registered the strongest transition between a wet winter/spring and dry summer/autumn at continental scale (Fig. 1B). At continental scale, DH2003, DH2010, and DH2018 were all preceded by wetter-than-average winters (positive SM anom ) and by sharp decreases in SM from spring to summer. Still, March and April 2018 corresponded to the highest SM anom during 1979–2018, while July to August were comparable to DH2003 and DH2010, and from September onward 2018 had the lowest SM anom on record. Such sharp enhancement in drought conditions during and after late spring 2018 is likely related to the extremely high spring [March-April-May (MAM)] temperature anomalies registered in Germany and Eastern Europe, as well as precipitation deficits—though generally not extreme—along with extremely high solar radiation in Scandinavia and eastern Europe (fig. S2). This extreme spring warming and brightening is a distinctive feature of 2018, higher than the corresponding spring anomalies in the regions affected by DH2003 and DH2010.

Seasonal anomalies in carbon fluxes The spatial distribution of total SM anom simulated by the multimodel ensemble median (MMEM; the median reduces the influence of few outliers) of 11 DGVMs (Materials and Methods) shows good agreement with surface SM anom measured by passive microwave sensors from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite (Materials and Methods) with SM anom patterns (fig. S3). This indicates that the ensemble of DGVMs can overall simulate well the agricultural drought conditions in summer 2018. According to the DGVM MMEM, spring 2018 was associated with positive net biome production (NBP) anomalies (defined positive for above-average CO 2 uptake) over most of Europe of about 5 to 10 gC m−2 month−1 (Fig. 2A). Record-high CO 2 uptake was estimated in several regions in southern (Balkans, Turkey) and northern (western Russia, Scandinavia, and Baltic countries) Europe. In summer, the NBP anomalies were more spatially heterogeneous, with negative NBP anomalies extending over a region encompassing western and central Europe and western Russia registering below average CO 2 uptake (Fig. 2B), but positive NBP anomalies estimated in Scandinavia and in southern Europe. Central Europe and southern Sweden registered record-low sinks, with CO 2 uptake dropping by more than 50% (−30 gC m−2 month−1) but not strong enough to turn ecosystems into absolute sources. Positive NBP anomalies in the south are most pronounced in those regions with wetter summer conditions, while those in the north are collocated with strong drought (Fig. 1A). Fig. 2 Anomalies of CO 2 fluxes during spring and summer 2018. Spatial patterns of NBP anomalies (reference period 1979–2018) during (A) spring (MAM) and (B) summer (JJA) 2018 estimated by the MMEM of 11 DGVMs. A positive (negative) value indicates higher (lower) net CO 2 uptake than the 40-year average. The color map shows the multimodel ensemble mean anomalies, and the stippling indicates those regions with extremely low (rank 40th) or extremely high (rank 1st) values over the reference period. To confirm general DGVM performance, we analyzed satellite-based estimates of satellite vegetation optical depth in the microwave L-band (L-VOD; Materials and Methods). L-VOD standardized changes were calculated from aggregated L-VOD for spring and summer months from 2010 to 2018 (fig. S3) and reflect changes in aboveground biomass carbon. Negative L-VOD changes dominate the region extending from northwestern France to eastern Poland and the Baltic countries, as well as southern Scandinavia, while L-VOD increase is found in central and northern Scandinavia, northwestern Russia, and most of southern Europe. When compared with simulated anomalies for NBP minus soil respiration for the same reference period and the same months, L-VOD changes show good agreement with DGVM estimates (fig. S3). The positive NBP anomalies in spring and summer generally match those of gross primary production (GPP); (fig. S4). In spring, DGVMs estimate widespread GPP increase and record-high values in Scandinavia and southern Europe. These patterns are generally consistent with GPP estimates from the data-driven product FLUXCOM (fig. S5) (16), although FLUXCOM additionally estimates record-high spring GPP in central Germany. In summer, regions with negative (positive) NBP anomalies are associated with below (above) average GPP, and most of the regions with extremely high or extremely low NBP match regions with record GPP anomalies. An exception is found in eastern Europe and Baltic countries, where DGVMs estimate below-average NBP during summer, but enhanced or close to average vegetation productivity. This is due to a strong contribution of total ecosystem respiration (TER) and, to a lesser extent, of fires (fig. S4). FLUXCOM also points to positive GPP anomalies in eastern Europe but in a smaller sector and a larger region with decreased summer TER (fig. S5). These differences suggest a possible oversensitivity of GPP from DGVMs to the alleviation of rainfall deficits during summer in those regions (fig. S1). Our results indicate an asymmetry in the summer carbon flux anomalies, with the northern sector of the drought-affected region showing increased NBP and GPP during summer, while the southern sector registered strong decreases in both variables. This asymmetry may be due to distinct responses of ecosystems to summer warming and drying but also from different legacy effects from spring climate conditions to summer water and carbon fluxes (Materials and Methods). To understand this asymmetry, we divide the region affected by DH2018 in two sectors: R1 (southern sector of DH2018, reduced summer CO 2 uptake) and R2 (northern sector of DH2018, increased summer CO 2 uptake).

Direct and legacy impacts of spring and summer climate to continental net CO 2 uptake Based on the three idealized simulations (reference, S Ref , spring effects, S MAM , and summer effects, S JJA ; see Materials and Methods), we find strong differences between the individual impacts of each season on carbon fluxes (Fig. 3, A and B) and the seasonal anomalies described above (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 Direct and legacy effects of spring and summer climate to DH2018 carbon balance. Spatial distribution of the average net effect of (A) spring climate anomalies direct impact on spring NBP (from S MAM ), (B) summer climate anomalies direct impact on summer NBP (from S JJA ), (C) spring climate legacy effects in JJA (from S MAM ), and (D) relative legacy impact of spring climate to summer NBP anomalies compared to the direct impact of summer climate to summer NBP anomalies. Red colors indicate regions where spring amplified (A) negative summer effects or offset (O) positive summer effects, i.e., spring contributed to a source anomaly by 25 to 100% or more than 100% of the corresponding direct summer effect. Blue colors indicate regions where spring legacy effects offset negative summer effects or amplified positive summer effects, i.e., spring legacy effects contributed to a positive summer NBP anomaly. The regions where spring legacy contributes by less than 25% of the summer-related NBP anomaly are masked in white. See the “Model simulations” section in Materials and Methods for a description of the idealized simulations used to isolate spring and summer direct and legacy effects. The spring-related NBP anomalies (Fig. 3A) largely reflect a positive correlation with temperature and radiation anomalies, with increased uptake confined to central and northern Europe and Turkey. In most of western Europe, DGVMs estimate a direct negative effect of spring climate to NBP (Fig. 3A), in spite of positive spring NBP anomalies (Fig. 2A). By contrast, DGVMs estimate a very strong direct summer-related decrease in NBP over most of Europe (Fig. 3B), including most of Scandinavia where DGVMs estimate positive summer NBP anomalies (Fig. 2A). This means that the spring conditions attenuated the direct effect of summer conditions on the loss of NBP in summer. A positive summer impact was found only in those regions where summer was wetter than average, mostly in southern Europe. Spring legacy effects to summer NBP show regionally distinct patterns (Fig. 3C), which can be summarized in three groups: (i) regions with positive effect of spring climate on spring NBP and positive legacy NBP effects (e.g., Scandinavia, R2), (ii) regions with spring-related increase in NBP being offset by negative legacy effects (e.g., central and eastern Europe, R1), and (iii) regions with negative spring-related effects on spring NBP (weaker sink) offset by positive legacy effects (e.g., western Europe). These results reveal important differences between the spring and summer NBP anomalies (reference simulation and observations) and the individual impact of spring and summer to direct and legacy NBP anomalies (idealized simulations). While the generalized enhancement in spring CO 2 uptake might have contributed to partly offset summer carbon losses in central and western Europe, the mismatch between the NBP anomalies simulated by DGVMs for each season (Fig. 2) and those resulting from the direct impact of each individual season (Fig. 3, A and B) hints that legacy effects from previous seasons might compensate or offset the impact of concurrent climate anomalies during the season considered. We thus evaluate how much spring climate legacy effects (Fig. 3C) contributed to amplify or offset the individual impact of DH2018 (Fig. 3B). In about 75% of the European area, legacy effects from spring climate contributed by 25% or more to offset or amplify the impact of DH2018 on summer NBP (Fig. 3D). In most of eastern Europe, southern Sweden, and southern Finland—the regions marked by strong spring warming and brightening—we find that spring climate anomalies contributed to amplify the negative summer impacts of DH2018 (red colors in Fig. 3D). On the contrary, higher latitude regions are dominated by positive legacy contribution of spring warming to summer NBP anomaly. In the Scandinavian mountains and parts of the Kola Peninsula, spring legacy effects offset a negative summer impact of DH2018 on summer NBP by more than 100% (values larger than 100% indicate an even stronger contribution of spring legacy than of summer direct effects to net source anomalies). In small sectors of Scandinavia (southern Norway and Kola Peninsula) as well as in the Iberian Peninsula, spring legacy effects amplified positive NBP anomalies in response to summer climate by more than 100% (i.e., doubling the sink response). These differences cannot be solely explained by regional differences in climate conditions, as regions with similar climate anomalies (figs. S1 and S2) showed distinct contributions of different direct impacts and legacy NBP responses. As in net CO 2 uptake (Fig. 2B), a north/south asymmetry in spring legacy effects between the southern (R1) and northern (R2) sectors of DH2018 is found. We therefore analyze, in more detail, the dynamics of carbon and water fluxes in these two regions, including direct and legacy effects of spring and summer.","Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/24/eaba2724/F1.large.jpg,"['effects', 'direct', 'summer', 'anomalies', 'european', 'heat', 'wave', 'fig', 'seasonal', 'drought', 'europe', 'climate', 'ecosystem', 'nbp', 'productivity', 'legacy', 'spring']", ,drought

14,14,Drought Sri Lanka,Climate Change: Preparing for Regional Risks - Earth911.com,https://earth911.com/living-well-being/climate-change-preparing-for-regional-risks/,"Climate change touches all parts of the world in uniquely local ways. A string of severe heatwaves took its toll across the globe in 2018, causing deadly wildfires in California, Russia, Sweden, and Greece. The Great Floods of 2019 impacted 14 million people in the United States as the disaster unfolded over months.

Thankfully, 2020 predictions of flooding are milder than the historic events of last year. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecasters do warn of moderate to major flooding in 23 states this year. And the agency expects much of the western U.S. to experience dryer than average conditions, the eastern half of the country is predicted to receive above-average rainfall.

As the U.S. grapples to respond to the coronavirus, people could be more vulnerable to extreme weather events. Social distancing, travel restrictions, a strained medical system, and stay-at-home orders complicate responding to the climate crisis. For example, the American Meteorological Society recommends using public tornado shelters despite, concerns about the coronavirus, if they provide the best shelter available.

Some people might be less likely to seek medical treatment for heat-related illnesses due to concern for contracting the virus.

Climate Change Risks

Although the impacts of climate change are extremely complex, the major effects fall into five categories: extreme heat, drought, wildfires, coastal flooding, and inland flooding. Each effect presents unique risks to human health as well as wildlife, infrastructure, and food production.

To better adapt to changing climate, localized scientific data and historic patterns can help highlight who is at the greatest risk. Keep in mind that the impacts of climate change are varied and encompass anything from air quality to food security. Gaining insights into the local impacts of the climate crisis enables us to better prepared and employ mitigation strategies.

Because the U.S. is a large and geographically diverse country, climate change risks vary considerably by location. This means that wildfires could be raging in California due in part to drought, while crops are drowning in South Dakota.

Awareness of regional risks is one of the best ways to enable people to effectively prepare.

Your Region’s Vulnerabilities

Although climate change affects us all, some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable due to geographic placement. The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch highlights which countries have been the most affected by weather-related loss events and suffer the greatest damage. In 2018, the countries affected most were Japan, the Philippines, Germany, Madagascar, India, and Sri Lanka.

A new study by SafeHome.org using data from Climate Central ranks the states by their risk to the consequences of climate change, creating a climate change risk index. The most at-risk states are Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Mississippi. Meanwhile, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Colorado are at the bottom of the list.

Knowing your region’s climate risks helps you make better decisions. For example, if your area is prone to tidal flooding, exercise caution when purchasing real estate.

Being aware of weather trends in your area can also be helpful for gaining awareness of how climate change impacts your region. NOAA publishes national monthly climate reports as well as status updates on droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, and flooding. They monitor a variety of indicators related to climate and the effects on society and the economy, including a heat stress index, a crop moisture stress index, and a residential energy demand temperature index.

Wildfire-prone States

In 2018, there were more than 58,000 wildfires in the United States. The devastating Camp Fire in Northern California took 85 lives and destroyed almost 14,000 homes.

The states that saw the highest increase in natural disasters were fire-prone states, according to an analysis by QuoteWizard using FEMA data from 1980 to 1999 and 2000 to 2017. The study found that natural disasters have increased by 165 percent nationwide between the two time periods. This is because wildfires are becoming more frequent, deadly, and larger in size.

The states with the greatest increase in natural disasters were western states that are vulnerable to fires. Many areas in the west experience wet winters, followed by hot, dry summers. The wet conditions allow the foliage growth, which fuels the wildfires during the hot, dry summers. Wildfires are more prevalent during dry, warm conditions, thus droughts intensify their probability. Dry conditions, combined with forest management practices to contain forest fires, leave a tinderbox of dense new growth, thick underbrush, and unharvested timber.

In the U.S. alone, 4.5 million homes have a high or extremely high risk of wildfires. Of these, 2 million are located in California. Most of the largest wildfires in California have been caused by humans or power lines. Unfortunately, this makes it more likely that fires occur in more populated areas, increasing fatalities and property damage.

Being aware of ripe conditions for wildfires can allow people to be especially diligent about fire safety, create an evacuation plan, and take precautions.

Mitigating Floods

More than 100 million Americans are at risk of spring floods this year, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. NOAA warns of risks of major flooding in parts of the upper Midwest and moderate flooding from the Northern Plains, though the Missouri Valley, and into the Southeast.

Some basic flood preparedness can help you respond better to this potential threat. Knowing if you live on a floodplain and if local rivers and streams flood easily can help determine your risk.

If you do live on a floodplain, try to elevate and reinforce your home. Raise your furnace, water heater, and electric panel to floors that are less likely to flood. Install check valves to prevent floodwater from backing up into your plumbing system. Construct barriers such as levees and berms to keep water at bay and seal basement walls to keep water from seeping in.

Climate Resilience

To better prepare for the climate crisis, 16 states and two cities are using the five-step Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework to identify likely climate impacts in their communities, potential health effects associated with these impacts, and their most at-risk populations and locations. Awareness of this vital information allows states and municipalities to create adaptation plans and evaluate the impact of mitigation tactics. It allows us to learn about our changing world and how to best respond.

Understanding the impacts of climate change on human health is a very complex topic. The most obvious human impacts of extreme weather events are injuries and even fatalities. But environmental degradation can be the root cause of some greater societal issues, such as forced migration, diseases carried by vectors, and mental health disorders.

The WFP family tragically lost two front line colleagues to COVID-19 over the past few weeks in Yemen and Sudan. We express our heartfelt condolences to their respective families during this extremely difficult time, and we are doing our best to support them. WFP reconfirms its commitment to ensuring a safe environment for our staff whilst delivering the essential assistance required for those who need it most.

There is growing evidence that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to deepen existing hunger amongst vulnerable populations. Ongoing insecurity, the lack of resources, and constrained access to food is worsening food insecurity. A revised global plan will be available by July for discussion with stakeholders- including the donor community. COVID-19 is exacerbating pre-existent regional crises (record global food insecurity & displacement, West Africa, South Africa drought, Insecurity in Middle East, Venezuela, Desert Locust) potentially leading to unprecedented levels of hunger in 2020/2021. Globally, needs-based plans have increased by 18 percent since March for the period of June-December 2020, and are expected to increase further.

A revised global plan will be available by July for discussion with stakeholders- including the donor community.

WFP’s operational analytical group has identified the primary countries of concern which require attention based on heightened food insecurity, scale of operations and operational complexity.

During a World Bank event on 26 May, WFP's Chief Economist highlighted how the pandemic is further exacerbating poverty. The discussion focused on factors that can trigger food supply chain disruptions, the implications of such disruptions on poverty, and the measures that WFP is taking to help countries mitigate the potential effects of this crisis on the world’s poor.

WFP and its partners appealed for urgent funding for Yemen as highlighted during the virtual pledging conference this week. Over 20 million Yemenis are food insecure, with nearly 10 million facing severe hunger and the COVID-19 pandemic risks worsening the situation significantly.

Around half of the country’s health facilities have shuttered and Yemen currently lacks the means to provide life-saving support to the millions displaced by ongoing conflict.

The Czech Republic is facing its worst drought in 500 years, experts said on Wednesday, with its Environment Minister Richard Brabec describing a long period of extremely dry weather as ""simply catastrophic.""

A map presented by the environment ministry showed that just 0.1 percent of the country had a normal level of water in the soil in mid-April while extreme drought was found in 75.4 percent of the country.

""The episode of drought that the country has experienced since 2015 is the worst of the last 500 years,"" Czech scientists and experts affiliated in Intersucho, a specialized data hub focused on drought, said on Twitter.

Drought conditions have persisted since 2015, as temperatures rose and rainfall dwindled.

Last year's drought affected around 99.5 percent of the country, causing crop damage between nine and 11 billion koruna (408-500 million U.S. dollars), according to the Agrarian Chamber.

Farmers across Europe, including those in usually wetter northern regions like Sweden and the Baltic states, also suffered in 2019 from record drought, with many forced to slaughter livestock due to severe shortages of fodder.

Brabec blamed the extreme drought in the Czech Republic ""on the decrease in the volume of precipitation, the increase in the average temperature as well as greater evaporation and a longer growing season.""

He has called an emergency meeting of regional and local officials from across the country for May 12 to draw up a crisis response strategy aimed at ensuring that supplies of drinking water will not be in jeopardy during what is forecast to be yet another dry summer.

Countries in south Asia are bracing themselves for an onslaught of climate disasters, as if managing the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is not enough.

April is the prime month for cyclones to strike India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, while central and southern India are forecast to heat up faster than usual this spring, making heatwaves more likely. Normal to above-average monsoon rainfall could bring floods to parts of the country from June as well.

Careful planning is needed to avoid major damage to crops, homes and infrastructure, while marshalling resources towards limiting the spread of COVID-19.

Cyclones are the most pressing problem: Meteorological forecasts based on satellite technology indicate that a large expanse of northeast India and Bangladesh are set to experience extremely high rainfall and thunderstorms in the coming two weeks.

Notably, a cyclone forecast for May 2, 2020 in the southern part of Bangladesh is likely to have a high impact in coastal cities and potentially further inland too.

Shirish Ravan, who implements the United Nations Platform for Space-based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response, believes space-based technologies can provide critical information ahead of crises on their potential extent and scale of impacts.

A map showing the state of maturity of crops around the world, created by scientists at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and CGIAR Research Program of Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) provides an example.

It shows that extensive areas within the path of the forecast storms in India and Bangladesh are planted with crops. Dark green areas in the map shown below indicate where crops will be ripening in the fields beyond April 23.

Upcoming extreme weather events, including this and the coronavirus pandemic present a host of challenges for governments.

North and northwest states in India, for example, have already struggled to harvest and sell summer wheat, fruit and vegetable crops because of lockdown measures disrupting food production activities.

If the cyclone damages later-ripening crops in more eastern parts, it will place even more pressure on the agricultural sector, and threaten the livelihoods and welfare of poor smallholder farmers, with likely knock-on effects for revenue-raising food exports and food prices.

The number of COVID-19 cases in the parts of India and Bangladesh where the cyclone is set to hit are still relatively low. In other places where extreme events are forecast, however, numbers are higher.

Scientists at IWMI compared a map showing levels of risk from multiple natural hazards (landslide, cyclone, heatwaves, floods and coastal inundation, drought, earthquake, extreme rainfall and forest fire) with the latest plot of COVID-19 cases published by India’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Scientists identified 411 districts in 22 states that have both, higher risks from natural hazards and elevated COVID-19 cases.

Well-thought-out planning for how these districts should manage potential disasters is critical, given that India is currently in lockdown until at least May 3.

Take Maharashtra, for example, where 5,652 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, with 269 reported deaths.

Large parts of the state show a high level of risk for multiple hazards, including heatwaves. The arrival of a heatwave will likely increase the number of people needing hospital treatment at a time when services are already stretched because of the pandemic.

It is a similar story for states likely affected by the monsoon. Bihar — India’s most flood-prone state — will need to prepare a joint response to COVID-19 and flooding, as well as safely housing people whose homes are inundated, without increasing their risk of contracting COVID-19.

This should include financial provision for smallholder farmers who have lost crops.

Insurance is one financial mechanism to consider. Scientists from IWMI, CGIAR Research Program of Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), WLE and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) recently tested a satellite-based insurance scheme in Bihar to compensate farmers in the case of flooding.

Farmers who took part in the scheme shared a total payout of Rs 8 lakh when their crops were damaged during the 2019 monsoon.

In Sri Lanka — where IWMI’s headquarters are located — the monsoon brings rain between May and July. It can sometimes unleash extreme events, including flooding and landslides.

The number of mosquito-borne Dengue fever cases often greatly increases, wherever storm water is released in urban canals.

The western, southern and central regions that the monsoon affects are also worryingly forecast to be the most vulnerable to COVID-19.

Anoja Seneviratne, Director of Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre, urged the country to prepare now for the combined impacts of extreme events and the pandemic, saying thousands of people could be affected.

In the past two decades, more than 750 million people in South Asia have been affected by at least one natural disaster.

Of late, the Disaster Risk Reduction sector has sought to shift disaster-prone countries’ focus from response preparedness, where actions plans are simply put in place to deal with the aftermath of disasters, to disaster risk reduction, where a greater level of resilience is built into communities to make them more able to endure disasters.

With time running out before new climate extremes arrive and collide with the COVID-19 pandemic, IWMI and its partners are making ten recommendations to guide South Asian nations.

Countries need to get ahead of the coming crises by moving quickly on act on these recommendations. Only early action, heavy allocation of resources and smart planning will make sure we can avoid collapse of medical, economic and food systems.

Here are the recommendations for managing climate disasters concurrently with COVID-19:

Integrate multiple hazard and COVID-19 hotspots to inform disaster preparedness and response strategies for monsoon planning

Minimise the burden on hospitals arising from other hazards (by treating COVID-19 patients separately)

Revise standard operating procedures (SOPs) for managing cyclone shelters, with the participation of communities. Incorporate social distancing and provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) in these SOPs

Strengthen capacities and resources for preparing for other hazards. For example, explore the possibility of using schools and colleges (with social distancing) as temporary shelters

Advise disaster response forces on protecting themselves from COVID-19. Establish protocols for their protection and provide personnel with appropriate PPE and psycho-social support

Establish support networks (with social distancing) for providing food and financial relief for the most vulnerable

Put in place provisions for the elderly in disaster-preparedness mechanisms to reduce, or, if possible, eliminate their exposure to COVID-19

Strengthen hospital preparedness, including access to sanitation and quality water, to protect functionality when natural disasters strike

Establish capability for rapid response mapping, incorporating GIS data for hospital and health center locations, connectivity, schools and colleges, and other community facilities. This can include supporting the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team

18,18,Drought Sri Lanka,Thailand's Big Water Challenge – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2020/03/thailands-big-water-challenge/,"Advertisement

Shortages of water are a huge problem for Thailand. The government’s attempts to promote industrial investment in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) — Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao — has caused water demand in the region to rise drastically. This has diverted water away from farmers and local people creating an increasingly unfair distribution of water resources.

Thailand is currently facing its worst drought in 40 years. This drought will exacerbate Thailand’s existing economic pressures through damaging the agricultural sector, particularly Thailand’s main farming activities of sugar, rubber and rice. Based on Bank of Ayudhya’s Krungsri Research, the 2020 drought will cost the country 46 billion Thai baht ($1.5 billion), or 0.27 percent of GDP.

The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) has spent more than 15 million baht ($480,000) supplying water to the EEC by building water storage systems and reclaiming more than 32,000 hectares of land. This has sparked conflict between local people and the state. Water sources in two districts of the Nakhon Ratchasima Province dried up in early January 2020 requiring water from the Lam Ta Khong Dam to be diverted to supply farmers in the area.

Thailand has undergone rapid economic development over recent decades causing huge increases in water demand around the country in all sectors. Increased demand has been accompanied by more droughts and floods due to climate change and deforestation. The Thai government sees the country’s water shortage problem as also being caused by both increased human demand in rural and urban areas and water overuse in many sectors.

The Thai National Water Vision was announced in July 2000 envisaging that by 2025 ‘Thailand will have sufficient water of good quality for all users … that will ensure equitable and sustainable use of water resources.” Thailand will find the complexities and politics of water policy difficult to overcome in the next five years as water demand continues to increase, driven by a growing population and economic growth. Thailand’s adoption of integrated water resource management (IWRM) principles has also faced challenges in implementation, owing to overlapping mandates among Thai institutions.

Thailand has sought to restructure its water management strategy, approving a 20-year national strategy in 2018. The Office of National Water Resources (ONWR) is the new and singular government agency that regulates integrated national water resources management. By 2030, the ONWR plans to provide clean water to over 75,000 villages in 66 areas covering 5.5 million hectares by building more than 541,000 small dams to restore watershed areas at risk due to flood and drought.

The Water Resources Act was approved in January 2018 to streamline water management across 40 government agencies that had previously managed water with overlapping mandates. Despite this restructuring, it is still not clear exactly how these new institutions will be composed and in what ways local people will be involved in water management decisions. Whether or not the effectiveness of water management improves with these changes is an open question.

Multiple actors — local communities, water professionals, universities and government units both at national and local levels — are involved in water management and policy. But not all of those involved have equal power to formulate water policy and reduce water shortages in drought-stricken areas. It is generally the powerless local population who are the first to confront a water crisis directly. They often have the weakest voice and are unable to express their concerns at the policy level.

Local people, farmers and civil society organizations who have experienced a shortage of water, especially in the northeast region of Thailand, observe that water shortages often become a political issue that is used to justify unfair water distribution and access.

Water shortages have also been associated with poverty and inequality. Local people and farmers are the most at risk of water shortages in Thailand but lack the political power to negotiate with other powerful actors who share Thailand’s water. Government agencies also have a paternalistic attitude towards local communities and distrust local authorities and the people.

Water isn’t merely a natural resource. It is also a resource for culture, politics, society and the economy. Implementation of effective water management policies at various levels requires a multifaceted approach taking into consideration the interests of all affected people. Farmers and local people must be provided with technical knowledge about water management. Water-related budgets also need to be distributed in such a way that local people can gain access to water resources and build their own capacity and water supply resilience.

Increased collaboration between water management institutions — local authorities, the RID and other related government units — will benefit farmers and local people and ensure they have fair access to water in the dry season. Increasing the voices and the expertise of local people can secure water rights and ensure inclusive development as local people gain access to water and are able to sustain their livelihoods.

20,20,Drought Sri Lanka,UNDRR Asia-Pacific COVID-19 Brief: Combating the dual challenges of climate-related disasters and COVID-19 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/undrr-asia-pacific-covid-19-brief-combating-dual-challenges-climate-related-disasters,"Less than a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, Category 5 Tropical Cyclone Harold slammed into Vanuatu devastating large parts of this Pacific small island developing state. As several other countries in the Asia-Pacific region enter their cyclone, drought, heatwaves or monsoon seasons, the potential for a repeat of such an ‘unprecedented double disaster’ is increasing. How can countries confront a major climate-related or other disaster on top of ongoing prevention, response, and recovery measures to deal with COVID-19?

This brief, developed by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, Regional Office for Asia-Pacific:

• Builds on early lessons from Cyclone Harold in the Pacific.

• Examines ongoing prevention and preparedness measures at the national and local level in other high-risk countries.

• Provides recommendations on how to address climate and disaster risk in an era of COVID-19.

• Points the way forward with a massively reinvigorated localization agenda.

The brief reflects the interventions and feedback from the 16 April webinar under the same title, which UNDRR co-organized with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

Overview

2019 was a tough year for communities and countries of Asia Pacific in terms of disasters.

More than 68 million people were affected across the region i . Climate-related hazards, many of which have become more unpredictable and extreme due to climate change, were responsible for most of these disasters. For most of the year, disaster prevention efforts remained firmly focused on natural hazards. It was only on the very last day of 2019, when a cluster of pneumonia-like illnesses were reported from Wuhan, China, that attention began to shift to a new risk- managing the threat of what would become a global pandemic.

At an institutional level, government agencies are already stretched thin trying to manage the COVID19 response. Countries like the Philippines, which typically experiences 20 tropical storms of varying strength a year, must now continue with their storm preparedness efforts while ensuring that they contain COVID-19 from spreading further.

The concern of many is that if a similar – or potentially higher – number of people are affected by climate and other related hazards this year, then disaster management capacities across the region risk becoming completely overwhelmed.

Some countries in the region are already experiencing the dual impact of weather hazardinduced disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Earlier this month, Cyclone Harold wreaked havoc across several Pacific Islands, especially Vanuatu (see box). This is on top of a drought that has impacted several north Pacific island states, including Palau, Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands.

Countries in other parts of the region are also struggling with these dual challenges. Since the start of the year, Indonesia has been responding and dealing with the impact of heavy rains, floods and landslides. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, recently reported that over a half million people have been affected by drought over the last three monthsii .

In this midst of these dual challenges, countries must not lose sight of the need to protect the most vulnerable from the impacts of both. Moreover, they need to examine their current preparedness plans to ensure that they are in line with their COVID-19 efforts. Managing such complex risks cannot be done by any single agency but must be a whole-of-government endeavour.","Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1512509-UNDRR%20Asia-Pacific%20Brief_Dual%20Challenges%20of%20Climate-related%20Disasters%20and%20COVID-19.png?itok=Burn1GVX,"['cyclone', 'office', 'dual', 'preparedness', 'challenges', 'climaterelated', 'countries', 'covid19', 'risk', 'brief', 'pacific', 'world', 'undrr', 'combating', 'prevention', 'region', 'asiapacific', 'disasters', 'disaster']", ,flood_and_drought
21,21,Drought Sri Lanka,Thailand Confronts its Triple Disaster in 2020 – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/thailand-confronts-its-triple-disaster-in-2020/,"Advertisement

This year was always going to be a tough one for Thailand, with the government led by Prayut Chan-o-cha trying to manage continuing political and economic challenges following last year’s contentious elections as well as rising domestic discontent that has rocked the country.

But 2020 has seen the concretization of what might be termed Thailand’s triple disaster. The combination of the global coronavirus pandemic, droughts, and choking fires have all combined to create a particularly difficult environment for the Thai government to navigate.

First, COVID-19 has hit the country hard. Though it arrived early in January, with Thailand recording the first known case outside of China, the government dithered in taking steps that would have restricted interactions with China, which contributed to the country becoming among those with the highest recorded cases in the region.

The economic fallout has been palpable. Tourism, a major sector that had already been dipping prior to the suspension of world travel, has been hit hard, while agriculture has been stressed with disruptions in exports. The political fallout could also be great, with COVID-19 only exacerbating the risk that domestic discontent against the Prayut government could lead to another round of political instability in the country.

Second, a devastating, country-wide drought has wreaked anxiety across the national economy. Prolonged droughts across the country had threatened economic disaster well before the emergence of the virus. Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha and his government had sounded the alarm throughout most of last year, including the promise of welfare payments and other forms of assistance for those employed in the agriculture sector. According to Mekong River Commission data published by Voice of America, last year’s monsoon season ended three weeks earlier than usual after starting late exacerbating dry conditions for farmers and stressing water capacity for households.

But a new survey commissioned by the Lower Mekong Initiative and Sustainable Infrastructure Partnership suggests drought conditions could become significantly worse in the coming months as the upstream Mekong is dammed further. The study found that while Thailand and neighboring countries like Cambodia have struggled, the upstream Tibetan Plateau remains lush with capacity. “There was just a huge volume of water that was being held back in China,” co-author Alan Basist told the New York Times.

What impact this data — confirmation of what many reliant on the river for livelihoods no doubt already suspected — has on the future between Mekong states and China is a large question. But for Thailand in the immediate now, it will not be a relief to the dusty, dry agri-business downstream.

Third, choking fires to the north have left millions facing a series of health concerns and only increased the fracturing of trust between Thais living in the villages and cities of the north and leaders in Bangkok. Dry conditions in Northern Thailand are ripe for destructive forest fires around Chiang Mai’s Doi Suthep mountain areas. Local authorities earlier this month ordered much of the forest areas closed to the public following the deaths of three villagers in three separate incidents. Air quality in the city and surrounds has been terrible, registering at “critical levels” across the North of the country for weeks.

Environment Minister Varawut Silpaarcha told reporters late last month that fires had been deliberately set, both by foragers and by others to cause “mayhem.” He also knocked back criticism that the government in Bangkok has largely been absent in the crisis. “To some it seems that we are doing nothing. But we have sent thousands of people to help firefighters in the north. However, the areas in which they are operating in are so large,” he said, as reported by The Bangkok Post.

Local villagers disagree. Representatives from communities within the mountains have told the Bangkok Post that they’ve been tasked with protecting the forests for years, even as the central government “points fingers” and blames those same communities. Another report suggests the number of lives lost in the recent blazes is higher than the official toll, with a reliance on traditional but dangerous back-burning techniques.

The drought, fires and the poor air quality it brings and now the pandemic are a perfect storm of a challenge for the Prayut government. They also disproportionately affect certain population segments regionally and economically, thereby increasing the risk of furthering divisions in the country. While the government has been eyeing several measures including expanding welfare and dispersing cash, it is unclear if these will be adequate to confront the triple disaster that is confronting Thailand in 2020.","Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2015-04-02_18-44-35.jpg,"['fires', 'north', 'mekong', 'told', 'triple', 'political', 'country', 'confronts', 'prayut', 'bangkok', '2020', 'thailand', 'disaster', 'china']", ,drought
22,22,Drought Sri Lanka,When the Indian Ocean’s ancient climate patterns return - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/when-the-indian-oceans-ancient-climate-patterns-return/article31934556.ece,"Formations like the El Niño of the Pacific Ocean could emerge

About 19,000-21,000 years ago, ice-sheets covered North America and Eurasia, and sea-levels were much lower, with Adam’s Bridge exposed so that the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka were contiguous. This period, the peak of ice age conditions, is called the Last Glacial Maximum. Researchers analysed simulations of this past climate and predicted that the ongoing climate change could reawaken an ancient climate pattern of the Indian Ocean.

They find that this could be similar to the El Niño phenomenon of the Pacific Ocean bringing more frequent and devastating floods and drought to several densely-populated countries around the Indian Ocean region. If current warming trends continue, this new Indian Ocean El Niño could emerge as early as 2050. The results were published in Science Advances.

Study on shells

By studying microscopic zooplankton called foraminifera, the team had published a paper in 2019 which first found evidence from the past of an Indian Ocean El Niño. Foraminifera build a calcium carbonate shell, and studying these can tell us about the properties of the water in which they lived. The team measured multiple individual shells of foraminifera from ocean sediment cores and was able to reconstruct the sea surface temperature conditions of the past.

“In the previous paper, we argued for the existence of an ‘Indian Ocean El Niño’ during the Last Glacial Maximum. We suggest that the Indian Ocean has the capacity to harbour much larger climate variability than observed during the last few decades or a century,” writes co-author Kaustubh Thirumalai, from the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona in an email to The Hindu. “In this paper, we argue that this climate variability in the Indian Ocean can arise under increased greenhouse gas forcing of global climate change.”

Lessons to learn

He explains that there are many lessons to be learnt from this cooler period about our warmer future, “even though the Last Glacial Maximum consisted of vastly different conditions compared to where the world is headed... For example, global sea-level is rising and glacial ice is melting today whereas the opposite was true for the Last Glacial Maximum”

Prof. Thirumalai adds: “As it is, under present-day conditions, changes in the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation strongly affect Indian Monsoon variability from year to year. If the hypothesised ‘equatorial mode’ emerges in the near future, it will pose another source of uncertainty in rainfall prediction and will likely amplify swings in monsoon rainfall.”

The paper adds that it could bring more frequent droughts to East Africa and southern India and increased rainfall over Indonesia. The team warns that further work is needed to accurately assess this new mode, particularly under lower-emission scenarios and also taking into account past climatic states other than the Last Glacial Maximum.","Sat, 27 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ngpbfl/article31934555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TH-SCIINDIAN-OCEAN,"['ancient', 'maximum', 'return', 'glacial', 'paper', 'niño', 'climate', 'ocean', 'el', 'oceans', 'conditions', 'patterns', 'variability', 'indian']", ,flood_and_drought

25,25,Drought Sri Lanka,Seizure of Afghan meth on high seas triggers concern - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seizure-of-afghan-meth-on-high-seas-triggers-concern/article31136531.ece,"It indicates trend of the contraband being smuggled out through well-established heroin trafficking route, says official

Tipped off by national drug-enforcement counterparts, the Sri Lankan Navy set out for the high seas in the last week of February and intercepted two trawlers in international waters, more than 1,000 km off the country’s coast. While the operation resulted in the country’s biggest ever drug bust at sea, with the seizure of 400 kg of heroin, what was far more worrying for the region’s drug fighters was that the seized contraband included 100 kg of crystal methamphetamine.

The drug haul was valued at $33.50 million and 16 crewmen, including eight Pakistani nationals, were detained. Initial investigations suggested that the boats came from Pakistan’s Makran coast, with the drugs presumed to have originated in Afghanistan.

Several seizures

Several seizures of Afghan-origin heroin in the high seas of the region have been made in the recent past. Since April 2015, more than 3,700 kg of heroin have been intercepted in India, Sri Lanka and Maldives. Also, 430 kg was intercepted in Mozambique on December 29, 2019, with the detention of 13 Pakistani nationals.

“Heroin seizures are common,” said a senior Indian Customs official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “However, it is the seizure of 100 kg of the methamphetamine that has alarmed the drug enforcement agencies in India and other countries. It is the indication of an emerging trend of meth produced in Afghanistan being smuggled out through an already well-established route for heroin trafficking to different parts of the world,” the official added.

Party drug

Also known as meth, crystal, glass, ice, speed and shards, methamphetamine is a psychostimulant “party” drug. It is much cheaper and highly addictive compared to cocaine. Its effect may last for over 12 hours. In contrast, heroin is a depressant.

In Afghanistan, meth is known to locals as “shisha (glass).” About a decade ago, there were barely any indicators of it being in widespread use in the war-torn country. In May 2009, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)-Kabul and the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan had confirmed a minuscule four-gram seizure in the Helmand province on January 31 that year.

“Nevertheless, with this first seizure, Afghanistan has crossed a worrying threshold,” the UNODC observed in a report. “The manifold challenges of the opium economy have placed a heavy burden on Afghanistan and the rise of methamphetamine consumption/production would be an unwelcome addition,” it added.

Late reaction

Noting that the history of the Golden Triangle (the opium-producing area where the borders of Myanmar, Thailand and Laos meet) demonstrated that meth production could have significant impacts on an opium economy, rapidly transforming a plant-based narcotics challenge into a challenge of tracking large synthetic laboratories, the UNODC said many countries had reacted too late to the development of meth markets.

About eight years later, the UNODC’s first Afghanistan Synthetic Drugs Assessment Report (2017) said meth was available in the country in “small quantities and at relatively high prices.” The usual wholesale price for 1 kg of meth was said to be between $10,000 and $15,000, against the $5,000-$7,000 range for heroin. Prices of “shisha” in Herat, Kabul, Mazar, Nangarhar and other areas were also recorded.

The local user base of meth was on the rise, but there was no data-driven indication of the substance being smuggled overseas. For long it was suspected that synthetic meth was coming from neighbouring Iran, where the drug was introduced from southeast Asia and later produced domestically.

Things changed dramatically after air raids by the United States Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) and the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces on May 6, 2019, when they claimed to have targeted 68 drug laboratories in south-western Afghanistan. Subsequent ground studies unearthed meth labs.

Bulk production

A startling revelation was that the meth in the country was being produced in bulk using ephedrine extracted from a shrub locally known as Oman (Ephedra) growing in the wild in the Afghan mountains, including in Helmand, Ghazni and Wardak.

The shift from use of chemical to plant-based ephedrine for making meth was very recent, in 2018. Proof of the shrub being harvested and transported in huge quantities started emerging. In the third quarter of 2019, more than 900 kg of meth was seized in Afghanistan. However, still there was no clarity on where all the meth being produced in the country was going.

“The huge seizure in Sri Lanka has perhaps cleared the air,” the Customs official observed. “This shift is suspected to have been triggered by the 2018 drought in Afghanistan, in which large tracts of opium [used in heroin production] crops were destroyed. The UNODC report (29 January, 2019) stated that opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan peaked in 2017, after which it declined,” the official added, explaining the move to meth.","Sun, 22 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dopmeh/article31136530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THSRILANKANDRUGBUSTFINAL,"['concern', 'official', 'heroin', 'seizure', 'afghan', 'opium', 'country', 'afghanistan', 'meth', 'kg', 'drug', 'produced', 'seas', 'high', 'triggers']", ,drought
26,26,Drought Sri Lanka,How a team of scientists studying drought helped build the world's leading famine prediction model - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/how-team-scientists-studying-drought-helped-build-world-s-leading-famine-prediction,"How a team of scientists studying drought helped build the world’s leading famine prediction model

The Indian Ocean seemed ready to hit Africa with a one-two punch. It was September 2019, and the waters off the Horn of Africa were ominously hot. Every few years, natural swings in the ocean can lead to such a warming, drastically altering weather on land—and setting the stage for flooding rains in East Africa. But at the same time, a second ocean shift was brewing. An unusually cold pool of water threatened to park itself south of Madagascar, leading to equally extreme, but opposite, weather farther south on the continent: drought.

Half a world away, at the Climate Hazards Center (CHC) of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), researchers took notice. Climate models, fed by the shifting ocean data, pointed to a troubling conclusion: By year’s end, that cold pool would suppress evaporation that would otherwise fuel rains across southern Africa. If the prediction held, rains would fizzle across southern Madagascar, Zambia, and Mozambique at the beginning of the growing season in January, the hungriest time of year. Zimbabwe, already crippled by inflation and food shortages, seemed particularly at risk. “We were looking at a really bad drought,” says Chris Funk, a CHC climate scientist. It was a warning of famine.

The CHC team, led by Funk and geographer Greg Husak, practice what they call “humanitarian earth system science.” Working with partners funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), they have refined their forecasts over 20 years from basic weather monitoring to a sophisticated fusion of climate science, agronomy, and economics that can warn of drought and subsequent famines months before they arise. Their tools feed into planning at aid agencies around the world, including USAID, where they are the foundation of the agency’s Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), which guides the deployment of $4 billion in annual food aid. Increasingly, African governments are adopting the tools to forecast their own vulnerabilities. “They’ve been absolutely key” to improving the speed and accuracy of drought prediction, says Inbal Becker-Reshef, a geographer at the University of Maryland, College Park, who coordinates a monthly effort to compare drought warnings for nations at risk of famine. “Every single group we work with is using their data.”

The forecasts are needed more than ever. From 2015 to 2019, the global number of people at risk of famine rose 80% to some 85 million—more than the population of Germany. Wars in Yemen, Syria, and Sudan are the biggest driver of the spike. Global warming, and the droughts and storms it encourages, also plays a role. The pace and severity of storms and droughts in Africa seem to be increasing, Funk says. “Both extremes are going to get more intense.”

The consequences of drought can be catastrophic, but it is hard to detect. Unlike temperature, rainfall is spotty and local, heavily influenced by terrain. Three important clues that drought is coming—low accumulated rainfall, a lack of soil moisture, and high air temperatures—are difficult to measure from space. Satellites can see when green fields turn brown, but that often comes too late to inform a large-scale aid response. In Africa, researchers cannot rely on data from ground stations, either. Zimbabwe, for example, only has a few weather stations, and sometimes those don't even measure rainfall. This “reporting crisis” is pervasive across the continent; over the past 30 years, the number of stations with usable public data has dropped by 80% to only 600 or so.

Forecasting drought months into the future is even harder. Weather forecasts stretch out only a few weeks. Moving beyond that requires an understanding of large-scale climate patterns that influence weather over months or years. The banner example is the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, a pattern of winds and surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that shifts every few years, altering global weather in myriad ways. Weather in Africa is influenced by other oscillations, including the two Indian Ocean shifts CHC was watching, known as the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole. But the “teleconnections” between the ocean and distant weather patterns are poorly understood, and aid agencies can be leery of relying on them for long-term drought predictions. They want evidence from real-time monitoring that drought is on the way.

Double trouble Two ocean climate patterns have aided predictions of floods and drought across Africa. A swing in the Indian Ocean Dipole pushed warm waters off East Africa, boosting rains there last winter. A shift in the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole left a cold pool south of Madagascar, suppressing rains across southern Africa.

The growing season in southern Africa was still months away when CHC noticed the signs of trouble—plenty of time for it and its partners, including a team of food security analysts in Washington, D.C., to refine their predictions and validate them with local observations. The fieldwork would be led by Tamuka Magadzire, a CHC agroclimatologist based in Botswana whose analysis had shown that conditions in Zimbabwe were already ripe for famine: The previous harvest was weak, shriveled by the lowest rainfall since the early 1980s. The currency was essentially fictional, and the country’s poorest had to devote 85% of their income to food. On visits in the past few years, Magadzire brought along maize for his friends and family. “It’s just been really bad in terms of long dry spells,” he says.

A perfect storm was looming. Through the fall of 2019, Funk and his colleagues at FEWS NET sent a series of escalating warnings to senior officials at USAID. No one wanted to repeat what had happened a decade earlier, elsewhere in Africa. The group’s forecasting record lent credibility to their warnings. But whether their call would be heeded this time would also depend on the strength of the evidence for an impending drought, political will in the United States and elsewhere—and a pandemic that had yet to rear its head.

CHC began with a dream. In 1995, Funk was a smart but directionless consultant working in Chicago for the credit card company Discover; he mined databases of personal information to identify consumers to target with ads. “It was, basically, working for the dark side,” he says. In the dream, he was standing with friends in Lake Michigan, smoking and drinking beer, when he felt the lake tug on his legs. Turning, he saw a tidal wave coming to inundate the city. But his first impulse was to rush to the office and buy stock options. “This dream really freaked me out,” he says. “What kind of person sees the city is going to be destroyed and wants to sell options?” Funk, from an Indiana farm town, recalled how struck he was as a child by Live Aid, the 1985 charity concert for Ethiopia. He needed to make a change. He wanted to make a difference. He quit.

Funk wound up studying geography at UCSB in a group that focused on statistical climatology. He met Husak, another geography graduate student, and James Verdin, a visiting remote-sensing scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The three of them witnessed the record El Niño of 1997–98, in which warm waters from the western Pacific sloshed eastward toward Peru, triggering long-range atmospheric shifts that brought punishing rains to their California campus. El Niños also seemed to suppress rains in southern Africa, so Verdin, who now heads FEWS NET, worked with Funk to see whether greenness measures of maize fell in southern Africa during the 1997–98 event. “It was kind of mixed results,” Verdin says, “but we got it published.”

Verdin encouraged FEWS NET to sponsor Funk’s and Husak's studies. By the time the next El Niño came, in 2002, the UCSB team had compiled scattered rainfall records dating back to 1961 to quantify how El Niño events dried up water resources across southern Africa. USAID used the resulting map and report to respond quickly after the 2002 El Niño, sending some $300 million in food aid. It was the first time the agency incorporated climate forecasts into its food aid, Funk says, and it relieved some of the ensuing famine. “And we're still basically doing the same thing, better, smarter, faster.”

Funk went to work for USGS, but he remains affiliated with UCSB, where he serves as resident provocateur while Husak steers CHC's growing staff. Funk's churning mind keeps them busy, Husak says. “We lift up a lot of rocks and see what's going on underneath them.”

In the 2000s, one of those rocks led Funk back to Africa to study a different teleconnection. He and Alemu Asfaw Manni, a FEWS NET analyst in Ethiopia, gathered historical rainfall data across the country's highlands, where the soil is fertile but rain so scarce that some crops need months to germinate. Most climate models showed East Africa would get wetter with climate change. But since the early 1990s, the team found, the highlands' long rainy season had gone into a steep decline. “This was a holy moly moment,” Funk says. The trend, dubbed the “East African climate paradox,” has held true to this day.

The explanation seems to lie in the ocean. Weather records indicated that many droughts in East Africa seemed to strike during strong La Niñas, El Niño's opposite number, when the western tropical Pacific heats up while the eastern Pacific cools. The UCSB team didn't understand the connection, but by August 2010, another La Niña was brewing in the Pacific. FEWS NET warned that rains across the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia and Somalia, would be late, weak, and erratic.

Politicians and donors largely ignored the alarm. La Niña's threat was poorly understood, different aid groups were issuing disparate warnings, and a degree of crisis fatigue had set in about Somalia, which had been in turmoil for years. But over the next 9 months, the rains failed as predicted. Food prices tripled and malnutrition grew rampant.

In mid-2011, the United Nations finally declared a famine, and USAID ultimately delivered more than 300,000 tons of wheat, high-energy biscuits, and other staples. But the aid came too late and didn't reach enough people. Within the next year, the famine killed 260,000 people in Somalia alone. Half of them were children under the age of 5. As a damning U.N. report later put it: “The suffering played out like a drama without witnesses.”

“It was really, really bad.” Verdin sits in his austere, modern USAID office in Washington, D.C., reflecting on the Somali crisis, now nearly a decade ago. There were extenuating circumstances. Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group, was ascendant, and humanitarian groups feared that if their aid ended up in the wrong hands, the U.S. government might have prosecuted them, he says.

The famine warnings had been accurate—but they had also seemed insufficient. The UCSB team “didn't convey the information as effectively as we could,” Funk says. The loss of weather stations meant their rainfall measures were getting worse, and most satellite-based estimates lacked the detail to show how dry specific crop-growing regions were getting. And their explanation of why La Niña was a threat seemed far too abstract. “You're asking somebody to open up their wallet and spend millions,” Funk says. “They're not just going to do it because you say, ‘Our standardized precipitation forecast is −1.2.’”

The famine forecasters needed better data. In 2015, those dreams came true when CHC released a tool called CHIRPS (which stands for Climate Hazards Center Infrared Precipitation with Station Data). It was the culmination of years of work compiling local rainfall records across Africa and folding in satellite data. Since the late 1970s, a coalition of European countries has maintained geostationary weather satellites over Europe and Africa. Among other things, the satellites measure the temperature of clouds by the infrared light they emit. When the temperature of clouds high in the atmosphere drops below −38°C, it is likely raining lower down. By using this record to fill in rainfall between ground stations, CHIRPS assembled a continentwide rain database stretching back to 1980.

CHIRPS not only provides the historical data for climate researchers to study teleconnections, but it also collects the contemporary data for near–real-time monitoring of rainfall. “It’s quite a step forward,” says Felix Rembold, a drought forecaster at the European Union's Joint Research Centre. It’s also in constant development: Pete Peterson, the CHC coding guru who has spearheaded CHIRPS, often woos local agencies to fill gaps in station coverage. For example, Ethiopia shares data from 50 government stations with CHC—even though its agricultural and meteorological agencies won't share their data with each other.

The data find their way back to Africa as CHC-affiliated field scientists train African agencies on using CHC products. For example, Kenya's Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development has begun to serve up CHIRPS data to help local users forecast rains. Ideally, Funk and company hope to slip into the background, as Magadzire and his peers weave the CHC tools into the fabric of African drought response. Magadzire has had lucrative job offers, but the challenge is too compelling, he says. “My heart is in the improvement of conditions in Africa.”

The long-term rainfall history in CHIRPS has enabled CHC researchers to refine their understanding of the La Niña teleconnection. By comparing global weather records and the predictions of climate models to the CHIRPS records, they have discovered the importance of the “western V,” an arc of hot Pacific water that can appear during a La Niña event. Shaped like a less-than sign, it angles from Indonesia northeast toward Hawaii and southeast toward the Pitcairn Islands, and it forms as La Niña pens warm waters in the western Pacific.

It has far-reaching consequences. As water temperatures spike, energetic evaporation saturates low-level winds flowing west from the cool eastern Pacific. The moist winds dump their water over Indonesia—the wet get wetter. The winds, now high and dry, continue their march west across the Indian Ocean and drop down over East Africa, preventing the intrusion of nearby moist ocean air and breaking up rain clouds. Global warming is strengthening these effects, causing them to linger even after a La Niña fades. And it appears that because of the ongoing ocean warming, they can happen without a La Niña at all, Funk says.

Armed with this new understanding, Funk in May 2016 found himself at USAID headquarters. A strong El Niño had just waned, and sea surface temperature trends suggested La Niña would follow. If it did form, he warned, FEWS NET's food analysts should prepare for sequential droughts in East Africa. A set of new seasonal climate forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration echoed Funk's drought warnings. CHIRPS revealed that the October-December rains had failed. And, seeking to amplify their voices, FEWS NET and its peers at the United Nations and in Europe issued a joint alert, warning of potential famine.

By December of that year, food aid for half a million Somalis arrived. The next month, 1 million; by February 2017, 2 million. Thanks to the shipments and the many improvements East Africans had made in their own safety net, food prices didn't spike when the rains failed again. The warnings had worked.

Four years later, a different teleconnection is playing out, but the picture across Africa is equally grim. In February, in a small UCSB conference room, CHC climate scientist Laura Harrison pulled up a map of Africa. Although there was no El Niño or La Niña to influence events, the two Indian Ocean oscillations she and her colleagues had been watching were going strong.

The blob of hot water off the coast of Somalia turned out to be as hot as it's ever been, a half-degree warmer than a similar state in 1997. CHC had been right to forecast extensive rains in the Horn of Africa: Moist winds from the blob fueled drenching storms. The resulting flooding and landslides ruined 73,000 hectares of crops and killed more than 350 people. The storms also saturated arid regions, feeding lush growth that lured an unpredicted hazard to the region: a locust invasion. Hundreds of billions of locusts have chewed through rich farmland in Ethiopia's Rift Valley, while stripping pastures in Kenya and Somalia.

The blob of cold water south of Madagascar was doing the opposite. Just as the team expected, it had dried up rains across southern Africa. On Harrison's screen, CHIRPS data showed a red blob of anomalous dryness across Zimbabwe—rainfall was running 80% below average for the season. Short-term forecasts called for some rain, but it looked like it would come too late, Harrison said. “The crop has failed in a lot of those areas.”

On the phone from Botswana, Magadzire agreed. He had spent the day training people to use FEWS NET products, and his visiting Zimbabwean students reported lines for maize that lasted hours. To buy it, farmers were selling emaciated cows for a fraction of their value. “There is actually a huge shortage,” he said. In a few days, after the team hashed out its evidence, he'd argue the same to the FEWS NET social scientists who would integrate the data with economic and security analysis.

At the end of the month, FEWS NET staff compared their monitoring with that of their peers at the United Nations and Europe. The combined forecasts would go into the Crop Monitor for Early Warning, a monthly update provided by the University of Maryland that the G-20 group of rich nations began several years ago to unify famine warnings. Already, in response to previous reports, USAID had more than doubled its food aid to Zimbabwe, to $86 million. But even this increase may not be enough.

On 2 April, FEWS NET sent out a rare alert, stating crisis conditions were likely in southern Africa from April to August. Maize supplies would be short, with prices 10 times their normal level. By that time, another danger had arrived: the coronavirus pandemic. The resulting lockdowns in Zimbabwe and its neighbors could exacerbate risks for the neediest, putting them out of work and unable to afford maize. By the end of this year, FEWS NET warned, Zimbabwe could find itself in emergency conditions—one step away from famine.

Reflecting on his time at CHC, Funk is proud of his team and how it has tried to lessen the toll of famines. But he is clear-eyed about a problem that isn't going away—and may be getting worse, for reasons other than natural cycles. For the past 5 years, during a time of global economic growth, famine threats were still rising, Funk points out. Now, the coronavirus pandemic has the world teetering on recession. He worries that climate change will only exacerbate the inevitable conflicts over stressed croplands. “At the end of the day,” Funk says, “humanitarian crises are caused by humans.”","Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ma_0417_Drought_groundwater_farming_1280x720_0.jpg?itok=JOvaalJh,"['funk', 'leading', 'studying', 'helped', 'prediction', 'worlds', 'net', 'africa', 'weather', 'chc', 'model', 'climate', 'rains', 'drought', 'team', 'ocean', 'famine', 'data', 'scientists']", ,flood_and_drought

Drought “is the death of the earth,” wrote the poet T. S. Eliot. A lack of water withers crops, kills trees, and dries up streams and lakes. Humans have long tried to cope by migrating to wetter regions or inventing new ways of moving water to where it is needed, including by pumping it out of the ground. But as human populations grow, climate change takes hold, and groundwater supplies shrink, droughts pose an increasingly complex challenge to people and the environment.

This special issue examines the science and social impacts of droughts—past, present, and future. Review articles assess our current knowledge of the causes of drought and consequences for forests and soils, how drought relates to political conditions, and options for improving drought resistance in crops. Additionally, three News Features highlight drought's influence on the rise and fall of an ancient South American empire, California's efforts to restore its depleted groundwater, and researchers' methods for predicting the famines that droughts sometimes bring.

Drought is defined by the absence of life-giving water. Some scholars believe that the forbidding presence of a drought that struck the United Kingdom in 1921 helped inspire Eliot's repeated allusions to water and drought in his poetry. That year, less than 260 millimeters of precipitation—one of the lowest levels ever recorded—fell in parts of England, prompting the writer to reflect on a natural force that has long shaped our planet.","Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6488/F1.medium.gif,"['dry', 'times', 'droughts', 'water', 'drought', 'crops', 'long', 'groundwater', 'south', 'writer', 'soils', 'wrote']", ,drought

Timor-Leste faces particularly acute climate challenges as an isolated, poor, and dry nation. Water remains scarce, intensifying public health concerns amid the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. International organizations have long supported efforts to build public health capacity and climate resilience in Timor-Leste. One such effort includes World Neighbors’ Increasing Community Resilience Program (ICRO), which focuses on proper water management in the Timorese region of Oecusse. To better understand these efforts, The Diplomat’s senior editor, Ankit Panda, spoke to Edd Wright, who oversees World Neighbor’s projects in Timor-Leste and Indonesia.

What are the major climate change risks for Timor-Leste?

Timor-Leste is increasingly being affected by severe weather events as a result of climate change. In the region of Oecusse, where World Neighbors works, this is seen mostly prominently in the form of short periods of intense rainfalls (which cause landslides and flooding), interspersed with longer periods of hot, dry weather, which can cause droughts. Rains are generally arriving later, and stopping earlier. This can have a very negative impact in Timor-Leste because around 90 percent of Timorese households are involved with agriculture. With little irrigation, the majority of the people rely on rain-fed agriculture for their food security and livelihoods.

Water constraints for Timor-Leste are an acute problem and a priority for the government. What is the source of the issue and how is the government managing the challenge?

Small island nations in the Pacific like Timor-Leste rely on groundwater to compensate for freshwater shortages due to increasing consumption. But higher temperatures, rising sea levels, erratic rainfall, and drought are affecting both the quality and quantity of available groundwater.

Deforestation is also a problem in Timor-Leste. This loss of forest cover negatively impacts the capacity of the soil to absorb water and recharge springs on which rural communities rely for their water needs.

One of the ways the government is managing this challenge is by partnering with World Neighbors, on the Increasing Community Resilience in Oecusse Program (ICRO), which is funded by the United States Government’s United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which promotes sustainable practices in water and environmental conservation. (Editor’s Note: Wright does not speak on behalf of the United States Government or USAID.) We improve and protect community water sources (mountain springs or wells) through the use of micro-watershed management technologies and a community-based natural resources management approach.

At the practical level, this is done through tree planting, digging absorption wells, water catchment holes, hedgerow terraces, water traps, and other appropriate micro-watershed management technologies around the water sources, to increase rainwater absorption and reduce run-off and loss of water. At the governance level, we work with the government to draft and enact bylaws to protect and maintain these water sources.

How has the country responded to the COVID–19 pandemic?

I’m not a public health expert so I’m not able to answer this question with any degree of certainty.

I can say though that the government called a State of Emergency early, which included closing the borders to foreigners and mandating isolation for a minimum of 14 days for Timorese returnees; restricting internal travel and prohibiting gatherings of more than five people.

As of May 22, Timor-Leste currently has no active COVID-19 cases. The last confirmed case was recorded on April 24, bringing the total number of cases to 24, all of whom have now recovered.

Tell us a little bit about the Increasing Community Resilience Program. How has ICRO affected public health outcomes?

The Increasing Community Resilience in Oecusse Program (ICRO) is funded by the United States Government’s United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by World Neighbors (WN).

The goal is to improve the health status and quality of life of Timorese citizens by increasing the availability and use of clean, safe water, improving sanitation facilities, and enhancing the uptake of improved hygiene practices.

On the physical level, this means creating a well-functioning water supply source/piping system. Around the water point, 1 to 1.5 hectares of land are converted into a forested, protected conservation area.

At the governance level, this means that both the water supply system and the conservation area are being managed by community groups who can independently maintain the area and water system; are financially responsible in collecting and managing community funds; and have a close relationship with the regional forestry and water and sanitation government departments, requesting and receiving assistance when needed.

In an assessment we carried out:

88 percent of respondents reported that their water was now cleaner.

75 percent of respondents reported that the quantity of water had increased.

96 percent of respondents said that they boil water before consuming. This is up from 78 percent from the baseline study taken at the start of the project.

There was an increase in knowledge on the critical handwashing times.

Respondents who had children under 5 reported that only 13 percent of these children had had diarrhea in the previous two weeks. This is down from 28 percent from the baseline study.

Which governments and international development organizations are most active in assisting the Timor-Leste government to increase resilience against climate and other shocks?

I’m sure there are many. I’ve had contact with: Wateraid, UNICEF, Plan International, DFAD (Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade), World Vision International, and the Timor-Leste Red Cross.

29,29,Drought Sri Lanka,Thailand's water shortage and inequality crisis - East Asia Forum,https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2020/03/20/thailands-water-shortage-and-inequality-crisis/,"Author: Kanokwan Manorom, Ubon Ratchathani University

Shortages of water are a huge problem for Thailand. The government’s attempts to promote industrial investment in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) — Chon Buri, Rayong and Chachoengsao — has caused water demand in the region to rise drastically. This has diverted water away from farmers and local people creating an increasingly unfair distribution of water resources.

Thailand is currently facing its worst drought in 40 years. This drought will exacerbate Thailand’s existing economic pressures through damaging the agricultural sector, particularly Thailand’s main farming activities of sugar, rubber and rice. Based on Bank of Ayudhya’s Krungsri Research, the 2020 drought will cost the country 46 billion Thai baht (US$1.5 billion), or 0.27 per cent of GDP.

The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) has spent more than 15 million baht (US$480,000) supplying water to the EEC by building water storage systems and reclaiming more than 32,000 hectares of land. This has sparked conflict between local people and the state. Water sources in two districts of the Nakhon Ratchasima Province dried up in early January 2020 requiring water from the Lam Ta Khong Dam to be diverted to supply farmers in the area.

Thailand has undergone rapid economic development over recent decades causing huge increases in water demand around the country in all sectors. Increased demand has been accompanied by more droughts and floods due to climate change and deforestation. The Thai government sees the country’s water shortage problem as also being caused by both increased human demand in rural and urban areas and water overuse in many sectors.

The Thai National Water Vision was announced in July 2000 envisaging that by 2025 ‘Thailand will have sufficient water of good quality for all users … that will ensure equitable and sustainable use of water resources’. Thailand will find the complexities and politics of water policy difficult to overcome in the next five years as water demand continues to increase, driven by a growing population and economic growth. Thailand’s adoption of integrated water resource management (IWRM) principles has also faced challenges in implementation, owing to overlapping mandates among Thai institutions.

Thailand has sought to restructure its water management strategy, approving a 20-year national strategy in 2018. The Office of National Water Resources (ONWR) is the new and singular government agency that regulates integrated national water resources management. By 2030, the ONWR plans to provide clean water to over 75,000 villages in 66 areas covering 5.5 million hectares by building more than 541,000 small dams to restore watershed areas at risk due to flood and drought.

The Water Resources Act was approved in January 2018 to streamline water management across 40 government agencies that had previously managed water with overlapping mandates. Despite this restructuring, it is still not clear exactly how these new institutions will be composed and in what ways local people will be involved in water management decisions. Whether or not the effectiveness of water management improves with these changes is an open question.

Multiple actors — local communities, water professionals, universities and government units both at national and local levels — are involved in water management and policy. But not all of those involved have equal power to formulate water policy and reduce water shortages in drought-stricken areas. It is generally the powerless local population who are the first to confront a water crisis directly. They often have the weakest voice and are unable to express their concerns at the policy level. The ‘Mekong-Loei-Chi-Mun River Management and Diversion’ — opposed by Thai Puan villagers in Loei province who were never fully consulted about the project — is just one example in the Northeast region.

Local people, farmers and civil society organisations who have experienced a shortage of water, especially in the Northeast region of Thailand, observe that water shortage often becomes a political issue that is used to justify unfair water distribution and access.

Water shortage has also been associated with poverty and inequality among water users. Local people and farmers are the most at risk of water shortage in Thailand but lack the political power to negotiate with other powerful actors who share Thailand’s water. Government agencies also have a paternalistic attitude towards local communities and distrust local authorities and the people.

Water isn’t merely a natural resource. It is also a resource for culture, politics, society and the economy. Implementation of effective water management policies at various levels requires a multifaceted approach taking into consideration the interests of all affected people. Farmers and local people must be provided with technical knowledge about water management. Water-related budgets also need to be distributed in such a way that local people can gain access to water resources and build their own capacity and water supply resilience.

Increased collaboration between water management institutions — local authorities, the RID and other related government units — will benefit farmers and local people and ensure they have fair access to water in the dry season. Increasing the voices and the expertise of local people can secure water rights and ensure inclusive development as local people gain access to water and are able to sustain their livelihoods.

Now, the state hopes to refill its aquifers - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/droughts-exposed-california-s-thirst-groundwater-now-state-hopes-refill-its-aquifers,"Droughts exposed California’s thirst for groundwater. Now, the state hopes to refill its aquifers

California’s Central Valley—one of the richest agricultural regions in the world—is sinking. During a recent intense drought, from 2012 to 2016, parts of the valley sank as much as 60 centimeters per year. “It isn’t like an earthquake; it doesn’t happen, boom,” says Claudia Faunt, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. But it is evidence of a slow-motion disaster, the result of the region’s insatiable thirst for groundwater.

For decades, farmers have relentlessly pumped groundwater to irrigate their crops, draining thick, water-bearing clay layers deep underground. As the clays compress, roads, bridges, and irrigation canals have cracked, causing extensive and expensive damage. In 2014, when NASA scientists flew radar equipment over the California Aqueduct, a critical piece of water infrastructure, they found that one section had dipped 20 centimeters over 4 months. Such sagging can leave canals carrying less water—an “ultimate irony,” says Graham Fogg, a hydrogeologist at the University of California (UC), Davis, because they were built in part to slacken demand for groundwater. Excessive pumping also jeopardizes water quality, as pollutants accumulate within groundwater and the clays release arsenic. Worst of all, the persistent pumping means that, one day, aquifers might run out of usable water. “If you pump too hard,” Fogg says, “you’re playing with fire.”

Now, California has launched a landmark effort to save its groundwater. In 2014, deep in drought, the state passed a law to protect its aquifers; since then, local water managers have developed sustainability plans for those deemed the most imperiled. The plans for some particularly hard hit regions, just released for public comment, call for ending the groundwater deficit mainly by allowing precipitation to refill aquifers, but also by curtailing demand. The state is funding scientists to gather better data on the crisis; researchers estimate that in the Central Valley, half of the aquifers are dangerously depleted, but they don’t know the extent of the damage. Meanwhile, geologists are working to identify the best places to replenish aquifers by flooding farm fields, including some with especially permeable geology.

Groundwater science is taking on a new urgency as California and other regions around the world face growing threats from drought—and are increasingly drilling wells to make up for missing rain and snow. Globally, aquifers are “highly stressed” in 17 countries that hold one-quarter of the world’s population, according to the World Resources Institute. Water and food supplies for billions of people are under threat.

California is a case study in the challenges of protecting those resources. Farm interests, which use the most groundwater, often resist limiting withdrawals, whereas environmentalists demand more water be returned to rivers and the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta; the first lawsuit challenging California’s sustainability plans was filed last month. Demand for groundwater is growing where farms have expanded into areas with little surface water. Across the state, climate change is making precipitation less reliable. “A lot of people are looking to California to see how the law plays out,” says Ellen Hanak of the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC). The hope, she adds, is “there’s just so much local innovation in California that it can be a model for folks elsewhere.”

California once served as a global model for another type of innovation: massive water projects. Los Angeles and other cities clamored for more water than they could get locally. The San Joaquin Valley in the southern Central Valley, the state’s largest and most lucrative agricultural zone, had fertile soil and plenty of sunshine, but never enough water. Farmers had to make do with what nature provided—and what they could pump from the ground.

In the 1930s, the federal government began to build a network of dams, pipelines, and canals that moved water from the state’s wetter north to farms in its semiarid south. Local projects sent water to urban centers. With the taps turned on, California’s farms and cities flourished.

But the imported water didn’t relieve the pressure on groundwater for long. Thanks to rural electrification, more farmers could pump as much as they wanted. There were no regulations, no limits. And pumps have become ever more powerful, with the best able to guzzle up to 5000 liters per minute from aquifers. Now, in a wet year, about 40% of the water used in the state comes out of the ground; during a drought, the proportion swells to 60%. In some farming areas, the dependence is even greater during dry years (see map).

California drying NASA’s GRACE satellites detect the gravitational pull of water masses in aquifers, reservoirs, and snowpack. In 2014, GRACE data showing water loss (below, red indicates loss) helped dramatize the draining of aquifers and galvanize state lawmakers to protect groundwater. 2002 2005 2008 2011 2014 2017 Change in groundwater storage (km³) 8 6 4 2 0 0 –2 –4 –6 –8 –10 –12 0 13 Wetter conditions Groundwater used in 2014 (km³) Groundwater as % of total water used Wet year 2011 Drought 2014 Drier conditions 29% 38% 18% 74% 30% 11% 12% 65% 8% 20% 90% 39% 19% 21% 75% 5% 24% 25% 54% 81% San Joaquin Valley region San Joaquin Valley region Tallying groundwater losses A thirsty valley Subtraction outraces addition California’s north receives abundant precipitation, so it relies less on groundwater during droughts than the drier farmland of the San Joaquin Valley to the south (left).

Rates of groundwater extraction are unsustainable in many parts of the state, says Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan. During wet years, enough water from rain and gushing streams sinks into the ground to partially refill aquifers, he says, but levels can fall even lower during the next drought. “It’s like a tennis ball bouncing down the stairs, it’s just going in one direction,” Famiglietti says.

The trend became especially worrisome during the 2012–16 drought. In the San Joaquin Valley, deep irrigation wells lowered groundwater levels—already 250 meters below the surface in places—putting it out of reach of shallower wells that provided thousands of people with drinking water. Elsewhere, environmental groups feared that springs, streams, and rivers would run dry as groundwater levels fell.

In response, state legislators introduced proposals to regulate groundwater withdrawals. The bills were fiercely opposed by farm groups, which worried about declining land values. But the push gained momentum from new satellite radar images that dramatically depicted the state’s subsidence problems. “The images really drew attention to a system that’s out of balance,” says Rosemary Knight, a geophysicist at Stanford University.

Lawmakers were also alarmed by images of water loss (above) from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), which surveys surface and groundwater by measuring how its mass tugs on a pair of satellites. GRACE measurements, combined with other data, indicated that in 2010 Central Valley aquifers held 20 cubic kilometers less water than they had in 2003.

The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which became law in September 2014, was “an incredible step” for a state that had long resisted groundwater regulation, Famiglietti says. But it only requires California’s some 260 groundwater sustainability agencies (new organizations set up under the law, often made up of local water districts) to stabilize, not to increase, groundwater levels. And it allows increased pumping if needed during drought, as long as no major problems result. Still, the law has forced a statewide rethink of groundwater policies. In January, the new agencies in 21 basins deemed critically overdrawn had to submit plans for achieving groundwater “sustainability” within 20 years. (Other agencies must submit their plans by 2022.)

The push to develop the plans has, in places, revealed an astounding lack of data. Many districts, for instance, aren’t sure how much water is being removed from the ground because California doesn’t require all pumps to have meters. (Local rules or court orders require metering in some basins to help resolve disputes.) In the absence of hard data, researchers have for years estimated flows by examining electricity records—groundwater pumps are energy hogs—and by mapping the extent and types of irrigated crops. Information on subsidence is also helpful. “It’s pretty amazing,” says hydrogeologist Andrew Fisher of UC Santa Cruz. “We’re in a position now of not knowing what a lot of the big groundwater flows are or how they vary.”

Reducing pressure on groundwater isn’t easy or quick. One obvious tactic is to reduce demand. Some parts of California have lessened their reliance on groundwater by incentivizing efficiency and imposing requirements such as water-saving showerheads and toilets. Planting water-efficient crops helps—grapes and young almond trees use much less water than alfalfa, for example. So does leaving fields fallow, a strategy farmers have used to cope with past droughts.

But for some parts of California, such measures aren’t practical, in part because of a massive expansion of profitable vineyards and orchards—tree nut acreage alone increased 85% between 2008 and 2018. The groves and vineyards cannot be fallowed like other fields, although they can survive with less water than normal. And farmers are reluctant to rip them out, because they are expensive to plant, can take years to mature, and have relatively long life spans.

Still, researchers say truly protecting groundwater in California will require cutbacks in agriculture, which on average makes up about 80% of commercial and residential consumption. To stabilize groundwater in the San Joaquin Valley, farmers will likely have to reduce irrigated cropland by more than 200,000 hectares, or 10%, according to a 2019 report from PPIC. Not surprisingly, such prospects worry farmers across the state, says Chris Scheuring, a water lawyer with the California Farm Bureau Federation. “We are absolutely hoping for mitigated outcomes that get us to sustainable management without causing a lot of pain.”

To slow the rate of depletion with less pain, a few districts are counting on proven methods for recharging aquifers. For decades, some water districts have filled dedicated ponds in wet years so that the water percolates into the ground. Others flood farm fields when water is plentiful. Vineyards can tolerate spring flooding, and some crops, like alfalfa, do well with flood irrigation. Building culverts and berms to move and hold the water can be expensive, however. In urban areas, where land is scarce or the upper layers of sediment or rock aren’t very permeable, officials pump water into the ground instead of removing it.

To expand such practices, researchers have been searching for areas ripe for recharge, based on factors such as soil type, land use, and aquifer geology. A UC Davis team identified 1.5 million promising hectares by reviewing existing data, they reported in California Agriculture in 2015. Some of the best places are valleys, now buried, that once existed in the Central Valley and were filled with coarse sediments during the last ice age. These sweet spots may be able to drain 60 times as much water as average sites, Fogg says. Researchers have discovered just three of these buried valleys, but Fogg says many others must exist given the region’s geological history.

Knight is using geophysical techniques to find such promising recharge areas. A helicopter-mounted instrument sends electromagnetic signals into the ground, measuring the electrical properties of buried sediment to create 3D maps of geologic formations that are as much as 300 meters deep. After that, smaller devices can be towed through fields or orchards for higher resolution images. The maps can help managers identify areas where water will quickly soak in—avoiding ponding that can lead to crop diseases or undermine trees.

The maps also show where water is most likely to reach deep layers where pumping is causing subsidence. “The level of complexity that we’re capturing is amazing,” Knight says. California’s water resources agency recently committed $12 million to using the helicopter-mounted system in groundwater basins throughout the state.

Restoring groundwater could become even more important because of climate change. The state has long relied on abundant mountain snow to provide a reliable, year-round source of surface water. Its many reservoirs were designed to fill with snowmelt by July, and then release the water to satisfy the peak demand during the hot summer. But because of a warming trend, the annual snowpack is already becoming thinner and melting sooner. And climate scientists predict more and more precipitation in California will fall as rain, rather than as snow in the mountains. All that means reservoirs will fill sooner and water will have to be released earlier in the spring, before it’s needed. In the summer, farmers would likely have to rely even more heavily on groundwater.

To adapt to that future, officials are pondering a new arrangement in which dam operators would release water ahead of rainstorms. That would make room for the storm water, and the discharge would allow downstream sites to put more into the ground. The idea sounds simple, but involves significant changes in regulations, operations, and in some cases infrastructure, Fogg says. Still, several pilot projects are underway. In the American River watershed, a flood control agency wants to retrofit some upper reservoirs. If the strategy is implemented there and in an adjacent Sierra Nevada river basin, Fogg and colleagues estimate about one-third of a cubic kilometer of water could be stored underground each year. That’s 10% to 25% of the annual statewide deficit, Fogg says.

Recharge water that comes from mountain reservoirs often has high quality. But a different source, stormwater runoff from urban or managed landscapes, could pose a problem: preventing contaminants—including farm fertilizers—from seeping into groundwater. Fisher has been studying ways to remove certain contaminants by adding biomatter such as wood mulch and almond shells to the soil at recharge sites. His team has found that the materials can promote the growth of microbes that remove nitrate, a common pollutant. “If we’re going to be putting hundreds of thousands or millions of acre feet of water in the ground every year, we should be taking every opportunity to make that water cleaner on the way in,” Fisher says.

Recharge isn’t the whole solution. In the San Joaquin Valley, scientists estimate recharge alone can eliminate, at best, just 25% of the groundwater deficit—in part because there is so little surface water to begin with in the region. So, any additional savings will likely have to come from reduced pumping, with its political challenges, as well as shifting water to the most productive croplands while leaving others uncultivated. That will require new canals and other infrastructure, and a new level of coordination. Across the state, multiple government and private entities will need to work together on managing supply and demand at the scale of entire basins, in order to minimize the economic cost of using less water. “There has to be policy innovation or financial innovation to get people to move away from this myth that we still have an unlimited groundwater supply and that we’re just never going to hit bottom,” Famiglietti says.

Bridget Scanlon, a hydrologist at the University of Texas, Austin, is optimistic that innovation will occur. “California has opportunities to move towards more sustainable management, and I think they are,” she says. Fogg is hopeful, too, but adds a cautious note. “Civilization has never been very successful at controlling water demand,” he notes.

Luckily, California’s recent winters have provided enough precipitation to allow aquifers to recover a bit. The state may not find out whether it learned the lessons of the last drought until the next one.","Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ma_0417_Drought_groundwater_aquaduct_1280x720.jpg?itok=xXLSpMYQ,"['state', 'exposed', 'californias', 'san', 'ground', 'thirst', 'droughts', 'water', 'refill', 'hopes', 'groundwater', 'valley', 'california', 'joaquin', 'aquifers', 'fogg']", ,flood_and_drought
33,33,Drought Sri Lanka,Shrewd water use helped South America's first empire thrive. So why did a drought destroy it? - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/shrewd-water-use-helped-south-america-s-first-empire-thrive-so-why-did-drought-destroy,"Shrewd water use helped South America’s first empire thrive. So why did a drought destroy it?

When Wari colonists arrived in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru some 1400 years ago, people already living there were likely nervous. The Wari state, with its capital city of Huari high in the Andes near what is now Ayacucho, Peru, had been expanding its reach. The Wari takeover was violent in places; the invaders sacrificed local people and displayed their heads as trophies.

But this time the Wari colonists did something unexpected. Rather than trying to seize the fertile valley floor, where people already lived, the newcomers occupied high, dry land that no one else had figured out how to use. They constructed their government and religious buildings on top of a high mesa, now called Cerro Baúl, and erected canals and aqueducts that carried water much farther than any previously attempted in the valley. They carved mountain slopes into agricultural terraces, which efficiently trapped and distributed water from rain and snowmelt to plots of maize, quinoa, and peppery berries called molle. People from several other regions moved to the new farms and towns, forming a powerful labor force that helped maintain the sprawling water infrastructure.

Remote Cerro Baúl is home to some of the best preserved Wari canals and terraces, but the remains of their sophisticated water infrastructure have been found in both the Wari heartland and in several of the state’s many colonies, including around the Wari center of Pikillacta near present-day Cuzco and in the Huamachuco region, more than 700 kilometers to the north of Huari. Such innovative hydraulic engineering enabled Wari—which some scholars argue was South America’s first empire—to expand and thrive for some 400 years despite an often dry, drought-prone climate, recent studies suggest. (Archaeologists refer to this state as “Wari,” not “the Wari,” similar to the names of modern nations like Peru or France.) Wari colonists and those who joined their community were able to “settle empty zones and make them productive,” says Donna Nash, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Archaeologist Patrick Ryan Williams of the Field Museum calls the Wari strategy “conquest by hydraulic superiority.”

Those studying the Wari state’s rise and fall, however, confront a puzzle. Its end, about 1000 years ago, appears to have coincided with a severe drought. Across history, the pattern might seem familiar; other ancient civilizations, including the Classic Maya and the Old Kingdom of Egypt, appear to have collapsed in a time of drought. But how could drought have doomed Wari, a society that had been built on learning to take maximum advantage of limited water, and had seemingly even expanded through previous dry spells? To find an answer, researchers are trying to reconstruct two intricate, fragmented narratives—the human and the environmental—and weave them together. The history of climate “in the Andes is extremely complicated,” says Benjamin Vining, an environmental archaeologist at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. “And the only thing more complicated is human behavior.”

The Wari homeland around today’s city of Ayacucho is dry, like much of Peru. It sits just 200 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean but nearly 3000 meters above sea level, nestled in the Andes, and the vast majority of precipitation in South America falls far to the east, over the Amazon rainforest. As a result, Peru’s mountains and coast depend on rivers fed by mountaintop glaciers, plus what little precipitation falls. “That means water is one of the most valuable commodities,” Williams says.

Conditions in the Andes were at least as harsh around 600 C.E., when Wari was expanding beyond the Ayacucho region, recent and ongoing research suggests. Broxton Bird, a paleoclimatologist at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, is now analyzing a sediment core—drilled from Lake Pumacocha about 250 kilometers north of Ayacucho—that shows cool and relatively dry conditions between 475 and 725 C.E. Those data support evidence of aridity from another high-resolution record preserved in a mineral deposit (called a speleothem) from Huagapo Cave, also in the central Peruvian Andes, he says.

Such dry periods certainly stressed prehistoric communities—sometimes intensely, if they tipped into regional droughts. But for Wari, they also appear to have led to innovation, including new and better ways of storing, moving, and using precious water. Their canals were far longer and sturdier than any that came before, and although some other cultures had used agricultural terraces, Wari massively scaled up the technology and brought it to new regions. “In a moment of crisis, they came with the solution,” says Francesca Fernandini, an archaeologist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP). Those technologies likely gave Wari colonists a strategic advantage—and a way to expand into new territories.

Wari’s expansion was not always peaceful, however. Wari art often depicts warriors, notes archaeologist Tiffiny Tung of Vanderbilt University. And strontium isotopes preserved in trophy heads uncovered in the Wari heartland site of Conchopata show the victims grew up elsewhere, evidence that Wari warriors captured and sacrificed people from faraway lands, she says. People buried at Conchopata also show more head trauma than people buried in communities controlled by other Andean cultures that existed before and at the same time as Wari.

At first, the Moquegua valley seemed likely to yield signs of a violent Wari takeover. Cerro Baúl was essentially a border outpost, butting up against territory occupied by colonists from Tiwanaku, another expansive Andean state that had its capital near Lake Titicaca in what is now northern Bolivia. But when researchers examined bodies from Tiwanaku cemeteries in the Moquegua area, they found that those buried after Wari colonists arrived showed no signs of increased violence. Instead, the valley’s peoples—Wari, Tiwanaku, and local Moquegua communities—appear to have coexisted for 400 years, from about 600 to 1000 C.E., each preserving its own style of pottery, architecture, temples, and burials.

Meanwhile, the Wari community, which Williams estimates numbered about 3000 people, pursued far more ambitious water projects than its neighbors. Whereas people living close to the valley floor typically dug 1- to 3-kilometer-long irrigation canals from the river to their low-lying fields, the Wari community built a 20-kilometer-long canal that snaked high up the mountain slopes and brought water to several settlements built along its path. The earth and gravel terraces on which the Wari farmed—an agricultural innovation independently developed in many hilly, water-stressed ecosystems—retained moisture around crop roots while allowing excess water to drain to the terraces below. Wari leaders living on and ruling from Cerro Baúl were “able to sculpt the landscape and put water where they wanted it,” Nash says.

That hydraulic infrastructure required an incredible amount of labor to build and maintain, Nash says. She has excavated in the agricultural settlement of Cerro Mejía, just 2 kilometers away from Cerro Baúl’s elite civic and religious center. Based on the variety of domestic pottery and other material, she thinks people from four separate cultures came together under the Wari umbrella in Cerro Mejía, including some Moquegua locals and people from the coast. “I envision this as a multiethnic, pioneering frontier colony,” she says. Wari leaders appeared to be able to marshal them all “to perform huge amounts of labor,” Williams says.

Formal diplomacy, likely with Tiwanaku representatives, was probably conducted in the form of elite feasts in the palace atop Cerro Baúl, which also housed a brewery. The site is now littered with thousands of molle berries, used for making the typical Wari beer called chicha de molle. Tiwanaku-style jewelry found in the Wari palace, as well as a small Tiwanaku shrine tucked into Cerro Baúl’s Wari palace, suggest other ties, perhaps formed as elite Tiwanaku women married into the Wari power structure, Nash says.

For many centuries, the system appeared to sustain peace and social cohesion, even during hard times. Between 850 and 950 C.E., for example, excavations show that part of the Wari colony at Cerro Baúl suffered a devastating landslide that buried people, houses, and large swaths of farmland. “It was a massive disaster,” Nash says. “But when the Wari government was going strong, they could [cope with] things like this.” The terraces were soon rebuilt.

Still, the reconstruction was flimsy, perhaps reflecting a rush to prevent starvation immediately after the landslide. And in what may be an early sign that support for the Wari government had begun to crack, no one mobilized additional efforts to improve the new terraces. The community appears to have fractured even further by the time a new natural disaster hit: an extreme drought. Paleoclimate records like the core from Lake Pumacocha and the speleothem from Huagapo Cave show this drought was much more severe than the dry period at the beginning of Wari’s expansion, Bird says.

By the time the drought reached the Moquegua valley in the 11th century, archaeological evidence suggests the Wari colony at Cerro Baúl was already weakened, Williams says. Around 900 C.E., after centuries of relatively separate coexistence, more Tiwanaku villagers started to move into Wari territory, as shown by the remains of Tiwanaku-style houses, ceramics, and cemeteries. Small Tiwanaku temples appeared on top of abandoned Wari agricultural fields, suggesting parts of the canal system were no longer functioning, which would have weakened the community’s ability to cope when the drought arrived. Increasing factionalism and decreasing cooperation to maintain infrastructure “might mean this society is more vulnerable to even the beginnings of a changing climate,” Williams says.

Around 1050 C.E., the administrative and religious Wari buildings on top of Cerro Baúl were abandoned, after what Williams calls an “end of times party.” The revelers intentionally burned particular rooms, including parts of the chicha de molle brewery, then scattered smashed drinking vessels on top, a common offering in Andean societies. Archaeologists can’t be sure whether the elite Wari leaders of Cerro Baúl left the region entirely or blended into the new, smaller communities that sprang up in Wari’s wake. The more middle-class residents of Cerro Mejía likely retreated into smaller towns located higher on mountain slopes, Nash says; these were easier to defend against attacks and nearer to short segments of the Wari canal that were still functioning.

Cerro Baúl wasn’t the only Wari community in trouble around 1050 C.E. Across the Wari state, people appear to have abruptly abandoned settlements they had worked hard to build and maintain. Even the capital of Huari emptied out, with its residents likely moving closer to the coast, Tung says. It remains a mystery, however, whether the collapse of the Wari capital rippled out to weaken colonies like Cerro Baúl, or the colonies gave up first and ceased to send tribute and supplies back to the heartland, eroding the state from the outside in. In any case, Williams says, “The Cerro Baúl colony couldn’t sustain itself without being part of the larger whole.”

Cerro Baúl’s story is adding to the increasingly nuanced view that scholars have of drought’s role in the collapse of ancient societies around the world. Once, it was conventional wisdom that drought had toppled ancient civilizations such as the Maya. Now, scholars rarely see a lack of water as the sole cause. Rather, they say, there is often a complex interplay between the social and natural environments. Sometimes, droughts simply drive wedges deep into existing cracks in political and economic systems.

In Cerro Baúl, for instance, it appears that Wari hydraulic expertise should have enabled the colony to cope with that final drought, Nash says. “But if the politics were bad, if their institutions were unraveling,” then the community was vulnerable. “So, you don’t blame the drought,” she says. “You blame the government.”

“The critical moment,” says Luis Jaime Castillo, an archaeologist at PUCP, is not necessarily when canals run dry. It “is the moment when people lose confidence in the system.”

Ironically, Wari engineering long outlasted the state itself. Beginning in the 1300s, the expanding Inca Empire repurposed Wari canals, roads, and agricultural terraces to feed and connect their far-flung territories. Some of the ancient terraces, with their Incan and Wari roots, are still in use today, Williams says. Indeed, he notes, terracing is being revived as a sustainable and hydraulically efficient way to farm in the Andes, as today’s communities confront the ancient problem of drought, but now with a new face: human-caused climate change.","Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ma_0417_Drought_Wari_landscape_1280x720.jpg?itok=7Z7CHyb9,"['dry', 'empire', 'helped', 'cerro', 'baúl', 'water', 'drought', 'americas', 'south', 'terraces', 'wari', 'tiwanaku', 'destroy', 'shrewd', 'nash', 'thrive', 'williams']", ,drought
34,34,Drought Sri Lanka,"Record 50.8 million people displaced inside own countries by conflict, violence and disasters - World - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/world/record-508-million-people-displaced-inside-own-countries-conflict-violence-and,"28 April 2020, Geneva – The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) around the world has reached an all-time high, according to a new report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), part of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The Global Report on Internal Displacement (GRID) estimates that 45.7 million people are living in internal displacement as a result of conflict and violence in 61 countries, the majority in Syria, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Yemen and Afghanistan. Another 5.1 million in 95 countries are displaced because of disasters. This includes 1.2 million people displaced by years of drought and floods in Afghanistan, more than 500,000 by monsoon rains in India and 33,000 whose lives are still uprooted a decade after the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti.

“IDPs are often highly vulnerable people living in crowded camps, emergency shelters and informal settlements with little or no access to healthcare,” said IDMC’s director, Alexandra Bilak. “The global coronavirus pandemic will make them more vulnerable still. It will compromise their already precarious living conditions, by further limiting their access to essential services and humanitarian aid.”

Contributing to these record figures, 33.4 million new displacements were recorded in 2019, the highest annual figure since 2012. Some 8.5 million took place in the context of conflict and violence in countries like Syria, DRC, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Burkina Faso. Around 24.9 million new displacements were triggered by disasters, including 4.5 million by cyclone Fani in India and Bangladesh, cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique and hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas. Heavy and prolonged rains resulted in widespread flooding in Africa, resulting in two million new displacements.

“Year after year, conflict and violence uproot millions of people from their homes. Collectively, we are failing by epic proportions to protect the world’s most vulnerable. Politicians, generals and diplomats must rise above stalemates and seek ceasefires and peace talks, not guns and grenades. In this age of coronavirus, continued political violence is utterly senseless,” said Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council.

The findings of this year’s GRID do, however, also hold some promise. Efforts to prevent and respond to internal displacement were visible in many countries in 2019. Several in Asia showed that displacement in the form of pre-emptive evacuations saves lives, and that effective early warning systems and other measures to reduce disaster risk avert the worst impacts of disasters.

National systems to collect and analyse displacement data were put in place in Indonesia, Mali and Sri Lanka, and development approaches to resolving the issue were launched in Ethiopia and Somalia. The UN secretary general established the High-Level Panel on Internal Displacement, an expression of global political commitment, and three more African countries ratified the Kampala Convention, the continent’s unique and legally binding framework on the phenomenon.

“The GRID shows that measuring and understanding a problem is the cornerstone of efforts to resolve it, but resources and political commitment are also needed if IDPs are to make tangible progress in re-establishing their lives,” said Bilak. “As the coronavirus pandemic casts an unforgiving light on the urgency of our task, we hope the lessons documented in this report will prove useful in our collective efforts to end internal displacement.”

43,43,Drought Sri Lanka,Desertification And Drought Day: The threat of parched land - The Daily Star,https://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/opinion/news/desertification-and-drought-day-the-threat-parched-land-1915505,"Barsha-Kaal, or the rainy season, has officially arrived this week. If we were not shackled by Covid-19, we would have been welcoming monsoon with singing and dancing at public gatherings, arranging tree fairs, and planting hundreds and thousands of saplings all over the country. A perfect time to make our country greener!

It may therefore sound a bit strange to observe Desertification and Drought Day today, on June 17. We may even wonder—does this day have anything to do with luxuriant, riverine Bangladesh?

Before answering this question, let's quickly look back at the 1970s. The year 1973 saw the end of a five-year-long drought in Sub-Saharan Africa that killed more than 200,000 people and millions of animals. The severity prompted numerous global discussions and initiatives over the next two decades to address these grave societal challenges—drought and desertification.

On June 17, 1994, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) was adopted in Paris as a global effort to fight desertification and drought, primarily in Africa. Six months later, the UN General Assembly decided that, from 1995, June 17 would be observed as The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought to increase public awareness of these vital environmental concerns. Twenty-five years later, this year, the day has been renamed as Desertification and Drought Day.

Just to clarify, desertification does not mean expansion or creation of deserts. It is in fact a process where the quality of land gets degraded—through clearing of tree covers, unplanned and over-exploitation of land resources, erosion of hills and rive banks, chemical pollution of land, and salinity intrusion, for example. Back in the 1990s, Bangladesh did recognise land degradation as a growing concern, as well as seasonal and long rainless spells, especially in the north-western part of the country.

Bangladesh signed the UNCCD in 1996. This UN convention is rather less known than its two sister conventions—the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These three UN conventions together are called the Rio Conventions—as they were the direct outcomes of the UN Conference on Environment and Development or the Rio Earth Summit held in June 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Prepared in line with the UNCCD, the National Action Programme (NAP) for Combating Desertification (2005) was Bangladesh's first comprehensive attempt to tackle land degradation. This enthusiasm gradually dried out over the following years, and land degradation in Bangladesh continued. From 2000 to 2010, for example, 334 square kilometres of forest land in Bangladesh was converted to shrub/grass land or cropland.

There are a few possible reasons for the UNCCD implementation getting sidetracked. First, overwhelming global attention to and resources for climate actions and biodiversity conservation, facilitated by the UNFCCC and the CBD processes, respectively, made the UNCCD a backbencher. Those two conventions also deal with land degradation and drought as a part of changing climate, carbon emissions, over-exploitation of natural resources, and destruction of ecosystems discourses—the second reason for the UNCCD struggling to find its unique niche.

Thirdly (although this is up for debate), the leadership—both at national and global levels—could also be responsible for limited attention and action to tackle land degradation. In Bangladesh, for example, while the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is accountable for implementing the UNCCD decisions, more resourceful ministries, like agriculture, land, local government, and road transport and bridges, are managing the country's land resources according to government priorities.

In 2015, the fight against land degradation was rejuvenated globally as the UN General Assembly approved the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Out of 17 SDGs, the UNCCD started focusing on SDG 15—life on land. More specifically, the convention deals with target 15.3—one of 169 SDG targets—which says ""By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world"".

""A land degradation-neutral world"" is indeed a very ambitious vision. Nevertheless, if we move towards such ""neutrality"", the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) can help us to measure our progress. LDN talks about a condition where the amount and quality of land needed to support ecosystem's functions and to improve food security remains at least stable. In other words—no more degradation occurs in a given piece of land, over a period of time.

In 2018, Bangladesh voluntarily set six targets towards LDN to be achieved over the next 12 years. In the National Report on Land Degradation Neutrality Target Setting Programme submitted to the UNCCD, the country promises to increase soil fertility and carbon content in 2000 square kilometres of cropland, to protect 1200 square kilometres of non-saline coastal land from salinity intrusion, and to reduce conversion of 600 square kilometres of forest area, waterlogging in 600 square kilometres of area, soil erosion in 600 square kilometres of hilly areas and river bank erosion in 100 square kilometres of area—all by 2030, in line with the SDGs.

To meet these targets, the government has proposed a number of nature-based solutions—afforestation, reforestation, green-belt creation, village forestry, agro-forestry, slope stabilisation with vegetation, and river bank protection and charland stabilisation with plantation—many of which have long been practiced in Bangladesh for disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and ecosystem management.

We should now bring our experiences together and invest our limited financial resources in nature-based solutions that will not only reduce land degradation, but also fight the climate crisis and biodiversity loss in a cost-effective and efficient manner, with the people.

As we get ready to revive our economy after the pandemic, we need to stop seeing land only as a source to generate revenue, a space for rampant agro-chemical application, and a resource to abuse. We need to see soil as a living entity that feeds us, that shelters biodiversity, and that has the tremendous potential to store carbon, large enough to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030.

It is time for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to take the lead and push for Land Degradation Neutrality as a priority in Bangladesh's land use sector. As the ministry is responsible for strategies and actions against land degradation, climate change and biodiversity loss, it needs to coordinate its efforts and investments around nature-based solutions to address all three societal challenges together. We should not miss this opportunity.

44,44,Drought Sri Lanka,India needs a plan for extreme weather caused by climate change - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/India-needs-a-plan-for-extreme-weather-caused-by-climate-change,"Dr. Arunabha Ghosh is CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in India and lead author of ""Jobs, Growth and Sustainability: A New Social Contract for India's Recovery.""

""All calm now,"" wrote a Mumbai-based friend on June 3. Cyclone Nisarga had made landfall a few hours earlier, 96 km to the south. Mumbai residents had been spared the brunt of the strongest tropical cyclone to hit Maharashtra state in June since 1891.

Two weeks earlier, another coastal city, Kolkata, had not been that fortunate. Amphan, the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, had ripped through India's eastern coast and Bangladesh, flattening the Sundarbans delta. The state government estimates damages have exceeded $13 billion.

India, with its 1.4 billion people, is especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change, from intense cyclones to extreme droughts. In fact, it was the fifth-worst country affected by extreme weather in 2018, according to the Germanwatch think tank, with 2,100 deaths and losses of $38 billion in purchasing-power terms.

Last week, India published its first official climate change assessment, whose most sobering finding was that the impact of climate change will be far worse on India than the global average. Now India must boost its defenses.

The climate change assessment had frightening findings. The average temperature in India increased 0.7 degrees Celsius during 1901-2018 and if emissions continue at the high end of the predicted range by 2100 the temperature could rise 4.4C relative to the 1976-2005 average. Such temperature extremes will particularly impact the Indo-Gangetic plain, home to 480 million, putting lives and livelihoods at severe risk.

The frequency of heat waves could increase three to four times, with average duration doubling. Heat waves adversely affect public health and economic productivity as vector-borne diseases spread -- pathogens in mosquitoes mature faster with higher temperatures.

The Council on Energy, Environment and Water has calculated that India has already experienced 478 extreme weather events since 1972, most occurring after 2005. The frequency of cyclones is rising, jumping from 33 in the 1980s to 58 in the 2010s. From 1998 to 2017 climate-related disasters caused $80 billion of damage.

Water is India's weakest link, with the frequency of high-intensity rains increasing 75% from 1951 to 2015. The Hindu Kush Himalaya region, source of 10 major rivers, could endure a temperature rise of 5.2C by 2100. In the worst case, CEEW analysis finds that food crop losses could be $1.4 trillion-$2.7 trillion at 2015 prices during 2050-2100.

Over the years, India's Meteorological Department and National Disaster Management Authority have greatly improved coordination to save thousands of lives. In 2019, when Cyclone Fani hit Odisha, early warning systems helped evacuate 1.2 million people within 48 hours. There were 64 lives lost compared to nearly 10,000 deaths when a super cyclone struck Odisha in 1999.

But climate risks are nonlinear. Chennai and Kerala endured once-in-a-century floods in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Low-probability events today become the norm tomorrow. Climate-induced disasters test the resilience of physical infrastructure, administrative capacity and social cohesion. Disease, pestilence, heat stress, coastal flooding and inland drought are a dreadful combination.

What India needs is a comprehensive plan for resilience at the federal, provincial and local levels.

First, the government and research institutions should design a Climate Risk Atlas to map critical vulnerabilities. Granular data would inform a national environment and health risk index. With high-resolution analysis of 700-plus districts, each state can build its own risk index. National and state indexes could then be linked to disaster risk reduction plans.

Second, India's bustling cities are heating up. Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and Kolkata are likely to experience the highest increases in heat-related mortality this century. City heat action plans would save lives, energy and public health costs.

Third, infrastructure must be climate-resilient. Analysis of coastal and inland cities finds that temperature extremes impair road surfaces and cause water reservoirs to run dry, while intense rainfall damages low-lying areas. Climate-resilient infrastructure is expensive -- but the costs of doing nothing are higher.

Fourth, a nationwide integrated emergency surveillance system would provide real-time information on extreme events, helping citizens and authorities coordinate relief measures. Overlaid with the climate risk atlas, the IESM could pinpoint vulnerable spots and relief infrastructure -- fire stations, hospitals, shelters. It could also catalyze efforts to rehabilitate livelihoods by giving businesses information on when they can reopen.

Fifth, a unified emergency response framework would train citizens on how to behave in an emergency. India can learn from Japan: after the Fukushima nuclear accident, Japan issued standardized emergency guidelines for residential areas.

Finally, India must work with other major economies to forge an insurance cushion against climate risks. Globally, weather-related insurance losses -- $55 billion annually -- have increased five times since the 1980s. A Global Risk Pooling Reserve Fund would combine environmental and health risks across countries to spread them and ensure a payout when climate disasters strike.

In 2019, India announced a global Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure at the U.N. Climate Action Summit after consultations with more than 35 countries. The latest climate assessment is another sign that India has growing concerns about climate risks. But there is also a possibility that a post-pandemic economic recovery will take priority over climate resilience. That would be myopic and damaging. Instead, building resilience will create jobs, additional investment in physical and natural infrastructure and save against future losses.

All might be calm for my friend in Mumbai, for now. But we cannot just hope for the best. India must prepare for the worst.","Sat, 27 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F1%252F9%252F7%252F8%252F27828791-4-eng-GB%252FCropped-1592821767G20200622%2520dark%2520cloud%2520Mumbai%2520small.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['weather', 'india', 'infrastructure', 'state', 'extreme', 'cyclone', 'heat', 'plan', 'risks', 'temperature', 'change', 'climate', 'risk', 'indias', 'caused', 'needs']", ,flood_and_drought
45,45,Drought Sri Lanka,"Coronavirus brews trouble for tea, disrupts supply as demand spikes - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-tea-idUKKCN22B09P,"MUMBAI/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak is causing a rare stir in the usually staid global tea market, with labour lockdowns stifling supplies just as millions in lockdown drive up demand for the beverage known for its immunity-boosting properties.

Five countries - China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka and Vietnam - account for 82% of global tea exports, but strict restrictions on movement to contain the coronavirus pandemic have already disrupted the key leaf-picking season, delayed some shipments by about a month and triggered a spike in prices.

Fewer pickers combined with colder-than-normal temperatures last month are expected to trim output in top producer China this year, while production in No.2 grower India and Sri Lanka have also been impacted by labour and weather issues.

India’s output is likely to drop by 120 million kgs or 9% in 2020 as the lockdown initially forced plantations to suspend plucking during the opening harvest - the prized first flush - and then operate with about half the workforce, said Prabhat Bezboruah, chairman of India’s Tea Board.

The International Tea Committee (ITC) estimates India’s 2020 exports will fall 7%.

In March, exports from India slumped 34% and nearly halved from Sri Lanka, India’s Commerce Ministry and tea brokers say.

The bright spot is Kenya, the world’s top exporter, which has seen minimal interruption to harvest since March and, according to ITC, may see domestic output rise by 15% this year.

Vietnam’s output is also expected to be largely unaffected, but it is a relatively smaller player.

Still, importers have already started feeling the pinch amid dwindling supplies from South Asia.

“Shipments from India have been delayed by an average of one month, and we have also experienced delays in the supply of tea from other countries, in particular Sri Lanka,” said Orimi trade, Russia’s leading tea manufacturer.

Prices for raw tea, which Russia imports, jumped as much as 30% from pre-lockdown levels.

FLUSHED AWAY

Plantations have struggled to collect the first flush crop in Darjeeling Hills, known for the world’s most expensive tea, as India ordered its 1.3 billion people indoors until May 3 so its modest public health system does not collapse under the weight of infections that have crossed 31,000.

Production from the second flush is set to drop more than 10%, and later flushes will not compensate for those losses, said Kaushik Basu, secretary of the Darjeeling Tea Association.

In India, the first flush usually begins in March, while the second flush starts in May.

A shortage of truckers amid travel restrictions is also delaying movement to auctions and ports, said Nazrana Ahmed, chairman of Assam Tea Planters Association (ATPA).

“Very few trucks are available, and they are taking a week instead of three days to transport tea” to Kolkata in east India from Assam in the country’s northeast, she added.

Less labour also means more bush overgrowth, which will hit later crop potential, tea garden owner Rajib Barooah said.

These problems have created a shortage of fresh supplies and lifted last season’s crop prices to a rare premium, said Kalyan Sundaram, secretary of the Calcutta Tea Traders’ Association.

At a recent auction, buyers paid a third more than the previous auction in Assam, India’s top tea-producing state, he said, indicating strong demand.

In Sri Lanka, tea production was down nearly a quarter due to an earlier drought, and the virus is now affecting exports, said Jayampathy Molligoda, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board.

Turkey, the world’s top tea consumer per capita, is usually self-sufficient in production but faces its own labour shortage.

Local producers say they usually rely on migrant workers from areas like Georgia and Azerbaijan, but that this year they will have to use inexperienced locals which may cut supplies.

IMMUNITY BOOST

The stifled supplies come just as global demand for food and beverages has risen with the pandemic confining people indoors.

Also, the world’s most consumed drink after water is emerging as the preferred choice for many given its low caffeine content and other health benefits.

“Demand for tea is higher than it was ... tea in Russia has an image of a thing that, combined with lemon, boosts the immunity system,” said Ramaz Chanturiya, at the Rusteacoffee lobby. Russia, which has reported more than 93,000 coronavirus cases and over 800 deaths, is a major tea importer.

That said, industry participants and ITC do not expect the hot tea trend to last in the long term as major exporting countries had excess supply in 2019, although the demand-supply balance is likely to be disrupted in the shorter term.

“Tea prices were depressed for the last few years. The current supply disruption could provide much needed support,” said Ahmed from ATPA.","Tue, 28 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200429&t=2&i=1516816289&r=LYNXNPEG3S05B&w=800,"['trouble', 'india', 'disrupts', 'supply', 'labour', 'supplies', 'coronavirus', 'sri', 'lanka', 'output', 'worlds', 'spikes', 'brews', 'flush', 'usually', 'tea', 'demand']", ,drought
46,46,Drought Sri Lanka,"Germany’s Rhine River at Dangerously Low Levels, Which Could Disrupt Shipping - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/06/09/571515.htm,"Germany’s Rhine River is entering dry summer months with water levels at their lowest in two decades, prompting fears of shipping disruption on Europe’s most important inland waterway.

After spring showers failed to show in Germany, the official water level at Kaub — a key chokepoint near Frankfurt — dropped to around 1 meter on June 3, its lowest for the time of year in at least two decades, according to Germany’s WSV inland waterway agency.

That’s prompting fears of a repeat of disruption seen in 2018 when waters fell so low the river became impassable to industrial ships, severing downriver factories from North Sea ports.

With its source high in the Swiss Alps, the Rhine snakes more than 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) and carries cargo barges through some of Europe’s most important industrial zones before emptying into the North Sea at Rotterdam.

A mix of glacial run-off and rain feeds the river, but contributions from glaciers have dwindled in recent years as summer melting outpaces ice formation in winter thanks to global warming.

Forecasters have warned that Europe faces a tinder-dry summer, conditions that would spark a repeat of an October 2018 impasse that was severe enough to dent German economic growth.

Rhine waters have dropped 40% since the start of April, according to data from the WSV. That’s after central Europe experienced an exceptionally dry spring, with rainfall below its usual levels, according to Germany’s DWD federal weather service.

Worsening matters, groundwater levels have dwindled after record-breaking heatwaves in 2019 further dried out soil and wilted vegetation from consecutive years of drought.

“All these usual sources of water are much reduced this year,” said Joerg Belz of Germany’s BAFG inland waterways agency. “If we see months of drought then we’ll see extremely low waters like in 2018.”

Laden barges

Barges hauling diesel-type fuel along the river were recently limited to loading just 40% of their cargo if they planned to sail past Kaub, according to Riverlake Barging, a specialist inland barge brokerage.

Factories like BASF SE’s sprawling Ludwigshafen chemical plant and Thyssenkrupp AG’s steelworks at Duisburg have booked alternative goods transports so they don’t get severed from raw materials.

If the low water levels are sustained, refineries using the Rhine will have to throttle back output more quickly than in 2018, because the fuel demand destruction from coronavirus means there’s less storage available, according to Alan Gelder, vice president for refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie.

Germany’s transport ministry last year unveiled a package of measures it hopes will keep the Rhine passable as global warming continues to dry up the region. The measures, including dredging shallower stretches of the flow and investment in weather forecasting might not prevent the 2018 disruption becoming the norm, according to the WSV rivers agency.

“We’re only two years down the track and it’s reappeared,” Gelder at Wood Mackenzie said.

Many disasters are a consequence of man-made activities. But some disasters are caused due to natural bahaviour. India has faced some very deadly disasters in its history.

In this article, we have published the top deadly natural disasters in the history of India. But before coming to the point we need to know the definition of the natural disaster.

A natural disaster is a natural event that causes great damage to the property or loss of human life.

Examples of Natural Disaster: Volcano, flood, Tsunami, and Earthquakes, or hurricane or cyclone etc.

Let us study them one by one;

1.Kashmir Floods disaster, 2014

Year: 2014

Affected Areas: Rajouri, Srinagar, Bandipur etc.

Number of deaths: 550+

Cause: continuous torrential rainfall and swelling of Jhelum River

This flood caused a huge loss to the lives of the Kashmir region in September 2014. The water of the Jhelum river swelled due to continuous torrential rainfall.

That is why water entered into the residential areas of the Kashmir region. Indian army helped a lot to the stranded residents of this region. Around 550 people lost their lives and damage of properties was estimated between Rs. 5000 cr and 6000 cr.

2. Uttarakhand Flash Floods, 2013

Year: 2013

Affected Areas: It affected 12 out of 13 districts of the state. Four districts were worst affected namely; Rudraprayag, Uttarkashi, Pithoragarh, and Chamoli.

Number of deaths: 5,700 plus

Cause: Heavy rainfall, massive Landslides

Uttarakhand Flash Flood is among the most disastrous floods in the history of India. Uttarakhand received heavy rainfall, massive Landslides in June 2013.

The flash floods and landslides continued from 14 to 17 June. Around 1 lac pilgrims were trapped in the Kedarnath shrine.

3. Bihar flood disaster 2007

Year: 2007

Affected Areas: Name of worst affected districts are Bhagalpur, East Champaran, Darbhanga, Patna, Muzaffarpur, Saharsa, Sitamarhi, and Supaul etc.

Number of deaths: Aboud 1,287 peoples and thousands of livestock lost their life

Cause: five times more rainfall than the monthly average of 30 years

Bihar flood disaster 2007 was described as the worst flood in the ""living memory"" of Bihar by the United Nations. It affected 19 districts of Bihar.

Bihar flood had affected an estimated 10 million people in the entire state. There are about 29,000 houses were destroyed and 44,000 houses were damaged, around 4822 villages and 1 crore hectares of farmland damaged by this flood.

4. The Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004

Year: 2004

Affected Areas: Southern India and Andaman Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep island, Indonesia, Sri Lanka etc.

Number of deaths: 2.30 lac

Cause: Tsunami

This deadliest Tsunami started on the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. Overall it affected around 12 countries and killed more than 2.3 lac people.

The magnitude of this tsunami was between 9.1 and 9.3 and it continued around 10 minutes. As per research it was the third-largest earthquake in the world ever recorded.

5. Gujarat Earthquake,2001

Year: 2001

Affected Areas: Kutch, Ahmedabad, Bhuj, Gandhinagar, Surat, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar etc.

The number of deaths: Around 20,000, injured 167,000 and nearly 400,000 became homeless.

Cause: Earthquake

This was the day of India’s 51st Republic Day celebration on January 26, 2001. Suddenly, Bhachau Taluka of Kutch (Gujarat) experienced an earthquake of 7.6 to 7.9 on the Richter Scale and lasted for 120 seconds.

This disaster killed around 20,000, injured 167,000 and nearly 400,000 people became homeless.

6. Super Cyclone, Odisha 1999

Year: 1999

Affected Areas: The coastal districts of Kendrapara, Bhadrak, Balasore, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur, Ganjam and Puri etc.

Number of deaths: Around 15,000+

Cause: Cyclone

Super Cyclone of 1999 was the most dangerous tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean. Its speed was 260 km/h. It affected not only India but also Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Thailand.

As per the estimation around 15000 people died, around 1.67 million people became homeless, and more than 2.75 lac houses were destroyed.

7. Great Bengal Famine 1770

Year: 1770

Affected Areas: West Bengal (Birbhum and Murshidabad), Bihar (Tirhut, Champaran, and Bettiah), Odisha, and Bangladesh

Number of deaths: Around 1 crore

Cause: Drought/Famine

Nobel laureate Indian economist Amartya Sen describes this famine as a man-made disaster. It was caused due to a combination of exploitative policies of the British East India Company and weather.

This famine was started in 1769 from a failed monsoon which continued for two consecutive seasons till 1773. During the full span of this famine around 10 million died due to hunger.

48,48,Drought Sri Lanka,Vanni: A graphic history - Himal Southasian,https://www.himalmag.com/vanni-a-graphic-history-review-2020/,"The present world in which I am writing this review is vastly different to the one in which I began reading Vanni: A Family’s Struggle Through the Sri Lankan Conflict – a graphic novel focused on the final stages of the Sri Lankan civil war and its devastating human cost.

I first opened this book many moons ago on a packed train to work in Colombo from the outskirts of the city. Within days, the government declared an all-island curfew. Fear of death gripped me as the number of local cases of COVID-19 mounted. I abandoned my sister, who is a doctor, and sought the relative safety of my aunt’s house to reduce my probability of contracting the virus. In my paranoia, I even contemplated stocking up on oxygen cylinders in the event that I became severely ill. I did not get around to writing the review for three months because (I felt) I was not in the right mental space to undertake the task.

The Ramachandrans and the Chologars – the two families from whom the main characters of Vanni are drawn – could not, unfortunately, make such calculations when the war uprooted them from their world of relative peace and contentment.

By May 2009, between 300,000-400,000 Tamil civilians in the Vanni – a resource-abundant, forest-covered and thinly populated region in the northern reaches of Sri Lanka – had already spent the better part of the preceding two years under lockdown. They did not have multiple safe locations to choose from as the fighting between the Sri Lankan military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) escalated. As the battle drew to a close, the Sri Lankan government declared ‘No Fire Zones’ – purportedly for sheltering civilians – but then rained artillery fire on these locations. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded widespread damage to civilian infrastructure and loss of civilian lives in an extensive report on alleged human-rights violations during the last stages of the war. The Sri Lankan military, however, insists till today that it only targeted rebel guns inside the No Fire Zones.

I first opened this book many moons ago on a packed train to work in Colombo from the outskirts of the city. Within days, the government declared an all-island curfew.

Unlike many who stocked up on rice and daal in preparation for the COVID-19 lockdown, civilians trapped inside the war zone could not. Many had lost their jobs and livelihoods and were dependent on the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for food. They were cut off from the rest of the country. Their hospitals were overwhelmed and healthcare workers were ill-equipped to deal with the unfolding catastrophe. Those on the frontlines, short on training and gear, were fighting a losing battle.

Social distancing, too, was impossible. In the months preceding May 2009, thousands of families were restricted to temporary tarpaulin shelters built on a narrow strip of beach on the coast of Mullaitivu District in the Vanni – bordered by the Nandikadal Lagoon to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east. Famine was rampant. Choon paan (mobile bakeries) and elavalu (vegetable) trucks did not honk at the gate thrice a week. Uber Eats did not deliver select restaurant food: often, the only meal was rice cooked in ocean salt. The national postal service did not deliver medicine. Their shelters were not electrified, nor did Sri Lanka Telecom provide a weekly internet data bonus. Soap and shampoo were super luxury commodities: people traded motorbikes for a bar of Lifebuoy. They waited for days on end to wash themselves for lack of water. In any case, sanitising was not going to save them from death; a death that was always a near and immediate possibility. There was no time for a dignified burial or cremation. Often, the dead were found ‘cremated.’ And the Tamils of Vanni are still counting their dead.

An act of abandonment

When we first encounter Antoni Ramachandran (a protagonist in Vanni) in 2014, he is a taxi driver in London on his last trip for the day. His passengers, upon learning he is from Sri Lanka, retell their recent holiday there and ask Antoni if he visits the country often. At this point, we depart with Antoni as he reflects back on his earlier, now alien life all those years ago in the Vanni.

From this point on, Vanni follows the lives of two neighbouring families – the Ramachandrans and the Chologars – in the coastal village of Chempianpattu in the Vanni region. The families struggle through one calamity after the other – from the tsunami of 2004 to the climax of the Sri Lankan civil war in 2009. It is through the stories of these two families that Benjamin Dix – a former United Nations (UN) worker in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province – and Lindsay Pollock – an artist and illustrator – distill the tragic experience of a people in their first joint production.

Choon paan (mobile bakeries) and elavalu (vegetable) trucks did not honk at the gate thrice a week. Uber Eats did not deliver select restaurant food: often, the only meal was rice cooked in ocean salt.

Dix, a British national, was on the last UN convoy out of Kilinochchi in September 2008 after the Sri Lankan government declared that it could no longer guarantee the safety of aid workers inside the war zone. In the ending note to the book, Dix admits to feeling traumatised by the UN’s act of abandonment, and being overcome with deep shame and guilt for his own role in the process. In the months that followed his exit, some of his local colleagues and friends died in the fighting. After the end of the war, Dix became a prominent international voice calling for accountability and justice in Sri Lanka. He features in Callum Macrae’s documentary, Sri Lanka’s Killing Fields, which is focused on the excesses of the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE in the final stages of the war, as well as in Frances Harrison’s collection of survivor stories Still Counting the Dead. His is a powerful testimony on the UN’s colossal failure in preventing civilian casualties.

Thus, Dix writes as an outsider who has established a degree of trust with the Tamil community through his past advocacy work. The book attempts to narrate the story of a severely underreported war to an oblivious Western audience in an accessible format. The literary space that Vanni attempts to occupy – English-language fiction focused on the end of the Sri Lankan civil war – is still in its infancy, with the only notable book capturing this time period being Anuk Arudpragasam’s The Story of a Brief Marriage. I say attempts to because even though Dix and Pollock describe their work as a ‘non-fiction-fiction’ graphic novel, it is more accurately a graphic history. Vanni is closer in form and content to Harrison’s Still Counting the Dead than it is to Arudpragasam’s novel – not just because Dix, Pollock, and Harrison are all British.

While ideally victims should tell their own story, there is nothing intrinsically objectionable in outsiders engaging with the troubled histories of a people so long as they do so truthfully. This is particularly true for histories that are intentionally obliterated by powerful forces. In Sri Lanka, the state continues to push back strongly against Tamils who grapple with war stories from the Vanni that do not neatly fit its official account. There is also the deeper question of what makes one local to an episode of suffering. I am an ethnic Tamil who lived in the Vanni throughout my childhood. Does this make me a victim of the Sri Lankan civil war? Yes, in certain unavoidable ways. But the truth is also that my hometown – Mannar, an island off Sri Lanka’s northwestern coast – was always under the Sri Lankan government’s control after my birth. As such my direct exposure to armed fighting is limited to hearing distant shelling and not so distant grenade blasts; I watched the war’s end unfold on high-speed internet while on a three-month trip to Tamil Nadu.

Thus, I engage with the present literature as strictly an outsider to the harrowing end to Sri Lanka’s civil war.

Navigating loss

Vanni effectively captures how war violently destroys human lives. We first meet Nelani Cholagar as a caring if anxious mother, leading a quiet and happy life with her entire family – husband and four children – intact. Towards the end of the book, we find a broken and destitute Nelani in the No Fire Zone in the final days of the war. She is tired and desperate to feed her youngest son – the last remnant of her once large family. Her geographic location is no longer the unspoiled Chempianpattu coast but the parched shores of Nandikadal Lagoon, strewn with dismembered limbs and dead bodies. And for Nelani life would only get worse from here.

The main characters navigate an emotional landscape riddled with searing personal loss and bereavement. The tsunami devastates their houses. As they are displaced from one location to another, they build shelters that they are forced to vacate in weeks if not days. Death parts couples and children abandon parents. As I read the book, I wondered if experiencing tragedies at such high frequency fundamentally reorients one’s being. What does grief look like to someone who has lost all of her family to a single explosion? How do you live when the sound of death greets your mornings and the cries of mourning fill your nights? What do you do when a loved one goes missing, never to be found again: do you assume her dead or do you live in the hope that you will find her again? Is accepting a confounding certainty simpler than holding on to an improbable hope? How does one communicate when language is no longer adequate to convey the horrors of your reality?

Dix and Pollock convey a remarkable deal of complexity in their characters. There appears, on the part of the writers, a genuine and concerted effort to stay true to the witness testimonies from which the story arcs of the primary characters are distilled. This commitment to truth, naturally and subtly – in ways perhaps originally unintended – subverts popular, mythical imaginations about the people of Vanni and the circumstances in which they found themselves.

There is also the deeper question of what makes one local to an episode of suffering.

A clichéd Tamil nationalist portrayal of Chempianpattu under the LTTE, for instance, may have romanticised it as nothing less (or more) than an idyllic, coastal village and depicted its people as completely blissful. But in the book, while Pollock’s paintings do present vistas of vast and pristine beaches, tall palmyra trees, and quiet sunrises, we also find jarring preexisting realities. On the morning after Maveerar Naal – the designated day for commemorating and mourning dead LTTE soldiers in the rebel calendar – we find the Ramachandrans and the Cholagars gathered outside the latter’s house. The eldest son from the Cholagar family is about to rejoin his LTTE battalion. Even as the elders bid their farewells, the youngest three kids from the two families – all possibly under five years of age – engage each other in a shooting game. Nelani’s youngest son Bala, wearing his elder brother’s Tiger cap, points a stick at Antoni’s son Michael’s chest. “BANG BANG,” Michael and his sister Theepa fire back. This shooting game spans several illustration blocks and signifies how violence had become entrenched and normalised in the Tamil community.

On the other hand, for the majority of Sinhalese, even today, it is impossible to imagine the Tamil people – particularly those from the Vanni region – as anything besides gung-ho supporters of the LTTE and its war efforts, willing to strap on a suicide vest at a moment’s notice. Dix and Pollock, by contrast, describe a reality that directly contradicts such an imagination. Nelani’s reaction to her children joining the LTTE is characterised by a deep sense of anguish. Similarly, we find Antoni and his wife Rajini repeatedly hiding their children away from the LTTE’s recruitment patrols. Even those who are part of the LTTE do not exhibit unbridled, unquestioning enthusiasm. In the aftermath of the tsunami, we find Ranjan – Antoni’s brother and long-time LTTE soldier – passionately dissuading Segar (Nelani’s second son) from joining the rebel movement. “Nelani needs your help. Your Appa isn’t here to look after things. Right now, they need you more than the Tigers do”. Similarly, when a fellow member of the LTTE medical corps questions, “Isn’t that what we are doing? Keeping (our families) safe?” Priya (Antoni’s sister-in-law who gets forcibly recruited into the LTTE) responds, “I hope so.”

Many Sinhalese also reject the UN’s estimate that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians died from the Sri Lankan military’s final push for victory (the Sri Lankan government’s own assessments place the death toll at 9,000 while human-rights groups and independent researchers assert a figure larger than the UN’s). To them, Sri Lanka’s armed forces – almost entirely made up of ethnic Sinhalese – can do no wrong. There is ongoing unwillingness to engage in truthful conversation concerning the Sri Lankan military’s repeated shelling of civilian targets and the sexual abuse, torture, and unlawful killing that its members allegedly committed against Tamil prisoners of war. Dix and Pollock do not shy away from highlighting such horrors.

In the penultimate chapter of the book, inside the government-demarcated No Fire Zone, Antoni picks a spot in close proximity to a makeshift hospital to build his family’s temporary shelter. He deems it a safer location from the ever-intensifying fighting. The Sri Lanka Army launches a midnight offensive with the object of infiltrating the No Fire Zone and splitting it in two. The makeshift hospital is razed to the ground in the shelling along with the adjacent shelters. Antoni’s family escapes the carnage but not without loss.

Antoni’s sister-in-law Priya is, almost certainly, a reference to the LTTE’s popular female newsreader Isaipriya. The fictional character’s final act makes this clear. A group of Sri Lankan Army officers separate Priya and her friend Kavitha from the crowd as they attempt to blend in and cross the Nandikadal Lagoon, out of the war zone. What transpires closely follows victim testimonies pointing to a disturbing culture of sexual violence instituted against LTTE cadres and suspects in the aftermath of the war. While we do not encounter Priya soon after this juncture in the book, we do know what happened to Isaipriya through the series of photographs Callum Macrae’s investigative documentary surfaced concerning the fate of the Tamil prisoners of war under Sri Lanka Army custody.

No heroes

Through all of this, Benjamin Dix and Lindsay Pollock keep the focus squarely on the human cost of war and violence. For instance, the authors spare hardly any attention to cover politics in the Sinhalese south – except for a single block of illustration announcing Mahinda Rajapaksa’s presidential election victory of November 2005. The book does not get into the details of the origin of the conflict nor does it moralise or theorise about which side committed the greater crimes. There are no obvious heroes, only victims. In spite of the limitations the graphic-novel format imposes and the relatively short length of the book, the writers have retold the Vanni experience truthfully and with great empathy for its subjects.

Pollock’s beautiful illustrations (in the early chapters, I must add, as ‘beautiful’ is perhaps not the adjective one wishes to use in relation to the latter ones) – albeit in black and white – accurately capture the essence of a Tamil fishing community’s life and the coastal landscape. One must credit the London-based illustrator for his attention to detail. For instance, the casual attire worn by the older Tamil women in the book – and the designs depicted on the faded dresses – were altogether familiar. His capture of human emotion, particularly of loss and longing, is moving. Two full-pages (p. 126 and p. 127) show Antoni combing through dust, rubble, and strewn bodies for his mother. His only words are ‘aiyo’ and ‘amma’, and his expressions accurately convey the truth he understands even before he locates the body: that his mother is dead.

The main characters navigate an emotional landscape riddled with searing personal loss and bereavement.

The layout of the book works well in places. The use of differently-sized illustration blocks adds variety to the pages and a certain depth to the narrative by invoking ingrained memories from the time. For example, the full-page capture of the Manik Farm camp for the displaced in the immediate aftermath of the war’s end is possibly based on a very familiar Agence France-Presse photo. In other sections of the book, however, uniformly sized blocks may have helped the reader follow the flow of the narrative more intuitively. On a minor note, on occasions, I was not able to immediately distinguish between characters from the sketches. A case in point are Antoni’s brother Ranjan and Nelani’s son Segar. Even though we glean from the text that between the two there is a significant age gap, they look very similar in the latter chapters of the book.

Eleven years on

Mindless injustice repeatedly strikes the same people with unforgivable vengeance. Eleven years on, the lives of the Vanni Tamils remain in tatters. Gotabaya Rajapaksa – Sri Lanka’s defence secretary who oversaw the bloody denouement to the country’s three-decades-long civil war – secured an overwhelming victory in the 2019 presidential election. This outcome has all but extinguished fickle hopes for justice and accountability that Antoni, Nelani, and others like them may have harboured for wartime violations the Sri Lankan armed forces committed against them and their children. The Tamil Vanni region is amongst the poorest in Sri Lanka. Despite the passage of time, the Sri Lankan security apparatus still heavily surveils the people of this land. Vanni’s students, crippled by a persistent absence of resources, often underperform in national-level standardised exams, reflecting poor educational outcomes. Vanni’s women are particularly vulnerable to domestic violence and sexual abuse. In the past decade, cyclic drought and flooding has devastated farmers’ livelihoods in the region. More recently, the supply chain breakdown due to the COVID-19 crisis has severely reduced the daily earnings of Vanni’s fishermen who are already heavily indebted to local loan sharks.

This commitment to truth, naturally and subtly – in ways perhaps originally unintended – subverts popular, mythical imaginations about the people of Vanni and the circumstances in which they found themselves.

Like Antoni Ramachandran, my university batchmate Aravind (name changed to preserve privacy) and his family are fisher folk from the Vanni. The tsunami crippled his father’s business. As the war drew to a close, severely short on manpower, the LTTE recruited him to its ranks while he was still a school student – similar to Antoni’s sister-in-law Priya. Many of whom he fought alongside died but he, miraculously, made it out alive. After several months in a Sri Lankan government rehabilitation centre for ex-cadres, he sat for the Advanced Level examinations and qualified to study engineering. We were in engineering school together for four years, starting in 2013. A few months after his graduation, in July 2018, he met with an accident when returning home from Colombo; he was travelling back after confirming his first job appointment as a civil engineer in the state sector. He is now paralysed from below the hip and confined to a wheelchair. How similar is his story to that of Nelani Cholagar’s youngest son Bala who survives heavy artillery fire, aerial bombing, land mines, and machine gun bullets only to die from hunger induced poison intake days before the war’s end?

Aravind serves as a compelling personal reminder that we are not in this together. We speak of a shared humanity even as we are far removed from the experience and suffering of millions of people. We live in an appalling culture that personalises achievements and universalises suffering. We never attribute our wins to structural factors. Yet we shamelessly partake in Oppression Olympics: that intense competition whereby we contest for pieces of others’ personal tragedies and claim them for ourselves merely because we share their ethnic, social, or cultural identity. Victories are mine and mine alone. As are your tragedies.

We seek comfort in lies and numb our consciences with delusional notions of unity and equality: in the standard ‘we are one’ or its more recent ‘the virus does not discriminate’ variant. We pretend to know that which we do not, and fake empathy for those that we do not care for. We ignore, all the while, the simple and agonising truth: the only honest response to the sheer unfairness of the world we inhabit is crying out helplessly, hopelessly, and in pain: ‘for how much longer?’","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.himalmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/3065561115_54b4.jpg,"['tamil', 'lankan', 'book', 'dix', 'ltte', 'lanka', 'sri', 'antoni', 'graphic', 'history', 'vanni', 'war']", ,flood_and_drought
49,49,Drought Sri Lanka,Southern England could be in drought in 20 years without water use cuts – report - shropshirestar.com,https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2020/03/25/southern-england-could-be-in-drought-in-20-years-without-water-use-cuts-report/,"Low water levels at Bewl Water near Lamberhurst in Kent

England is in danger of experiencing droughts within 20 years unless action is taken to combat climate change’s impact on water availability, the public spending watchdog has warned.

The National Audit Office (NAO), in a report published on Wednesday, said some parts of England, especially the South East, are at risk of running out of water due to decreased rainfall and a need to cut the amount taken from natural waterways.

Water companies will have to reduce the amount of water they take out of rivers, lakes and the ground by more than one billion litres per day, creating huge shortfalls in the coming decades, the NAO warned.

UK water supply could drop by 7% by 2045 because of #climatechange and the need to source water sustainably. Find out more in our new report: https://t.co/dZVppOJ7xL (1/3) — National Audit Office (@NAOorguk) March 25, 2020

Parliament’s auditor predicted that four billion litres of additional water supply will be needed per day by 2050 to counter the growing risk of drought from climate change.

The country’s total water supply is forecast to drop by 7% by 2045 because of climate change and the need to scale back the amount of water taken out of England’s waterways and soils.

The amount removed will need to be slashed by almost 500 million litres a day to ensure sustainable biodiversity can continue, while drier weather is expected to see a 600 million daily reduction in rainfall.

According to NAO figures, the daily demand for water in England and Wales stands at 14 billion litres, with the equivalent of three billion litres of that lost through leakage.

People on average use 143 litres of water on a 24-hour basis.

In his report, Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, was critical of ministers for failing to lead on the issue of water sustainability, with personal water consumption having risen every year for the past five years.

Mr Davies, the Comptroller and Auditor General, has called on the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) to co-ordinate a national approach to encouraging consumers and public bodies to reduce their water usage in a bid to avoid water shortages in the coming decades.

He said: “The Government has made limited progress on reducing water consumption, tackling leakage and sharing water resources between regions in the last five years, but rapid progress is now vital for the Government to deliver its objective of a resilient water supply.

“Defra needs to provide stronger leadership to water companies, regulators and consumers.”

Defra needs to make sure there is a clearer message about the need for the public to save water. It should also work with Ofwat and the Environment Agency to review how water companies are reducing water consumption and leakage. (3/3) — National Audit Office (@NAOorguk) March 25, 2020

The report states that water companies over the past five years have made little or no progress in reducing water consumption and cutting leakage.

The NAO has urged the Government to monitor progress on the water suppliers’ pledge to reduce leakage by at least 15% by 2025.

Ministers in 2018 also committed to announcing a personal water consumption target but have yet to follow through on the promise, said the report.

The NAO said it wants Defra to promote a “more coherent and credible message” about water efficiency and develop a plan to evaluate its impact, with Whitehall leading on getting the message across that consumers need to save water.

Defra has been pushed to work with other Government departments to reduce water consumption by large public sector users, such as hospitals and schools.

It should also better understand how willing the public are to pay more in terms of bills in order to improve water infrastructure, said the NAO.

Drier weather is forecast to reduce water supply by 600 million litres a day. The amount of water we take out of the ground, or from rivers, needs to reduce by 480 million litres a day, within 25 years. Water companies can help by reducing the amount wasted through leakage. (2/3) — National Audit Office (@NAOorguk) March 25, 2020

Regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency should also have a role to play in regularly reviewing water companies’ progress on reducing consumption and leakage, the report recommended.

Water UK said companies are working on reducing leakages while also attempting to ensure household goods coming on to the market have improved water consumption.

A spokesman for the trade association representing the major suppliers said: “Water companies are working hard to improve water efficiency and have committed to triple the rate of leakage reduction by 2030, as well as delivering plans to reduce, by a fifth, the average amount of water used per person by 2050.

“In addition, we are urging the Government to use the Environment Bill to introduce measures, such as mandatory water efficiency labelling on white goods and stricter building regulations, in order to tackle water wastage.”

A spokesman for Defra said: “We recognise that we need to work harder than ever to ensure that we all have enough water in the future and that is why we are already working towards many of the report’s recommendations.","Wed, 25 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/G1G_OWXfu6FJ5ulsTo12wUkkIxI=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/OMWC4J6ODJA6TFEWHETFERAVPE.jpg,"['cuts', 'need', 'consumption', 'leakage', 'report', 'nao', '20', 'water', 'litres', 'drought', 'companies', 'england', 'reduce', 'southern', 'reducing']", ,none

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lanka’s election commission is meeting with government officials on Monday to discuss ways to avoid a possible constitutional crisis if the country fails to hold parliamentary elections before a mandated deadline of June 2 because of the coronavirus.

The commission must decide whether to hold the polls, which could expose more people to the virus, or let the country plunge into its second constitutional crisis in less than two years.

Sri Lanka reported 24 new infections on Monday, its most in a single day. It now has a total of 295 confirmed cases, with seven deaths and 96 recoveries.

“We will be dealing with legal questions and whether it is safe,” said Ratnajeevan Hoole, one of three election commissioners.

“I don’t think we have the right to ask the people to go and expose themselves to the virus without expert opinion,” he said.

Also on Monday, the government lifted a daytime curfew in many areas of the country, except ones identified as high risk, to restart the economy.

In 2018, Sri Lanka came to a standstill for 52 days after then President Maithripala Sirisena sacked his prime minister. The crisis was ended by a Supreme Court decision that restored the prime minister.

Last month, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved the opposition-controlled Parliament six months early, hoping his party could win a majority in new elections.

He has complained that a 2015 constitutional change curtailed presidential powers and wants a constitutional amendment to strengthen his office, which would require the support of two-thirds of Parliament.

Rajapaksa announced elections for April 25, but the election commission postponed the polls indefinitely after the coronavirus spread and the government declared an island-wide curfew.

The constitution stipulates that a dissolved Parliament must be replaced within three months.

“There will be a constitutional crisis, because the Parliament has to meet within three months of the dissolution. If by the second of June the Parliament is not in a position to meet, there is a crisis,"" said Naganathan Selvakumaran, former dean of the college of law at the University of Colombo.

“The constitution has not provided an exit (from the crisis) because it has not anticipated such a situation,” he said.

Rajapaksa rejected the election commission's suggestion that the Supreme Court be asked to help find a solution.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president's brother, said the election commission could not ignore its legal duty to schedule a new election because of “imaginary situations that may or may not come in the coming weeks or months.”

The government has also rejected suggestions by the opposition that presidential powers be used to recall the dissolved Parliament.

Opposition parties say an election during the pandemic poses too much risk since candidates typically rely upon large public rallies and door-to-door campaigning.

“Yes, we need an election and we want to have it as early as possible. However, it should be done in a responsible way without putting people at risk,"" said former opposition lawmaker Harsha de Silva.

Health authorities say they have managed to keep the spread of the virus under control, limiting its spread within the community through identification and isolation of patients and their contacts.

Anil Jasinghe, a top health official, said 12 of the country's 25 districts have not reported any patients and that the lockdown could be gradually eased.

A new study highlighting the impact of China’s dams on the Mekong river has raised fresh questions on whether dams being built on other rivers that originate in China, such as the Brahmaputra, may similarly impact countries downstream.

China blocks tributary of Brahmaputra to build dam

While China’s southwestern Yunnan province had above-average rainfall from May to October 2019, there was “severe lack of water in the lower Mekong”, the study found based on satellite data from 1992 to 2019.

The Mekong flows from China to Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. The Mekong River Commission, which comprises Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, has said more scientific evidence was needed to establish whether dams caused a 2019 drought.

The study released this month said six dams built since the commissioning of the Nuozhadu dam in 2012 had altered natural flow of the river. It was published by the Sustainable Infrastructure Partnership in Bangkok and the Lower Mekong Initiative, which is a U.S. partnership with all the downstream countries besides Myanmar. The study was funded by the U.S. government.

‘Groundless study’

China has maintained that the dams it is building on the river, known as the Lancang there, are “run of the river” dams that only store water for power generation. The Foreign Ministry said the study was “groundless”. Yunnan had also suffered from drought, while the Lancang only accounted for 13.5% of the Mekong’s flows.

Harnessing the power of the 'mother river'

India has long expressed concerns over dam-building on the Brahmaptura. In 2015, China operationalised its first hydropower project at Zangmu, while three other dams at Dagu, Jiexu and Jiacha are being developed.

Indian officials have said the dams are not likely to impact the quantity of the Brahmaputra’s flows because they are only storing water for power generation. Moreover, the Brahmaputra is not entirely dependent on upstream flows and an estimated 35% of its basin is in India.

India does not have a water-sharing agreement with China, but both sides share hydrological data. “We have got China to cooperate with us for warnings on how floods are moving down the Yarlung Tsangpo and into the Brahmaputra, so that we can warn our population living in low-lying areas and move them safely to higher ground,” said Gautam Bambawale, who was India’s Ambassador to China until December 2018.

“India will continue to raise the issue of river waters in the Brahmaputra with China, as that appears to be the only methodology to ensure what happened on Mekong does not happen on Brahmaputra,” he said.

Management problem

“India, for the most part, doesn’t have a quantity problem but a management one,” added Ambika Vishwanath, who researches water security and is director of the Kubernein Initiative. “We really need to worry more about activity in China affecting quality, ecological balance, and flood management.”

The Mekong study, she added, was not conclusive on the question of how China’s dams had affected quantity of flows. “To state that the basin had less water because of activities in China alone is misleading, mainly because that only considers the water flowing into the lower basin at one station in Thailand,” she said, adding that the study did not consider other dams and water-use along the course of the river. The lower basin isn’t entirely dependent on flows from China, but also receives water from tributaries in all four countries, which the study did not account for.","Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ak9j73/article31466672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30-ANANTH-ZANGMU1,"['brings', 'river', 'mekong', 'study', 'basin', 'brahmaputra', 'water', 'dams', 'flows', 'china', 'lower', 'focus']", ,flood_and_drought

KODIKARA / AFP)

(AFP) - Sri Lanka's stock exchange was shut 38 seconds after opening Monday for the first time following a 52-day virus lockdown, as a plunge in share prices triggered a circuit breaker.

The Colombo Stock Exchange was closed on March 20 when the government imposed a lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus, with only essential services allowed to operate.

But soon after the restart, prices tumbled 10 percent, leading the exchange to stop trading.

Analysts said the stock market was likely to perform badly when it reopened, with the pandemic devastating key sectors of the economy including tourism, banking and exports.

""This should have been expected with foreign investors keen to liquidate their stakes,"" Pasindu Perera, at Candor Equities, said. ""This crisis is unlike any other, and we may just be at the start of it. So in the short to medium term the selling will persist.""

The market's top 20 stocks have tumbled 38 percent since the first virus patient was reported on January 27.

The island nation has reported 863 cases and nine deaths so far.

The government eased the lockdown on Monday in a bid to revive the economy, which was already struggling to recover from the deadly Easter Sunday bombings in April last year.

Health authorities have also said the spread of the virus was under control.

Offices were allowed to reopen with reduced staffing but schools and food outlets remained closed.

Sri Lanka in late March called on international lenders to grant it and other developing nations a debt moratorium and defer repayments as they grapple with the pandemic.

The country last week appealed to its 1.5 million government employees to donate their May salary to the government, saying it would help to narrow the budget deficit by saving some 100 billion rupees ($525 million).

India were one of the favourites to win the tournament and this was one of the reason why the pressure on India was huge as they were playing in front of their home crowd. India were also up against history as no home team had managed to win the prestigious title in the past. In 1996, Sri Lanka had won the World Cup in Lahore when the marquee event was co-hosted by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Dhoni and his boys were under huge pressure as India had crashed out of the World Cup 2007 in 2007 and the expectations from the Indian fans were too high in 2011.

India performed brilliantly in the group stages, though, losing just one match. Indian top-order lived up to its reputation in almost all group games. In the quarterfinals, the Men In Blue were up against three-time defending champions Australia.

Batting first, Australia posted a challenging total of 261 runs after Ricky Ponting's 104. India looked in trouble at one stage after they lost their fifth wicket at 187 in the 38th over.

But Yuvraj Singh (57 not out) played one of the finest match-winning innings of this career to take India to the semifinals.

In the semifinals, India were upagainst archrivals Pakistan and Dhoni-led team defeated Pakistan in Mohali to maintain their record of not losing to Pakistan in a World Cup game.

The final at Wankhede was played in front of thousands of people and billions across the world watched the match on TV with a hope that India will create history.

For Sri Lanka, Mahela Jayawardene (103 not out, 88 balls, 13 fours) hit a classy ton to to help his side post a challenging total of 274/6.

In reply, India lost both their openers, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag early, but Gautam Gambhir (97) and Virat Kohli (35) joined hand to build a crucial partnership.

After Kohli's departure, skipper Dhoni decided to walk in ahead of in-form Yuvraj. At that time India needed 160 runs to win. Dhoni, who had not done much with the bat in World Cup till then, showed his class once again and handled Muttiah Muralitharan and Lasith Malinga, Sri Lanka's main bowlers, quite easily to help India win their first World Cup win since 1983.","Thu, 02 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2020/04/02/852161-583086-2011-world-cup-win.jpg,"['india', 'total', 'world', 'dhoniled', 'mahendra', 'lanka', 'sri', 'wankhede', 'cup', 'drought', 'team', 'singh', '28year', 'ended', 'yuvraj', 'win', 'pakistan']", ,drought

By Peter Keen

At the macro level, climate change is a scientific, political, societal, policy, and planetary issue. For the tea industry, it raises questions about the future and, perhaps, even its survival. At the micro level, it is a practical and immediate management problem for tea farmers. There is no area of the world where it is not a current, imminent, or emergent factor. Examples of major shifts already apparent are sustained drought in East Africa and Yunnan, disruption of seasonal rain and monsoons in Darjeeling, temperature increases in Assam and Japan, and soil erosion in Sri Lanka.

Tea farmers can’t do anything to change these powerful macro forces, but they can adapt their management practices to at least protect their own smallholding or specialty tea garden. Some of these require aid and investment funding. Most take 1-3 years before the benefits become fully apparent.

Here are some examples of effective action. They are illustrative and selective, highlighting some features that apply across many related objectives, methods and achievements:

1. Water: drip irrigation versus spraying, soil water infiltration mapping (satellite and sensor identification of water absorption/lack within areas of a field);

2. Soil: fertigation, organic fertilizers, compost, shade trees to shelter fields;

3. Energy: biomass fuel to replace wood and fossil fuel, fuel-saving stoves;

4. Waste: manure fertilizer, gasification of, for example, sugar cane and tea leaf waste to form briquettes;

5. Trees: reforestation, shade-tree cover;

6. Biodiversity: bio-corridors, multi-crops; and

7. Genetic variety: clonal seedlings

These all follow a path that is not so much moving forward as getting back on track. Basically, dealing with climate change at the grower level begins with the rejection of monoculture. This is the highly efficient growing of a single crop, with a focus on chemicals to maximize soil productivity and yields, minimal loss of harvest from crop rotation, and an industrial manufacturing and distribution approach to production. The new refocus is on biodynamic management.

Water

Irrigation methods are key to the effectiveness and efficiency of water use. Drip irrigation has become an essential here. Spraying stresses the soil in dry seasons, adding to erosion. In wet ones it produces water logging and runoff. Overhead sprinklers are hit-or-miss. Netafim, the largest Indian irrigation service firm, reports that flood irrigation reaches only 30% of the land, sprinklers 60%, but drip irrigation 90%.

Drip irrigation and its combination with fertilizer feeding — fertigation — uses pipes controlled by software and sensors to deliver the exact water need at the optimal time. In South India, one extensive tea garden increased its yield from 3,500 kilos to 5,000 in 4 years and to 7,000 in 9. The owner reports a visible improvement in the health of the plants. A Sri Lanka three-year development doubled yields. In Tanzania, drip irrigation at Igoda farm increased yields — more “crop per drop” — while cutting water waste by 30%

Tea Growing Managing Climate Change Briquettes enrich the soil and encourage long-term fertility.

Soil

Monoculture has contributed to the growing problems of soil erosion, contamination, and overreliance on chemical fertilizers for nutrients. The new priority is to substitute biomass to enrich the soil and encourage long-term fertility. Crop residues, manure and organic decomposition are examples.

Energy

Energy management is a major immediate target of opportunity. Electricity and fossil fuels comprise a large proportion of operating costs for pumps, fans, boilers, and tea drying.

There are many examples of crop waste being turned into biofuel. In Kenya, one small organization collects sugar cane waste from outside a factory where it has piled up for decades, then dries and mills it before pressure-compacting it into briquettes. These are smokeless and generate 50% more energy than equivalent sizes of logs.

The Mokomboki factory in Kenya initiated a program that shows the scale of direct energy savings by replacing firewood with briquettes made of biomass waste. Its energy expenses fell from $542,000 to $295,000. It has entirely eliminated the use of timber.

Waste

Tea making generates plenty of waste, from the farm to the factory to the discarded used tea bag. One study states that 190,000 tonnes of India’s 860,000 tonnes of production are waste, mainly leaves and fragments.

Lipton’s massive Jebel Ali factory in Dubai produced 450 tonnes of waste annually, taking up 30,000 square meters; this amounted to 5.4 kilograms per tonne, a figure Lipton has reduced to 0.09. Nestle’s plan goes beyond getting rid of waste to turning it into an economic, social and environmental asset. Tea waste is packed with the compounds that make for a superior fertilizer: nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. These improvements come from applying well-established quality management methods from manufacturing.

Tea generates wastewater that remains untreated. It builds up organic matter that decomposes without oxygen being able to aerate it; separating waste and storm water transforms the waste into refreshed water via screens, sediment tanks, gravel beds, and wetland treatment methods.

Trees

Deforestation has been endemic in modern times. In crowded Taiwan and Japan, tea farms are being surrounded by housing developments that reduce trees. The scarcity of land encourages their removal. Many tea experts regard restoring shade trees as core to sustainability. They add to wildlife biodiversity, provide protection and are emission sinks for carbon. Planting by drone, community action programs, and careful selection of native trees are part of the growing emphasis on teas plus trees as the basis for a productive farm.

× Expand Tea Growing Managing Climate Change Monoculture is the opposite of biodiversity.

Biodiversity

Bio-corridors link separate locations so that animals, insects, and flora can move freely between them. This helps offset the intensity of monoculture fields, housing, and other developments built on fenced off land previously open to farming and many other impediments to diversity. Dilmah is credited with implementing these paths in Sri Lanka and points to the resulting increase in variety, mobility, and number of dragonflies, for instance, many of them rare. Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province, China has made corridors the base for intercropping, support of wildlife, and enriching of flora and fauna. Biodiversity is the opposite of monoculture in its aims and methods. It increasingly extends the principles of organic farming to add, not remove, nature from the tea fields.

Genetic variety

Stress-tolerant tea clones are an important, long-established adaptation aid to farming. India’s Tocklai Tea Research Institute has developed 33 tea clones, plus 150 vegetable and flower clones and a dozen seed stocks. These vary in their characteristics — yield, level of drought resistance, suitability for marginal land and soil with poor drainage, etc. They also help extend the genetic variety of tea bushes that monoculture has narrowed down. Biogenetic molecular science seems sure to speed up and extend clonal methods: gene profiling, genome mapping, and micropropagation in the interests of sustainability and reduction of vulnerability of a small set of seedings.

Biodynamic management

Bio-management is organic farming, with or without formal organic certification. “Organic” applies only to pesticide-free farming. Bio-management is everything natural, whereas the organic label addresses pesticide-free and bio-fertilization farming. It adds to soil renewal, irrigation, biodiversity, multi- versus monoculture crop choices, tree shading, and use of natural nutrients. Whether these and other examples of management activism in responding to climate and related environmental threats will succeed over the long-term is uncertain. But the approach of “wait it out” or “that’s a government policy problem” is self-defeating. Something must be done at the grower level and in the fields today.","Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://stir-tea-coffee.com/downloads/3231/download/20i3_Tea_Growing_Climate_Change_1.jpg?cb=ea458de2b94b51fbbf088c01846155e0&w=1200,"['response', 'farming', 'monoculture', 'managing', 'growing', 'trees', 'water', 'change', 'teagrowing', 'climate', 'irrigation', 'organic', 'tea', 'soil', 'waste']", ,drought
61,61,Drought Sri Lanka,Organisers very keen on breaking cricket drought in September - Barbados Today,https://barbadostoday.bb/2020/04/17/organisers-very-keen-on-breaking-cricket-drought-in-september/,"If the 2020 Caribbean Premier League (CPL) comes off in September, it is likely to be staged in the absence of both fans and overseas professionals.

With the Caribbean in lockdown and measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 being stringently applied, it is possible that the CPL fixtures could be among the first staged globally, though chief operations officer Pete Russell confirmed the league would try to avoid a clash with a postponed IPL season.

Speaking to ESPNcricinfo, Russell said he hoped that staging the tournament as planned could be “a sign that the Caribbean is open for business again” once the worst effects of the pandemic have passed.

“It’s good that the Caribbean has locked down early, and it hasn’t been hit in the same way as the UK, for example,” Russell said. “We’re looking at different permutations in terms of what could or couldn’t happen, but the lucky thing is that we’ve got a bit of time – we don’t have to force a decision.

“I don’t think there’s any question that we’ll be able to play it. We’re only going to play if it’s safe to do so, but we’ve been approached by a lot of the countries who want it to happen. The reason [for that] is that it’s a big sporting event, and it could act as a sign or a marker that the Caribbean is open for business again.”

With the IPL season currently postponed indefinitely, it has been suggested that the tournament could be staged at some stage in September or October, not least with the T20 World Cup in October in doubt. Russell said that while the CPL would not try to compete for eyeballs with the most lucrative T20 league in the world, he hoped that the IPL could “figure out their own window”.

“We wouldn’t go up against it,” he said. “While I know the BCCI is all-powerful in these things, there has to be some sensible consideration around what players and other leagues are doing.

“I think IPL would want all the West Indian players to be playing in their tournament – it wouldn’t make sense for them to play at the same time as CPL when a lot of their stars are playing with us. That would defeat the objective. I don’t think they need to do that, either. They can figure out their own window, for sure.”

If the tournament does go ahead as planned, it is possible that no overseas players will be involved due to health concerns and restrictions on international travel. The CPL’s organisers are also drawing up plans to hold games while maintaining social distancing within a stadium, a situation which would involve all players staying in the same hotels and the tournament being held at one or two venues instead of the planned six.

“That’s what people are going to have to look at: how would a stadium look if you were to follow all the guidelines on social distancing? Of course, it’s doable. For instance, in Barbados, we would probably be able to do a social-distancing stadium, and it could be at 25 per cent capacity – there’s a lot of organisation that goes into that, but it’s viable.

“The player side is the important bit. It could be that CPL is played without international players this year, and there’s enough Caribbean talent to play without if we have to – that’s not our preferred option, but it’s doable.

“And then obviously you have to go through the whole medical process. Would you quarantine players, or put them all in the same hotel? How would that all work? Even if we don’t necessary use [these plans] this year, it’s vitally important that we’ve done them. That’s my biggest focus at the minute.”

The picture may become clearer next week, following an ICC meeting via videoconference in which board CEOs will discuss contingency plans, and Russell has been in regular contact with WICB chief executive Johnny Grave to work out how West Indies’ fixtures might affect the competition’s staging.

“[The WICB] obviously want to get back playing. They’ve got the England tour – and I saw headlines today saying that is unlikely to take place – and then South Africa would be the first team in the Caribbean in August. There’s so much juggling to go on that it’s difficult to know what’s going to come out.

“We know that in the West Indies, what’s good about CPL is that we’re employing cricketers and locals, while not many of them are getting paid at the minute. We’re an important part of that economic ecosystem, as much as we are about playing cricket.

“I wouldn’t put money on it, but we could be the first cricket back if September is our window. If we don’t play in September, then we can play probably in December. Talking to all the owners, they definitely want to do it, and for players it’s important by that stage that they’re getting some income. Our intention is definitely to play, but we would only ever do it if everything is right from a safety perspective.”

The governor’s declaration, which expires Dec. 31, will authorize state agencies to expedite water management tools for local officials to quickly start mitigation activities, The World reported.

According to the order, extremely low stream flow and hot, dry conditions in Coos County led to the governor’s declaration.

With forecasted water supply conditions not expected to improve, the drought is likely to have significant economic impacts on the county’s farm, forest, recreation, drinking water and natural resource sectors, according to the order.

At a commissioner’s board meeting in April, Coos County Commissioner Melissa Cribbins informed the board that the local water master and regional water director both expressed concerns with the county’s domestic water wells going dry and not recovering.

The declaration in Coos County follows similar declarations in Curry, Jackson and Klamath counties in southwestern Oregon.

Wellington have been crowned Plunket Shield champions for the first time in 16 years, their longest ever gap between titles in New Zealand's first-class competition.

The Firebirds had a clear lead of 26 points at the top of the table when New Zealand Cricket announced on Monday that the final two rounds of this season's tournament would be scrapped as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

This is the 21st time the team has held the title since a round-robin format was introduced in 1921, but the side have finished runners up on three occasions since last taking the title in 2003/04.

Though Wellington's squad learned the news via WhatsApp, perhaps no player would be happier than Devon Conway, the only man in the tournament to finish above 500 runs after reaching a club record score of 327 not out against Canterbury earlier in the season.

Seventeen county sides have either cancelled or cut short overseas pre-season tours as of this week, with exception Nottinghamshire having been the only team not to initially include a warm-weather stint as part of their preparations for the 2020 campaign.

Middlesex, who had travelled to Oman, arrived back in the UK on Monday and became the final county to announce an alteration to their schedule, following Derbyshire (Zimbabwe), Leicestershire (Spain), Northamptonshire (Singapore) and Sussex (South Africa) earlier in the day.

The ECB has since announced that the earliest the county campaign may begin in response to the coronavirus outbreak is May 28, which was previously announced as the first day of the T20 Blast.

Leicestershire have appointed Colin Ackermann as their new captain across formats, making him the 39th player to earn the honour since the club earned first-class status in 1894.

The batsman joined the county on a two-year deal at the start of 2017 having just finished as the leading scorer in South Africa's first-class franchise tournament, and he first deputised as skipper at the end of the following season.

Ackermann then had a breakthrough campaign in 2019, recording seven half-centuries in County Championship action and finding great success with his part-time off-spin in the T20 format, claiming world record figures of 7-18 from four overs against Birmingham Bears at Grace Road in August.

The 28-year-old's exploits earned him a maiden international call-up for the Netherlands as the winter months began, where he went on to help the team secure the T20 World Cup Qualifier title in Dubai in November with an unbeaten 29 against Papua New Guinea in the final.

Colin Ackermann will succeed Paul Horton as Leicestershire captain if and when the county season gets under way

The winning margin by which Derbyshire defeated a Zimbabwe Select XI in Bulawayo last Saturday in the only competitive county pre-season fixture actually completed as scheduled.

The Falcons, playing their first 20-over game since making their inaugural Finals Day appearance in September, posted 174 for 5 after winning the toss, led by a Leus du Plooy knock of 79 not out that included six sixes.

In response, the representative side lost eight-cap national player Tinashe Kamunhukamwe to the third ball of their reply, delivered by Mattie McKiernan, and rising young stars Tadiwanashe Marumani and Milton Shumba likewise departed without score.

Ravi Rampaul, the leading wicket-taker in last year's T20 Blast, was again the pick of Derbyshire's bowlers, bowling Marumani and conceding just 14 runs from his four-over quota before the team called short their stay in the southern African nation.

Upon their arrival on March 9, Derbyshire had become the first county side to tour Zimbabwe since 2004.

The number of matches completed so far in the Dhaka Premier Division, the final top-tier tournament to see any cricket before COVID-19 postponements kicked in.

A full set of games took place in the opening round of the Bangladesh-based List A tournament, with Abahani Limited sitting top of the pile on net run rate after captain Mushfiqur Rahim struck his 12th ton in the format to guide the side to an 81-run win over Partex Sporting Club.

On Monday, half-centuries from Under-19 World Cup winners Tanzid Hasan Tamim and Towhid Hridoy saw Shinepukur home with three balls to spare against Abdur Razzak's Mohammedan Sporting Club, while Prime Bank squeezed out Gazi Group by nine runs in Mirupur thanks to former international allrounder Alok Kapali delivering figures of 2-32 alongside a catch and run-out.

There is no luck for fans planning to turn to the Legends of Rupganj for their cricket fix, however – the league's next three rounds have now been postponed as the coronavirus outbreak wreaks havoc with fixture lists.

All 145 players, staff members, and broadcasters tested for COVID-19 upon the sudden conclusion of the Pakistan Super League have been found to be clear of the disease.

The league was suspended indefinitely on Tuesday after batsman Alex Hales began to display possible symptoms of infection within 24 hours of arriving home in the UK from his stint with the Karachi Kings franchise.

Hales was among 18 overseas players to call time on their participation in the league at the end of last week as uncertainty grew surrounding travel restrictions, but as of Tuesday afternoon he had been unable to be tested for the coronavirus in the UK and remains in self-isolation.

Multan Sultans were leading the way before the PSL playoffs were postponed due to Alex Hales' cough and fever

June 4

The next official scheduled fixture between any international men's or women's sides is now England's first Test against the West Indies at Lord's in early June.

All international matches until that date have now either been postponed or cancelled outright, including games that had been set to take place this week between Sri Lanka and England, Australia and New Zealand, and India and South Africa.

Australia's women were due to open their tour of South Africa this weekend with an ODI clash in Durban, with both teams set to wear black kits in order to raise awareness of campaigns to eliminate gender-based violence. However, this series too has now been pushed back.

The region has suffered from drought since 2016. Five provinces have declared a state of emergency earlier this month. In most places, the Mekong is between 0.1 and 1 metre above the Eastern Sea level. Lack of rain, water use and more dams have increased salinity.

Ho Chi Minh City (AsiaNews) – Drought and water salinity are threatening the lives of 180,000 householfs in the Mekong Delta, south-western Vietnam.

Over the past two months, the number of residents affected by the crisis has increased, touching 10 of the region’s 13 provinces, especially Bến Tre, Kiên Giang, Cà Mau, Long An and Tiền Giang, which declared a state of emergency in early March.

Considered the ""rice bowl"" of Vietnam, the Mekong Delta supplies more half of the country’s rice. However, according to government estimates, more than 362,000 hectares of rice fields and 136,000 fruit trees will be lost this year.

The Mekong Delta has suffered drought since 2016. The water level is very low, about 20 per cent lower than the record low of four years ago. In most parts of the Delta, the Mekong is between 0.1 and 1 metre above the level of the Eastern Sea.

Experts say that the lack of rain, plus greater water use along the Mekong’s tributaries, as well as more dams, are behind the drought and the greater salinity.

One direct consequence for the local population is drinking water shortages, with a cubic metre of fresh water costing up to 200,000 dongs (US).

Nguyễn Thế Hải lives in Cần Giuộc, a district in Long An province. Every day, his “family has to buy fresh water to drink and cook rice and pay at least 150,000 dongs (US.75) per cubic metre. For a family of four or five people, this means spending at least a million a month (US), four times higher than the cost of local rice.”

The Water Supply Company in Bến Tre City, the capital of Bến Tre province, is also running out of fresh water with salt entering its pipes. For this reason, some 57,000 local families (205,000 people) have had to find alternatives sources of water at higher costs.

In Bạc Liêu province, the authorities built a network of canals in recent years to counter salinity. However, these have dried up. In addition to buying drinking water, many residents rent tankers.

Trần Kim Nhung lives in the Phước Long district. “We haven't had enough fresh water for two weeks,” she said. “To drink and cook, I have to buy expensive fresh water. How can we survive if we don't have water to drink? Only those who experience this situation can recognise the preciousness of fresh water.”

For Mr Nguyễn, who lives in Hồng Ngự, a municipality in Đồng Tháp province, “Fresh water in ponds contains chemicals from fertilisers, pesticides and pathogens. Our only hope is the coming rainy season” (April-October 2020).","Wed, 25 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_0325_-_Mekong.jpg,"['shortages', 'mekong', 'metre', 'province', 'threaten', 'water', 'delta', 'households', 'drought', 'tre', 'lives', 'fresh', '180000', 'rice']", ,drought

Telecommunication service providers said they have blocked access to facebook and several other social media platforms on the directive of the government which accused extremists of using the popular social media to spread hate speech and instigate violence against the Muslim minority in the country. (ISHARA S. KODIKARA / AFP)

(AFP) - Facebook has apologised for its role in the deadly communal unrest that shook Sri Lanka two years ago after an investigation found that hate speech and rumours spread on the platform may have led to violence against Muslims.

The riots in early 2018 erupted as anti-Muslim anger was whipped up on social media, forcing the Sri Lankan government to impose a state of emergency and block access to Facebook.

The tech giant commissioned a probe into the part it may have played, and investigators said incendiary content on Facebook may have led to violence against Muslims.

""We deplore the misuse of our platform,"" Facebook said in a statement to Bloomberg News after the findings were released Tuesday. ""We recognize, and apologize for, the very real human rights impacts that resulted.""

At least three people were killed and 20 injured in the 2018 unrest, during which mosques and Muslim businesses were burned, mainly in the central part of the Sinhalese Buddhist-majority nation.

The hate speech and rumours spread on Facebook ""may have led to 'offline' violence"", according to Article One, the human rights consultancy hired to conduct the investigation.

The consultants also suggested that before the unrest, Facebook had failed to take down such content, which ""resulted in hate speech and other forms of harassment remaining and even spreading"" on the platform.

Article One said one civil society organisation had tried to engage with the company on the misuse of Facebook as far back as 2009.

In 2018, officials had said mobs used Facebook to coordinate attacks, and that the platform had ""only two resource persons"" to review content in Sinhala, the language of Sri Lanka's ethnic majority whose members were behind the violence.

Facebook has 4.4 million daily active users in Sri Lanka, according to the report by Article One.

The firm said Tuesday it had taken a number of steps in the last two years to better protect human rights.

""In Sri Lanka... we are reducing the distribution of frequently reshared messages, which are often associated with clickbait and misinformation,"" Facebook said in a statement accompanying reports, which also looked at Indonesia and Cambodia.

It said it had also hired more staff, including Sinhala speakers, and started using detection technology to protect vulnerable groups.

- Concerns in Indonesia -

Article One also investigated the impact of Facebook's services -- including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram -- in Indonesia.

It found that in addition to political attacks and attempts to influence elections, vulnerable groups across the sprawling archipelago faced increased risks.

The sharing of images without consent, cyberbullying and sexual exploitation threatened women especially, the consultancy said.

""In some cases, women are blackmailed or even forced into abusive relationships or into situations of rape to avoid the embarrassment of nude photos being made public on Facebook's platform,"" said the report, released at the same time as the findings on Sri Lanka.

""In other cases, Facebook's platforms have been used to connect customers to sex workers, some of whom may be trafficked.""

Article One said it also ""found evidence of online bullying and child sexual exploitation, including online grooming of children"" on Facebook's platforms.

The social media company said that, like in Sri Lanka, it is ramping up efforts to protect its users from harm, including more staff and improved technology to identify hate speech in Indonesian.

Facebook has been rolling out a number of programmes to prevent misuse after coming under increasing pressure in recent years over a series of privacy scandals, as well as criticism of its slow response to human rights concerns.

Thailand's agricultural trade in the ASEAN market rose by 5.1 per cent year-on-year to 113.566 billion baht ($3.66 billion) in the first quarter of the year, driven by a rise in imports.

However, total agricultural exports fell 6.99 per cent to 75.415 billion baht from last year, data from the Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) show.

The core exports were sugar and sugar products, non-alcoholic beverages, and livestock.

Meanwhile agricultural imports from ASEAN neighbours jumped by 41.43 per cent or 38.151 billion baht, consisting mainly of vegetables – especially cassava and green beans – fish and other aquatic animals, and rice and grain.

Corn was imported in high quantities after crops in Thailand were hit by drought and pests.

Thailand’s first-quarter trade surplus in the ASEAN market dropped by 31.13 per cent year-on-year to 37.264 billion baht. Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia were Thailand’s top three regional trading partners.

Cambodia received 14.336 billion baht or 19.01 per cent of total Thai exports, consisting mainly of non-alcoholic beverages and pigs. Malaysia and Indonesia accounted for 16.20 per cent and 15.90 per cent of Thai farm exports, respectively.

Agricultural production in Thailand has slowed since the end of last year due to early drought and the economic impact of Covid-19.

The Magpies resumed Premier League action following the coronavirus-enforced stoppage and took a significant step towards survival against the 10-man Blades.

After John Egan was sent off in the 50th minute, Allan Saint-Maximin and Matt Ritchie put Newcastle in control.

Joelinton rounded off the win with his first league goal since his effort in a 1-0 win at Tottenham on August 25.

The Brazilian striker, a club-record signing in the close-season, had seen his previous 39 league shots fail to result in a goal.

Magpies manager Bruce was thrilled to see the former Hoffenheim man end his wait to find the net, revealing Joelinton had endured a tough time during the lockdown measures enforced by the British government to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

""We're all delighted for him,"" Bruce said afterwards. ""He probably suffered more in the lockdown, he had no family over and he was stuck in an apartment somewhere.

""It's been difficult for him but I'm delighted for him because he's a really good pro and he can only get better.""

Miguel Almiron supplied the assist for Joelinton, the South American pair and Saint-Maximin performing excellently as Newcastle's front three.

Newcastle are now 11 points clear of the bottom three with eight games remaining.

75,75,Drought Sri Lanka,Coronavirus in Guatemala compounds a long list of problems - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/feature/2020/05/04/coronavirus-Guatemala-violence-drought-poverty,"GENEVA

Aid groups worry that Guatemala, long one of Latin America’s most unequal countries, will be hit hard by the effects of COVID-19, piling further hardship on a population already suffering extreme poverty, violence, and years of climate change-driven drought.

As the number of confirmed cases passed 700, scores of people took to the streets of Guatemala’s cities in recent days, waving white and/or red flags, signalling they need food and medicine. Others, in poor neighbourhoods, hung them from their houses.

Many Guatemalans have lost their jobs or can’t access informal work due to strict lockdown measures, and a quarter of overseas remittances – approximately 12 percent of the country’s GDP – have stopped, according to Oxfam’s representative in the capital.

Ana María Méndez Libby, the aid group’s country head, described the situation as “complex”, especially due to drought ramping up poverty levels in rural areas, where half the population lives. “To put it politely, it has a very fragile social protection system, where health, food security, and water and sanitation are extremely bad,” she told The New Humanitarian.

Weak development, high levels of violence, and a lack of government accountability have seen mass emigration to the United States, increasingly of women and children and entire families rather than just the young Guatemalan men who used to more typically migrate.

A quarter of overseas remittances – approximately 12 percent of the country’s GDP – have stopped.

However, tough US anti-immigration policies – in particular a July 2019 law barring Central Americans from seeking asylum in the United States if they don’t seek it first in the countries they cross – have effectively shut the door on Guatemalan asylum seekers.

Dependent on Washington for aid, the Central American country is bound by a 2019 accord that obliges it to not only to accept Guatemalan deportees from the United States but also any failed asylum seekers the United States wants to return from El Salvador and Honduras.

Last month, as COVID-19 cases rose rapidly, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei suspended deportations after planes were found to be carrying large numbers of infected people. The US authorities now appear to be testing deportees prior to departure, and flights have resumed.

While considered a middle-income country by the World Bank, Guatemala has the second highest level of poverty in the Americas. Poverty – defined as earning less than $5 a day – is mostly concentrated in indigenous communities, where it is 2.8 times higher than in the rest of the population. At least 40 percent of Guatemalans are indigenous – from a range of groups including the Kaqchikel Maya, Garifuna, and Xinca.

Marginalised rural areas

On 25 April, the UN’s emergency aid coordination body, OCHA, reported that lockdown measures were exacerbating seasonal hunger in eastern Guatemala, already badly hit by a 2019 drought. According to health ministry figures cited by the UN, acute malnutrition cases in the department of Chiquimula have increased 56.6 percent compared to a year ago.

The area is located in the Dry Corridor – a region extending from Mexico to Panama that regularly suffers from floods and drought. Many people migrate from there to urban areas, often encountering violence and corruption in the cities before heading on northwards.

The Network for the Defence of Food Sovereignty in Guatemala, a local aid group known by the Spanish acronym REDSAG, told Prensa Libre that hunger and malnutrition couldn’t be coming at a worse time for parts of the Dry Corridor, where food reserves are lacking, prices of basic goods have risen, and unemployment is up.

Oxfam is working with local groups to deliver food, sanitary, and medical products in Guatemala, particularly to indigenous communities, including in the Dry Corridor.

Méndez Libby said the pandemic has forced Oxfam to innovate. Instead of sending in people from outside to distribute aid – and risk spreading the virus – it is transferring credit to locals’ phones and employing them to collect and distribute two months’ worth of essential goods in areas needing assistance.

Government lockdown measures include strict stay-at-home orders, overnight curfews, mandatory use of masks – with fines ranging between $914 and over $16,300 for those who fail to do so – and suspension of all public transport.

A study by the Guatemalan health ministry in 2017 showed that the government was spending fractions of its health budget in rural zones compared to in the country’s largest, wealthiest cities. “One understands why the Guatemalan population feels abandoned by the state on health matters,” the report concluded.

Méndez Libby said that COVID-19 assistance outside major towns had been inadequate. “The government has offered some relief, but it is not enough, it is not effective, it is not efficient,” she said. “They are not seeing the whole dimension, and they think that once things reopen it will be normal.”

“It is impossible to provide for everyone.”

In Patzún, a Kaqchikel Maya town of 55,000 people some 80 kilometres from the capital, a first case of COVID-19 was reported in early April. Many residents need emergency assistance due to the lockdown, but the government only sent an insufficient 60 aid boxes for the town’s entire population, according to one aid worker.

“It is impossible to provide for everyone,” the aid worker told TNH, speaking on condition of anonymity. “My sister (who works for the mayor) had to hand out 20 boxes, but they didn’t even provide a criteria for who to deliver them to.”

Deportation issues

Since the United States – which has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world – stepped up deportations under new COVID-19-related regulations in March, some 20 percent of infections in Guatemala have been traced to the returnees.

The National Roundtable on Migration, or MENAMIG, a group that coordinates Guatemalan organisations that work with migrants, reported a sharp increase in the numbers of deportees. During the first three months of 2020, 21,836 people were expelled to Guatemala, compared to 16,432 for the same period in 2019.

The government has faced criticism for the way it has handled returnees.

“The airport [in Guatemala City] was not an adequate facility to keep deportees,” said Juan José Hurtado, executive director of Pop Noj, a Guatemalan NGO that provides services to migrants and works with indigenous communities.

Migrants were then moved to an athletes’ dorm at a large sports centre known as the Domo Polideportivo. As of 22 April, this ad hoc reception centre held 226 returnees, with the rest quarantining at home, according to Alejandra Mena, a government migration spokesperson.

Deportees, including those from El Salvador and Honduras, are also arriving in Guatemala by land, via Mexico. Mexican border control agents load them on buses to the southern border with Guatemala, where, according to AP, they are instructed to cross informally due to the official closure of the border.

Father Juan Luis Carbajal, executive secretary of Pastoral de Movilidad Humana, a regional Catholic aid group, confirmed to TNH that some 300 people had been dropped off in recent days in the southern Mexican city of Villahermosa, before making their way to the Guatemalan border.

Meanwhile, civil society groups worry about non-Guatemalans being pushed back into the country, especially as they could contribute to the spread of COVID-19.

“We have no information from the government or the media about what is happening in our country with irregular migrants from other nationalities,” said Julia González Deras, executive coordinator of MENAMIG, referring to health services being provided for the international deportees. One of the big problems, she said, is that on the Mexican side of the border, health authorities are only checking the deportees’ temperatures, not for COVID-19 itself.

In addition to 6,500 Guatemalans, some 5,000 Hondurans and 1,600 Salvadorans were deported by the United States and Mexico between March and mid-April, according to the International Crisis Group, which described virus testing as “far from reliable or robust”.

Guatemala has officially refused to accept deportees of other nationalities. At least some returnees from El Salvador and Honduras appear to be heading south and making their way to their countries of origin despite the border closures.

President Giammattei also said many Guatemalans living undocumented in the United States are leaving the country due to their fear of being infected by the virus. “They arrive in Mexico, pay coyotes (traffickers) to cross at blind spots (along the border) and arrive in Guatemala without any control,” he said.

With the exception of domestic and gender-based violence, the authorities have reported a drop in violent crime since Guatemala’s strict lockdowns were imposed: 617 homicides between 1-28 March compared to more than 800 in preceding years.

But the lack of social safety nets and government support for those suffering the economic fallout of the lockdown may soon lead a new wave of poor Guatemalans to flee the country, warned Oxfam’s Méndez Libby.

“Those who have always tried to move will always move, whatever the circumstances, despite the huge restrictions and the militarisation of the borders,” she said. “People will always think that there is something better elsewhere.”

WFP is focused on mobilizing the assistance and resources needed to reach our 100 million beneficiaries we set out to reach in 2020. Even before COVID-19, hunger needs in 2020 were expected to rise with 135 million more people facing severe hunger this year. Ongoing political instability, macro-economic fragility, droughts, and other events such as locust swarms in East Africa, pointed to further deterioration of food security.

The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNet) shows that Nigeria, South Sudan, and Yemen face the risk of famine as critical levels of food insecurity could hit as soon as June, during the crucial lean season in many countries, when harvests are dormant. WFP projects 130 million more people in low-to-middle income countries will likely be driven into severe hunger this year from the socio-economic fallout the COVID-19 pandemic will bring, including heavy job losses and a drastic reduction in remittances.

WFP will seek to augment its humanitarian response wherever needed and possible and is urgently working to adapt, prioritize and scale up operations. Comprehensive country level assessments are already underway in some 40 WFP country offices and will provide WFP with a comprehensive picture of new food and assistance needs by June, as the WFP global scale-up plan is finalized.

WFP is working to support governments with food systems, social protection, and basic services - even in complex crises where WFP has historically established experience. WFP’s Medium Term Programme Framework is designed to augment this critical assistance.

Consultations with all Regional Bureaux to prepare the operationalisation of the framework in country offices continues.

WFP’s common logistics services will continue to provide the backbone for the global humanitarian COVID-19 response. In a discussion with the Atlantic Council on May 8, Executive Director, David Beasley pointed out WFP’s critical role in enabling the global response, “We don’t deliver just food. We are the humanitarian logistics coordinator for the entire United Nations.” He added, “We’re the biggest airline industry operating right now. If we weren’t already where we are, we’d have famine in many countries.” Our network of Humanitarian Response Hubs located in strategic locations around the world, along with cargo and passenger flights connecting these hubs to individual destinations, are supporting the steady flow of humanitarian and health cargo and personnel into affected areas.

Sustaining this part of the operation through 2020 will cost an estimated US$ 965 million as part of the updated Global Humanitarian Response Plan (GHRP). Adequate funding will be crucial to enable the global COVID-19 response in the world’s most fragile settings.","Fri, 22 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1518913-WFP%20COVID-19%20Situation%20Report%20%2308%2C%2022%20May%202020.png?itok=Oa7meCdh,"['response', 'situation', 'report', 'food', 'emergency', '2020', 'million', 'covid19', 'hunger', '08', 'critical', 'global', 'humanitarian', 'external', '22', 'world', 'wfp', 'famine', 'l3']", ,drought

He, however, urged the International Cricket Council, the Board of Control for Cricket in India and Sri Lanka Cricket to launch an investigation.

""We cannot let people get away all the time with lies. I request everyone, ICC, BCCI, and SLC to investigate this immediately,"" Silva told Sri Lankan newspaper Sunday Times.

The former SLC chairman of selectors said legends like Sachin Tendulkar, who won his maiden World Cup in 2011, deserve the respect and that's why it's the duty of the Indian government and to initiate an impartial probe.

""Just like we cherished our World Cup victory, players like Sachin (Tendulkar) cherish these moments for the rest of their lives. I think in the interest of Sachin and the millions of cricket fans across India, it's the duty of the Indian government and their cricket board to initiate an impartial inquiry to see whether they have won a fixed World Cup,"" de Silva said.



""When serious allegations like these are being made, it affects a lot of people. In this case not only us, the selectors, the players, and the team management but Indian cricketers who deservingly won the world title. We need to clear this once and for all for the greater good of the game we love,"" he added.

Aluthgamage had earlier stated in an interview that the match, which India won at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in 2011, was ""fixed.""

""The 2011 Cricket World Cup final was fixed. I stand by what I say. It took place when I was the minister of sports,"" Aluthgamage told Sri Lankan outlet newsfirst.lk.

""However, I do not wish to expose details for the sake of the country. The game against India in 2011, the game we could have won, was fixed.

""I say this with a responsibility and I can come forward for a debate. The people are concerned about it. I would not involve the cricketers in this.

80,80,Drought Sri Lanka,Water hyacinth pest chokes Iraq's vital waterways - Phys.org,https://phys.org/news/2020-06-hyacinth-pest-iraq-vital-waterways.html,"The water hyacinth—nicknamed the ""Nile flower"" in Iraq—is an invasive plant native to South America's Amazon basin that has ravaged ecosystems across the world, from Sri Lanka to Nigeria

The broad leaves and delicate purple flowers floating on the Euphrates look breathtaking—but they are suffocating the waterways of Iraq, celebrated as the ""land of the two rivers"".

The water hyacinth, nicknamed the ""Nile flower"" in Iraq, is an invasive plant native to South America's Amazon basin that has ravaged ecosystems across the world, from Sri Lanka to Nigeria.

The fast-spreading pest poses a special risk in Iraq, one of the world's hottest countries that is already suffering from regular droughts and shrinking water resources due to overuse, pollution and upstream river dams.

The exotic flower was introduced to Iraq just two decades ago as a decorative plant, but now the mighty Tigris and Euphrates rivers are being choked by its rapid spread.

Its glossy leaves form a thick cover, absorbing up to five litres (1.3 gallons) of water per plant a day and blocking sunlight and oxygen vital to the aquatic life below.

That has made the hyacinth a formidable floral foe for Iraq's fishermen, who sell hauls of river carp in local markets to those cooking ""masgouf"", a national delicacy.

Because of the infestation, carp are dying and fishing nets get caught in the tangle of flat leaves, roots and flowers that also hampers boat travel.

Because of the infestation, carp are dying below the surface, and the tangle of flat leaves, roots and flowers gets caught in fishing nets and hampers boat travel

""Our livelihoods are gone, all because of this Nile flower,"" said Jallab al-Sharifi, a fisherman in the southern province of Dhi Qar who makes his living on the Euphrates.

Another fisherman east of Baghdad who works the Tigris said his haul had dropped by as much as half.

Harvests at risk

The hyacinths have also impacted Iraqi farmers who already struggle with low water levels due to a series of dams built further upstream in Turkey and Iran.

The thick floating vegetation draws down water levels and clogs irrigation channels leading to agricultural fields.

""During this harvest, our vegetable sales in the local market were down by a third,"" said Ahmed Yasser, a farmer in a village near Kut, east of Baghdad.

The hyacinth causes another type of pressure—a 100 square metre (1,000 square feet) patch can weigh up to five tons, putting major strain on dilapidated riverside infrastructure, Iraqi officials warn.

The fast-spreading pest poses a special risk in Iraq, one of the world's hottest countries that is already suffering from regular droughts and shrinking water resources due to overuse, pollution and upstream river dams

In the village of al-Badaa, the thick columns of a brick bridge that once spanned a wide stretch of the Euphrates are now covered by hyacinths.

A dam further upstream encloses a swamp-like patch of land also covered by the plant.

If the flowers are not removed, ""the bridge and dam of al-Badaa will collapse,"" said Jalil al-Abboudi, the village sheikh.

""And if they collapse, the whole water supply system will collapse.""

That would deprive vast regions—all the way to Iraq's southernmost province of Basra—of the fragile water resources their ecosystems and economies rely on.

Iraq's oil-dependent economy is already projected to shrink by nearly 10 percent this year, according to the World Bank.

And a health crisis sparked by a shortage of safe drinking water in the south hospitalised some 100,000 people in 2018.

A boat removes Eichhornia crassipes, commonly known as water hyacinth, from the surface of the Euphrates river

'Spreads like wildfire'

Locals blame authorities for what they say have been years of neglect and insufficient maintenance.

""The lack of action by the ministry of water resources, and the fact that there have been no renovations of infrastructure, caused an invasion that reached potable water reserves,"" said Abboudi.

But Saleh Hadi, head of research at Dhi Qar's agriculture directorate, insisted the ministry was well aware of the dangers and working hard to mitigate them.

""The ministry of water resources is working to combat this plant mechanically by uprooting it from irrigation channels,"" he told AFP.

The perennial predicament has been made even worse this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Under normal conditions, Iraqi villagers along the banks of the Euphrates pluck out the plants by hand instead of using a chemical agent that would destroy the delicate ecosystem.

Iraqi villagers usually pluck out the plants by hand. But this year, a lockdown imposed to stem COVID-19 infections has allowed the hyacinth to spread mostly unhampered

But this year, a countrywide lockdown imposed to stem COVID-19 infections has allowed the hyacinth to spread mostly unhampered.

Some vigilantes, however, are defying the curfew to fight the parasitic flower which they see as a bigger threat to their livelihoods than the pandemic.

While villagers are sneaking out to uproot the plants by hand, Mohammed Kuwaysh, an environmental activist and member of a farming cooperative, is thinking even bigger.

His collective raised about $800 from local farmers to equip small speedboats to clear waterways by cutting hyacinths en masse.

""The government isn't listening, which allowed this flower to spread like wildfire,"" Kuwaysh said.

The case concerned Vijayakumar Thuraissigiam, a member of Sri Lanka’s Tamil ethnic minority who was apprehended about 25 yards north of the Mexican border near San Ysidro, Calif.

He sought asylum, saying he would face a credible fear of persecution if he were returned to Sri Lanka. His request was considered under “expedited removal” procedures called for by a 1996 law that streamlined asylum applications from people caught near the border and barred courts from reviewing most aspects of the determinations made under the procedures.

Mr. Thuraissigiam, a farmer, told an asylum officer that he had been savagely beaten in Sri Lanka by men who had blindfolded and abducted him. He said he had spent 11 days in a hospital recovering from his injuries.

Though their communication was imperfect, an asylum officer believed Mr. Thuraissigiam. But the officer rejected his request because Mr. Thuraissigiam could not identify the assailants or definitively establish their motives. An immigration judge affirmed that determination.

Mr. Thuraissigiam filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, noting that what had happened to him was consistent with documented instances of abuses directed against Tamils in Sri Lanka. A trial judge rejected the petition, saying it was barred by the 1996 law.

But a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled the law unconstitutional, saying that it violated the Constitution’s suspension clause. The clause says that “the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.”","Thu, 25 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/us/politics/25dc-scotus-immig/25dc-scotus-immig-facebookJumbo.jpg,"['thuraissigiam', 'court', 'saying', 'right', 'san', 'officer', 'lanka', 'sri', 'request', 'supreme', 'seekers', 'writ', 'asylum', 'rejected', 'object', 'law']", ,none
83,83,Drought Sri Lanka,Pakistan: Coronavirus lockdown threatens livestock in Thar desert - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/4/27/pakistan-coronavirus-lockdown-threatens-livestock-in-thar-desert,"Lockdown stops annual migration of desert’s dwellers in search of water and fodder for thousands of livestock.

A prolonged lockdown imposed by the Pakistani government to check the spread of the novel coronavirus poses a potential threat to the survival of hundreds of thousands of livestock in the country’s southeastern Thar desert, local residents and experts say.

The crippling restrictions have not only stopped the traditional annual migration of the desert-dwellers, or Tharis, to adjoining districts in search of water and fodder for the livestock – their main source of livelihood, accounting for 80 percent of the local economy – but have also barred the transportation of fodder in the region.

From April to June, the three driest months in the region, thousands of Tharis migrate to the districts of Mirpurkhas, Badin and Sanghar, where they find water and fodder for their cattle, as well as temporary jobs for themselves as harvesters on farmlands.

The Thar desert, which forms a natural boundary with neighbouring India, covers a region of 200,000 square km (77,000 square miles), has a population of 1.5 million and is ranked by the UN World Food Programme as the most food-insecure region in the country. Its annual rainfall is 250mm (10 inches).

While the Tharis have been able to struggle through previous droughts, each year makes the situation more desperate as more of their traditional sources of water go dry.

200424073528205

“At present, overall conditions are tough, due to the ongoing lockdown. But the situation concerning the livestock is harder,” Nashad Samoon, a resident of a remote village in the town of Mithi, told Anadolu news agency.

He said the administration was not allowing traditional migrants to move to the irrigated districts, while the unavailability of transport has led to an acute shortage of fodder and water.

Many of those who attempted to travel to the nearby districts were forcibly sent back by the security forces, said Samoon. “We have been left with no other choice but the rationing of fodder for our cattle,” he said.

“There might be alternative sources of income in other parts of the country. But here for us, there is no alternative source besides livestock,” he added.

“If this [source of income] is wiped out, that means everything is destroyed for us.”

Khatau Jani, a local journalist, said a lingering drought coupled with untimely rains and a recent onslaught by locusts in the region has led to a severe shortage of water and fodder for the livestock.

“Thar is one of Pakistan’s poorest regions, where 95 percent of the population lives in remote villages with only a single source of income,” he said.

“No other area has been affected by this lockdown more than Thar.”

Breeding of cattle threatened

Many Tharis trudged through the hot sand and roads to get to the adjoining districts days before the lockdown was imposed, but thousands are still waiting for the restrictions to ease, according to Samoon.

“Even those who managed to move are also facing troubles. Some have been forced to return while others are still stranded at different points,” he said.

Ali Akbar Rahimoo, head of Aware, a local non-governmental organisation which deals with water and livestock issues, fears a water and fodder crisis could affect the breeding of animals in the region in the months to come.

200329140507607

“Shortage of fodder and water will have a cascading effect on the breeding of cattle, which will eventually hit the region’s already weak economy,” Rahimoo told Anadolu.

He added that the closure of several cattle markets in Thar and adjoining districts due to the lockdown has compounded the economic hardships of the local communities.

Rahimoo said Thar’s cattle account for 15 percent of the country’s livestock.

“Wheat harvesting is still continuing [in nearby districts]. They can still find jobs for themselves and fodder for their cattle at the farmlands if the [lockdown] restrictions for them are eased immediately,” he said.

“Livestock is everything for Tharis. It’s a source of income, nutrition and property. Immediate actions need to be taken to save that.” said Rahimoo.

Pakistan has been under lockdown since late last month and will continue until May 9 as the country reported more than 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 281 deaths so far.","Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/8f9b3b6635c2460e976c24c783d22fc3_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['source', 'threatens', 'livestock', 'coronavirus', 'water', 'fodder', 'cattle', 'region', 'districts', 'lockdown', 'desert', 'tharis', 'pakistan', 'local', 'thar']", ,drought

WASCO wishes to draw the public’s attention to a Drought Warning issued by the Meteorological Services Department and concerns relating to this prevailing dry season and the impact thereof it is currently having on our water resource.

Dry conditions continue at this time and the prediction for this weather pattern has been forecasted well into 2020 by weather experts.

This has continued to deplete our raw water supply from the traditional abstraction points within the river system as well as the John Compton Dam reservoir.

As a result of this dry spell, WASCO is currently considering a number of options to ensure that the available water supply is distributed to all customers.

Considerations under review include the extension of a valving schedule which has already been implemented in some communities.

WASCO also urges customers to immediately implement the following measures:

• Repair all noticeable water leaks within the home and or premises

• Install or replace defective ball valves in your toilet tanks

• To conserve water, it is advisable to stop using a hose for the washing of vehicles and bicycles

• Stop watering lawns

• Shut taps while using soap on your body or shaving or brushing teeth

• Shut taps while washing/rinsing dishes or clothes

• Harvest rain water whenever possible for household use and watering plants

• Use water saving devices on the taps or hoses at home.

WASCO is mindful of the increased demand for water at this time as the country seeks to stem the spread of COVID-19 through the mandated health protocol of frequently washing of hands, clothing etc. and of course Social Distancing.

86,86,Drought Sri Lanka,WFP Annual evaluation report for 2019 - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/wfp-annual-evaluation-report-2019,"Foreword

It is often in times of crisis that the virtues of science and data, objectivity and truth come to the fore.

As WFP supports the global response to the devastating effects of COVID-19, evaluation has never been more relevant in producing the evidence that will help light a path for our leaders, policy-makers and programmers to support decision-making and better performance.

A key commitment of WFP’s Evaluation Policy (2016-2021)1 is to deliver the right evidence to the right people at the right time, measuring up to the ambition of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

This 2019 Annual Evaluation Report, the fourth produced under the current policy, highlights the significant steps taken to enhance evaluation use through strategic planning. It presents a snapshot of evidence generated by the different types of centralized and decentralized evaluations carried out during the year. It also reveals the state of the evaluation function: measuring evaluation coverage, quality, use, funding and partnerships through key performance indicators.

In 2019, 17 centralized evaluations were completed or ongoing, including three policy evaluations, Update of WFP’s Safety Nets policy (2012), the People Strategy (2014-2017) and the Gender Policy (2015-2020); three strategic evaluations, WFP’s Capacity to Respond to Emergencies, Funding WFP’s Work and WFP School Feeding Contributions to the SDGs; and a corporate emergency evaluation, WFP emergency response in northeast Nigeria.

The year also saw 18 decentralized evaluations completed and 25 new ones begin. While school feeding continues to be the leading programmatic area, the range of decentralized evaluations is broadening to include smallholder agriculture market support, emergency preparedness, climate adaptation and asset creation and livelihood support.

However, numbers alone do not provide adequate description to a year of transformation for the Office of Evaluation. Of the developments detailed in this report, three shifts were remarkable. The first shift, in line with WFP’s Integrated Road Map, was to lay the foundations for a more agile, better equipped evaluation function to produce timely evidence to feed into the design of each new country strategic plan. Five Country Strategic Plan Evaluations were initiated in 2019 (Bangladesh, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, and Timor-Leste), and, at the time of writing, a further 11 are set to be delivered in 2020 (Afghanistan, China, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Gambia, Honduras, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lebanon, Morocco, Mozambique, the Syrian Arab Republic and Zimbabwe).

The second shift, responding to country needs and Agenda 2030 priorities, was to direct greater attention to evaluations of global strategic value by strengthening evidence partnerships and capacities to deliver more syntheses and joint and interagency evaluations. WFP’s first synthesis of WFP country portfolio evaluations (Sahel and Horn of Africa) was completed in 2019, and a second,

Evidence and lessons from WFP’s policy evaluations, will be completed in 2020. WFP also participated in three inter-agency humanitarian evaluations,

The drought response in Ethiopia; the System-wide scale up of the humanitarian response to Cyclone Idai in Mozambique; and Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, and collaborated in the UNESCO-led Synthesis of evaluative evidence related to SDG 4.5 – equality and inclusion in education.

The third shift was to build a concerted platform of support to deliver impact evaluations. WFP’s Impact Evaluation Strategy (2019-26) responds to the growing need of countries, donors and policymakers for high-quality evidence to better understand what interventions work (and do not) in fragile and humanitarian contexts, places where the battle to achieve Zero Hunger will be won and lost. Of the priorities identified for generating WFP impact evaluation evidence, two impact evaluation portfolio ‘windows’ opened in 2019,

Cash-based transfers and gender, and Climate and resilience, with a 'window' for School-based programming set to open in 2020.

While less of a shift than a continuation of policy, considerable attention was given to strengthening capacities and building partnerships in 2019. A Capacity Development Strategy (2020-24) was designed to strengthen the evaluation cadre and ensure a coherent approach to evaluation capacity development across WFP. A Monitoring and Evaluation FIT Pool was established comprising 179 candidates selected from more than 4,000 applicants. And continuing our commitment to support country-level capacity strengthening, the evaluation offices of WFP regional bureaux were prominent in organizing workshops, building partnerships and contributing to inter-agency coordination processes to enhance national evaluation capacities.

It was a year in which the Office of Evaluation led or participated in 15 different UNEG working groups; the Inter-Agency Humanitarian Evaluation steering group; and saw the Director of Evaluation appointed Co-Chair of EvalPartners, a global partnership aimed at raising awareness of the importance of evaluation towards achievement of the SDGs. Critically, WFP also struck a number of partnerships in 2019 with governments, donors,

UN agencies and academic organizations to help deliver impact evaluations, notably with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (2019-23) with the World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation Unit.

Measuring results against key performance indicators, 2019 was notable for the growth in evaluation coverage. The proportion of active WFP policies evaluated moved into a majority for the first time, with 56 percent – 15 out of 27 – evaluated in 2019 compared to 39 percent in 2018. The percentage of WFP country offices completing at least one decentralized evaluation within the previous three years rose to 46 percent (39 percent in 2018). While coverage grew overall, the percentage of ongoing corporate emergency responses evaluated within the previous four years continued to fall from close to three-quarters in 2016 to 39 percent in 2019, a trend influenced, in part, by the spike in the number of humanitarian crises facing the international community.

The quality of WFP evaluations registered a dip for the first time under the current policy. According to independent assessors, 78 percent of evaluations ‘met’ or ‘exceeded’ requirements in 2019 compared to 90 percent in 2018. While completed centralized evaluations in 2019 ‘met’ or ‘exceeded’ requirements, four of the 14 decentralized evaluations were assessed as ‘partially meeting’ or ‘approaching’ requirements.

Looking forward, the Office of Evaluation will increasingly engage in joint, inter-agency humanitarian and system-wide evaluations and syntheses with our partners, including the Romebased and other UN agencies, with the aim of delivering evidence to support countries to achieve the SDGs.

The 2019 Annual Evaluation Report is presented in three parts. Part 1 explains the purpose of evaluation, how it is evolving in line with the WFP strategic direction and trends in its operating environment. Part 2 reports major developments in evaluation and assesses progress against key performance indicators. Part 3 looks ahead, presenting the outlook for the evaluation function and highlighting areas for attention in the coming years.

I hope you will find these pages informative as we face the challenges ahead.

87,87,Drought Sri Lanka,The onset of Southwest Monsoon comes with a different shade | Skymet Weather Services - Skymet Weather,https://www.skymetweather.com/content/weather-news-and-analysis/the-onset-of-southwest-monsoon-comes-with-a-different-shade/,"Weather News and Analysis

The onset of Southwest Monsoon mostly springs a pleasant shade, so different from the past few and rarely a repeat of the earlier ones. The first phase takes place in three spurts. The first knock is over the South Andaman Sea and the Nicobar Islands around 22nd May. The next stop follows within days to reach the North Andaman Sea and Sri Lanka on 26th May. The much-awaited mainland arrival of the Southwest Monsoon is announced around 01st June covering minuscule portion of the South Peninsula. Sometimes it may not strictly observe these stops and could jump or skip to reach the next.

The monsoon current arrived over the South Andaman Sea on 17th May, 5 days before its usual arrival. There were heavy rains thereafter over Sri Lanka and North Andaman Sea in association with the formation of cyclone Amphan but the NLM (Northern Limit of Monsoon) remained unchanged. Looks like, the sea conditions will be bubbling with the monsoon drivers on either side of the coastline in the next few days. Close on heels of Cyclone Amphan in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea also may respond shortly, pushing the monsoon line.

There are no linkages between arrival of Southwest Monsoon over the Andaman Sea or Kerala and overall seasonal performance. The earliest arrival of monsoon over Kerala was 18th May 2004 and the most delayed on 18th June 1972. Both years were droughts, the latter severe than the former. The earliest arrival since 2010 was 29th May in 2011 and 2018. The former one was a normal monsoon and the latter nearly drought.

The complete monsoon onset over the country takes place in three phases. The first one advances from south to north over peninsular India along with northeastern parts and the second relay the current over central and eastern parts. The third and the final push is over North India to establish the current. The first phase invariably takes a good leap just in few days but the second half of advancement is mostly in bits and pieces. This also means that the complete onset after the initial push keeps getting complicated and advances in many installments. However even these dates have hardly any strong connection with the overall performance.

The Southwest Monsoon is likely to arrive around 28th May within a margin of 2 days. The conditions are shaping up in the equatorial belt strengthening the crossflow. NLM may take one big leap to announce before time ingress.","Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.skymetweather.com/content/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Monsoon-in-Kerala.jpg,"['comes', 'north', 'sea', 'onset', 'southwest', 'monsoon', 'shade', 'arrival', 'takes', 'different', 'south', 'days', 'andaman']", ,drought
88,88,Drought Sri Lanka,Who Will Survive the Clout Drought? | Highsnobiety - Highsnobiety,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/clout-drought-quarantine-content/,"The longer we stay inside, the more life feels like the music video for Green Day’s “Longview” — the ultimate paean to suburban ennui. That video was so perfect in capturing the essence of grungy rec rooms, a concept that was totally foreign to me until I made white friends in elementary school and started hanging out at their houses. One of them had an older brother with a heavy smoking habit, so seeing the plaid couch in that Green Day video, spent cigarettes filling up an ashtray on the table, and a TV set that was at least a decade old ticked off all the boxes — I could practically smell the baked-in odors of old smoke and schwag weed.

Billie Joe Armstrong sang of a particular kind of boredom we now call #firstworldproblems. Before the internet was in our pockets (let alone in every house), it was a bummer if you had hundreds of cable channels at your disposal and yet everything on TV sucked. It’s not unlike the extended staycation many of us find ourselves in now, except instead of aimlessly flicking through the boob tube, we’re flicking through the endless scroll of content that either contributes to the growing sense of unease, helplessness, and despair gnawing at the pits of our stomachs, or momentarily distracts us from it.

One of my favorite distractions is @hidden.ny, a progenitor of the “archive” Instagram, an account prioritizing deep-cut photos where inference based in a foundational knowledge of street culture fills in the context you'd normally expect in the captions. It's part-Superfuture/NikeTalk/Splay, seminal online fora in their own right that influenced the way we talk about sneakers, streetwear, and music today. Seeing a photo of Nigo chilling with Paris Hilton, or Pharrell's iced-out Blackberry and Rubik's Cube chain from that inimitable 2006 BET freestyle reminds older heads that they were there before street culture blew up and became a meme simplified to “Which Off-White™ Nike Are You?” based on your birth year (and the dates begin in 1999! Feel old yet?!).

But something's happened to influencers and content aggregators during quarantine. Welcome to The Clout Drought™. It's where social platforms and online content creators seemingly have a larger audience than ever, but have hit the internet equivalent of cable television: millions of channels but nothing's on.

In some ways, it feels like a lot of the accounts I follow are on re-runs. Or they've done the thing TV channels do, where they either air a Law & Order: Special Victims Unit marathon or every single Fast & Furious movie all weekend long. Why put in the work to highlight the new and novel when you can get just as many eyeballs by rehashing things you already know people like? I swear, if I see another photo of a dyed hemp Stüssy x Nike Zoom Spiridon Caged 2, or an artfully-placed 1985 OG Air Jordan 1 colorway (Storm Blues and Ash Greys, you’re on notice) on my feed, I might just defenestrate myself.

“I've seen accounts I follow devolve pretty clearly,” says Chris Black, a writer and cultural commentator whose taste is generally deemed impeccable by other people on the internet. “You're on the road constantly; you're in these great hotels; you're wearing these beautiful clothes; and you're at these beautiful restaurants. Then all of a sudden you're stuck in your apartment, and it's another selfie or a picture of a stack of books. I can tell you're running out of ideas.”

Lockdown has made it impossible to flex on a plane or five-star hotel room. People who otherwise enjoy enviable existences on the timeline have gone silent or otherwise given a look at their real lives, the humble abodes they spend most of their time on airplanes escaping (cue: “Wow king, you live like this?”). The only food going on IG stories are things either created at home or delivered, which is nothing like securing a table at a restaurant with a years-long waiting list. IG Live has exposed celebrity and influencer culture for the farce that it is, with plenty of fake-it-til-you-makers trying to connect with their audience in a real way, but finding that they actually don't have anything to say.

“I do think that this shit is sussing out true creativity,” adds Black. “It's forcing people to do things in a different way, and also figuring out what your audience truly responds to versus just shitting stuff out that you find.”

In fact, some of us are taking this time to be more creative than ever. You know, like how Sir Isaac Newton, while in quarantine during the bubonic plague, used the opportunity to discover calculus (yay!). Billie Eilish even told Zane Lowe in a recent Beats One interview that she’s managed to write an entire song in quarantine! That’s cool and all, but Dolly Parton wrote “Jolene” and “I Will Always Love You” on what she called “a good writing day.”

But the truth is, a lot of us are finding it harder and harder to do anything slightly above the equivalent of jack shit, especially the millions of newly unemployed and underemployed individuals trying to work out their own salvation in this fraught period.

Cam Hicks, like many photographers, certainly isn't shooting anything at the moment. But he did take this time to release his first book, For the Porch, which managed to sell out of its first copies when it was released online last week at Dover Street Market and Paradigm Publishing. It was a calculated move on his part. For one, he wanted to make something that would set him apart from other photographers, and second, it's an ideal way to keep himself busy as he starts to think of his next steps.

For the past two or three years, he's felt like there was an oversaturation in the fashion and creative industries, and a lot of repetition in terms of concepts and ideas. He brings up the idea of economic “creative destruction,” in which an economic structure incessantly renews itself, and believes that's exactly what we're experiencing right now, and it's been long overdue. It reminds me of a Sade clip that's been making its rounds on Twitter where she talks about the importance of taking a break. “It gives you a chance to realize why you're doing what you do, and actually want to do what you do, not just do it because you're already there and you're on a roll,” she says.

Indeed, with global fashion weeks being cancelled, both street style photographers and their always-fitted subjects find themselves at a crossroads too. Some have turned the lens on themselves, including Tyler Joe, whose hilarious, personality-driven Instagram posts include branded content with Samsung and Matchesfashion, for whom he documented all the hard work that goes into a TikTok video. French photographer and Air Max addict Julien Boudet self-styled, shot, and modeled in a lookbook for Toronto streetwear label 3.PARADIS, who sent the clothes to the Luxembourg home where he's riding out isolation.

Stylist, consultant, and model Aleali May is used to being on the other side of the camera as one of fashion week's most flicked-up fit gods. In our recent Vibe Check podcast, she admits she's been doing more of a reset, catching up on her favorite fashion documentaries, digging through her wardrobe archives, and figuring out ways to make her styling and consulting gigs work remotely.

About a month ago, Evan — a self-aware, supercilious Canadian better known on Instagram and YouTube as @fuckhopsin — posted a video titled “The Instagram Archive Page Subculture - A Critique On Content Curation.” Part-Destiny 2 gameplay, part-valid critique on creation versus aggregation, it's sort of a “Who Watches the Watchmen?” moment for people whose primary hobbies include screenshotting Virgil Abloh's Instagram Stories and mining places like KanyeToThe or BapeTalk for photos of streetwear and gear in the pre-blog era.

He cites @liljupiterr and @hidden.ny as — for all intents and purposes — the godfathers of this archive shit. But with great power comes great responsibility, and in the video he gripes about how both accounts sometimes gravitate towards posting similar images of the same sneakers (sup, Dior Jordan 1s?) and jawns-copping tastemakers (mainly former homies Lil Uzi Vert and Playboi Carti) rather than use their sizable platforms to put a shine on under-appreciated labels or give more context to the neophytes who aren't as hip to the history of a particular silhouette or designer, but whose fashion knowledge is limited to whatever's been memed in the past few weeks (i.e. this person has Googled “where to buy Yankee with no brim”).

“I've seen a lot of people just stick with a certain formula that someone else is successful with and attempt to replicate that,” he laments. It reinforces a groupthink around what's cool without providing any real context as to why something is held in such high regard. It dumbs down aesthetic appreciation to soulless appropriation.

The result is a scene of similar pages with obscure-sounding names that — in Evan's words — is “a lot of people copying each other and not necessarily providing anything new or bringing extra information to the table.” In a chicken-versus-egg phenomenon, it's as if the popularity of @liljupiterr and @hidden.ny spawned its own fuccboi continuum populated by Lil Uzi fit pics, Revenge X Storm Low Tops, and pre-2010 Rick Owens Geobaskets/Dunks (when they still had the trademark-infringing design on the side, an amalgamation of Nike's Swoosh and Puma's Formstripe). Instead of championing discovery, it champions conformity, which is why the Clout Drought™ is also a time for separating the A-alikes from the real deal.

Among the stellar follows during the Clout Drought™ include @organiclab.zip, whose dedication and consistency to GORP drip and trail-ready kicks is commendable. Then there's accounts like @hartcopy (run by Highsnobiety social editor Tim Suen) and @samutaro, which evolved from the personal page of London-based denim expert and trend forecaster Samuel Trotman (the name is a play on Japanese denimhead label Momotaro, and his avatar is the “Fuck 'Em” safety pin from 2009's Supreme x A.P.C. collab). Both do something novel in the age of visually-dominant internet culture: They have faith that their audience cares enough to read.

“I saw a lot of people sharing images and posting them but there was no real kind of thought or understanding of the context of where they came from,” says Trotman. “I was seeing a lot of these young kids who are good at creating an aesthetic and bringing an interest around these brands, but I felt like there needs to be more of a level of understanding and knowledge behind it.”

What I especially appreciate about the work Suen and Trotman are putting into their accounts is they're not just reminding us of cool shit we already know exists, they're putting people onto things whose time may have finally come. Sure, you'll see the Travis Scott SBs on @hartcopy, but you'll also learn about the 2004 Hello Kitty Prestos that only existed in whispered back issues of obscure Japanese sneaker magazines. Trotman will alternate between narratives about designer basketballs, then highlight the work of resin artist Chris Bakay, or post about the Korean-Americans who vigilantly kept watch over their communities during the L.A. Riots. They offer deeper, substantial chunks out of the monolith of street culture rather than just the high-engagement, low-hanging junk food of so many other accounts.

Trotman admits that he didn't think anyone would even read his captions when he first started taking a more narrative approach to his platform. Your average “long-form” Instagram caption maxes out around 2,200 characters (about 365 words), which is only a little over a paragraph. Meanwhile, @hartcopy puts the text right on the image, a layout similar to tomes like Shoes Master or Lightning's Nike Chronicle Deluxe, and certainly pleasing ephemera enthusiasts who always wondered what the Japanese text translated to.

These accounts represent the antithesis to “gatekeeper” culture, the notion that a thing can only truly belong to its earliest, most fervent adopters. Sneakers and street culture are mainstream now, and there's no stopping that. But what @samutaro and @hartcopy provide are ways to keep it honest, accountable, and — most importantly — fun.

It restores the inherent nerdiness of jawns enthusiasm, encouraging people to issue corrections in the comments (which sometimes get updated in the caption), or reminisce about even more obscure sneakers and collaborations. It's the crass, conversational tone of forum culture melded with the accessibility of Instagram. And maybe these kinds of self-contained communities will eventually lead us out of the Clout Drought™ and into the promised land of content.

“Kids should be able to learn through other people like we've learned, and this is just a new means of how information is being presented,” says Trotman. “I didn't ever want to just write like, a cringy one-line tag. I wanted to add something more interesting to the table.”","Thu, 14 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.highsnobiety.com/thumbor/SjYPn_F7244dCEyFc7XCq_YT6S8=/1200x720/static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/14155633/ED_Web_Clout_Drought_1200x720_feat.jpg,"['youre', 'clout', 'content', 'street', 'survive', 'lot', 'drought', 'accounts', 'work', 'video', 'instagram', 'trotman', 'highsnobiety', 'culture']", ,drought

91,91,Drought Sri Lanka,How Kachchh's Nomadic Pastoralists Are Dealing With COVID-19's Challenges - The Wire,https://science.thewire.in/environment/rabari-kachchh-nomadic-pastoralists-livestock-lockdown-movement-restriction/,"Featured image: Naniben’s camp in a field in Morbi in March, before the lockdown. Photo: Natasha Maru.

“Aavu toh kadi dithu nathi” (I have never seen something like this), said Naniben when I asked her on the phone about the lockdown.

Naniben belongs to the nomadic Rabari pastoralist community of Kachchh, Gujarat. A part of Naniben’s family moves with their sheep and goats throughout the year, living in a migrating camp under the open sky. When the government announced its nationwide lockdown to try and contain the spread of COVID-19 in late March, Naniben and several other families from her community were in a camp far away from home in Morbi district.

While the country has been been focused on the mobility (or lack of it) of migrant workers – and rightly so – what has the lockdown meant for pastoralists like Naniben, who rely on movement for their livelihoods?

When I asked her about her feelings towards the COVID-19 pandemic two weeks into the lockdown, Naniben sounded nonchalant, aware of the unfolding pandemic but unaffected. They were going about their business as usual, she said, moving from farm to farm, village to village, all mobile despite the lockdown. However, cracks in their resilience are also beginning to show as new anxieties come to the fore.

Sometimes 2 km, sometimes 20, the Rabari move every few days, going east to mainland Gujarat for the winter and summer months before moving back west to Kachchh for the monsoons. They use mobility to take advantage of agricultural ‘hotspots’ in Gujarat as well, such as the cotton-growing Morbi region and the wheat-fields of Bhal. These regions have assured harvests even in years of low rainfall thanks to bore-wells and canal irrigation from the Sardar Sarovar Dam.

In these places, the Rabari have a chance to get nutritious fodder for their animals and to earn cash or grain in exchange for manure deposits from their sheep. Sheep manure is very nutritious and costs farmers less than chemical fertilisers. With arrangement like this, the Rabari have cultivated mutually beneficial relationships with farmers over the years and are valued within the local agrarian system.

Characterised by variable rainfall, drought cycles, sandy soils and salty groundwater, the dryland region of Kachchh is home to several pastoralist communities that overcome these environmental barriers through some degree of mobility. Last summer, Kachchh experienced its harshest drought in 30 years, but the subsequent monsoon was unusually late and violent, extending well into November. As a result, Gujarat’s harvest was delayed – as was Naniben’s winter migration. So the Rabari had a markedly short migration period this year, and spent less than three months in mainland Gujarat compared to the eight last year. In fact, Naniben said had never experienced such a short migration cycle before.

By the time the lockdown was partly lifted in the area on May 3, Naniben was already making her way back to Kachchh, although some of her relatives had chosen to go further ahead, to Bhal. The late winter rainfall in Kachchh had allowed for a summer harvest and early rain in June provided new sprouts of grass for grazing, allowing the pastoralists to return early.

The primary source of income for the Rabari shepherds is the sale of live animals. A growing global meat market has made pastoralism an attractive livelihood option despite the taboos against slaughter in the region. The pastoralists normally command the price and negotiate informally with the trader, who purchases animals directly from the camp. However, sales since March have been dismal due to restrictions on the export of livestock.

When the lockdown first began, the pastoralists were confident that they would be able to sell animals in a few months’ time, and at comfortable prices. The low input costs and the long lifespan of livestock mean the pastoralists can hold onto their stock until they can charge a price they like. But with the lockdown, and no respite in sight, their optimism has given way to anxiety. “Khule tyaare hachu (when trade opens, we will know),” Ishwarbhai Rabari, a member of the community, said indicating some uncertainty over his fortunes.

India sells close to 7 lakh small ruminants each year, mostly to countries in West Asia such as Oman, Dubai and the United Arab Emirates. The Tuna port in Kachchh, under the Deendayal Port Trust, is the preferred port for livestock exports. In late April, the government issued an order allowing exports from the port but revoked the permission within five days as the port administration grew concerned about novel coronavirus transmission through the animals.

As a result, the pastoralists and traders were unable to make a profit from exports even after peak demand during the month of Ramzan. In addition, restrictions on local movements of traders and vehicles also made local trade harder.

Abubhai, a livestock trader in Kachchh, said they were using their savings to meet their needs. In June, Abubhai had been able to supply animals to the animal market in Anjar for domestic trade, but that isn’t likely to be enough as access to key markets in big cities, especially in other states, remains limited.

Apart from animal traders, the wool-shearers and contractors associated with pastoralism have also suffered in the lockdown. Manubhai, a contractor from Rajkot, missed the pre-monsoon shearing cycle. Traditional shearers from Rajasthan who he works with were unable to travel to Gujarat. With the drop in international demand for wool in this period, he struggles to sell wool collected in February. The Gujarat government announced no relief measures for this sector, nor for the pastoralists and allied industries.

“Gaamwala ne kai aapti hase toh theek, pan amane vagada wala ni koi sambhar nathi leti sarkar (They may be giving something to those in the villages [referring to ‘settled’ farmers] but the government is not checking on us who are in the bush),” Dayabhai Rabari said.

The image of a Rabari pastoralist herding a flock of sheep by the roadside, stick in hand, sack on shoulders, popularly adorns pamphlets inviting tourists to Gujarat. But the government in Gujarat, like many others, provides little or no support to non-milk-related livestock-based livelihoods, often appropriates common grazing resources for big business interests, and hasn’t provided adapted social services, such as education and health, to support their mobile lifestyles.

Operating at ecological and social interstices, pastoralists have imbibed diversity, flexibility and self-organisation within their lifeworld to adapt to their uncertainties. They cut across the fragmented, enclosed and privatised farmlands, roads and highways. During the lockdown, they walked or hitchhiked through their extensive networks criss-crossing districts and bypassing the need for buses and trains. They reduced their dependence on essentials by relying on grain from farmers and dairy from their animals. Meanwhile, they also earned through ancillary sources within their multi-resource income portfolio, which often includes land given on lease to contract farmers, rented tractors or trucks, secondary flocks, etc.

But not all pastoralists in India have had the same opportunities. The Rabari experience favourable interactions with farmers and local state agents, like the police, who provide free passage and other support. The reason is that the Rabari is a large community in Gujarat that falls within dominant religious and caste categories that often mark social ties in the region. Many other pastoral communities have been barred from villages, have faced food and fodder shortages and have also not been able to sell meat or milk. The Muslim pastoralists in the north Indian states in particular have also faced religious persecution due to the deadly communal politics.

Situated in a complex economic, social and political milieu, the Rabari have specialised in managing environmental variability through their movement. A research project called ‘Pastoralism, Uncertainty and Resilience‘ at the Institute of Development Studies in the UK asks what lessons we can learn from how pastoralists engage with uncertainties. (Editor’s note: The author is part of this project.) Based on a six-country study, including my doctoral research with the Rabari in India, this project aims to apply lessons from pastoralist contexts to address global challenges where uncertainty is pervasive, including disease outbreak.

Trapped between uncertainties related to both the weather and the pandemic in the last few months, the case of the Rabari shows how mobility has been enabled and constrained in different ways to adapt to these extraordinary circumstances.

93,93,Drought Sri Lanka,How to Empower Women Who Are Losing the Most From the Climate Crisis - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/women-climate-crisis-empowering-2645574344.html,"By Tharanga Gunawardena

Extreme climate events are increasingly threatening countries and livelihoods. Devastating natural disasters and unpredictable weather have made communities more vulnerable and impoverished, especially women. According to the United Nations, 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. But what makes them more susceptible to the effects of climate catastrophe?

According to the World Bank, people in low-income communities suffer the most from these events, due to poverty, lack of resources and of awareness. Sudden climate catastrophes such as floods, wildfires and droughts displace people and affect their income. Within these communities, cultural barriers, gender norms and lack of education leave women even further behind men. They are left to take care of families, work in farming for low wages, with little knowledge of survival skills (in 2004, for example, more women in Thailand died of the tsunami because they stayed back looking for their children and because culturally, they are not taught skills such as swimming, climbing trees, etc.).

Lack of education makes women more dependent on their families and communities, less employable, with little opportunity to move beyond where they are born. Therefore, when sudden climate disasters strike, they are more vulnerable. The responsibility of looking after children further jeopardizes them. Furthermore, climate emergencies are often followed by health risks in South Asian countries, such as the spread of diseases like malaria, dengue, etc. It is the mothers who are hardest affected by these tragedies, often being unable to provide sufficient healthcare for their children.

At the same time, climate disasters affect agriculture in poorer areas, which directly impacts women. In India, 80% of all economically active women are in the agriculture sector, comprising 33% of the total agriculture labor force and 48% of self-employed farmers. Many women in Africa walk miles in search of water; severe droughts worsened by the climate crisis mean that they have to travel further, risking their health and safety, and their children's. In Central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk.

Men's stories are no less distressing. Unreliable rain patterns force them to work for longer hours, search for jobs beyond their communities, and lose income due to crop failures. However, this makes women work twice as hard to support their husbands to earn a living while looking after children. In developing countries, women are often given no education or independence and lack employment opportunities. As a result, they are under-represented in society. Globally, the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments is only 24% as of 2019. The UN Climate Change Conference COP24 in 2018 had only 38% representation of women, with only 1% increase from the previous year. These numbers demonstrate the lack of participation of women in key policy- and decision-making, limiting their ability to advocate for climate solutions. Two-fifths of countries worldwide limit women's property rights; in 19 countries, women still do not have equal ownership rights to immovable property. Disregarding half of the world's population and their needs will not bring sustainable, inclusive or holistic climate-mitigation actions.

Resilience Through Education Educating women about climate change and its impact will be pivotal to making them climate-resilient. In Zambia, 78% of small-scale farmers are women. Severe droughts and erratic weather patterns have cost the country more than $13.8 billion in crop failures. Lack of education and exposure make it difficult for women in Zambia to progress beyond traditional beliefs to understanding the reasons behind crop failure. To remedy this, they are being introduced to improved weather forecasting tools, knowledge and consultation on climate change, to prepare them better for the next farming seasons.

In Latin America, the World Food Programme is helping women in indigenous communities between Ecuador and Colombia adapt climate-smart farming by combining scientific knowledge with traditional local practices to promote climate-resilient activities, such as cocoa cultivation, to earn a living and increase food sufficiency within communities. In addition, climate-smart projects such as the Lima Work Programme on Gender (LWPG) aim to advance equal participation of women, promote gender-responsive climate policy and mainstream gender in the UNFCCC process. Involving women in key decision-making within communities and empowering them with skills improves their resilience and climate-adaptive action. In 2015, Seacology, in collaboration with a local NGO, conducted a mangrove conservation project in Sri Lanka, replanting 9,600 acres of mangrove forests that have been cut down. The project provided alternative job training and microloans to approximately 12,000 impoverished women in 1,500 small fishing communities, teaching them to be climate-smart and become ground-level leaders, fostering sustainable farming methods. In addition, UNEP surveyed 32 villages in six remote districts in Bangladesh and identified 11 occupations that could use solar energy, benefiting nearly 300 women directly. Access to clean energy helps women in impoverished communities work less in the fields and focus more on their families. Including women in more decision-making positions, educating them with transversal skills and involving them in climate-resilient projects will not only empower women in disadvantaged communities, but promotes them as equal stakeholders in finding solutions to climate catastrophe.

95,95,Drought Sri Lanka,These cities will feel climate change's effects the most - National Geographic,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/these-cities-will-feel-climate-changes-effects-the-most-feature,"This story is part of the pessimistic argument for the future of the planet in our special issue on Earth Day. Read the optimistic argument and the rest of our stories here

More and more of us live in urban areas. Today, some 55 percent of the world lives in cities, and a quarter of all humans live in the 2,500 most populous cities. That percentage is expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. By 2050, as the global population swells and urbanizes, about 70 percent of people will live in metropolises.

Earth’s climate, meantime, will continue to change in response to ever-rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Further warming will induce dramatic changes in nearly every corner of the planet. Some of those effects are already playing out.

Many of the impacts of future warming will be felt by the growing population of city dwellers. Cities concentrate people, infrastructure, activity, and many other resources into tight spaces, which means they’re particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Hotter temperatures put extra stress on human bodies, asphalt-covered roads, and more; more intense droughts can tax water systems; more intense rainfall can flood cities’ drains.

National Geographic partnered with Matt Fitzpatrick, an ecologist at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, to look at how temperature and precipitation patterns in many of the major urban areas of the world could change by 2070 if significant efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions are not made quickly—the “RCP 8.5” scenario.

The conclusions are clear: Just about everywhere in the world will experience shifts in seasons, hotter highs, and more extreme wet and dry periods. Some urban areas will feel more intense changes than others. But the alarming predictions are not set in stone. Today’s decisions can still influence tomorrow’s experience.

Warmer warms

Cities are affected more than rural areas by increasing air temperatures because they’re already hotter. Concrete, steel, wood, and other infrastructure materials trap more heat than a natural landscape does: the so-called urban heat island effect.

Unchecked climate change will drive temperatures up dramatically in every one of the 2,500 locations studied. During summer, the highest high temperatures are projected to increase by an average of 8 degrees Fahrenheit by 2070. In some places, the heat will be even more extreme. Summer temperatures in Urmia, Iran, for instance, will experience a 15-degree uptick, with average hot temperatures hovering at 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

Currently, only 9 percent of the cities studied have summer maximum temperatures that exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but that number will more than double by 2070. Among those future cities experiencing intense heat will be Grand Junction, Colorado, where today’s summer maximum temperatures of 90 degrees are projected to hit 100 degrees in 2070.

Cold seasons get less cold

The hot parts of the world are getting hotter, but some of the more dramatic changes are already happening—and will continue to unfold—in the places that are supposed to be cold. In general, the cold seasons in these places are warming up more quickly than warmer places’ warm seasons. The Arctic, for example, is heating up roughly twice as fast as the world on average, and its winters are taking the brunt of that warming.

Cities in the Far North will continue to feel their winters warm, if no major climate-curbing actions are taken soon. Among the 2,500 cities studied, the average minimum temperatures during winter are expected to increase 7.3 degrees Fahrenheit between now and 2070.

That’s enough to push some places over a dangerous tipping point from freezing into not freezing; snow to rain; ice to liquid; permafrost to sloppy, carbon-releasing mud.

The effects could be devastating. Snow that falls in the mountains of the western United States, for example, acts as a “water tower,” melting slowly through the spring and summer, providing water to areas downstream. If that snow falls as rain, the threat of later-season drought increases. Many agricultural crops, like almonds, wine grapes, and peaches, require a chill to produce fruit. Freezing temperatures also kill off pests, such as mosquitoes, ticks, and beetles, so warming winters could amplify the spread of vector-borne diseases and facilitate the earlier emergence of adult mosquitoes.

Cities outside the Far North will also see their cold seasons change. Today, 36 percent of the cities analyzed experience minimum winter temperatures below freezing. By 2070, 62 percent of the cities analyzed will no longer have below freezing winters.

What’s happening to the rain?

Another likely outcome of climate change is that the subtropics—regions just north or south of the tropics, such as northern Mexico or the Argentinean Pampas—will get drier. In general, higher latitudes are predicted to see more total precipitation, particularly rainfall, as the Earth warms. Exactly how those changes will play out seasonally is harder to pin down, though.

All in all, we should expect “more intense but less frequent precipitation,” says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA, with longer dry stretches between rainfall events.

Some cities that will experience drying will be better equipped to handle it than others, Fitzpatrick says. Places that already get abundant rainfall will be less strapped by a 20 percent decrease than somewhere that’s already really dry.

“A 20 percent decrease in an area that already has marginal rainfall,” he says, “very easily could transition it to a place with significant water issues.”

For every one degree Celsius the air heats up, the atmosphere holds 7 percent more water vapor. That means that by the end of the century the atmosphere will be able to hold 27 percent more water vapor than it does today. Adding that much more precipitation into the world’s water cycle will create more intense rainfall, particularly escalating the risk of flooding.

Much of the change is likely to occur during the cooler months of the year: 812 cities will have almost no precipitation, but many others will have extreme precipitation. And while many of the most extreme cities will get drier,11 cities across Nigeria, Rwanda, and Cameroon will also experience significantly more precipitation in 2070.

India had one in five of all internal displacements caused by disasters across the world in 2019, mostly caused by floods, cyclones and drought, according to the State of the Environment report released on Thursday. In fact, 19 major extreme weather events also claimed 1,357 lives last year.

Also read: ‘Climate change caused 15 disasters this year’

There were more than 50 lakh internal displacements in India last year, the highest in the world. This refers to the number of movements, not people, as individuals can be displaced several times, said the Centre for Science and Environment, which published the report.

Flooding caused by the south-west monsoon led to 26 lakh displacements, while Cyclone Fani alone led to 18 lakh displacements, followed by Cyclone Vayu and Bulbul. On the other hand, drought conditions in 19 States led to another 63,000 displacements.

Apart from such forced migrations, many migrants move for work. With migrant workers in the news due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, the report also broke down 2011 census data on migrant populations. There were over 45 crore migrants in the country at the time, with the vast majority migrating within their own State. In 2011, over 1.7 crore new migrants had moved for employment purposes, mostly from rural to urban areas.

The report also offers a snapshot of data on forests, water, waste, air, land, wildlife and other natural resources. It notes that there were 747 more tigers in 2018 than in 2014. However, the net area meant for tiger conservation shrunk by 179 square kilometres. Forest cover has shrunk in 38% of districts, while five out of 21 river basins are now in a state of absolute water scarcity.

“Each data is a story. It will raise your curiosity towards a development and will help you understand its impacts better,” said Down to Earth managing editor Richard Mahapatra in the foreword to the report. “We are sure that the data and the story it tells will help in better decision making.”","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i2q0ts/article31751229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5TH-FANI,"['weather', 'migrants', 'state', 'world', 'report', 'lakh', 'led', 'displacements', 'disasters', '2019', 'data', '50', 'caused', '19', 'internal']", ,flood_and_drought

98,98,Drought Sri Lanka,Q&A: Could climate change and biodiversity loss raise the risk of pandemics? - Carbon Brief,https://www.carbonbrief.org/q-and-a-could-climate-change-and-biodiversity-loss-raise-the-risk-of-pandemics,"Across the world, millions of people have tested positive for Covid-19 – and countless more have seen their lifestyles completely transformed as a result of the virus.

It is not yet known exactly what triggered the current outbreak, but researchers suspect that the virus passed from bats to humans through an unknown intermediary animal, possibly a pangolin.

Politicians in the UK have called this pandemic a “once-in-a-century” crisis. But scientists have warned that the ongoing disturbance of species through human activities and climate change could be raising the risk of potentially pandemic-causing diseases passing from animals to humans.

The study of the “spillover” of disease from animals to humans has received renewed focus in light of the pandemic. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – a major international collaboration of climate scientists – is now looking into how the influence of warming on such events could be included in its next major climate report due next year.

In this explainer, Carbon Brief examines what is known about how climate change and biodiversity disturbance, including habitat loss and human-animal conflict, could influence the risk of diseases being transmitted from animals to humans.

How does an animal-to-human disease spillover turn to a pandemic?

When humans come into contact with other animals, they can pass harmful pathogens between one another. The passing of an infection or disease from a vertebrate animal to a human is known as a “zoonosis”, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). (Vertebrate animals include mammals, birds and reptiles, but not insects, such as mosquitoes.)

Such diseases have a major impact on health, accounting for two-thirds of all human infectious diseases and three out of four newly emerging diseases.

Serious diseases that have spilled over from animals to humans include Ebola in Africa, Marburg in Europe (and subsequently in Africa), Hendra virus in Australia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Nipah virus in east Asia. Some have gone on to have a lasting, global impact, such as HIV/AIDS and swine flu (H1N1). The current Covid-19 pandemic was also most likely caused by a spillover.

The number of potentially harmful viruses circulating in mammal and bird populations that have not yet spilled over to humans is estimated to be up to 1.7m, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). (IPBES is an independent group of international researchers monitoring biodiversity issues).

The spillover of disease from animals to people can happen in many ways, including directly through animal bites, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal meat or products such as milk, or through contaminated water. Diseases can also spread indirectly if humans come into contact with a surface that has been contaminated by an infected animal. Both wild animals and livestock can pass on disease.

(Sometimes, transmission occurs through an intermediary species that can carry the disease without getting sick. Scientists suspect this is how the Covid-19 pandemic started.)

Out in the wild and in settings where humans and animals come into contact, these kinds of interactions happen regularly – and it is rare for one to end with a human being infected by a new disease, explains Dr David Redding, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London. He tells Carbon Brief:

“There are lots of different factors that need to all overlap at the same time for there to be a contact that is both effective in terms of transferring a live pathogenic organism and then also for that very rare situation where that pathogen has an adaptation that allows it to invade our immune system.”

Even if a disease is effectively transmitted from an animal to a person, it is unlikely that they will then pass it on to someone else, he adds:

“I would say most – possibly 99% – of all diseases that are caused in that way can’t then be passed on. So we’ve got another ‘filter’ that dictates that people have to be infected in a particular way that allows them to shed viruses effectively to other people.”

This “virus shedding” can happen in various ways. Like other respiratory diseases, Covid-19 can be transmitted when a carrier coughs or sneezes in close proximity to another person. (Scientists are still debating whether the virus can also be passed on in other ways.)

The ability of the new pathogen to spread directly from person to person is a key ingredient for a disease to take hold in a population, Redding says. (Some animal-borne diseases require a vector to spread from person to person, such as West Nile virus and Lyme disease.)

An illness outbreak is said to become an “epidemic” when its impact on people in a single community or region is “clearly in excess of normal expectancy”, according to the WHO. The term “pandemic” describes the worldwide spread of a new disease. (When a disease is “endemic” it has a continuous presence in a population or area.)

Since 1900, there have been pandemics at “intervals of several decades”, according to the WHO. The worst in this time period was Spanish flu, which killed an estimated 50 million people from 1918-19.

Prior to Covid-19, every outbreak considered to be a pandemic by the WHO since 1900 has been caused by influenza, a virus that transmits from person to person. Some new strains of flu originate in animals, such as bird flu, but most new strains arise in human populations – and so would not be considered animal-borne.

There are many factors that can determine whether an outbreak reaches epidemic or pandemic status. These include human factors, such as preparedness and early action to prevent the illness from spreading, and also the traits of the pathogen itself, says Redding:

“The characteristics of the pathogen and its ability to spread are two key components in causing these rare events.”

For instance, if the pathogen causes very severe illness, the sufferer is less likely to be able to travel to a new place to pass on the disease, Redding says. This is also the case if the mortality rate is particularly high.

In contrast, if the disease causes mild to undetectable symptoms for at least some sufferers – as is the case with Covid-19 – it is more likely that people will inadvertently spread it to new places, he says.

This may go some way to explaining why previous serious animal-borne disease outbreaks have not reached pandemic status, Redding explains.

For example, Ebola – a disease initially spread to humans by fruit bats – has caused several serious epidemics in West Africa, but has not established itself on a worldwide scale. It has a mortality rate of around 50%. The mortality rate of Covid-19 is not yet known, though it is likely to be below 10%.

It is also worth noting that the likelihood of a disease turning to a pandemic has been heightened in recent decades by increased global connectivity, particularly through frequent air travel, Redding says:

“Plagues in the medieval times took years to spread across Asia. Whereas we look at today’s outbreaks and we can see that they can spread in hours.”

Overall, for a spillover event to turn into a pandemic, there must be a “perfect storm” of several complex factors all occurring at the same time – which, at present, does not happen very often, says Redding: “I think history shows us that these sort of large outbreaks happen a couple of times a century.”

Could climate change and biodiversity disturbance affect the risk of spillover?

Every new animal-borne disease starts with humans coming into contact with wildlife. And it is likely that climate change and the disturbance of biodiversity could play a role in shaping the frequency, timing and location of these meetings, says Prof Hans-Otto Poertner, head of biosciences at the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) and co-chair of the impacts chapter of the next major assessment report from the IPCC. He tells Carbon Brief:

“Climate change is clearly a factor that can influence these relationships. Climate change shapes the biogeographical distribution of species. If, in the future, we see species moving into areas where humans are prevalent, we could see new opportunities for pandemics to evolve.”

Research has shown that climate change is shifting where species live, both on land and in the ocean. This is because, as temperatures increase and rainfall levels change, some species are being forced to seek out new areas with climate conditions they are able to tolerate. (Species that are not able to adapt could face extinction.)

A review published in Science in 2017 looking into 40,000 species across the world found that around half are already on the move as a result of changing climate conditions.

In general, species are seeking cooler temperatures by moving towards the Earth’s poles. Land animals are moving polewards at an average rate of 10 miles per decade, whereas marine species are moving at a rate of 45 miles per decade, according to the review.

However, the movement of animals is complicated by other factors, such as the changing availability of food, the shifting distribution of predators and changing patterns of human land-use, the review says. This makes it difficult to predict exactly where species will move to.

It is likely that the movement of species will have consequences for human health, says Prof Birgitta Evengard, a senior researcher of infectious diseases at Umea University in Sweden, who was one of the authors of the review. She tells Carbon Brief:

“When land-based animals move, they bring with them their [viruses] – and they will spread them.”

So far, there has not been a great deal of research into how climate change-driven shifts to animal ranges could affect the chances of disease spillover on a global scale, says Poertner.

In one example, a research paper by Redding found that climate change could heighten the risk of new Ebola outbreaks in various parts of Africa by 2070.

This is because climate change could cause regions that are currently desert to become warmer and wetter, leading to the formation of the lush plants that bats use as a habitat. The movement of bats into these new areas could increase contact between them and humans, increasing the chances of disease spillover, the study found.

Another study found that climate change could enhance the risk of spillover of the Hendra virus, an animal-borne disease that can pass from flying foxes to humans through horses, which are also affected by the virus.

The virus was first identified when an outbreak broke out in Hendra, a suburb in Brisbane, Australia, in 1994. Since then, there have been at least eight separate outbreaks along the coast of northern Australia, according to the WHO. It has a mortality rate of 50-75%.

The research found that climate change could cause the geographic range of flying foxes to expand southwards and further inland. “Spillover events could potentially increase farther south, and inland with climate change,” the authors say.

Elsewhere, a recent preprint – a preliminary study that has not yet completed peer review – suggests that climate change could drive substantial global increases in the passing of novel diseases from mammals to humans by 2070.

Using modelling, the study maps where around 4,000 mammals species and the diseases they carry are likely to move to by 2070. It finds mammals are “predicted to aggregate at high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa, sharing novel viruses between 3,000 and 13,000 times”.

The authors add: “Most projected viral sharing is driven by diverse hyperreservoirs (rodents and bats) and large-bodied predators (carnivores).”

It will be important for the IPCC to include the emerging evidence of how climate change could affect the passing of diseases from animals to humans in its next major assessment report, currently due for release in 2021-22, says Poertner:

“We expect to include aspects as they become apparent from the literature.”

The scale of the impact of climate change on wildlife is currently second only to the damage caused by human land-use change, including deforestation, other types of habitat loss and human-animal conflict.

In its first major assessment on biodiversity published in May 2019, IPBES reported that humans have “significantly altered” 75% of the land surface and 66% of the global ocean. During 2010-15, 32m hectares of natural or recovering forest were cleared by humans. This area is roughly equal to the size of Italy.

As a result of ongoing pressures on biodiversity, around one million species are currently threatened by extinction within decades, the report concluded.

The report noted that ongoing pressures on wildlife are likely to increase contact between animals and humans, altering the chances of disease spillover. In chapter three of the full report, the authors say:

“Complex links between increased human disturbance, land-use change, habitat loss/degradation and biodiversity loss have all been linked to increases in the prevalence and risk of zoonotic [animal-borne] disease for a variety of pathogens.”

However, research into how biodiversity disturbance could affect animal-borne disease risk at a global level has so far been limited, it notes:

“Causal mechanisms are only well known for a handful of infectious diseases and it is sometimes hard to pick apart the drivers of disease to isolate the direct effects of environmental change from other human actions.”

Research has shown that bushmeat hunting, deforestation and the trade of wildlife at markets can heighten the risk of diseases passing between animals and humans.

In 2018, a study warned of a possible link between deforestation in southeast Asia and a heightened risk of spillover of novel coronaviruses from bats to humans. The authors say:

“Owing to evolving land-use, bat populations are setting up in areas closer to human dwellings…This increases the risk of transmission of viruses through direct contact, domestic animal infection, or contamination by urine or faeces.”

A study published in April of this year looked into global drivers of mammal-to-human disease spillover, concluding:

“Our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal-human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission.”

It notes that “domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species”.

The graph below, taken from the study, shows the relationship between virus richness and species richness for various mammal groups, including rodents, bats, primates, carnivores, artiodactyla (hoofed animals such as goats, sheep and giraffes), lagomorpha (hares, pikas and rabbits) and eulipotyphla (insect-eating mammals, such as hedgehogs, shrews and voles).

The graph shows how the rodent group contains both the highest number of different species and the highest number of different viruses. This is followed by bats and then primates.

It is worth noting that the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss on disease spillover risk are likely to compound or moderate one another, says Redding.

For example, his research found that climate change could create more suitable habitat for Ebola-carrying bats. However, the degree to which this will translate into more disease spillover could depend on how humans interact with the animals’ new habitat in the future, he says:

“The numbers of people and how they are interacting with that land is probably going to dominate the more subtle effects.”

Both climate change and biodiversity disturbance could heighten spillover risk in the same way, by opening up new avenues between humans and animals, adds Poertner:

“It’s humans opening interfaces with nature that haven’t been there before and then you can get these encounters.”

Will the risk of animal-borne disease pandemics increase in the future?

Though research has uncovered links between climate change, biodiversity disturbance and disease spillover, it is still unclear how this could shape the future risk of pandemics, scientists tell Carbon Brief.

One major reason for this is scientists currently do not have a good understanding of how these pressures are affecting animal-borne disease risk at a global level, says Poertner:

“The major research priority now should be building some basic insight about how these [animal-borne viruses] will be changing under climate change. We have so many unknown viruses in the animal pool, it is important to identify those cases where crossing over may happen. But it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack.”

This point is echoed by IPBES authors Prof Josef Settele, Prof Sandra Díaz, Prof Eduardo Brondizio and Dr Peter Daszak who recently released a statement in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. They say:

“The potential for future pandemics is vast. As many as 1.7m unidentified viruses of the type known to infect people are believed to still exist in mammals and water birds. Any one of these could be the next ‘disease X’ – potentially even more disruptive and lethal than Covid-19.”

It is their opinion that pandemics will become more likely in the future if existing pressures on biodiversity continue. They say:

“Future pandemics are likely to happen more frequently, spread more rapidly, have greater economic impact and kill more people if we are not extremely careful about the possible impacts of the choices we make today.”

(UPDATE 30/10/2020: On 29 October, IPBES released a rapid workshop report detailing the links between the loss of nature and the emergence of novel diseases. The report found that future pandemics will “emerge more often, spread more rapidly, do more damage to the world economy and kill more people than Covid-19 unless there is a transformative change in the global approach to dealing with infectious diseases”. It also found that economic costs of tackling another pandemic would be around 100 times higher than the cost of prevention.)

In terms of climate change’s impact on animal-borne diseases, researchers still have a lot to learn, says Redding:

“We’re in a fairly embryonic stage of understanding this. People have been recently concentrating more on vector-borne diseases. There are far more zoonotic pathogens carried by mammals and birds than there are transmitted by insects, and we need to better understanding what impact climate change will have on this group .”

“Vector-borne diseases” are those spread by insects, such as malaria, dengue fever and Zika virus. Lots of research papers have shown that climate change could shift the range of such diseases, often further towards the poles.

For example, a study published in 2019 found mosquito-borne diseases could reach an additional one billion people by 2080, mostly in higher latitudes, if future global warming is extremely high.

By comparison, the impact of climate change on animal-borne diseases has been subject to very little research, says Redding. The WHO categorises the vast majority of animal-borne diseases as “neglected” because they “are not prioritised by health systems at national and international levels”.

In addition to better understanding how the pressures of climate change and biodiversity loss might affect animal-borne diseases, there is also a need to research the potential solutions, notes Poertner:

“A personal challenge that arises here for me is while all these dangers are imminent, there is an urgency to not only investigate the phenomenon, in terms of its basic science, but also to immediately investigate solution options.”

One step that should be taken is to improve the monitoring of animal-human interactions, says Redding:

“Routine monitoring is the key here. This is where scientists go out regularly and randomly monitor lots of people and their potential exposure to animals. This will have more of a ‘canary in the coalmine’ approach rather than a ‘by the time we’ve detected it, it’s too late’ approach.”

Such a monitoring system would demand a great level of global cooperation, Evengard says:

“We need to have a proper surveillance and also a monitoring system. But in order to have that, we really need to have very solid genuine international collaboration, involving the sharing of data and transparency. That’s really important.”

An organisation that could take on this responsibility could be the WHO, she adds.

Conserving existing wildspaces and restoring degraded ecosystems could also be an important step to protecting wildlife and people, says Poertner:

“We should not penetrate the last corners of the natural world. Biodiversity conservation has already produced the finding that 30% of land and 30% of the ocean should be set aside and left undisturbed in order for natural ecosystems to evolve and adjust to climatic changes that we are already imposing.”

It will also be important to address human activities that heighten the risk of disease spillover, including deforestation and the trade of wildlife, Redding adds:

“We need to have a better regulation of supply chains, which should include better accountability of how richer countries are often driving the demand for these activities.”","Fri, 15 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/zambia-drought-in-Hilapgwa-Valley-Deforestation.jpg,"['pandemics', 'loss', 'biodiversity', 'raise', 'species', 'change', 'climate', 'risk', 'spillover', 'qa', 'diseases', 'animals', 'humans', 'disease']", ,none

Activists and farmers from Tirupattur district have sought funding to rejuvenate the Palar river in the region.

The river, originating in Karnataka, flowing through Andhra Pradesh enters Pullur village and flows across Madhanur to reach neighbouring Vellore district.

Speaking on the upper Palar river basin, A. Asokan, a resident of Ambalur and member of Reversal of Ecology Committee, said water continued to flow into Palar river till 2017, whenever there was heavy downpour.

Due to monsoon failure and negligence of rights of farmers in the region, the river has started dying, he claimed.

To save it from further deterioration it should be revived in order to save residents of this region from drought.

The Palar river should be rejuvenated using CSR funds, received before the district was split, he added.

There are few tributaries for Palar which bring rainwater into the stream. The ‘seema karuvelam’ trees on these tributaries should be removed and efforts should be made to increase the height of dykes in Kodaiyanji, Udhayendhiram and Alangkuppam by three feet, he added.

According to officials of the Public Works Department, surplus water from the checkdam constructed by the Andhra Pradesh government near Pullur panchayat, Vellore district, had been flowing into the river.

Mr. Asokan said plea to officials to desilt channels leading from Palar to two waterbodies – Nagaleri and Kodaiyanchi Eri – did not produce any result.

“I have submitted a petition to District Collector M.P. Sivanarul for taking up rejuvenation work before the onset of monsoon. Hopefully he would take appropriate action immediately,” he added.","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['river', 'palar', 'residents', 'basin', 'save', 'water', 'submitted', 'region', 'deterioration', 'tributaries', 'say', 'district', 'upper', 'pullur', 'vellore']", ,drought
