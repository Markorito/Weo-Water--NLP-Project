The injectable vaccine, RTS,S, was developed to protect young children from the most deadly form of malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. RTS,S will be assessed in the pilot programme as a complementary malaria control tool that could potentially be added to the core package of WHO-recommended measures for malaria prevention.

“The prospect of a malaria vaccine is great news. Information gathered in the pilot will help us make decisions on the wider use of this vaccine”, said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. “Combined with existing malaria interventions, such a vaccine would have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives in Africa,” she added.

Africa bears the greatest burden of malaria worldwide. Global efforts in the last 15 years have led to a 62 percent reduction in malaria deaths between 2000 and 2015, yet approximately 429,000 people died of the disease in 2015, the majority of them young children in Africa.

The WHO pilot programme will assess whether the vaccine’s protective effect in children aged 5 – 17 months old during Phase III testing can be replicated in real-life. Specifically, the pilot programme will assess the feasibility of delivering the required four doses of RTS,S, the vaccine’s potential role in reducing childhood deaths, and its safety in the context of routine use.

WHO recommendations and RTS,S

RTS,S was developed by GSK and is the first malaria vaccine to have successfully completed a Phase III clinical trial. The trial was conducted between 2009 and 2014 through a partnership involving GSK, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), and a network of African research sites in seven African countries—including Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.

RTS,S is also the first malaria vaccine to have obtained a positive scientific opinion from a stringent medicines regulatory authority, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which approved RTS,S in July 2015.

In October 2015, two independent WHO advisory groups, comprised of the world’s foremost experts on vaccines and malaria, recommended pilot implementation of RTS,S in three to five settings in sub-Saharan Africa. The recommendation came from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), following a joint review of all available evidence on the vaccine’s safety and efficacy. The World Health Organization formally adopted the recommendation in January 2016.

Pilot implementation

The three countries were selected to participate in the pilot based on the following criteria: high coverage of long-lasting insecticidal-treated nets (LLINs); well-functioning malaria and immunisation programmes, a high malaria burden even after scale-up of LLINs, and participation in the Phase III RTS,S malaria vaccine trial. Each of the three countries will decide on the districts and regions to be included in the pilots. High malaria burden areas will be prioritized, as this is where the benefit of the vaccine is predicted to be highest. Information garnered from the pilot will help to inform later decisions about potential wider use of the vaccine.

The malaria vaccine will be administered via intramuscular injection and delivered through the routine national immunization programmes. WHO is working with the three countries to facilitate regulatory authorization of the vaccine for use in the pilots through the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum (AVAREF). Regulatory support will also include measures to enable the appropriate safety monitoring of the vaccine and rigorous evaluation for eventual large scale use.

Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and UNITAID, are partnering to provide US$49.2 million for the first phase of the pilot programme (2017-2020) which will be complemented by in-kind contributions from WHO and GSK.

The Ghanaian tells why he and his ex-club colleague are perceived to be full of themselves

Ghana international Emmanuel Frimpong says he shares some similarities with former Arsenal teammate Niklas Bendtner.

Having progressed through the Gunners' youth ranks, the controversial footballer played together with the Denmark striker between 2011 and 2014.

On various occasions, the two men have been described as cocky and disrespectful, a notion the Ghanaian addresses.

""Nicklas is a bit like me,"" Frimpong told 6'eren.

""Sometimes people don't quite understand Nicklas.

""He believes in himself and believes that he is the best.

""Why not? If he does not believe in himself, who will? There is nothing wrong with that.

""Nicklas has some funny stories like me and sometimes we did some stupid things.

""Nicklas was super cool and very fun. He always made me laugh.""

Their 'arrogance' aside, Frimpong and Bendtner have both struggled to hold down a steady club career.

The Ghanaian had three successive loans stints prior to his Arsenal departure and has since played for four clubs including current Swedish outfit AFC Eskilstuna.

Bendtner, likewise, was farmed out to Birmingham City, Sunderland and Juventus on consecutive loans, before leaving Emirates Stadium.

Since, the 29-year-old has featured for VfL Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest and present team Rosenborg.","Thu, 20 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['frimpong', 'ghanaian', 'youth', 'loans', 'played', 'bendtner', 'believes', 'arsenal', 'dont', 'understand']",

In drought-hit Somalia, children also face potentially deadly measles threat

UNICEF and partners conduct lifesaving vaccination campaign

© UNICEF/Mohamed Hersi On 24 April 2017, a mother gives her child a deworming tablet mixed with water at Beerta Muuri camp in Baidoa during the measles vaccination campaign launch.

BAIDOA, Somalia, 25 April 2017 – Almost 30,000 young children, many of them displaced by a searing drought, are being vaccinated against measles this week in an emergency campaign in Baidoa, a town at the heart of one of Somalia’s hardest-hit areas.

Many of the children have never been immunized before – they come from remote areas health workers often cannot reach because of a decades-old conflict that has ravaged the impoverished country in the Horn of Africa.



So far this year, almost 5,700 cases of suspected measles have been reported across the country, more than the total number of cases in 2016. Measles, a viral respiratory infection that spreads through air and contact with infected mucus and saliva, thrives in congested, unsanitary displacement camps, which have mushroomed across the town and surrounding areas. More than 100,000 people have come to Baidoa in search of assistance, including at least 70,000 in March alone.



“Among vaccine-preventable diseases, none is more deadly than measles,” said Steven Lauwerier, UNICEF’s Representative in Somalia. “And we know only too well from the 2011 famine that measles, combined with malnutrition and displacement, is an especially lethal combination for children.”



The threat of famine once again looms large over Somalia. Over half the population is acutely food insecure, water-borne and infectious diseases like cholera and measles are spreading, and up to a million children are, or will be acutely malnourished this year, with one in five requiring life-saving treatment.



“The only way to prevent sickness and death from measles is to make sure all children receive the vaccine. A child suffering from severe acute malnutrition is nine times more likely to die from a disease like measles than a healthy child. We have no time to lose,” Lauwerier said.



The Baidoa campaign is part of an effort to vaccinate about 110,000 displaced children below 5 years old in hotspots across south central Somalia, plus 250,000 children in Somaliland, against the deadly contagious disease, by the end of May. Conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Health, WHO, and several non-governmental organizations, it also includes a vitamin A supplement to boost immunity as well as de-worming tablets.

Robert Lewandowski broke a dry spell that spanned 208 minutes by firing home from the penalty spot against Real Madrid

Bayern Munich are teetering on the brink in the Champions League, and the German giants can point to a recent lack of goals as the principal culprit.

Dani Alves rules out Barca return

After opening the scoring against Real Madrid through Arturo Vidal last week, Bayern conceded a Cristiano Ronaldo brace to go down 2-1.

Having drawn a blank at the weekend away to Leverkusen, the return of Robert Lewandowski failed to inspire the Bavarians to a breakthrough in the Champions League second leg as they went into half-time 0-0.

That means Carlo Ancelotti's men went 208 minutes without hitting the net, the longest period in the coach's tenure.

It was finally left to Lewandowski to break the drought, as the Polish striker marked his return to action by steering home a penalty early after the break.

Lewandowski's goal could also give Bayern cause for optimism in their bid to reach the semi-finals, judging by the above stat.","Tue, 18 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['return', 'endure', 'munich', 'longest', 'went', 'lewandowski', 'drought', 'real', 'bayern', 'optafranz', 'goal', 'ancelotti', 'penalty', 'minutes', 'worst']",

Almost seven seasons and over 300 games have passed since the Argentine arrived at Camp Nou, and he finally broke his duck on Wednesday

Javier Mascherano finally ended his amazing goal drought for Barcelona by firing home from the penalty spot during the Catalans' clash against Osasuna.

Incredibly, the former West Ham and Liverpool star had never previously scored in Blaugrana colours, despite playing for the club for almost seven seasons.

'Alli can become a true great'

But when Denis Suarez was chopped down in the penalty at Camp Nou with Barca already cruising 5-1 up, Masche stepped forward to convert the penalty.

He beat Salvatore Sirigu to end a run of 319 games without hitting the net, to the delight of his team-mates who mobbed him after the successful effort.

The goal also brought up a milestone for Luis Enrique, who saw Barca score their 500th goal since he took charge back in 2014.

A midfielder at Liverpool and with the Argentina national team, Mascherano dropped back into the centre of defence after moving to Camp Nou, and rarely crosses the halfway line.

Wednesday's effort was only the fourth goal of his professional club career, while he has scored another three with the senior Argentina team in 136 appearances. The last goal Mascherano scored came on June 4 2014, when he converted against Trinidad & Tobago for Argentina. His last club goal came for Liverpool on February 25, 2010 against Unirea Urziceni in the Europa League.","Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['scored', 'barcelona', 'mascherano', 'incredible', 'club', 'team', 'drought', 'liverpool', 'camp', 'argentina', 'nou', 'scoring', 'goal', 'ends']", 
5,5,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Reducing climate impacts in West Africa - Mali - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/mali/reducing-climate-impacts-west-africa,"Recognizing that Africa is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the World Meteorological Organization has launched the Training Programme on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction in Agriculture to improve the capacity of national technical services in West African countries. The programme seeks to reduce the impacts of natural disasters and climate change on the agricultural sector and to support sustainable development.

“Climate change is threatening food security in many parts of the world,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “This new training program will make a significant contribution to strengthening the capacity of the technical services of West African countries to address the impacts and risks of climate change on agriculture through early warning systems and climate prediction.”

The partners for the project are two WMO Regional Training Centers: the Institute of Biometeorology of the Italian National Research Council (CNRIBIMET), represented at the inaugural ceremony at WMO by the Italian Ambassador, His Excellency Ambassador Maurizio Serra and by IBIMET Director Mr Antonio Raschiand, and the AGRHYMET Regional Center, represented by Mr Etienne Saar.

The project will be implemented in the 15 member states of ECOWAS (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo) plus in Mauritania and Chad. With a budget of some €820 000, the 12-month project will focus on training experts from national agriculture, agro-meteorological, hydrological and early warning services.

The project will organize training courses for technicians and experts of national services in order to develop effective climate services for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The main objective of the training is to enhance the participants' ability to plan and adopt strategies to mitigate the effects of these phenomena and to harmonize the methods of analysis, thereby strengthening cooperation at regional level.

The project will also consolidate a network among scientific and technical institutions in order to work on shared methodologies and to create an objective and harmonized base of information. The aim is to transfer and share the know-how, to expand cooperation in sensitive areas to the national and regional level and to promote exchanges and collaboration.

Africa is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts in the world because of its widespread poverty and its limited adaptation ability. Since the 1990s, the issue of natural disasters has gained international visibility. In addition, because much of West Africa’s growing population relies on rain-fed agriculture, the region is vulnerable to crises that can turn into humanitarian disasters, such as the one that hit East Africa in 2011 when a long period of extreme drought threatened the survival of millions of people.","Tue, 11 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-social-media.png,"['africa', 'training', 'national', 'climate', 'world', 'project', 'regional', 'agriculture', 'impacts', 'mali', 'reducing', 'change', 'services', 'west']", 
6,6,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The Unbearable Cost of Drought in Africa - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2017/04/the-unbearable-cost-of-drought-in-africa/,"The Unbearable Cost of Drought in Africa

ROME, Apr 12 2017 (IPS) - Nearly 50 per cent of all emergency multilateral food assistance to Africa is due to natural disasters, with advancing droughts significantly threatening both livelihoods and economic growth, warns the African Union through its ground-breaking extreme weather insurance mechanism designed to help the continent’s countries resist and recover from the ravages of drought.



The mechanism, known as the African Risk Capacity (ARC) provides participating African states with quick-disbursing funds in the event of drought, and assists countries in developing drought response contingency plans to implement timely and effective responses.

“The result is significant economic and welfare benefits for participating countries and vulnerable households.”

As currently structured, ARC reports, the cost of responding to extreme weather events in Africa, particularly droughts, is borne largely by the international community.

To give an order of magnitude using World Food Programme (WFP) operations as a proxy for international aid flows, in 2012 WFP assisted 54.2 million people in Africa, spending US $2.7 billion –66 per cent of WFP’s global expenditure that year, it adds.

Droughts significantly threaten record Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in sub-Saharan Africa, ARC warned, while explaining that 1-in-10 year drought event could have an estimated adverse impact of 4 per cent on the annual GDP of Malawi for example, with even larger impacts for 1-in-15 and 1-in-25 year events.

“Such decreased productivity detracts from economic growth, causes major budget dislocation, erodes development gains and resilience, and requires additional emergency aid from the international community in the future.” One dollar spent on early intervention through ARC saves 4.40 dollars spent after a crisis unfolds.

Devastating Effects for Households

The African Union’s extreme weather insurance mechanism also informs that at the household level, the consequences of drought can be devastating in countries with low resilience where large sectors of population rely on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihood.

Experts from Oxford University and International Food Policy Research Institute conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to examine household coping actions when faced with a drought, and the likely long-term cost impacts of these actions, according to ARC.

The study estimated the economic benefits of early intervention and thus protecting a household’s economic growth potential –that is, intervening in time to prevent households’ negative coping actions such as reduced food consumption, livestock death, and distressed productive asset sales, which, in the absence of external assistance, have increasingly pronounced negative consequences.

“The CBA calculated that the economic benefit of aid reaching households within the critical three months after harvest could result in nearly 1,300 dollars per household assisted in terms of protected economic gains.”

A further analysis shows the potential benefit of ARC outweighs the 4.4 times compared to traditional emergency appeals for assistance, as a result of reduced response times and risk pooling.

Lake Chad Basin – Extreme Emergency

The ARC report about the impact of droughts in Africa came out shortly before the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) chief’s visit to some of the affected areas in North-Eastern Nigeria, where conflict has forced an estimated 2.5 million people to leave their homes and livelihoods.

The Sub-Saharan Lake Chad Basin, which is the main source of water in the region, between 1963 and 2013 lost 90 per cent of its water mass, with massive impact on the population, according to FAO.

Across the region, (encompassing parts of Nigeria, Cameroun, Chad and Niger), which is currently faced with one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world, some 7 million people risk severe hunger during the lean season and require immediate food and livelihood assistance.

“There are fifty thousand people on the brink of famine in the region, on a scale from 1 to 5, where 5 is famine, they are already at level 4”, FAO director general Graziano da Silva warned.

Following three years of drought, agriculture including livestock and fisheries can no longer be left unattended, he said.

Agriculture produces food and sustains 90 per cent of the local population. Many of the people in the area have already sold their possessions including seeds and tools and their animals have been killed by the armed groups.

“Pastoralists and fishers need to be supported as well for animal restocking. Otherwise if internally displaced persons don’t have their animals and their jobs back, they will remain in the refugee camps, “ the FAO DG emphasised.

Contribution to Long-term Resilience and Growth in Africa Low resilience households must grow by more than 3 per cent annually in real terms to withstand a 1-in-5 year drought.

For many countries in Africa, a small shock in terms of a rainfall deficit or elevated food prices can precipitate a call for a major humanitarian intervention and emergency response. The resilience in such countries is significantly low such that they struggle through most years, let alone during a drought.

For example, in a country such as Niger, where households currently display very low resilience, the ARC team has calculated that to event, the income of the most vulnerable households would have to grow by an annual average of 3.4 per cent over the next five years in real terms to build sufficient resilience in order to adequately cope without requiring external assistance.

In the meantime, insurance is not the ‘correct’ tool to deal with this chronic risk. In order to improve such countries’ resilience to natural disasters, thereby enabling sustained growth on the continent, two key elements are required: risk management and investment.

Drought, a complex and slowly encroaching natural hazard with significant and pervasive socio-economic and environmental impacts, is known to cause more deaths and displace more people than any other natural disaster, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).

By 2050, the demand for water is expected to increase by 50 per cent, it reports, adding that as populations increase, especially in dryland areas, more and more people are becoming dependent on fresh water supplies in land that are becoming degraded.

“Water scarcity is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty-first century. The Global Risks report published by World Economic Forum ranks ‘water crisis’ as the top risk in the coming decade and it has a place in the Sustainable Development Goals where a specific goal has been dedicated to water.”

Drought and water scarcity are considered to be the most far-reaching of all natural disasters, causing short and long-term economic and ecological losses as well as significant secondary and tertiary impacts, UNCCD informs.

The African Risk Capacity was established as a Specialized Agency of the African Union to help Member States improve their capacities to better plan, prepare and respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters, therefore protecting the food security of their vulnerable populations.","Wed, 12 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2017/04/LakeChad_.jpg,"['africa', 'water', 'drought', 'countries', 'food', 'arc', 'cost', 'cent', 'unbearable', 'resilience', 'economic', 'risk']", 
7,7,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"To save forests, cut some trees down, scientists say - Science Magazine",https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/save-forests-cut-some-trees-down-scientists-say,"To save forests, cut some trees down, scientists say

Forests are feeling the heat. In places like the American West, rising temperatures and drought mean less water for trees, sometimes shriveling swaths of woodland. Now, scientists have found that thinning early in forest growth creates tougher trees that can endure climate change. What’s more, these thinned forests can suck carbon out of the air just as fast as dense forests.

“When it comes to carbon sequestration and climate change adaptation, we can have our cake and eat it too,” says Andrew Larson, forest ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula and author of the new study. “It’s a win-win.”

As trees grow, they convert carbon dioxide to food and store it in their leaves, trunks, and roots. U.S. forests capture between 10% to 20% of U.S. emissions each year. But if trees get too crowded, they compete for light and water—and stressed trees are more susceptible to drought and insect attacks. Removing some trees can ease the competition, letting the remaining trees grow big and healthy. But scientists worry that removing trees can reduce forest carbon storage. These worries, however, are based mostly on models and short-term studies.

To see if the climate trade-off truly exists, scientists tapped into a long-term experiment in northwestern Montana. In 1961, U.S. Forest Service officials started the experiment in a young forest of western larch—a conifer common in the Inland Northwest. The forest was broken up into plots. In some plots, the 8-year-old trees were thinned from tens of thousands per hectare down to 494 per hectare (2.5 acres). These trees grew thick trunks and broad canopies. Other plots were left alone, and the teeming trees grew tall and skinny as they competed for sunlight. The original study was rooted in an interest in growing timber rapidly. But the scientists at the University of Montana sprouted a new question: How did tree density affect carbon storage?

To find out, they measured tree height, diameter, and width of branches to estimate the amount of carbon stored. They also calculated the carbon contained in other plants, dead wood, and forest floor debris.

Total carbon was nearly the same in both forests. The un-thinned forest had more trees, but the thinned forest compensated with bigger trees, the team reports this month in Forest Ecology and Management. Larson was surprised by how quickly the thinned trees had caught up.

“There are very few experiments that have ever been set up to test [carbon storage] directly,” says Mark Harmon, forest ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who was not involved in the research. Long-term studies like this are useful to validate climate models, he says. “I think we need more examples like this.”

The key is early thinning, before trees start to fight over water and light. The remaining trees grow rapidly. Thinning treatments on mature trees haven’t had such success, because the leftover trees were already weakened by competition. “The later you wait, the more impact you’re going to have on carbon storage,” Harmon says.

Climate change may bring more severe droughts to the West. Big trees are more drought-resilient, and their thick bark can resist fire better than can young trees. Also, they are healthier and can fight off disease and insects. When the large larches do die, they become homes for woodpeckers and lynx.

The results can be applied to forests that have been clear cut, boosting the recovery of trees, says forest ecologist Michael Schaedel, lead author of the study. As a forester for the Nature Conservancy in Missoula, he’s thinned similar young larch forests. But, until now, he hasn’t fully understood how the practice will affect them in the long run. “Having an opportunity to travel through time to the present day—54 years later—and see what the effect of those treatments is is invaluable.”

There are still concerns over how thinning impacts other species. In Montana, snowshoe hares—preyed on by the threatened Canada lynx—inhabit young western larch forests. Thinning in these forests could reduce hare habitat and in turn food for lynx. Still, Larson thinks thinning could become a useful tool for addressing climate change. “I think there’s no more pressing issue in natural resource management.”","Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/cc_GettyImages-516885564_16x9.jpg?itok=qZ2JamJC,"['scientists', 'thinned', 'forests', 'carbon', 'climate', 'montana', 'trees', 'thinning', 'cut', 'forest', 'young', 'save', 'say']",

For a small farmer in India, the last year might have gone something like this: She plants tomatoes, and the crop is destroyed by pests. Months of extreme heat mean that she can’t plant anything else. When she finally plants another crop, it’s destroyed by drought. After backbreaking labor, she’s still broke, or worse, in serious debt. In 2015, more than 8,000 farmers in India committed suicide, most because of their financial situation.

As climate change increases environmental risks for farmers in the area–from monsoons to heat waves–one startup is testing a potential solution. Kheyti, which recently won the Global Social Venture Competition, makes what it calls the Greenhouse in a Box, a simple, low-cost greenhouse that can sit on a small area of a farm and provide regular crops which guarantees year-round income if everything else goes wrong. “The biggest problem that we found is income variability,” says co-founder Kaushik Kappagantulu. “Farmers make money only once or twice in a year. That income is affected by all sorts of environmental risks, including unseasonable rain, pest attacks . . . That’s why they’re stuck in that poverty cycle.” The typical greenhouse available in India was originally designed for farmers in developed countries who grow high-value flowers or vegetables–and it’s well out of the price range of a low-income farmer. The new greenhouse is simpler, with fewer materials and a smaller footprint (it’s roughly half the size of a basketball court or 2% of the land area of a typical small farm in India). Two layers of shade netting on the top reduce the temperature inside by 5-8 degrees Celsius. Insect netting on all sides reduces pest attacks 90%.

The team is now working with Extreme, a course at Stanford University’s d.school that focuses on design for extreme affordability, to bring the cost down further. The current version of the greenhouse costs $2,000 to make, and through a partnership with a bank, the startup is offering it to pilot customers at cost, with a $400 down payment and quarterly payments of $175 over three years. A high-quality cow, by comparison, costs around $800. “It’s basically the same investment that a farmer would make to start a daily operation, buy two or three cows so they can make a steady income from dairy, or invest in making a small poultry shed in their farms for chickens and eggs,” Kappagantulu says. “I think it’s comparable to other small investments that farmers make.” On average, farmers should make $475 a quarter from the greenhouse, leaving them a profit of $300 per quarter.

Still, the $400 down payment is more than the poorest farmers can afford. The startup is aiming to be able to offer it for a down payment of $100 or $200. In experiments on the startup’s own farm, the greenhouse has performed even as the same crops fail outside. “Right now the temperature in Hyderabad is about 115 degrees Fahrenheit, I would say, and in this time, nothing grows,” says Kappagantulu. “From this time until about June, farmers aren’t able to grow anything outside. When we did this experiment side by side, all the plants [outside] died when the temperature hit 115, and all the plants inside survived and gave us a steady income.” A drip irrigation system, coupled with the shade that reduces heat and evaporation, helps cut water use 90%. Along with the greenhouse’s ability to protect crops from pests and floods, this means that farmers can grow seven times more produce. But the startup believes that the greenhouse on its own can’t fully address the challenges that farmers face, so it also provides a suite of services.

9,9,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Why did these lions eat 35 men? Bad teeth - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/why-did-these-lions-eat-35-men-bad-teeth,"Why did these lions eat 35 men? Bad teeth

In 1898, two male African lions killed 35 people in the Tsavo region of Kenya. Their 9-month reign of terror ended when Colonel John Patterson of the British Army shot them dead. Scientists have long debated why the lions began eating people. Now, two researchers have a new answer: They blame tooth decay for the big cats’ taste for human flesh. The finding might also explain why other lions sometimes turn into human eaters.

Lions normally consume a diverse variety of animals, including buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe, zebra, and antelope. Humans figure into their diets only rarely. In the 3 months before their deaths, however, the Tsavo human eaters got nearly 30% of their food from people, according to one recent study. Did the lions focus on humans because they were desperate? Many scientists think so. Apparently suffering from starvation—likely because drought or disease had ravaged their usual prey—they turned to another toothsome delicacy.

But other researchers have turned up conflicting evidence. Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, wanted a look at the lion’s preserved teeth after reading a frightful passage from Patterson’s 1907 account, The Man-Eaters of Tsavo: “I have a very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway camp and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound … rang in my ears for days afterwards.” If the lions were that hungry, DeSantis reasoned, they must have also scavenged carcasses, a process that involves heavy bone crunching and wears down the teeth in predictable patterns.

To find out, she and a colleague analyzed the lions’ jaws and teeth, as well as those of a third human eater from Zambia—all stored at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois. They used a technique that can determine whether an animal is eating mostly flesh, bones, or some combination of the two. They then compared the patterns on the human eaters’ teeth with those of 53 wild lion specimens from across Africa, two from India, and five captive lions. Next, the scientists examined the patterns on the teeth of cheetahs, which dine solely on flesh, and hyenas, which typically consume entire carcasses—including the bones.

The Tsavo lions’ teeth did not look like those of hyenas, DeSantis says. Instead, the wear patterns were “strikingly similar” to those of the zoo lions, which eat soft foods such as beef and horsemeat. She thinks Patterson was actually hearing the sounds of hyenas that dreadful night.

Other research points out why the lions’ dining preference shifted. One lion—the one that ate the most flesh—was known from a previous study to suffer from dental disease. A painful abscess at the root of one of his canines would have made normal hunting—grabbing and suffocating large prey—impossible, DeSantis says. His partner also had dental and jaw injuries, but these were less serious. The Zambian human eater, which did not consume bone, was also suffering from severe damage to its jaws. Together, this means that dental injuries and disease likely led these lions to softer foods, the researchers write today in Scientific Reports .

“[This] provides first-hand information straight from the lions’ teeth that there is little evidence to support bone eating by the Tsavo lions,” says Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist at the State University of New York in Buffalo who was not involved in the study. “Any human bone consumption at the time was much more likely the work of the usual suspects—hyenas—than meat-specializing felines.”

But the scientists emphasize that bad teeth alone do not make lions into human eaters. “[They] probably targeted humans because they were easy and had soft flesh,” says DeSantis, noting that the cats didn’t consume entire carcasses. They were also doing what lions do best: hunting opportunistically from a menu that has, since the emergence of early humans, occasionally included people.","Wed, 19 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/cc_John-Patterson-with-Tsavo-lion%2C-courtesy-of-The-Field-Museum_16x9.jpg?itok=lAElUBqX,"['scientists', 'bone', 'desantis', 'teeth', 'eat', 'men', 'consume', 'flesh', 'bad', 'lions', 'humans', 'human', '35', 'tsavo']",

With the few that survived, he managed to stay at home in Qansahdheere, in southwestern Somalia. Six years on, as Somalia faces yet another humanitarian disaster, Hassan and his family have fled to Mogadishu hoping to find aid. Hassan and his family made it to the capital city’s only government-managed camp, Badbaado.

Half of Somalia’s population of 12.3 million people currently need humanitarian assistance. Legal, political and security restrictions and limited funding are restricting the access of international aid agencies to parts of the country, including areas controlled by the Islamist armed group Al-Shabab. Every day thousands of people like Hassan are moving into urban areas under government control, where international assistance is more likely to arrive. According to the United Nations, just under half a million people have fled their homes since November largely because of the drought, many arriving in Mogadishu and Baidoa, a town at the epicenter of the crisis.



But there are no quick solutions. The reality awaiting those like Hassan is often hostile and sometimes abusive.



Hundreds of thousands of people are in informal displacement camps, 400,000 in Mogadishu alone. Most arrived during the 2011 famine or due to ongoing clan fighting, military operations and insecurity in regions bordering the capital. Recent arrivals also include people who are returning from Kenya’s sprawling Dadaab refugee camp after the authorities said they would shut the camp down and started coercing refugees to leave.



Since the 2011 famine, people living in these settlements have faced serious abuse at the hands of government and private actors, including camp managers known as “gatekeepers,” who often have links to local authorities, business people and militias. Beatings, rape, including at times by African Union peace support forces, plus the diversion of food aid, restrictions on movement, and discrimination based on clan affiliation have marked their everyday lives.



The situation has not significantly improved.



Many of the people in the camps are from traditionally marginalized or less powerful communities, who rarely own or have rights over the land.



According to the UN and local women’s rights groups, rape remains widespread in Somalia’s displacement camps. To make things worse, a growing demand for land in central Mogadishu has triggered the forcible evictions of tens of thousands of people from the Mogadishu camps. In March 2015, government forces came with bulldozers and kicked out 21,000 camp residents in a 24-hour period, beating those who resisted and destroying their meager property.



While the escalating famine is receiving much needed news coverage, the evictions are not. Since November 2016, over 60,000 people have been forcibly evicted, including from camps where people like Hassan have been arriving.



The government’s Badbaado camp is not immune. In March, two people who had lived there told me that a man turned up with an armed militia and threatened and coerced dozens of families into leaving their shelters. “We reported the threats to the police,” said “Ibrahim,” who had been living in the camp since the 2011 famine. “They replied ‘You don’t have evidence!’ They took no interest, and told us to leave. When we saw that they were not going to help us, we decided to leave the camp.”



For people who are already hungry and in very precarious situations, evictions often mean losing the few belongings they have, including basic shelter, access to day labor opportunities and greater insecurity and hunger.



Limited job opportunities put displaced women and girls at particular risk of sexual violence and exploitation – including the longer and often hazardous journeys they have to take to find firewood or water, secure day labor, or beg.



Many of those evicted have been forced to move to more dangerous places on the outskirts of Mogadishu, where shelter is scarce and access to aid is even more limited. The families recently evicted from Badbaado, including Ibrahim’s, moved toward Lafoole–20 kilometers outside of Mogadishu, where they have since been joined by people fleeing the current drought.



Some residents told me they were now living in huts made of sticks, they had no access to clean water and sanitary facilities, and they had so far only received assistance from local business people and youth groups that have been trying to raise funds for those newly displaced.



Somalia’s new leaders say that averting a famine and dealing with the resulting health crisis is a priority. But ignoring systemic abuses and the vulnerabilities of people most affected by previous and ongoing crises means that the current efforts will have limited long-term impact in protecting these communities from future displacement and risk.



The new government should put a stop to forced evictions from public land. A draft displacement policy from the previous administration spells out how to conduct lawful evictions. The government needs to endorse that policy and make sure it is carried out. No one should be evicted without due process, and the government needs to make sure that basic security and assistance are provided to the areas people move to.



At the same time, the government, along with its international partners, should urgently improve the protection and security at informal settlements in the main urban areas, so that people like Ibrahim and Hassan can find protection and the help they need.","Tue, 18 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2016/2015_afr_somalia_evictions.jpg,"['safe', 'crisisstricken', 'hassan', 'famine', 'haven', 'camp', 'assistance', 'evictions', 'camps', 'evicted', 'including', 'somalia', 'displacement', 'mogadishu']",

14,14,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Governments in sub-Saharan Africa are restricting religious freedom at the expense of security more than anywhere else globally - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/965389/governments-in-sub-saharan-africa-are-restricting-religious-freedom-at-the-expense-of-security-more-than-anywhere-else-globally/,"Countries in sub-Saharan Africa experienced the largest increase in social hostilities towards religious people globally in 2015, a new Pew Research Center study shows. This aggression stemmed largely from government harassment of religious groups in the name of security, and increased antagonism towards minority religions or practices.

Sub-Saharan Africa witnessed a 13% uptick in attacks against Muslims in 2015 compared to the previous year. The study uses two 10-point indices to rate 198 countries and self-governing territories on the prevalence of laws, policies, and actions that restrict religious beliefs and practices through things like government restrictions and social hostilities. The results showed that the median level of violence in sub-Saharan Africa rose to 2.2 points in 2015 from 1.5 in 2014. On the measure of social hostilities defined by Pew as “actions aimed at members of religious groups by private individuals and social groups,” including “hostile rhetoric, vandalism, and physical assaults,” Niger had the largest increase to two points, followed by Chad, South Sudan, and Burkina Faso.

Examples of these incidences included targeted bombings and shootings carried out by extremist groups like Boko Haram. Governments, wary of these groups’ actions, have responded by imposing severe restrictions on religious practices or prohibited the donning of certain attire, like the full-face veil.

The Pew report details examples of some of these aggressive actions. The Chadian government banned burqas in June 2015 for fear that attackers would use the loose garment, which covers the whole body, to hide explosives (a month later, a man dressed in a burqa killed 15 people in a market in the Chadian capital of N’Djamena). That October, the government arrested 62 women for wearing burqas. The governments of the Republic of Congo and Niger have also banned the full veil, citing security concerns. Headscarves are also a contentious issue in Kenya and Ghana, where students have been asked in some cases to remove their hijab before sitting for exams.

In August 2015, Muslim women in Cameroon reported being harassed at a highway roadblock by a police officer for wearing religious headscarves, even though a nun with a longer covering was allowed to pass. Following raids on a number of Quranic schools in Cameroon’s far north suspected of recruiting for Boko Haram, the government also arrested 84 children who remained in juvenile custody for months without being charged.

In Rwanda, members of the Jehovah’s Witnesses were arrested, beaten, and dismissed from government agencies and school between May and June 2014 for refusing to touch the national flag while taking oaths of office, and for not participating in community night patrols or school religious services. The group believes that saluting or bowing down to flag ascribes salvation to the state and not God.

Environmental changes, like desertification and persistent drought, is also driving religious strife. Clashes between Muslim Fulani herdsmen and predominantly Christian farmers over pasture and grazing land in Nigeria, for instance, poses a security threat bigger than Boko Haram, SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based intelligence consulting firm estimates.

These fissures threaten to undermine the tolerance and solidarity shown by Muslim and Christian communities who have coexisted side by side across the continent for years. Whether it’s the Islamic State bombing churches in Egypt, governments cracking down on religious practices, or al-Shabaab attacking churches and universities in Kenya, these unrelenting attacks are testing leaders’ ability to sustain longstanding religious harmony. The situation is also compounded by a demographic shift that will see more Christians and Muslims living in sub-Saharan Africa in the years ahead. By 2060, more than four in ten Christians will call the region home, up from 26% in 2015, while Muslims living in the region will increase to 27% from 16%—making it the most populous region for Muslims globally after the Asia-Pacific region.","Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rtx34sah-e1492766025636.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['africa', 'security', 'social', 'region', 'actions', 'freedom', 'groups', 'expense', 'restricting', 'muslims', 'religious', 'quartz', '2015', 'governments', 'subsaharan', 'globally']",

Following the sacking of Zdravko Logarusic, Sportsnetghana.com looks through five possible coaches who could take over the coaching job at Kotoko.



Maxwell Konadu



Konadu has been one of the experience coaches in the Ghana Premier League, he is currently Black Stars assistant coach, he has been heavily linked to re-join his boyhood club, Kotoko.



In his first stint as coach of Kotoko in the 2011/2012 season he won the Ghana Premier League.



Didi Dramani



After Maxwell Konadu left Kotoko after the 2011/2012, Dramani with no Premier League experience took charge of the Porcupine Warriors and he won the 202/2013 Ghana Premier League. He spent two seasons at Kotoko, in his last season he won double, the 2013/14 Ghana Premier League and the FA Cup.



With his exploits at the club he is a possible candidate to replace Zdravko Logarusic.



Bashir Hayford



Hayford is currently a free agent after leaving Ashanti Gold last week, the tough talking coach have had stints with Kotoko and he won the Ghana Premier League with the side in 2009.



Hayford made history during his days at Ashanti Gold, he became the first coach to end the club’s 20 year league title drought two seasons ago. With Kotoko coaching job currently vacant he is likely to get the nod.



Tom Strand



The Swedish tactician since the league started has been linked with a move to Kotoko, he is now without a club. Two seasons ago he guided Medeama to win their second FA Cup trophy. He has also been linked with Great Olympics.



Michael Osei



Osei’s return to Kotoko is possible. Before the league kick start he was the club’s caretaker coach, he was in charge of the club’s pre-season. With two weeks to start the Ghana Premier League he was shown the exit door.



Last week Osei was linked with Ashanti Gold , but his immediate return to Kotoko is imminent.","Mon, 10 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/src/Ghana_coach.jpg,"['coach', 'possible', 'replace', 'league', 'logarusic', 'seasons', 'won', 'linked', 'zdravko', 'gold', 'ghana', 'premier', 'coaches', 'kotoko']", 
16,16,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ireland steps up its humanitarian response to looming famine in Somalia - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/ireland-steps-its-humanitarian-response-looming-famine-somalia,"- Airlift of 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies dispatched to Somalia

Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Charlie Flanagan T.D., and Minister of State for the Diaspora and International Development, Joe McHugh T.D., announced that Ireland has today (Wednesday) dispatched over 100 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies to Somalia.

Announcing the airlift, Minister Flanagan said:

“I am deeply concerned that over 6 million people in Somalia are now in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. Almost 3 million people are facing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity and there is a very real and significant risk that the situation will further deteriorate to famine, causing starvation and death. This is simply unacceptable in our world of plenty.

“In Somalia today there are worrying similarities to the conditions that led to the worst famine of the 21st century when, in 2011, three-quarters of a million Somali people faced famine and more than a quarter million lives were lost. A massive and urgent scale up of assistance by the international community is required to avoid a similar catastrophe this year. Acting now will save lives.

“Over 400,000 people have been displaced in the country over the last six month because of prolonged drought, loss of livelihoods and acute hunger. They are congregating in informal settlements with nothing, arriving with only what they can carry. Most have walked long distances to reach these camps in hope that they will receive some assistance. Ireland’s donation of emergency supplies that we are announcing today will help to meet the immediate needs of up to 4,000 displaced families.”

“Today Ireland will dispatch an airlift, worth over €600,000, from the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Dubai, where Irish Aid pre-positions relief supplies for use in emergencies and humanitarian crises under Ireland’s Rapid Response Initiative.

“The relief supplies, including blankets, jerry cans, cooking sets, family hygiene kits, tarpaulins and solar lamps, will arrive in two loads into Mogadishu today (Wednesday) and Friday, and will be distributed by Concern Worldwide to 4,000 vulnerable families displaced by drought and acute hunger to informal settlements located outside of Mogadishu and Baidoa, and in the Afgoyee Corridor, north-west of Mogadishu.

“Last month, Ireland also announced new funding of €11 million to humanitarian crises in the Horn of Africa region, €3 million of which was contributed to the UN-managed Somalia Humanitarian Fund to help our partners to provide life-saving assistance to those most in need and at risk of famine in the country.”

Minister McHugh added:

“Severe drought conditions continue in many parts of Somalia following poor and erratic rains over the last two years. In the worst affected areas, poor rainfall has destroyed crops and killed livestock, and communities are being forced to sell their assets, and borrow food, to survive.

“If the forthcoming rainy season from April to June is as poor as is currently forecast, this hunger crisis will worsen and further displacement will occur. The situation for children is especially grave with over 360,000 Somali children under the age of five now acutely malnourished.

“Urgent action is required to provide emergency shelter and basic services for families that have been forced to move. Ireland is responding quickly through one of our trusted NGO partners. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.”

Always - Citifmonline,https://citifmonline.com/2017/04/the-tasteless-salt-of-adina-the-struggle-over-white-gold/,"An alarming sound was heard. The women looked towards the sea, wondering the tide that might have exuded such a trembling sound. Their men on sea wondered what went amiss at home.

Not sooner than they looked out for the noise, their children sprang out on the streets in tears; wailing and gnashing their teeth.

Yes! A tragedy befell the community again. Another ‘warrior’ has just fallen in their decade-old struggle to protect a livelihood which until recently they solely enjoyed.

It is a fight over daily bread which an expatriate also has an interest in.

Not until the government of Ghana granted a license to a British Salt Company Kensington to mine salt, throughout their lives, the people of Adina and satellite communities along the Keta Lagoon in the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta Region, worked tirelessly mining salt to take care of their families and contribute to the country’s food basket.

The community is a small stretch of land between the sea and the lagoon. The soil structure like any other coastline is very rough, porous and can hardly hold nutrient or water for crop production. Because of the nature of their land, most of them engage in fishing and trade in salt.

Sadly, the recent unattractiveness of the fishing business has forced most of them to concentrate more on dealing in salt.

But fulfilling their salt venture comes at a price; a bloody battle between them and the foreigners.

This is because in 2010, the government of Ghana, entered into an agreement with the British Company, Kensington, to allow the latter dig, win, mine and produce salt on a section of the Keta lagoon in the Ketu South Municipality of the Volta Region .

The company is fully owned by a British, but workers on site are mostly Indians.

According to the locals, per the agreement, Kensington was to draw water from the sea for their production, and also develop the local concession ( ie 300metres at the edges ) to provide an alternate livelihood for the residents.

But the residents say,company is yet to fulfill its part of the agreement.

This has among others generated unending agitations from the local salt miners and the residents, who accuse government and the company of leaving them to their fate.

Early this month, some irate youth in town took matters into their own hands and invaded the company’s premises. Their action was also in protest against the arrest of four of their women who were purportedly accused of harvesting salt at an ‘unapproved’ area. The youth damaged properties belonging to the company and assaulted the workers. During the confrontation, one of them was gunned down by the police and others injured.

The recent incident is one among several clashes between the locals and the foreign company that have resulted in death and loss of properties.

Like every conflict situation, it is important to recognize the conflict, understand the source, and predict the possible actions of the various parties involved and how to tackle it.

My colleague, Pearl Akanya Ofori and I, moved to the area to spend days investigating the possible causes of the unrest, and to prescribe possible remedies.

In the case of Adina and its surrounding communities including Kpedzakope and Gbevekope, their major problem with the foreign company is their decision to drill water from the ground which they presume is causing drought in their area. They complain their wells are drying out; coconut trees withering and the residual water in the wells have turned salty. And this wasn’t the case until Kensington started operations.

Workers of Kensington also share the same water reservoir which hitherto was solely used by the locals. This has also affected the quantity and quality of water supply to the residents. The lagoon land space which was to serve as a ramzar site for endangered species like waterbirds and buffer zones for flooding, has also almost been eaten up and the remaining portions dried up.

Our visit to the community revealed how the residents struggled daily to have access to potable water. The local salt miners who we spoke to lamented that they face unfair market competition from the foreign company, which produces salt in large quantities and sell at cheaper prizes.

The situation in Adina and the satellite communities, can best be compared to the Ancient Mariner who in the midst of water couldn’t get a drop to quench his thirst.

Kensington on the other hand would not take any of such claims. The fact that the Minerals Commission has given them the right to operate on the concession is one thing they would keenly protect.

The Public Relations Officer of the Company, Adams Mensah told Citi News, the company has met all the requirements from the various regulatory bodies in the country, and have had a cordial relationship with the community over the years. He explained that the decision to drill water from the ground was the Company’s short-term plan, thus they would soon start drawing water from the sea for salt production as part of their long-term goals.

What is scientifically evident is that, the degree of salinity in the underground water is higher than that of the sea water. Thus, it is economically prudent to produce salt using underground water than the use of the sea water. It is with this conviction that many believe the company is unwilling to undertake its long-term plan of tapping water from the sea.

This has also been discounted by Adams Mensah, who argued that the cost of using electricity in drilling the borehole is more expensive than drawing from the sea.

A Geophysicist, Selorm Dogbevia Greenfield, in an interview told Citi News drilling water underground for mass production of salt, is likely to affect the quantity and quality of water from the water table. This was also confirmed by officials of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

What is also revealing is that, the Water Resources Commission has denied ever giving license to Kensington to drill water.

Following our revelations, the Minister for Land and Natural Resources, Peter Amewu in the company of officials from the Minerals Commission, EPA and the Water Resources Commission, visited the area to meet with the management of the company.

After that crunch meeting, he directed that the company with immediate effect desists from drilling water for their production, and gave them an ultimatum to start tapping water from the sea. He also pledged to further engage the company and other key stakeholders to solvw other outstanding issues in the agreement.

It is indeed a great relief to hear this from the Minister, and it is our prayer that the directives would be carried out accordingly.

Beyond the impasse between the locals and the foreign company, we also found out some chieftaincy problems which were derailing efforts in the implementation of the terms in the agreement. Issues over ownership of the landscape, and the eligibility of some chiefs also brought their ugly heads.

Across the country, there are similar situations happening mostly as a result of poor contractual agreements or partners failing to play their part of the bargain. This is saddening, especially when locals are made to suffer the consequences of such decisions.

The recent revelations must open up discussions on our mining policies and local participation. Government, instead of “bequeathing” lands to multinational companies for extraction of natural resources for several decades, should put in place skills transfer and short term successive plans in order to empower our people economically. The fact that Ghana is rich in natural resources but the citizens remain poor should be a worry to all of us.

Salt production in Ghana contributes billions of Ghana cedis to the economy, and employs more than 2000 people in the country.

Ghana is among the few nations in West Africa that has huge salt reserves to feed the world’s demands.

Businesses strive when there is peace, but that peace cannot be assured when indigenes feel left out of their natural livelihood.

The current situation where foreigners are allowed to wholly own businesses in the country, has largely contributed to the needless agitations and litigation from the locals who feel their natural wealth are being taken away. Companies investing in Ghana should also take into consideration business partnerships with community members in order to generate enough affinity between the community and company.

The Minerals Commission and other relevant stakeholders might consider improving on local participation component in our extractive laws.

The locals in Adina might not be well-educated to explain scientific phenomena, but they are feeling the impact of the changes in their environment than any expert’s conjecture.

The cultural differences in the society shape the responses to conflicts in different societies. We can condemn the acts by the youth of the town, but we cannot be certain of how a different society may express their grievances if faced with a similar situation.

There is obviously a need to go back to the negotiation table for all parties to reach a consensus. The traditional authorities must move to the negotiation table with a united front.

And the youth of Adina and the adjoining communities, must give peace a chance; draw back the rifles and inflammatory language. No Society today grows through the heroism of its troops on the field of battle; but grows when it turns to tolerance and arbitration.

The salt at Adina would remain ‘tasteless’ for the people, and continue to make life unbearable until such differences are ironed out.

——————————————————————————————————————-

Note: This address was delivered at the Detroit branch of Workers World Party public forum held on Sat. April 22, 2017. The event examined various anti-imperialist struggles taking placed around the world from the Middle East and Africa to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Venezuela. Other speakers included the event chairperson Kayla Pauli of Workers World Party, Randi Nord of Workers World Party, Joe Mchahwar of WWP youth section, Tom Michalak of WWP read a paper prepared by Jim Carey of Geo-politics Alert and WWP, Yvonne Jones of the Detroit Active and Retired Employees Association (DAREA), and Martha Grevatt of the UAW Local 869, who is also a contributing editor for Workers World newspaper.

——————————————————————————————————————

Any reasonable observer of the United States ruling class discourse during April 2017 realizes that the imperialist war drive is still a dominant theme.

Many people were quite skeptical if not disbelieving of the campaign rhetoric of current President Donald J. Trump when he hinted at lessening tensions with the Russian Federation over the wars in Syria and eastern Ukraine. These decisions to embark upon a militarist approach to foreign policy is well entrenched in history.

After all the indigenous Native peoples were driven off their lands and systematic genocide remain the order of the day in light of the situation at Standing Rock as a stark example. Of course African people having been kidnapped into slavery and super-exploited for two-and-a-half centuries through involuntary servitude by the purportedly “enlightened and civilized” British, French, Spanish, Danish and Dutch ruling classes were essential in the transformation of the economic system of the West from feudalism and mercantilism into industrial capitalism and imperialism.

The Atlantic Slave Trade not only created the economic conditions for the rise of mass production utilizing steam technology, large-scale agricultural commodity exports and raw material extraction, it developed more effective means of generating surplus value through the advent of the mining outposts and plants where scientific manufacturing systems such as Taylorism and Fordism took capitalism to unprecedented levels of wealth generation. Although capitalism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries expanded the capacity to generate wealth, it only intensified the contradictions between labor and the owners of production.

It was the global triangular trading system of slave labor, agricultural commodification and export for profit which fueled the economic imperative of colonial imperialism. Slavery was abolished beginning in the early decades of the 19th century only to pave the way for a more effective process of exploitation. Even though workers in the colonies both foreign and domestic were considered emancipated in fact they were enslaved through their dependence on meager wages needed to maintain an existence after the destruction of more traditional forms of farming and small scale commodity production.

The colonial project in the British colonies of the northeast and southeast as mentioned above was based on genocide and enslavement. The contradictions between the ruling classes of Britain and what became known as the U.S. was resolved through the so-called Revolutionary War, which some historian now realize was in actuality a counter-revolution to preserve chattel slavery, and the War of 1812, which solidified the quest for American dominance over areas south of the Canadian border.

Contemporary Instances of Imperialist Destabilization Efforts in Africa: The Case of Cameroon

For the purpose of this discussion let us first look at the current situation in the West African state of Cameroon. This is a country that garners almost no news reporting in the U.S. due to what is perceived as a lack of strategic interests.

Nonetheless, over the last several months a mounting struggle across the country has paralyzed the ability of the public sector to function in an efficient manner. The Cameroon crisis is almost completely framed by corporate media reports as a conflict between the French and English speaking regions of the nation. Two provinces are dominated by those who speak English while the other eight are largely under the influence of French language and culture.

Teachers and civil servants went out on strike late last year in the English speaking provinces due to policies initiated by the government of President Paul Biya, who has been in office now for 35 years. Lawyers and legal workers objected to the imposition of French speaking judges in their court systems which created an untenable situation.

Later teachers in the English speaking provinces complained of the inadequacy of educational materials mandated by the French-oriented regime. Moreover, teachers were not being paid for their work and these factors precipitated a general strike among both educators and legal workers.

The Biya government responded by imposing draconian measures such as the termination of internet services in an attempt to make it more difficult to organize resistance. Just recently the government announced that it is reinstating connectivity to these provinces in the western region of the country.

This labor unrest eventually spread to the French speaking areas as well. Teachers in the other provinces went out on strike saying that in many cases they have not received a paycheck in as much as five years. Many teachers who graduated college and were hired as educators had not been able to collect one dime for their services.

Despite the efforts of the government and business press to frame the conflict as purely a sectional one, stripping it of its class and anti-imperialist dimensions, this has not been wholly successful. One of the leading football stars of Cameroon, the champions of the Africa Cup, openly expressed solidarity with the people of the English speaking regions of the country.

Nevertheless, how did this situation develop? Africa was subjected to imperialist divisions during the late 19th century.

There is almost no appreciation or acknowledgement of the role of Germany under Otto von Bismarck in the imperialist partitioning of the continent. The fact of the matter is the Berlin Conference was held there due to the important role of Germany in the colonial project.

In a series of three articles published recently by this writer, I have outlined the role of Germany in its genocidal and exploitative role during the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Africa. These articles dealt with the demand by the Herero people of Namibia, formerly known as South West Africa, for the payment of reparations stemming from the genocide against the Namibian people during 1904-1907. Tens of thousands of Africans were slaughtered, forcibly removed from their traditional lands, starved and worked death simply because they revolted against the imposition of German colonialism in the final years of the 1800s and the first decade of the 1900s.

Also the Germans were involved in East Africa through the colonization of the area now known as Tanzania, then Tanganyika, along with Rwanda and Burundi. In Tanzania, the Maji Maji Revolt of 1905-07 against German imperialism prompted another genocidal wave of violence resulting in untold numbers of deaths through brute force, dislocation and systematic starvation. The people of Tanzania are now demanding reparations from the government in Berlin which is seeking to enhance its trade and political relationships with independent African states.

Cameroon was as well a German colony during this same period. Atrocities were committed through forced labor initiatives utilized to build railroads and agricultural commodity production. Those Africans who refused to cooperate were tortured and killed in the thousands.

All of these historical developments occurred decades prior to the holocaust in Germany, Poland and Hungary of the 1930s and 1940s under the Third Reich of Adolph Hitler. Yet the consciousness of people in the West, and even within Africa itself, is almost nil in this regard.

During the course of World War I, Germany lost all of their colonies in Africa. The imposition of the Treaty of Versailles negotiated by President Woodrow Wilson and the victorious European imperialist powers in the aftermath of the First World War did not bring peace to the globe but set the stage for the rise of fascism and the advent of World War II.

However, there has been no recognition of the colonial history of Cameroon in evaluating the contemporary political impasse. It is important to evoke the anti-imperialist and revolutionary national liberation history of Cameroon.

In the aftermath of WWII, there was a wave of anti-imperialist fervor internationally. Africa did not escape this phenomenon. The Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC) sought immediate national independence during the 1950s. Having met vicious repression on the part of the French colonialists, they embarked upon an armed struggle. Consequently, the UPC was targeted for liquidation by Paris.

Two of the leading figures in the UPC, Ruben Um Nyobe and Felix Roland Moumie were assassinated. Nyobe was killed on the battlefield in 1958. Moumie was later poisoned in Switzerland by the French secret police in 1960. The political forces which became the official government after independence in the early 1960s were willing to compromise with imperialism. Although Cameroon was further divided through the independence process, officially it is not supposed to be a francophone state.

Consequently, it is important to look beyond the headlines in order to understand the post-colonial conflicts in Africa. As historical and dialectical materialists we must uncover the truth through an examination of the social forces motivating existing contradictions both within the society as well as external influences.

Trump Escalates Imperialist War in Somalia

Late last month, President Trump issued another executive order on Somalia. The essence of the initiative was to purportedly relax restrictions on carrying out aerial strikes against Al-Shabaab fighters who have been in a war with the U.S. and European Union (EU) supported government in Mogadishu.

Washington has a long history of military and intelligence interference in the internal affairs of Somalia. In the last decade, the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has engaged in targeted assassinations, training programs for the reconstructed of the Somalian National Army and the embedding of U.S. personnel within local state structures.

These policy efforts are bolstered by the presence of flotillas of warships off the coast of Somalia in the Gulf of Aden, one of the most lucrative shipping lanes in the world. The situation in Somalia manifested by the naval presence of the Pentagon and the EU in the Gulf of Aden is closely related to the imperialist war in Yemen, Syria and the entire region of West Asia.

The previous administrations of Presidents George W. Bush, Jr. and Barack Hussein Obama engaged in aggressive military and covert operations in Somalia. Since 2007, U.S. and British warplanes have staged bombing operations in various regions of the Horn of Africa state.

Therefore, the proclamation by Trump is merely a disingenuous approach to continuing the already existing war policy in the Horn of Africa. Additional Pentagon troops are being deployed to Somalia in a supposed bolstering of training operations in support of the recently-elected administration in Mogadishu.

In fact the role of the U.S. in Somalia over the last twenty five years has done more ensure that no real political settlement is achieved in the country. When any semblance of national unity and social stability is achieved it is immediately attacked by Washington. This holds true for successive Republican and Democratic administrations.

Somalia is an oil-rich nation where leading multi-national petroleum firms are engaging in drilling. Its natural resource wealth combined with the strategic waterways off the coast makes the nation an important focal point of imperialist intrigue on the African continent extending through the so-called Middle East.

Nevertheless, despite all of the natural wealth and imperialist funding of military operations, including the stationing of 22,000 African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) troops which are funded and trained by the imperialist states, the humanitarian situation in the country is worsening on a daily basis. Somalia has for nearly four decades suffered from periodic drought and famine. These problems have forced millions of its residents into neighboring states throughout Africa, the Middle East and even into Western Europe and North America.

The advent of colonialism scattered the Somalian people across five different geographic nation-states: British Somaliland, Italian Somaliland, French Somaliland, Kenya and imperial Ethiopia under the monarchy. The maintenance of the status-quo under neo-colonialism is the driving forces by the U.S. support of military intervention by neighboring states such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti.

Formerly French Somaliland, Djibouti, is now the largest base of the U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) on the continent. This geographically and populated small Horn of Africa state houses thousands of American and French troops at Camp Lemonier serving as an imperialist base for Pentagon and CIA operations across the region including Yemen.

With all of these resources flowing in from the West and its allies, why are the people in Somalia still under extreme duress? It is largely due to the real objectives of the imperialist states which are to ensure geo-strategic dominance and the exploitation of resources and labor.

In a report issued by the Inter-regional Information Network (IRIN) of the United Nations on March 28, it says: “Six years after a famine killed a quarter of a million people in Somalia, the country is threatened with another. Famines only occur if political decision-makers allow them to; it is imperative that the right decisions are made now. But have we learnt enough from the mistakes of 2011? The context has changed since 2011. Somalia now has a functioning – if limited and fragile – state apparatus. Some of the areas worst affected by the last crisis have since received considerable resilience investment (although how far such programming has helped people prepare for or cope with the current crisis is not yet known).”

IRIN continues in this same article emphasizing: “Food security, nutrition and health are rapidly deteriorating in affected areas of the Sool Plateau in the north of Somalia and in the ‘sorghum belt’ in the south. In late 2016, the deyr rains failed in the south and the earlier gu rains were well below average, bringing national grain yields to their lowest in a decade. Predictions for the coming gu season in the affected areas are not optimistic. Food prices are rising. The purchasing power of typical households has declined by 20 percent in some areas of the north and by as much as 60 percent in the hardest-hit areas in the south – repeating the dangerous pattern seen in early 2011. Large-scale livestock deaths are already occurring. The Shabelle River, which provides irrigation water and a livestock refuge in the south, ran dry at some locations in January and remains dangerously low.”

Such as profound contradiction of increasing U.S. military involvement and deteriorating social conditions are by no means an anomaly. This is the actual history of imperialism in Africa over the last six centuries.

Prior to the rise of the Atlantic Slave Trade and colonialism, the area now known as Somalia was very much a part of the world system extending from the Far East in Asia to the Indian Ocean basin. This trading network existed for at least a thousand years and was not disrupted until the rise of Portugal and Spain as the initiators of the triangular construct leading to involuntary servitude as an economic system.

In understanding this history it is quite conceivable that the system of imperialism can be overthrown and transcended. This basis for the establishment of an alternative economic method of organizing society, the relationships between states, and the priorities of production, has been set forth through socialist ideology.

This is the reason why imperialism declared war on socialism in its infancy following the Russian Revolution (1917) and the subsequent founding of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (1922) in 1922. Both the bourgeois liberal imperialists and their fascist counterparts longed for the destruction of the Soviet Union and the national liberation movements through the rise of the Third Reich, Mussolini’s Italy, Franco’s Spain and Japanese expansionism in Asia. The breaking of the might of the Nazi military apparatus at Stalingrad and other key battles in 1942-43 has never been fully recognized by the educational modules that have achieved dominance in the U.S.

Then of course the efforts by both Italy and Germany to reclaim their imperialist ambitions during World War II led to some of the fiercest battles of the period being waged in the North Africa regions of Egypt and Libya in 1942-43. Ethiopia’s invasion by Italian imperialist fascism in 1935, are far as Africa is concerned, represented the beginning of the Second World War.

Even with the defeat of Italy and Germany in 1944-45 solidifying the resultant dominance of England, France and the U.S. did not lead to the abolition of colonialism. A Cold War beginning in 1947 was not merely designed to reverse the advances of socialism and national liberation in Vietnam, Korea and China. The Cold War represented the imperatives of the West to maintain its colonial hegemony among the immense majority of humanity in the oppressed nations of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean.

In addition, the contradictions within the imperialist states themselves had reached unprecedented proportions prior to World War II. The Great Depression of the 1930s brought the capitalist system to the brink of collapse. Both the ruling classes of the U.S. and Britain were forced through their desire for mere survival to adopt the Welfare State, incorporating elements of socialist “safeguards” to protect the interests of the private ownership of capital and to ameliorate the antagonism of the nationally oppressed and the proletariat as a whole.

These dynamics on the part of imperialism are manifested in Africa through the crises in Somalia and throughout the continent in the present era. Drought and famine are spreading across the region at a rapid pace.

IRIN in this same above-mentioned report stressed: “On the other hand, the current drought is more widespread than that of 2011. Global competition for humanitarian resources is fiercer. Parts of South Sudan have already been declared to be experiencing famine, and the situation there is likely to worsen substantially over the next four to five months, while Nigeria and Yemen also face the imminent threat of famine. Across the world, a record 70 million people are estimated to need emergency food aid in 2017. Yet there are fears some donors, notably the U.S., will significantly cut their aid budget this year, including for humanitarian assistance.”

The U.S.-based corporate and government-sponsored media never asks the simple question: How is the renewed military build-up by the Pentagon in Somalia going to address the humanitarian crisis? Or what is the correlation between imperialist militarism and underdevelopment as represented by increasing poverty, dislocation, food deficits and political instability? Also what real impact does aid from the West actually have on the imperatives of self-reliance, self-determination, genuine independence and sovereignty and sustainable development?

We can only conclude based upon the actual history of Africa that what is described as “aid” is part and parcel of a reinforcement of the cycle of dependency stemming from centuries of slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism. The only real solutions must derive from the struggle of the masses against Western domination which can only be effectively realized through Pan-Africanism and Socialism in practice.

The Destabilization of South Africa, Zimbabwe and the SADC Region

Finally we must look at recent events in the sub-continent to get an even clearer insight into the African situation. The Republic of South Africa is the most industrialized state on the continent due in large part to the international division of economic power and labor.

During the 19th century, the struggle for the imperialist control of South Africa and the Southern Africa region intensified through the quest for control of its treasure trove of natural resources and arable land. The mining of gold and diamonds in South Africa and Zimbabwe thrusts these countries into the forefront of imperialist exploitation worldwide.

The complete rationalization of capitalist exploitation through the apartheid system after 1948 was by no means an aberration. This social pattern had been based on developments in the U.S. where the indigenous people were forced off of the most arable and mineral rich lands to make way for the settler-colonialists. Super-exploitation of the labor of Africans generated profits so enormous that the return on investments was unprecedented in comparison to any other period in world economic history.

A protracted struggle for national independence accelerated in the aftermath of World War II with the Rand Miners’ Strike, the development of the African National Congress Youth League Program of Action, the Defiance Campaign Against Unjust Laws, the creation of a Federation of South African Women, the advent of the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), the Congress of Democrats, etc.

By the period between 1976 and 1994, less than two decades, the African masses and their allies were able to force the racist apartheid National Party from power. The African National Congress, which had been labelled as communist and terrorist were able to construct a government that remains in power after 23 years.

In response to the national liberation movement in South Africa, occurring in conjunction with the overall African revolutionary struggle across the continent and the broader international community, the owners of capital sought to undermine the capacity of the ANC to effectively govern the post-apartheid state. Large scale disinvestment after the advent of the national democratic government was far more significant in real terms than the divestment movement which sprung up from the 1960s through the early 1990s, targeting the settler-colonial system itself and its enablers in the imperialist countries, mainly the transnational corporations and financial institutions based in the West.

Even today a major controversy has developed over the economic trajectory of ANC government policy. Since the world recession of 2008 and beyond, the South African people have loss millions of jobs inside the country. This is due to the shrinking of manufacturing and monetary markets increasing the cost of conducting commerce and prompting the closure of plants, mines and its concomitant impact.

These developments were compounded with the reaction of capital to the demands of the working class for a greater share of the profits accrued from the exploitation of strategic minerals, commodities and manufacturing production. The legacy of radical trade unionism is South Africa has roots which extend back for the greater portion of the 20th century to the present. Without the essential role of the South African working class, the overthrow of the apartheid system could have never been achieved within the existing historical framework.

The formation of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) in 1985 placed tremendous pressure on the already beleaguered settler-colonial state and internal capitalist system which was dependent upon the investments from Wall Street, Washington and London. An organized working class union with a strong alliance with the national liberation movement and the South African Communist Party (SACP) signaled the potential for a genuine socialist construction after the demise of white minority-rule.

Since 1994, the Tripartite Alliance has been flexible and even conciliatory in its approach to the immediate need of preserving foreign capital inside South Africa. Yet this approach has not been met with reciprocity by the ruling class. Not only have the mine owners and other capitalists retrenched production facilities and markets as well as laying off many workers over the last several years, they have systematically resisted any mentioned within the public discourse of the necessity of wealth redistribution as a prerequisite for the realization of a people’s democracy.

The opposition parties which have sprung up to challenge the ANC on an electoral level are largely bankrolled by the capitalist class. The Democratic Alliance (DA) advocates policies of greater neo-liberalism which have not worked effectively anywhere in Africa or throughout the world. Another party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is led by Julius Malema who was expelled from the ANC several years ago. Although the EFF takes an ultra-left position in its rhetoric, objectively it has blocked with the DA which is in actuality a party of the white settler-class despite the Black figureheads who are ostensibly in charge of the organization.

A recent illustration of the role of international finance capital and its efforts to strangle the South African National Democratic Revolution was the revelations regarding the currency fixing carried out by some of the leading banks inside the country. This scandal is strikingly similar to the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) matter which gained considerable media coverage in years past. LIBOR was utilized to exploit working people utilizing insider information and informal negotiations to maximize the profits of these firms at the expense of the most vulnerable within capitalist society.

A report published by this writer in March says: “In South Africa, it was revealed by an anti-trust agency that during the period where residents were negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the economy fueled in part by the fluctuating value of the rand, banks were profiting from these problems. These multi-national firms represent some of the largest of such entities in South Africa and the world. The South African Competition Commission cited the following companies in relationship to the currency fixing matter: Citigroup, Nomura, Standard Bank, Investec, JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse Group, Commerzbank AG, Standard New York Securities Inc., Macquarie Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML), ANZ Banking Group Ltd, Standard Chartered Plc and Barclays Africa (Absa), part of the Barclays Plc. Investec and Barclays agreed to participate in the probe. Nonetheless, Standard Bank, BAML, Nomura, Credit Suisse, ANZ and Standard Chartered have not gone on record as to whether they will cooperate in the inquiry.” (Global Research, March 16)

This same report goes on to stress that: “These developments in South Africa and internationally illustrates that the economic system of capitalism is controlled by an ever shrinking group of financial interests who operate as a matter of policy in contravention to the majority of people not only within the western industrialized states notwithstanding throughout the world. As the African Union member-states face escalating economic difficulties a re-emergent debt crisis in looming. This burgeoning phenomenon of declining currency values and lack of credit availability portends much for the ability to strengthen both state and non-state structures in Africa. Escalating rates of poverty and lack of national and regional economic capacity will inevitably foster even greater dependency on the West and its transnational institutions.”

This is why the lessons of Zimbabwe and its land reclamation process are important. After two decades of independence from settler-colonialism, in 2000, the Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) government initiated a constitutionally engineered policy of seizing and redistributing millions of acres of land which rightfully belonged to the African people. The land was illegally confiscated by Cecil Rhodes and his class of settler-colonialists. In order to carry out this process it was necessary to politically enslave the masses through a colonial system of military and economic domination. Sanctions were enacted against Zimbabwe not only by the former colonial power of Britain but also their erstwhile imperialist allies in Washington and Brussels. Zimbabwe is yet to recover from this economic war against social transformation yet the farmers are able to exercise a greater degree of self-determination and economic independence through land ownership. Studies conducted by the Institute for Development Studies in Britain confirm the positive impact of land reform which is sorely needed in South Africa and Namibia as well.

A recent summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) endorsed a regional industrialization program aimed at fostering such self-reliance and internal-centered development policy. Nonetheless, it will be a challenge in pushing forward with this process because it goes right up against the desire on the part of the former colonial and current neo-colonial powers which actively work against genuine independence and sovereignty.

Conclusion: The Need for an Anti-Imperialist Viewpoint

These examples of events on the continent bring attention to the cause of anti-imperialism in the U.S. We must be in complete solidarity with all anti-capitalist, socially progressive and socialist-oriented policy initiatives taking place in Africa.

The African states have an inherent right to shape their own governmental and societal structures free of imperialist influence. It is quite obvious that six centuries of slavery, colonialism, neo-colonialism and imperialism has failed to bring real development to the people. Therefore, the importance of social transformation should be a priority of all modern-day anti-imperialist and solidarity forces in North America.

20,20,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ministry Retrieve 500 Excavators From Illegal Mining Sites - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/ministry-retrieve-500-excavators-from-illegal-mining-sites/,"The Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Mr John Peter Amewu, on Wednesday said 500 excavators have, so far, been retrieved from mining sites with 1,148 dredges taken from major rivers in the country.

He said the Ministry would collaborate with the Ministry of Environment, Science, Innovation and Technology, to establish a desk to combat illicit mining and crack the whip on anyone involved.

Mr Amewu said this when he toured some mining sites in the Upper West Akyem Municipality, Atiwa East and Denkyemboar districts in the Eastern Region.

The tour followed a three-week ultimatum the Minister gave to illegal miners to evacuate their machines and leave all mining sites. The ultimatum expired on Tuesday, April 18.

The team, comprising officials of the Minerals Commission as well as some police personnel, visited communities including Akenten, Pianaman, Moseaso and Kubriso.

Some illegal miners who were working on some concessions left the site upon seeing the team.

There were excavators abandoned at the mining sites while others were packed in front of houses.

The Minister called on the Environmental Protection Agency to collaborate with the Minerals Commission in monitoring the various miming sites to ensure licensed mining firms reclaimed the lands concurrently while mining went on.

He said there was the need for a sustained fight against illegal mining and called for collective efforts by all stakeholders including the traditional authorities, land owners, the media, civil society organisations and politicians to help stop the practice.

Mr Amewu gave the assurance that the Government would sustain the fight for the next five years.

Dr Tony Aubynn, the Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, said the key stakeholders supposed to combat the menace had been complicit and, therefore, called for collaborative efforts to deal decisively with the challenge.

Illegal mining, otherwise known as galamsey, had degraded the environment and polluted water bodies all over the country.

The Abontendomhene of Kyebi, Nana Boakye Dankwa, who later received the Minister and his entourage, charged the Government to sustain the fight against illegal mining and prosecute persons involved.

Their numbers are spectacular, at the height of their history, but we have the goal of always: make a great match, regardless of the stage. It will be difficult”. The coach did not want to analyze the situation of the possible sanctioning of Neymar and expressed his confidence in the squad: “We are more than capable to supply Busquets, it is normal for a player to see cards”

“Sergio Busquets is a crucial player for us; just look at his statistics and you will understand how important he is. However, suspensions are normal in a competition like this and we must be ready to replace him in the best possible way”. Enrique explained.

Regarding the final of Berlin, he has warned that “it is a positive memory, but it will have nothing to do with the final” and considers that the defeat of Malaga does not have to be a spur: “At this point the player already Is more than attentive. It’s very attractive the competition, and more face the semifinals, I do not think I have to see what happened before. ” He also believes that 6-1 has little to do now: “Notros we have no previous results, eight teams are in quarters and it will depend on who develops a better game, which is more successful in the areas … Of many details.

I have watched many Juve matches and they are always trying to impose their own game in every part of the pitch. They will do the same tomorrow, but you must put that question to Allegri. I can only tell you what we will do. We will try to win, as we always do. I have only good memories of my experience in Italy. I had the chance to experience a new culture which I enjoyed a lot.

There are a few different players compared to the Berlin final. Juve are still a great team, but I cannot say if they are better or worse than two years ago. I have great memories of that final, but this game is completely different. Both sides are definitely confident about their chances. I certainly don’t need to motivate players for a quarter-final against a team like Juventus.

He has defended André Gomes and does not think it fair to blame him.For him Barça played well against Sevilla and also in Malaga: “Both games were good matches. In Malaga we were higher and penalized a play in particular. The result was unfair. We can not go crazy when a defeat comes or when we win with clarity. ”

Although he must have a forecast that keeps for himself, he has not externalized what Juventus expects: “I have seen him press high, I have seen him withdraw .. dominate all records. I can tell you what we will do; Make our game, looking for victory from the beginning. “

UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is warning today that the risk of mass deaths from starvation among populations in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Nigeria is growing. This warning is in light of droughts that are also affecting many neighbouring countries and a funding shortfall that has become so severe that an avoidable humanitarian crisis in the region, possibly worse than that of 2011, is fast becoming an inevitability.

Already displacement is rising, forcing us to upgrade our displacement estimates for 2017. In Sudan, for example, where our initial estimate was for 60,000 arrivals from South Sudan this year, we are in the process of revising the expected total upwards to 180,000. Similarly in Uganda we are revising planning from 300,000 displaced to 400,000.

In all, more than 20 million people in Nigeria, South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen are experiencing famine or are at risk. The regions in which these countries sit, including the Lake Chad basin, Great Lakes, East, Horn of Africa and Yemen together host well over 4 million refugees and asylum seekers. Consecutive harvests have failed, conflict in South Sudan coupled with drought is leading to famine and outflows of refugees, insecurity in Somalia is leading to rising internal displacement, and rates of malnutrition are high, especially among children and lactating mothers. In the Dollo Ado area of southeast Ethiopia for example, acute malnutrition rates among newly arriving Somali refugee children aged between 6 months and five years are now running at 50-79 percent.

Children account for the majority of refugees (62 per cent, for instance, in the case of refugees fleeing South Sudan) and in common with other refugees nearly all are dependent on food assistance via our sister-agency WFP. With no money to buy food, rations however are being cut. In Djibouti rations have been cut by 12 per cent, in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Rwanda by between 20 and 50 per cent, and in Uganda by up to 75 per cent. Many refugees are without full access to livelihoods and agriculture or food production and their ability to take matters into their own hands and help themselves is limited.

In this context, the risks to children can be particularly great. Already, many are dropping out of school. In Kenya, 175,000 students in drought areas have stopped attending school. In Ethiopia, almost 600 schools have closed. In all, some five million children could in the coming weeks and months see their educations being disrupted.

Inside Somalia, the internal displacement dynamics are shifting too. Of the half a million people displaced since November, 278,000 were displaced in the first quarter of 2017. More than 72,000 of these have moved to the capital Mogadishu. Some 69,000 others have headed to Baidoa in the country’s southwest. Somalia continues to see a complex situation of both outflows and returns (mainly from Yemen).

In famine hit parts of South Sudan, where UN agencies warned in February that fighting, insecurity, lack of access to aid and collapsing economy had left 100,000 people facing starvation in some parts of the country, a further 1 million people are now on the brink of famine.

In Yemen, which is experiencing the world’s largest humanitarian crisis with almost 19 million people in need of humanitarian help, around 17 million people are food insecure. Food needs are being cited as the lead factor in displacement at three quarters of all locations where there are internally displaced people.

In northern Nigeria, seven million people are now struggling with food insecurity and need help. The situation is particularly bad in parts of Borno, Adamawa and Yobo states where by June it’s expected that some 5.1 million people will be in Integrated Food Security Phase classification levels of between 3 and 5 (worst).

UNHCR is scaling up efforts with its partners, we remind the international community that the Horn of Africa drought of 2011 cost more than 260,000 lives, more than half of these children aged below five. A repeat must be avoided at all costs. Our operations in South Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen are today funded at between 3 and 11 percent. It is now urgent that the shortfalls be addressed.

UNHCR High Commissioner Filippo Grandi is attending a high-level extraordinary meeting in Berlin tomorrow, 12 April 2017. The “Berlin Humanitarian Call – jointly against famine” meeting, called for by the German Federal Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, will bring together donor countries and humanitarian partners, as well as local responders, to review and raise more awareness for the dire humanitarian situation in the countries affected

24,24,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,South Sudan Rebels Wants Genocide investigated - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/south-sudan-rebels-wants-genocide-investigated/,"South Sudanese rebel factions on Tuesday called on the international community to investigate what they term as targeted killings along ethnic lines nearing genocide in the war-torn country.

The SPLA-in opposition (SPLA-IO), Sudan Peoples’ Liberation Movement – Former Detainees (FDs), National Democratic Movement (NDM), People’s Democratic Movement (PDM), South Sudan National Movement for Change (SSNMC) and National Salvation Front (NAS) said in a joint statement that genocide was being orchestrated by the government as the region and international community kept quiet. “We urge the region and the international community to urgently investigate, document, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of recent genocide in Wanduruba, Yei, Lainya, Pajok and Kajokeji in Equatoria, Wau in Bahr el-Ghazal, and in all of Upper Nile before appropriate courts or tribunals,” they said.”As this murderous campaign unfolds, the region and the broader international community, for the most part, has stood by, excused the aggressor and justified the inaction of the world on the intransigence of the perpetrator,” they added.

The rebels also said the tribal killings underway were reminiscent of the December 2013 fighting that resulted into the killings of the Nuer and Dinka ethnic people, to which former Vice President Riek Machar and President Salva Kiir belong respectively. However, President Kiir’s spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny has denied SPLA troops were orchestrating killings along tribal lines. He added the government can not commit genocide against its people. “The government cannot commit, implement genocide against South Sudanese. The state apparatus can not be used against a particular tribe,” he said.

South Sudan descended into violence in December 2013, as political disputes between President Kiir and his former deputy Machar caused fighting to spread along ethnic lines.The fighting has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions of others from their homes, according to the UN. Both the SPLA and militia groups fighting in Yei, Kajokeji areas of Equatoria region, have been accused of carrying out ethnic targeted killings on civilians, hence forcing thousands to flee violence.

25,25,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Transforming The Society Through Education - GNAT - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/transforming-the-society-through-education-gnat/,"GNAT is the biggest public sector union in the country, and her mission and visions are collectively achieved through the efforts putten into doing hard work.

In her speech delivered at the Kumasi Metro’s 5th quadrennial Delegates Conference held at the GNAT Hall on 12th April, 2017, the acting national president of GNAT, Mrs. Philippa Lawson said, teaches are wonderful people whose contributions towards national development cannot be over emphasized.

Saying that, the teacher at all times influences the lives of people positively. ” Our job cuts across all facets of life, for the dedication and meritorious services we render in and outside the classroom, I say AYEKOO to all teachers for your tireless efforts in making the country what it is and what it will be in the future.”

According to Mrs. Lawson, the association does not take unilateral decisions. Decision making starts at the grassroot level which is the basic unit through all the levels. And said since the delegates are representing their various districts, they would be able to come out with the best resolutions that will benefit all teachers.

The theme for the conference, “Transforming Society Through Education : The Role Of The Teacher Towards Agenda 2030”, is appropriate. “The world is changing at a very fast pace and therefore, there is the need for us to change our way of doing things and for that matter, teaching. Bearing in mind that, we are the pivot around which transformation and development revolves.

That is why GNAT is an association prioritizing the professional developments of its members. Even though, it’s the duty of the Ghana Education Service to retrain teachers to sharpen our skills, GNAT in collaboration with Canadian Teachers Federation, organises workshops for it’s members in three regions across the country for free. And this year the GNAT/CTF program will be organized in Accra, Central and Western regions.” Mrs. Lawson noted.

Hinting on the role of the teacher towards agenda 2030, she outlined the following;

* There is the need for them to adapt to change and be ready accept new views, methods and techniques, move away from traditional waysof doing things and use scientific methods.

* The teacher should be a facilitator and not a lecturer.

* Should have in depth knowledge on the learners and how fast they are growing in terms of technology.

* Teacher must be curious in acquiring professional knowledge of education framework and curriculum learners, identify gaps in knowledge and go beyond textbooks.

* Exhibit professional attitudes and values, knowing very well that, they are role models for the children and to name a few.

She continued that, their major pressing concerns as teachers, are the issues of validations of their promotions, Tier two pension, Souvenirs and salaries. But their officer have met her for a lengthy discussion and the details will be made known to the national council in order to address all their concerns.

Present at the gathering was the former regional director of education, Mr. J. K Onyinah, to grace the occasion.

27,27,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Ethiopia can convert its youth bulge from a problem into an opportunity Published by Sosina Bezu - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ethiopia-can-convert-youth-bulge-problem-opportunity/58348/,"Ethiopia’s youth has come under the spotlight recently for their role in a political protest that is seen to be threatening stability. But Ethiopia’s youth bulge doesn’t need to be a political problem. It can be converted to an economic muscle.

Over the past 12 years Ethiopia has been lauded as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world with average gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 10.8%. It has also seen a significant decline in poverty. In 2004 it had a poverty rate of 39% which had fallen to 23% by 2015.

But there’s a cloud hanging over the country. In 2016 it was hit by a drought that affected 10 million people. And a new drought has emerged again this year.

2016 also saw an outbreak of political protest. Although things are relatively calmer now, the state of emergency that was declared in October 2016 has been extended.

But Ethiopia still has a lot going for it, including a large youth population – over 70% of the country’s population is under 30 years of age. This could be turned to a massive advantage if backed by appropriate policies.

Ethiopia’s demographic profile mirrors China’s in the 1980s and of East Asian countries in the 1950s. The spectacular economic growth in East Asia in the second half of the 20th century is partly attributed to the demographic transition that supplied the economies with a young workforce. The key to reaping this demographic dividend is, of course, that there are jobs for those joining the labour force.

While a young population can be a positive economic factor, it can also be a political risk in an economy that doesn’t create enough opportunities.

Until recently Ethiopia had avoided large-scale political upheaval among young people. This was partly due to the government’s tight control of youth groups and surveillance of their activities. But recent unrest with youth at the helm signals huge problems, indicating that their livelihood and unemployment issues can no longer be suppressed or ignored. Addressing the problem head on is the smarter thing to do.

The problem

Every year more than a million young Ethiopian men and women join the labour market. But the economy produces far fewer new jobs and opportunities. This is partly due to the structural make up of the largely agrarian economy.

Over 80% of Ethiopians live in rural areas. While the agricultural sector in Ethiopia has declined significantly as a contributor to the economy in the past decade and now accounts for less than 50% of the national product, it still employs more than 70% of the labour force.

Historically, most people who were born in rural areas tended to settle there. But land scarcity and population growth, coupled with limited non-farm employment opportunities has started pushing young people into the urban areas.

There aren’t enough jobs for them there either. Official statistics show that 30% of 20 to 24 year-olds in urban areas are unemployed. Some studies suggest that the actual rate is as high as 50%.

National level labour surveys and other studies suggest that young people with secondary education or more are the ones missing out the most from the flourishing economy. Many – about 70% – join the labour market with little or no practical or specialised training past the general secondary education.

High aspirations and expectations

High levels of unemployment among educated young people is a troubling phenomenon. The country’s youth have increasingly higher aspirations and expectations due to the possibilities they see, given the country’s economic growth. They also have high expectations of what they believe they deserve as relatively educated people.

But not only are there no jobs, wages are often not high enough to support high living costs.

This gap between aspirations and economic reality is clearly becoming increasingly frustrating.

In focus groups of young people in different parts of southern Ethiopia we captured a deep sense of hopelessness and a fear that they would remain trapped in poverty.

For those living with their parents the main concern was that unemployment was “waiting for them” when they finished school. Many said that they previously thought that hard work at school was the way out of the life of poverty their parents had endured. Many were clearly itching to do something about their lives.

One sign of this pent up frustration is the surge in young people choosing to take the risk of irregular international migration even when they’ve been warned about the risks.

Way forward

Ethiopia’s youth bulge can be an engine for growth as international companies look to set up operations where they can access low-wage labour. On top of that, an increase in the number of young people working would boost demand and investment in the country.

But to transform young people into an engine of growth requires improving access to employment.

The government should create an enabling environment for the private sector by improving the country’s dismal business environment.

At the same time, it should design effective employment programmes. It’s recent effort to increase job opportunities for unemployed young people is a step in the right direction. But policymakers, politicians and those implementing policies should resist the temptation to use access to jobs and employment as a political tool.

30,30,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Growth In Middle Class Drives Private Education Boom On Continent - News Ghana,https://newsghana.com.gh/growth-in-middle-class-drives-private-education-boom-on-continent/,"April 2017

Private universities and schools are mushrooming across Africa, as parents increasingly seek a quality education for their children outside of the state offering – a move which is largely attributable to the rapid growth of the middle class on the continent.

“The private education sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, with private providers in the rest of Africa lining up to partner with credible and experienced counterparts in South Africa, to be able to sustainably grow in response to the huge demand for quality basic and higher education institutions,” says Jaco Lotz, who heads International Business Development at ADvTECH, Africa’s largest private education provider.

Research about the growth of the middle class in Africa, conducted by the African Development Bank, shows that by 2010, the middle class had surged by 60% from a decade before, and the number keeps growing. The report highlighted the fact that increased prosperity led to a rise in investment in education, and that private education was increasingly seen as an attractive option for parents.

“We are really starting to see the effect of this continued rise in the ranks of those joining the middle class,” says Lotz.

In addition to the growth of the middle class, the sharp rise in demand for private education is also fuelled by the fact that the average age of Africa’s population is getting lower – in other words there is also growth in the younger population – as well as the fact that governments and the public sector simply can’t keep up with the demand for space in schools and public universities.

“Throughout Africa, governments are under pressure in terms of resourcing, and are battling to increase capacity in the public sector,” notes Lotz.

“As a result, private schools and universities are popping up all over Africa as business tries to capitalise on the demand, however many of these institutions don’t have full accreditation or, at present, a benchmark quality assurance standard.

“However parents are becoming more informed, demanding that institutions prove their track records and credibility, and that they are able to provide a quality education.”

Owing to ADvTECH’s track record in schools and higher education, and because they are a listed entity, the company is being approached by numerous education institutions throughout the continent who seek to partner with them, Lotz notes.

“Additionally, we are able to prove sustained good corporate governance, and as a result we are constantly being approached by institutions responding to the demand from parents who seek not only a private education for their children, but a quality, accredited private offering,” he says.

Last year, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, acquired a 4% equity stake in ADvTECH, in a partnership aimed at supporting the company’s plans to expand into the rest of Africa.

IFC Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Oumar Seydi, noted at the time that the investment would further enable ADvTECH to fill gaps in the education market on the continent, which will enable Africa’s workforce to meet the challenges of changing job markets in Africa and globally.

“This partnership with the IFC has enabled us to work on numerous projects, from acquisitions and partnerships, to developing new schools and universities. The pipeline is growing, and we are anticipating a domino effect in the future,” Lotz says.

“We already have a significant footprint across Africa, with 6% of revenue coming from our African operations outside the borders of South Africa, which include Gaborone International School in Botswana, the University of Africa in Zambia in which we recently secured the majority stake, and CA Global and Africa HR Solutions, which fall under the Resourcing division.”

Lotz says ADvTECH has expanded its delivery model through the implementation of technology-enabled models in both blended and distance learning, and that the IFC partnership is providing valuable on-the-ground insight to identify additional suitable investment opportunities and partners in other African markets.

Ghana has therefore been certified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) since July 2014, whilst the elimination of Trachoma has been achieved since 2016 with the dossier preparation for verification of elimination ongoing.

Ghana’s Deputy Minister of Health, Mr Kingsley Aboagye-Gyedu who made this known at the on-going global summit on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) when he shared some of the success Ghana has chalked out in the area, said 3.8 million people in Upper West and Northern Regions have been freed from trachoma.

The five-day Summit, marks the fifth anniversary of the London Declaration, a historic document signed by leaders from diverse sectors committed to controlling, eliminating or eradicating 10 tropical NTDs by 2020.

Since the London Declaration, fewer people are suffering from these disabling diseases and many countries are eliminating them entirely.

NTDs are a group of debilitating infectious diseases such as elephantiasis, river blindness and trachoma that affect the world’s poorest communities.

These gains, have made possible by strong global partnerships, country leadership and investments in innovation and technology.

The 2017 summit marks the 5th anniversary of the WHO’s roadmap on NTDs and the London Declaration and to celebrate the milestone: “Uniting to Combat NTDs.”

Representatives of Member States, donor agencies, foundations, the private sector, academia and stakeholders and pharmaceutical companies are participating in the summit.

Mr Aboagye-Gyedu said government would rollout and intensify the deworming exercise of children for at least once a year to protect them from schistosomiasis, which made them vulnerable due to their play habits.

He said morbidity or complications had greatly reduced, high-risk districts changed from 47 down to three, moderate risk districts also changed from 138 to 54 and low risk districts also increased from 31 to 159.

The disease could cause mental debilitation, thus, reducing the child’s ability to learn.

The government he said would be investing in the use of technology to distribute drugs to the regions and communities who would be needing them and “this will be done with just by a press of a button, it will tell what kind of medicine is out of stock at which particular facility”.

The Deputy Minister pledged the commitment of the government in ensuring that the remaining NTDs were tackled with all seriousness to ensure their total elimination.

In an interview with Ghana’s NTDs Programme Manager Dr Nana Kwadwo Birituwm, on the NTD situation in Ghana, he explained that transmission has been broken in 81 out of 98 endemic districts for Lymphatic Filariasis, also known as Elephantiasis

He noted that 12.8 million at-risk population have been freed out of 14.2 million at-risk or endemic population, adding that no new cases of elephantiasis or hydrocoeles have been reported.

Elephantiasis is a worm disease which is usually acquired in childhood and could cause the scrotum and breasts to swell to the size of a watermelon often leading to deformity, social stigma and isolation.

Dr Biritwum said no new cases of onchocerciasis blindness had been recorded for years, no new cases of onchocerciasis skin nodules or onchocerciasis dermatitis or skin changes, whilst transmission was markedly reduced (no hyper (high) or meso (medium) areas of endemicity but all moved to hypo (low endemicity).”

He explained that 85 hyper and meso- endemic districts for onchocerciasis, had moved to make now make 85 hypo endemic districts with an endemic population of about 4million.

“This indicates control to elimination for this disease is ongoing and very soon it would be eliminated from Ghana.”

The pair from the United States and Sweden went missing last month on a mission to the Kasai Central province where rebels had intensified their anti-government insurgency in recent weeks, killing dozens on both sides.

U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said her colleagues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have seen the video, stating they are utterly horrified at what appears to be the killing of Michael Sharp and Zeida Catalan.

As we mourn these deaths, we urge the government of the DRC to ensure that these killings and the hundreds of others such horrible killings that have taken place in the Kasai region are credibly.

“As we mourn these deaths, we urge the government of the DRC to ensure that these killings and the hundreds of others such horrible killings that have taken place in the Kasai region are credibly, thoroughly and promptly investigated and that the perpetrators are brought to justice in line with international human rights law,” she said.

The video screened to the media in Kinshasa on Monday appeared to show the two experts walking with a group of men wearing red headbands characteristic of the Kamuina Nsapu local militia.

“Outside Kananga city in the Kasai Central province and therefore not far from Moyo bridge in the Dibaya territory, the bodies were indeed found in a grave and were identified, formally, by the MONUSCO experts, specifically members of the United Nations police and that is why it took time all day yesterday.But as soon as they were formally identified, the United Nations Secretary-general was informed and the families, following protocol,” said Information Director,Charles Bambara.

Under the ESICOME the EHOs are to first identify a nuisance, educate households on the services being rendered by their respective assemblies in the abatement of nuisance and to ensure compliance of acceptable behaviour.

“After a household or the landlord failed to abate the nuisance he or she would be served with summons as part of the enforcement to comply with the assemblies’ bye-laws.”

Mr Kweku Quansah, the Chief Environmental Health Technologist at the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development made this known to the Ghana News Agency at a two-day technical workshop for health officers, technologists and analysts of the 11 Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in the Greater Accra Region at Tutu in the Akuapem South District of the Eastern Region.

It was on the Review of Environmental Health Prosecution Manual and MMDAs Model Bye-laws and was sponsored by the World Bank as part of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area-Sanitation and Water Project (GAMA-SWP).

Mr Quansah told the participants that the workshop was to strengthen the capacity of the EHOs to review their outmoded bye-laws and prosecution manuals to bring their penalties to conform with modern day realities in their jurisdictions.

“This is to curb the environmental and insanitary problems that have engulfed the MMDAs in the country.”

He urged the officers to look out for a more appropriate way of data management and resist political interference in their work through phone calls by politicians.

“We need MMDAs laws to compliment the national laws to ensure that the public infrastructure and services are well catered for to strengthen regulations and enforcement standards to change behaviours,” he said.

Mr Samuel Akwei Allotey of the Environmental Health Directorate of the Ministry of Local Government said the environmental sanitation challenges were serious and called for pragmatic steps to deal with them.

Major challenges which were identified by participants were; political interference , lack of logistics and inadequate capacity-building and outmoded bye-laws.

35,35,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/new-solar-powered-device-can-pull-water-straight-desert-air,"This new solar-powered device can pull water straight from the desert air

You can’t squeeze blood from a stone, but wringing water from the desert sky is now possible, thanks to a new spongelike device that uses sunlight to suck water vapor from air, even in low humidity. The device can produce nearly 3 liters of water per day for every kilogram of spongelike absorber it contains, and researchers say future versions will be even better. That means homes in the driest parts of the world could soon have a solar-powered appliance capable of delivering all the water they need, offering relief to billions of people.

There are an estimated 13 trillion liters of water floating in the atmosphere at any one time, equivalent to 10% of all of the freshwater in our planet’s lakes and rivers. Over the years, researchers have developed ways to grab a few trickles, such as using fine nets to wick water from fog banks, or power-hungry dehumidifiers to condense it out of the air. But both approaches require either very humid air or far too much electricity to be broadly useful.

To find an all-purpose solution, researchers led by Omar Yaghi, a chemist at the University of California, Berkeley, turned to a family of crystalline powders called metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. Yaghi developed the first MOFs—porous crystals that form continuous 3D networks—more than 20 years ago. The networks assemble in a Tinkertoy-like fashion from metal atoms that act as the hubs and sticklike organic compounds that link the hubs together. By choosing different metals and organics, chemists can dial in the properties of each MOF, controlling what gases bind to them, and how strongly they hold on.

Over the past 2 decades chemists have synthesized more than 20,000 MOFs, each with unique molecule-grabbing properties. For example, Yaghi and others recently designed MOFs that absorb—and later release—methane, making them a type of high-capacity gas tank for natural gas–powered vehicles.

In 2014, Yaghi and his colleagues synthesized a MOF that excelled at absorbing water, even under low-humidity conditions. That led him to reach out to Evelyn Wang, a mechanical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, with whom he had previously worked on a project to use MOFs in automobile air conditioning. After synthesizing the new zirconium-based MOF, dubbed MOF-801, Yaghi met Wang at MIT and said, “Evelyn we have to come up with a water-harvesting device.” She agreed to give it a shot.

Device pulls water from the air At night setup soaks up water vapor from air, and uses heat from the sun to release it as liquid water during the day.

The system Wang and her students designed consists of a kilogram of dust-sized MOF crystals pressed into a thin sheet of porous copper metal. That sheet is placed between a solar absorber and a condenser plate and positioned inside a chamber. At night the chamber is opened, allowing ambient air to diffuse through the porous MOF and water molecules to stick to its interior surfaces, gathering in groups of eight to form tiny cubic droplets. In the morning, the chamber is closed, and sunlight entering through a window on top of the device then heats up the MOF, which liberates the water droplets and drives them—as vapor—toward the cooler condenser. The temperature difference, as well as the high humidity inside the chamber, causes the vapor to condense as liquid water, which drips into a collector. The setup works so well that it pulls 2.8 liters of water out of the air per day for every kilogram of MOF it contained, the Berkeley and MIT team reports today in Science .

“It has been a longstanding dream” to harvest water from desert air, says Mercouri Kanatzidis, a chemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn’t involved with the work. “This demonstration … is a significant proof of concept.” It’s also one that Yaghi says has plenty of room for improvement. For starters, zirconium costs $150 a kilogram, making water-harvesting devices too expensive to be broadly useful. However, Yaghi says his group has already had early success in designing water-grabbing MOFs that replace zirconium with aluminum, a metal that is 100 times cheaper. That could make future water harvesters cheap enough not only to slake the thirst of people in arid regions, but perhaps even supply water to farmers in the desert.

37,37,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The fall in commodity prices is curbing military expenditure across Africa - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/968950/the-fall-in-commodity-process-is-curbing-military-expenditure-across-africa/,"Subdued prices for oil and other key commodities in recent years has started to filter through to Africa’s military budgets. Defense spending fell to $37.9 billion in 2016 from $50.2 billion in 2014. This marks the second consecutive year of decline in spending, after 11 straight years of increases, a new report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute found.

The Institute also recorded a drop in military spending in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America, while defense budget allotments increased in Asia, Europe, and North America.

Until recently, Africa has been home to some of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Political stability and demand for commodities attracted investors and supported the emergence of tech-savvy entrepreneurs. But the crash in recent years in prices for commodities like oil, gold, diamond, and timber has slowed this momentous growth. Many economies are also facing mounting pressure from the effects of violent extremism and an unprecedented drought and famine affecting millions.

In sub-Saharan Africa, cuts in military spending were most dramatic in Angola. The top oil producer has the second largest military in Africa after Algeria, and spent $6.1 billion on it in 2013. That figure dropped to $3.2 billion in 2016, largely due to falling oil prices. South Sudan, once East Africa’s biggest spender on defense, cut its budget by more than half to $525 million last year.

Algeria increased its budget just 2.3% last year compared to the previous year, spending $10.6 billion, its lowest level (pdf) since 2007.

On the whole, Africa has become more peaceful in recent years, and its military spending is often a signal of something other than an attempt to shore up national security from outside forces. In many cases, it’s the result of an attempt to stifle internal dissent. In others, it’s a response to internal strife caused by extremism, such as with Mali and Kenya, who have increased spending over the last few years to help with their fight against armed Islamist extremists.

It can also be read as an attempt to project power. Botswana, which has no threat of extremism and has never experienced a civil war, spent $536 million upgrading its defense infrastructure last year, compared to $384 million the year before.

SIPRI cautioned that a comprehensive and completely accurate overview of military spending on the continent might not be possible. Defense spending in Libya was not made public, for example, and the data didn’t reflect the billion of dollars in bilateral military aid provided to countries like Egypt and Ethiopia by its allies. Military budgets also continue to be plagued by corruption allegations, raising questions about the reliability of published spending figures. For instance, Nigeria’s president Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of the country’s former national security advisor in 2015 for allegedly pocketing up to $2 billion from fraudulent arm dealings.","Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rtr3rpca-e1493199997992.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['africa', 'oil', 'prices', 'budgets', 'africas', 'global', 'slump', 'increased', 'military', 'squeezed', 'defense', 'recent', 'commodities', 'million', 'billion', 'spending']",

But the Leuser ecosystem on the island of Sumatra – home to some of the world’s most ancient forests – is gradually being destroyed by giant corporations, a leading conservationist has warned.

A campaign called Love the Leuser has now been launched in an effort to ""save a global treasure"".

In an article for US News & World Report, Dr Ian Singleton painted a picture of the Indonesian area’s extraordinary natural beauty and its importance on a global scale.

“If the Amazon rainforests are the lungs of the Earth, the Leuser is its heart – beating with vitality for us all,” he wrote.

But he also described how “industrial” palm oil plantations, mining, logging, energy projects and new roads and infrastructure were “eating away at every corner of the ecosystem”.

“From its pristine tropical beaches to its rugged high mountaintops, the Leuser ecosystem pulses with life,” Dr Singleton wrote.

“It is the last place on Earth where Southeast Asia's most iconic species – orangutans, tigers, rhinos and elephants – still live side by side in the wild.

Recommended Indonesia could ban new palm oil plantations to stop forest fires

“To step into Leuser's steamy rainforests is to experience a serenade of biodiversity, a cacophony of buzzing insects, singing birds, croaking frogs, and loud-calling primates.”

Leuser, he said, was home to some 382 bird species, at least 105 different mammals and 95 reptiles and amphibians. It helped provide clean water for millions of people and acted as a massive store of carbon.

“But Leuser's forests face a growing threat,” the article continued.

“Despite being protected by Indonesian law, the ecosystem is under siege for short-term profits.

“Corporate interests such as industrial pulp and palm oil plantations, mining and logging operations, energy projects, and all the roads and infrastructure that get built to support them, are eating away at every corner of the ecosystem.

“As the last remaining intact lowland forests and peat lands are being cleared, drained burned and carved up into smaller fragments, all of the region's threatened and endangered species, many of them endemic and found nowhere else in the world, are being pushed closer to the brink of extinction.”

He said the Sumatran orangutan could “easily become the first great ape species to go extinct in the wild if Leuser’s lowland forests and peat lands continue to be destroyed”.

And there were now believed to be just “a few hundred Sumatran tigers” and “even fewer Sumatran rhinos” in the wild.

“For sure, if we lose Leuser we will lose these species and countless others as well, forever,” Dr Singleton argued.

He called for people all over the world to help save the area.

“The ‘Love the Leuser ecosystem’ movement is a global effort to raise the profile of this amazing, unique, and totally irreplaceable place in the imagination of everyone, everywhere – to make it a global household name,” Dr Singleton wrote.

42,42,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,El Nino linked to cholera outbreaks in Africa - study - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/el-nino-linked-to-cholera-outbreaks-in-africa-study/,"Heavy rainfall linked to the El Nino weather pattern can push up cholera cases in Africa, according to a study published on Monday that could help health workers prepare for outbreaks.

El Nino is a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that occurs every few years, with global consequences. In Africa it often brings excessive rains to the east while the southern cone gets parched.

By mapping and comparing cholera outbreaks in Africa with previous occurences of El Nino, researchers at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) saw a clear link between rainfall caused by the weather pattern and the number of cholera cases.

“ Knowing there is elevated cholera risk in a particular region can help reduce the number of deaths that result. Justin Lessler, lead researcher and epidemiologist, Johns Hopkins University

For example when El Nino occurred between 2000 and 2014, which increased rainfall in east Africa, cholera cases tripled in the region, according to findings published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Researchers said the findings could help health workers anticipate and prepare for potential cholera outbreaks, since scientists are able to track when El Nino will occur six months to a year in advance.

“Knowing there is elevated cholera risk in a particular region can help reduce the number of deaths that result,” said Justin Lessler, lead researcher and epidemiologist at JHU.

An intestinal infection often linked to contaminated drinking water, cholera causes diarrhoea and vomiting, leaving small children especially vulnerable to death from dehydration.

Africa has the most cholera cases in the world with more than 900 recorded deaths in 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

The researchers said higher rainfall overruns sewerage systems in areas with poor infrastructure, which contaminates the drinking water and could lead to cholera.

But in drought-hit regions, some people contract cholera after drinking contaminated water since there are no other water sources, the researchers said.

“Linking these outbreaks to El Nino events and increased rainfall improves our understanding of the environmental conditions that promote cholera transmission in the region and will help predict future outbreaks,” said study author and epidemiologist Sean Moore.

Each year, there are between one to four million cholera cases recorded globally and at least 21,000 die from the preventable disease, the WHO says.

The new software developed at Oregon State University (OSU) may be applicable to a range of other social science research questions, the researchers said, and already shows that many people may not adequately appreciate the power of social media to greatly transcend the type of interpersonal, face-to-face communication humans are most accustomed to.

“As a society it’s like we’re learning a new skill of text communication, and we don’t fully understand or reflect on its power to affect so many people in ways that we may not have intended,” said Nels Oscar, an OSU graduate student in the College of Engineering. “Social media is instant, in some cases can reach millions of people at once, and can even instigate behaviors. We often don’t even know who might eventually read it and how it will affect them.”

When it comes to Alzheimer’s disease, thoughtless or demeaning comments on a broad level via social media can take an already-serious problem and make it worse.

The topic studied by Oscar and his colleagues, who published a paper in the Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, is of growing importance.

A global tripling of individuals with some form of dementia has been projected in coming decades, from 43 million now to 131 million by 2050.

In the research, the software was designed to recognize and interpret the use of various keywords associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as dementia, memory loss or senile.

The system was improved by comparing results to the same comment evaluated by human researchers, and ultimately achieved an accuracy of about 90 percent in determining whether a comment was meant to be informative, a joke, a metaphor, ridicule, or fit other dimensions.

Used to analyze 33,000 tweets that made some reference to Alzheimer’s disease, the system indicated that people concerned about these issues might be more conscious of their own comments on social media, and also more willing to engage with others who are using language that is insensitive or potentially hurtful.

However, “it was shocking to me how many people stigmatized Alzheimer’s disease and reinforced stereotypes that can further alienate people with this condition,” said Karen Hooker, holder of the Jo Anne Leonard Petersen Endowed Chair in Gerontology and Family Studies, in the OSU College of Public Health and Human Sciences. “This can create what we call ‘excess disability,’ when people with a stigmatized condition perform worse just because of the negative expectations that damaging stereotypes bring.”

“This type of stigma can make it less likely that people will admit they have problems or seek treatment, when often they can still live satisfying, meaningful and productive lives,” Hooker was quoted as saying in a news release. “Our attitudes, the things we say affect others. And social media is now amplifying our ability to reach others with thoughtless or hurtful comments.”

The researchers noted a 2012 report that negative attitudes about Alzheimer’s disease and dementia can result in shame, guilt, hopelessness and social exclusion among stigmatized individuals, leading to delay in diagnosis, inability to cope, and decreased quality of life.

A comment a person might never make in a face-to-face conversation, said Oscar, lead author on the study, is often transmitted via social media to dozens, hundreds or ultimately thousands of people that were not really intended.

Some constraints that might reduce the impact, like clearly making a joke or using sarcasm in a personal conversation, can often get lost in translation to the printed word. Enditem

It has been very interesting to explore their feelings about the differences between how they define themselves and what their DNA makeup shows when the test results come in.

Biologically, our ancestral differences reflect only a 0.1 percent difference in DNA. Yet we often cling to those differences — both in unity with our fellow people of origin and, at times, in divisiveness.

Stemming the tide

The federal Refugee Act of 1980 grants the president authority to admit refugees who face persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a certain social group.

The recent executive orders from President Donald Trump, aimed at temporarily halting immigration from several Muslim-majority nations, have focused attention on the tide of refugees to the U.S. The orders, challenged in the courts, are on hold.

The nations targeted in the orders — Iran, Iraq (which Trump removed from his second order), Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — account for some of the highest numbers of refugee and immigrant entries to the U.S. between 2007 and 2017.

PennLive looked at how many refugees, from those nations and others, came to Pennsylvania between 2000 and 2015. The numbers are based on those provided by the U.S. State Department and an analysis by The Associated Press of data from the State Department's Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration.

Refugee law

The 1980 act giving the president power to admit refugees also created the Federal Refugee Resettlement Program, a federally funded program that helps refugees become self-sufficient.

Once a refugee is vetted and cleared to enter the United States, the U.S. Department of State works with the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Pennsylvania Refugee Resettlement Program and local nonprofits designated as Voluntary Resettlement Organizations.

Between 2000 to 2015, Pennsylvania witnessed a migration of refugees from all over the world. Here are a look at the countries from which those refugees have come, and the conditions in their homelands that brought them here.

An estimated 100,000 people are experiencing famine, and another 1 million people are on the brink of starvation in South Sudan, according to the United Nations. South Sudan is now Africa's largest migrant crisis as more than 3 million people have either fled the country or become internally displaced.

Refugees to Pennsylvania - a total of 705 - have opted to live in Erie and Philadelphia for the most part. This many have opted for homes in:

Allentown: 15

Dangerous journey

Refugees from sub-Saharan nations - such as Somalia and Sudan - continue to face dangerous journeys as they flee famine and war. Erie, in particular, has seen an influx of refugees from Somalia, particularly in 2015 and 2016, with close to 400 refugees resettling there. Lancaster last year saw 103 Somalians choose to settle there. Camp Hill and Mechanicsburg counted a handful of refugees from Somalia.

U.S. immigration authorities put the number of Iraqi refugees in the U.S. at 58,000 since 2007. When Trump signed his executive order, 25,000 Iraqis who had been approved to enter the U.S., were affected.

A total of 38,901 Muslim refugees entered the U.S. in 2016, making up almost half (46 percent) of the nearly 85,000 refugees who entered the country in that period, according to the Pew Research Center. That means the U.S. has admitted the highest number of Muslim refugees of any year since self-reported religious data became publicly available in 2002. Almost the same number of Christian (37,521) as Muslim refugees were admitted in 2016.

Water scarcity will become a pressing societal and geopolitical issue in the near future, owing to the popular perception that access to water is a human right. The economic reality—rather controversially—stands in stark contrast to that utopian ideal.

At a recent Brookings Institution conference titled Tackling the “Water Problem”: Challenges facing U.S. regulation, sustainability, and global geopolitics, a panel of experts addressed the topic of water security in the context of geopolitics. Their predictions for the future painted a devastating picture of widespread water scarcity, with the brunt of the impact falling on women, the poor and other marginalized groups of people.

Betsy Otto, the global director of the World Resources Institute’s Water Program, opened the panel using statistics to lay out the global scope of the problem. “By 2025, 1.8 billion people are going to be living in areas where they have absolute water scarcity,” Otto said. “As much as 40 percent of the world’s population … by 2035 could be living in seriously water-stressed areas.” The crisis, she added, would only be exacerbated by climate change and the onslaught of longer and more extreme storms and droughts. “We are in the throes of a quiet but growing crisis in much of the world that we are really sort of just ignoring,” Otto said.

However, while Otto addressed projections dating forward to 2025 and 2035, Kumud Acharya, an engineer who leads the Ecological Engineering group at the Desert Research Institute, emphasized that many low- to middle-income countries already struggle with water scarcity and have been forced to reckon with the problem for many years.

“I was born and raised in Nepal, and I’ve seen 60, 70 percent of people in the country I was born, they still don’t have clean drinking water supply,” Acharya said. “In remote areas of Nepal, people actually have to walk miles to get a bucketful of water, still. And it’s really done by women.”

The Economic Value of Water

However, the panel’s discussion of water scarcity was derailed by a more ethical and philosophical question: If water is a human right, is there such a thing as “illegal water,” or “water theft?”

The question was raised by Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at Brookings’ Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence and the author of a new Brookings report titled Water Theft and Water Smuggling: Growing Problem or Tempest in a Teapot? In her report, Felbab-Brown defined “two broad schools of thought,” standing in opposition to each other on this topic: The first, she wrote, “defines water as a basic human right, and often opposes the pricing of water, particularly increases in prices.” The second “sees water as a commodity to which value needs to be assigned … to maintain its sustainability and efficient use.”

“We need to be more realistic about the fact that water does need money. If you pay for it, it will cost less.”

Based on the findings of her report, Felbab-Brown asserted that water theft is indeed possible. She argued that despite the reality of inequities in water distribution, illegal water sourcing ultimately hurts everyone: Theft increases scarcity across the system, subjects the marginalized to legal repercussion and increases in policing, and strains existing water utilities by withholding funds for regular maintenance and upkeep.

Chris Gasson, publisher of Global Water Intelligence, agreed with Felbab-Brown’s conclusions, and offered his analysis of the overarching economic problems with water theft.

“The total amount of what you might call the unnecessary cost of water—that is, the time wasted, the health costs, the coping costs—that more or less adds up to the same amount of money that you would have to spend if you were going to give everyone 24/7 potable water plus a sewer connection with waste water treatment,” Gasson said. “We do need to get a hell of a lot more realistic about the fact that water does need money. If you pay for it, it will cost less.”

Glass Half Empty

Felbab-Brown cautioned that it was increasingly easy to envision a future in which water scarcity might be used as a cudgel in political conflicts. She cited India and Pakistan as key examples: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already threatened to deny Pakistan water in response to tensions over terrorism between the two states.

“We have really not seen instances yet on cross-border water smuggling,” Felbab-Brown said. “But I think one of the aspects of the future will in fact be the emergence of cross-border water smuggling and that will not only present a difficult human rights, legal policing challenge, but also perhaps extra dimensions of conflict.”

Even barring the question of political and violent conflict, the panelists agreed that urbanization was a huge burden on water supplies. “Cities are growing and being developed without sustainable water planning,” Acharya said. “Obviously, we need to deal with climate change, but [urbanization] is a more pressing issue for me right now.”

Gasson proposed an economic solution. “Dubai was building [desalination] plants every two years, or every one year until 2008,” he said. “And then in 2009, they decided that they were going to—for the first time ever—charge Dubai citizens for water, and they actually charged a fairly decent amount. And immediately, overnight, water demand in Dubai fell by 15 percent.”

“It can all be done,” Gasson said, with a chuckle. But given the weight of the question, it’s not clear that the audience nor his fellow panelists felt similarly humored by his assessment.","Mon, 17 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/water_half_full-664658364-900x600.jpg,"['water', 'glass', 'exceedingly', 'right', 'need', 'global', 'question', 'access', 'human', 'future', 'problem', 'half', 'otto', 'grim', 'scarcity']", 
48,48,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,A New Data Set to Keep a Sharper Eye on Land-Air Exchanges - Eos,https://eos.org/science-updates/a-new-data-set-to-keep-a-sharper-eye-on-land-air-exchanges,"The turn of the millennium marked a decade of systematic measurements of exchanges of carbon, water, and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere, made by a few pioneering scientists at their own study sites. New knowledge was—and still is—generated from these data at individual sites. It quickly became clear, however, that pooling together data from multiple sites would create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts: a powerful tool not only for comparing and combining sites but also for studying land-air exchanges at regional and even global scales.

Scientists formed regional networks to foster sharing of data and methodologies, and FLUXNET was created, establishing a global “network of networks.” But a challenge remained: Data sets were still too diverse, incompatible, and hard to compare. In June 2000, at the Marconi Convention Center on the northern California coast, a group of scientists resolved to change that. The first FLUXNET data set was born.

FLUXNET2015 is the third data set in the series, following the original Marconi data set from 2000 and the widely used 2007 version produced after a workshop in La Thuile, Italy. Released in December 2015, with two augmentations in 2016, the FLUXNET2015 data set includes more than 1500 site-years of data at 30-minute intervals from 212 sites, ranging from the Norwegian tundra in Svalbard to the South African savanna in Kruger National Park, from the birch forests of Hokkaido, Japan, to the scrub oak near the launch pads of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Each site has records of fluxes of carbon, water, and energy and other ecosystem and biometeorological variables.

The fidelity of these flux measurements and their singular spatial and temporal coverage uniquely position them not only to help answer a broad range of questions about ecosystems, climate, and land use but also to bridge gaps between field observations and larger-scale tools like climate models and remote sensing. If past usage of FLUXNET data sets is any guide, we expect that scientists will use these data to validate satellite measurements, inform Earth system models, provide insight into a host of questions in ecology and hydrology, and fuel novel applications, many harnessing big data tools, on scales ranging from microbes to continents.

Updating FLUXNET Data Sets

FLUXNET sites span all continents and all major climate zones (Figures 1 and 2; Figures 3 and 4 and the photograph above illustrate three sites). Some regions of the globe and ecosystem types are still underrepresented, but this newest release has improved coverage (see Figures 2a and 2b). Increased data contributions from regional networks in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania helped expand the geographic and temporal coverage of the data set.

The longest continuous flux data records now exceed 25 years. AmeriFlux and the European networks reached 20 years of age in 2016, and other networks host records nearly as long. This combination of longer time series and new sites from undersampled regions make the FLUXNET2015 data set the state of the art for understanding long-term interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere and for addressing questions about year-to-year variability and trends in fluxes.

Such long flux records are also essential for gaining insight on extreme events and the ways that disturbed ecosystems respond over time. They can also help address emerging science questions, such as identifying the causes and effects of the greening of the Arctic, detected by nearly 30 years of remote sensing, or finding what drives the increasing amplitude of seasonal variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), observed in nearly 60 years of records from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii.

This update was also motivated by the opportunity for higher-quality data. The FLUXNET data team and site teams collaborated on extensive data quality control that allowed us to avoid or correct many of the data issues that are common in observed data such as missing sensor calibrations or inconsistent processing of a measured variable. Advances in the science and the availability of complementary data sets also allowed for the creation of new data products, such as uncertainty estimates and better methods for filling long gaps in micrometeorological data.

Earlier FLUXNET data sets were used in hundreds of peer-reviewed papers, for studies ranging from soil microbiology to effects of climate change at a global scale. As a simple metric, a Web of Science keyword search for FLUXNET now yields more than 400 papers. Stimulating new science with useful data products is a main motivation behind the work to create FLUXNET data sets.

What’s Inside

Data collection at FLUXNET sites engenders only minimal disturbance to the ecosystem and produces flux estimates on temporal scales from hours to years, and now decades. Data collection at FLUXNET sites engenders only minimal disturbance to the ecosystem and produces flux estimates representative of spatial scales of hundreds of meters and multiple temporal scales, from hours to years, and now decades. To make the data simple to use by scientists from many disciplines, data included in FLUXNET2015 were consistently quality controlled and gap filled. Also, ecosystem exchange of CO 2 was partitioned into ecosystem respiration (as CO 2 released into the atmosphere) and gross primary production (as CO 2 uptake by the ecosystem).

The FLUXNET2015 data set includes a number of new features. One is the revised and extended data quality checks, which not only increase data quality for individual sites but also help harmonize quality levels among all sites. This uniformity in the data is important for synthesis analyses, which require sites to be comparable.

Also included for the first time are estimates of uncertainties for key steps in the processing. Some of the steps, such as filtering for low wind conditions and partitioning of CO 2 fluxes, were implemented with multiple methods, resulting in more thorough estimates of uncertainties. These uncertainty estimates have been a long-standing request from ecosystem and Earth system modelers and make this data set especially useful for applications like model validation and constraining.

FLUXNET2015 also includes estimated energy corrections that were applied to achieve energy balance closure (between storage and incoming and outgoing energy), which makes the data more useful to climate and ecosystem models that require closed energy budgets when using flux data.

To fill long gaps in meteorological data, FLUXNET2015 used downscaled data based on the ERA-Interim global reanalysis data set, which provides a gridded and uninterrupted record derived using a data-informed model. This approach improved the accuracy of gap-filled micrometeorology data points and of temporally aggregated products such as those at daily or yearly resolutions.

Some of these data products and processing steps, especially the data quality checks, prevented some sites from being included in the data set. As a result, not all sites that contributed data or were part of the LaThuile data set were included in FLUXNET2015. The FLUXNET data team continues to work with these site teams to include data from their sites in future FLUXNET data sets.

Embracing the Benefits—and Challenges—of Open Data

Open data sharing has gained momentum and is becoming a cornerstone for scientific research. In principle, open data sharing doesn’t just benefit users—it also benefits the teams collecting the data by enhancing community integration, collaboration opportunities, data collection protocols, recognition for the data collection and curation work, and fulfilling funding agency requirements on data availability.

Data policies have evolved at least as much as the FLUXNET data sets themselves. In practice, however, sharing data remains complicated. The extra work and the logistics of supporting open sharing are beyond the reach of many scientists. FLUXNET data sets are based on field data collected by many independent teams from many countries. The multisource nature of the data set brings the added challenge of ensuring that the various data collectors receive proper credit when their data are used. Proper attribution is also necessary for site teams to get a better measure of the impact of their work and opportunities to participate in the science using their data. Data policies aimed at addressing these requirements have been put in place to enable data sharing via the services provided by regional networks and FLUXNET.

Data policies have evolved at least as much as the FLUXNET data sets themselves. For the Marconi data set, the policy stated that site teams had to be informed of the data usage and could request work on conflicting topics be postponed. For the LaThuile data set, each site team classified their data into one of three data policy tiers. The most lenient required only acknowledgement of the data source. A middle tier required users to submit proposals, which needed approval by a committee with representatives from each regional network and FLUXNET. In the strictest tier, data access was restricted to the teams who contributed data.

The FLUXNET2015 data policy has matured to allow access to all interested users, with two tiers differing only in the terms for using the data, for example, for publications or class assignments. One tier requires acknowledgments, and the other requires that data providers be given the opportunity to add intellectual contributions and potentially become coauthors. This policy approach allows much broader access to the data and more opportunities to experiment with it.

Over the past decade, many FLUXNET site teams moved from being cautious about data sharing to being advocates for increased openness. FLUXNET’s track record of more than 20 years of sharing data helps pave the way toward reproducible science and should encourage other communities to tackle the challenges of sharing data sets with many sources and users.

Where We Go from Here

49,49,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"Types and rates of forest disturbance in Brazilian Legal Amazon, 2000–2013 - Science Advances",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1601047,"Deforestation rates in primary humid tropical forests of the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Brazil’s national forest monitoring system provides extensive information for the BLA but lacks independent validation and systematic coverage outside of primary forests. We use a sample-based approach to consistently quantify 2000–2013 tree cover loss in all forest types of the region and characterize the types of forest disturbance. Our results provide unbiased forest loss area estimates, which confirm the reduction of primary forest clearing (deforestation) documented by official maps. By the end of the study period, nonprimary forest clearing, together with primary forest degradation within the BLA, became comparable in area to deforestation, accounting for an estimated 53% of gross tree cover loss area and 26 to 35% of gross aboveground carbon loss. The main type of tree cover loss in all forest types was agroindustrial clearing for pasture (63% of total loss area), followed by small-scale forest clearing (12%) and agroindustrial clearing for cropland (9%), with natural woodlands being directly converted into croplands more often than primary forests. Fire accounted for 9% of the 2000–2013 primary forest disturbance area, with peak disturbances corresponding to droughts in 2005, 2007, and 2010. The rate of selective logging exploitation remained constant throughout the study period, contributing to forest fire vulnerability and degradation pressures. As the forest land use transition advances within the BLA, comprehensive tracking of forest transitions beyond primary forest loss is required to achieve accurate carbon accounting and other monitoring objectives.

Keywords

All wall-to-wall deforestation or postdisturbance land-use maps derived using remotely sensed data contain errors, which results in the biased area estimates derived via map pixel counting ( 15 – 17 ). This study follows good practice recommendations ( 15 – 17 ) to use a probability sample for unbiased area estimation from remotely sensed data. Our study includes the following objectives: (i) produce unbiased estimates of annual forest disturbance rates between 2000 and 2013 for the states of the BLA using a sample-based approach; (ii) characterize the types of forest disturbance and predisturbance forest types; (iii) assess carbon implications of the observed forest loss dynamics; and (iv) compare sample-based estimates with the existing deforestation, forest degradation, and postdeforestation land-use maps.

Most regional- and continental-scale studies on the types of deforestation are based on tabular data sources and modeling ( 4 , 11 , 12 ). Remote sensing data, specifically time series of medium– and high–spatial resolution optical imagery, can be used to attribute types of stand-replacement forest clearing (deforestation), for example, clearing for pasture, cropland, mining, infrastructure, and urban expansion. This has been realized in the form of postdeforestation land-use mapping by the Brazilian systems TerraClass ( www.inpe.br/cra/projetos_pesquisas/dados_terraclass.php ) and TerraClass Cerrado ( www.dpi.inpe.br/tccerrado/ ) and the nongovernmental land-cover and land-use mapping initiative MapBiomas ( http://mapbiomas.org ). The use of remotely sensed data in assessing the degree and type of partial canopy loss (forest degradation) has been demonstrated in monitoring wildfires and selective logging ( 13 , 14 ). Given these demonstrated capabilities, a more comprehensive accounting of forest disturbance dynamics is possible for the Brazilian Amazon.

The PRODES ( 1 ) data set and a global forest loss map from the University of Maryland (UMD) ( 10 ) agree on the general decreasing deforestation trend in Brazil for the past decade but disagree in terms of the absolute forest cover loss rates, presumably due to differences in methodology. Although PRODES quantifies large-scale deforestation of disturbed and undisturbed primary forest, other forest change dynamics (including secondary forest clearing, logging, and fire) are omitted. Conversely, the UMD map quantifies any tree cover loss, including forest plantation rotations, fire, logging, and natural disturbances. PRODES ignores all changes outside of the old-growth forests of the dense humid tropical forest biome, whereas the UMD product maps all tree cover dynamics, including secondary forest and dry tropical woodland clearing. Additionally, minimum mapping units of 6.25 and 0.09 ha for PRODES and UMD, respectively, result in product differences.

Rates of deforestation in Brazil significantly slowed after 2004 according to the Brazilian national satellite–based deforestation monitoring system PRODES ( www.obt.inpe.br/prodes ) ( 1 ). The major underlying cause of deforestation has been beef and soybean production in response to growing global and national demands ( 2 , 3 ). Deforestation in the region in the early 2000s was reported to be predominantly due to pasture expansion ( 4 ), with increasing forest-to-cropland conversion in Mato Grosso ( 5 ). Success in slowing deforestation is attributed to a number of factors, including declining commodity prices, the role of government policies and implementation, civil society activism, and private industry engagement ( 6 – 8 ). Despite the recent deforestation reduction, Brazil remains the single largest contributor to natural forest loss among tropical countries ( 9 ). Extant demands for commodities sourced through tropical deforestation will test the ability of Brazil to achieve further reductions in forest loss.

MapBiomas ( http://mapbiomas.org ) maps major types of land cover and land use (forest, cropland, pasture, planted forests, coastal forests, water, and others) annually between 2008 and 2015 for the Amazon, Cerrado, and Pantanal biomes, which enables comparison with our sampled pixels, identified as 2001–2013 human clearing of all forest types (see Materials and Methods and Table 6 ). Of the sample pixels falling within MapBiomas pasture, 86% were labeled as pasture in our sample interpretation; of MapBiomas cropland, 64% of sample pixels were labeled as cropland. Thirty percent of the area identified as human clearing of all forest types in the current study falls within the MapBiomas “Other” category, which represents nonforested types of land cover and therefore does not disagree with our interpretation in terms of forest cover absence. A major disagreement between our sample-based result and MapBiomas is the 26% of the human forest clearing area that MapBiomas labels as “Forest.” This disagreement is probably due to the different forest definitions used and possible commission errors in the MapBiomas annual forest layers (MapBiomas has yet to undergo a formal accuracy assessment).

TerraClass Cerrado ( www.dpi.inpe.br/tccerrado/ ) maps 2013 land uses for the Cerrado region of Brazil. We compared sample pixels identified as 2001–2012 human clearing of natural woodlands in our analysis with the 2013 TerraClass Cerrado map (see Materials and Methods and Table 5 ). Of the sample pixels falling within TerraClass Cerrado pasture, 79% were labeled as pasture in our sample interpretation; of TerraClass cropland, 95% of sample pixels were labeled as cropland. At the same time, TerraClass Cerrado omits 21% of the area identified as human clearing of natural woodlands in the current study, marking them as natural vegetation ( Table 5 ). TerraClass and TerraClass Cerrado confirm our finding that natural woodlands are converted to croplands more often than primary forests are converted to croplands ( Tables 4 and 5 ): The pasture/cropland conversion ratio is 2:1 in TerraClass Cerrado (natural woodlands of Cerrado region) and 11:1 in TerraClass (primary forests of BLA).

Cell entries of the confusion matrix denote the number of sample pixels in each category (a mixed loss pixel was recorded as 0.5). The 113.5 sample pixels with TerraClass showing later loss date than the current analysis (for example, 2004 instead of 2001–2003) were excluded from the analysis and are not displayed in the table.

We have compared our sample-based estimates of forest disturbance types to the existing land-cover and land-use maps for the BLA, namely, TerraClass, TerraClass Cerrado, and MapBiomas. The TerraClass system ( www.inpe.br/cra/projetos_pesquisas/dados_terraclass.php ) maps land uses following deforestation detected by PRODES by 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014 ( 26 ). We compared sampled pixels identified as human clearing of primary forests in our analysis with the temporally closest TerraClass map (see Materials and Methods and Table 4 ). Similar to our results, TerraClass identified pasture as the most widespread postdeforestation land use: 87% of area identified as TerraClass pasture corresponds to the agroindustrial clearing for pasture disturbance type in our sample analysis, indicating a high degree of agreement between the two products. Of the sample pixels falling within TerraClass pasture, 7% are labeled as small-scale clearing disturbance, a difference that does not necessarily represent a thematic disagreement. Only 6% of the area TerraClass labels as pasture disagrees with our sample interpretation, falling into cropland, tree plantation, construction, dam, and mining disturbance types. More than 85% of the TerraClass area of annual agriculture was in agreement with our agroindustrial clearing for crops disturbance type. A large percent of small-scale clearing area from our current study corresponds to TerraClass forest (46% of the area), which is likely explained by the median size of small-scale clearing in our study being 5 ha and minimum mapping unit of PRODES being 6.25 ha. Small-scale clearings also correspond to TerraClass pastures (26%), secondary regrowth and reforestation (15%), mosaic of land uses (5%), and other classes (8%). Numerous forest loss sample pixels are identified as no deforestation or secondary vegetation in TerraClass (columns “Forest,” “Nonforested areas,” and “Secondary regrowth and reforestation”), probably because of the differences in deforestation date identification between our sample-based analysis and PRODES, which is the deforestation baseline for TerraClass.

The differences between the three estimates are probably due to different degradation definitions, which are often difficult to formalize (for example, how the boundaries of the burnt areas are defined or what distance from visible logging extractions is considered degraded), different methodological approaches [automated image classification of Souza et al. ( 20 ) versus visual image interpretation of DEGRAD versus visual sample interpretation of the current study], different input data [a single Landsat image per year by Souza et al. ( 20 ) and DEGRAD versus a continuum of 16-day Landsat composites in our study], and slightly different study areas.

Souza et al. ( 20 ) 2000–2010 forest degradation estimates are also based on a single-date Landsat imagery analysis and have a similar 1-year lag in degradation date detection ( Fig. 8 ), detecting peaks of forest degradation in 2006 and 2008 instead of 2005 and 2007 and missing the 2010 peak.

“End of year—uncertain date” indicates that the fire scar was observed in the first 16-day composite of the year and there were no cloud-free 16-day composites at the end of the previous year; in this case, fire was attributed to the end of the previous year.

Peaks of degradation detected by DEGRAD are 1 year later compared to the peak fire years from our sample and independent MODIS estimates ( Fig. 8 ). The 1-year lag in DEGRAD is confirmed by a sample-level degradation date analysis: 72% (89 of 124) of the sampled pixels identified as 2007–2013 degradation in both our sample analysis and DEGRAD had DEGRAD year of disturbance 1 year later. The lag in degradation detection is probably due to the use of single-date imagery in the DEGRAD system: Year 2008 DEGRAD map was based on imagery from 7 April to 3 October 2008 (91% of the scenes were acquired before September), whereas our sample-based analysis indicates that ~70% of fires in 2000–2013 occurred in September to December ( Table 3 ).

DEGRAD detects areas affected by selective logging and fire during 2007–2013 (see www.obt.inpe.br/degrad/ and Materials and Methods for more information on DEGRAD methodology). The larger degradation area detected by DEGRAD compared to the sample-based analysis (combined selective logging and fire) is likely due to (i) differences in methodology and definitions (DEGRAD marks the entire forest patches as degraded when disturbance signs are present, whereas we consider only a 120-m buffer around visible logging damage and fire scars as degraded). This difference was partially offset by analyzing DEGRAD only within the sampling region of the current study, leaving out 49% of DEGRAD area. (ii) DEGRAD includes some pre-2007 degradation in the 2007–2013 map: 26% (41 of 160) of the samples marked as pre-2007 fire or logging degradation were identified as 2007–2013 degradation in DEGRAD.

Results of the current sample-based analysis indicate fire peaks in 2005, 2007, and 2010 ( Fig. 8 ), which is consistent with earlier Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)–based observations ( 21 ). Two of these fire peaks, 2005 and 2010, occur within years of extreme drought ( 22 , 23 ). Drought conditions, together with forest fragmentation edge effects and selective logging, increase humid tropical forest susceptibility to fire, which often originates from human activities outside of the forest ( 24 , 25 ). Selective logging rates remain constant in the region between 2000 and 2013 ( Fig. 8 ). We compared our selective logging and fire area estimates with mapping results from the Brazilian national forest degradation monitoring system DEGRAD and from Souza et al. ( 20 ) ( Fig. 8 ).

The UMD map detects more tree cover loss in the BLA each year, compared to PRODES and Souza et al. ( 20 ) ( Fig. 7 ). The explanation for this difference is that the UMD map is not limited to mapping deforestation of primary forests but includes all tree cover loss dynamics. The UMD map underestimates total tree cover loss at the beginning of the study period (before 2010) and overestimates total tree cover loss at the end, that is, displays a temporal pattern of bias, which is absent in PRODES and Souza et al. ( 20 ). This may be due to the following reasons: (i) loss date attribution uncertainty ( 10 ); (ii) a possible increase of model sensitivity to loss events at the end of the study period caused by the after-effects of the two large droughts (2005 and 2010); and (iii) the new model including Landsat 8 data in 2013, which has proven to increase sensitivity to small-scale disturbances.

PRODES is successful in reproducing our unbiased sample-based annual loss area estimates, but PRODES is not spatially accurate. Only 79% of the sample-based estimated area of human clearing of primary forest was within the PRODES forest mask. Thus, the forest mask imposed by PRODES results in omitting 21% of the estimated area of primary forest cover loss.

Three-year averages of sample-based annual tree cover loss estimates by disturbance type (stand-replacement disturbances, selective logging, and fire) and forest type (primary forests and other forests and woodlands) compared with 3-year averages of annual map-based deforestation estimates from PRODES and Souza et al. ( 20 ) and tree cover loss estimates from UMD map.

(A) Current study (human clearing of primary forests), (B) PRODES, and (C) Souza et al. ( 20 ). Total difference between (A) and (C), and (B) and (C) is calculated only for 2001–2010 because of the absence of Souza et al. ( 20 ) estimates for 2011–2013.

PRODES and Souza et al. ( 20 ) both map deforestation in primary humid tropical forests of the Brazilian Amazon, which corresponds to the human clearing of primary forests in our study. Although all three studies document decreased annual deforestation rates after 2005 and agree in the overall area of deforestation, annual estimates vary up to 65% ( Table 2 and Fig. 7 ). The largest relative disagreement is 2009, when Souza et al. ( 20 ) detect substantially larger deforestation areas than PRODES and the current study. The peak of deforestation is 2003 according to our study and 2004 according to others.

Our results indicate that, by 2013, clearing of woodlands and secondary forests and non–stand-replacement disturbances (fires and selective logging) exceeded human clearing of primary forests in area (53% versus 47%) (table S3 and Fig. 2B ). We used our sample data to estimate the implications of this result on gross carbon loss. From all sample pixels of tree cover loss (3908 pixels), we derived the range of mean predisturbance aboveground carbon (AGC) density estimates from three carbon maps ( Table 1 ). AGC loss was assumed to be 100%, resulting from stand-replacement forest disturbances (human and natural), 4 to 37% (average 21%) from selective logging ( 18 ), and 10 to 50% (average 30%) from fire ( 19 ). The results of this estimation process indicate that 26 to 35% of 2013 gross AGC loss likely resulted from disturbance types other than human clearing of primary forests. The lowest contribution of other disturbance types to gross AGC loss was in 2003 (13 to 18%), corresponding to an annual peak of primary forest clearing, and the highest contribution was in 2010 (38 to 49%), the drought year with fire disturbance peak ( Fig. 6 ). If deforestation (clearing of primary forests) continues to decline, carbon emissions from other forest and disturbance types, including natural woodlands, will constitute a substantial proportion of gross carbon loss in the BLA.

Annual state-level tree cover loss estimates ( Fig. 5 and table S5) show a peak loss in primary forests and natural woodlands in 2003 and 2004 in most states and a less pronounced peak in secondary forests and woodlands in 2002 in Mato Grosso, Maranhão, and Tocantins. The largest annual loss amplitude is observed in Mato Grosso (1.62 ± 0.12 Mha in 2004 versus 0.12 ± 0.04 Mha in 2009).

Construction of the Luis Eduardo Magalhães (Lajeado) Dam in Tocantins, which was completed in 2002, resulted in extensive inundation and contributed 5% of the total 2000–2013 tree cover loss in the state (4% of loss in primary forests, 3% in natural woodlands, and 10% in secondary forests and woodlands).

Secondary forests and woodlands are primarily cleared for agroindustrial pastures and small-scale agricultural activities ( Fig. 3D ). Clearing for plantations is a significant contributor to loss dynamics in some areas (45% in Amapá and 2 to 3% in Amazonas, Maranhão, Mato Grosso, Pará, and Rondônia).

Natural woodlands are converted to cropland more often than primary forests are converted to cropland ( Fig. 3C ). Conversion to cropland is a major type of loss dynamic in the natural woodlands of Mato Grosso (50%) and the second largest (after pasture conversion) loss type in the natural woodlands of Maranhão (37%) and Tocantins (24%).

Agroindustrial forest clearing for pasture is the largest contributor to primary forest loss at the state level ( Fig. 3B ), except for Roraima and Amapá, where small-scale clearing prevails over agroindustrial. Small-scale clearing is the second largest disturbance type in other frontier states (Acre, Amazonas, and Rondônia). Mato Grosso has a substantial portion of primary forest loss to croplands (18%; table S4), followed by fire (14%). Primary forest fires are also widespread in Maranhão (16%), Tocantins (15%), Amazonas (10%), Pará (5%), Rondônia (5%), and Roraima (4%). Most selective logging occurs within Mato Grosso and Pará, the two largest primary forest clearing contributors, and is estimated at 8 and 7% of the total primary forest loss of these states, respectively. Natural forest disturbances, namely, river meandering and windfalls, contribute more than 1% of primary forest loss only in Amazonas (8% river meandering and 3% windfalls) and Roraima (2% windfalls).

At the state level, the largest contributors to tree cover loss are Mato Grosso and Pará, which together comprise 60% of the total 13-year loss area (table S4 and Fig. 3A ). These two states are also the leading contributors to primary forest loss ( Fig. 3B ), whereas Maranhão, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins, which are partially located within Cerrado woodlands ( Fig. 4 ), make up 99% of tree cover loss in natural woodlands (table S4).

Estimates are disaggregated by ( A ) disturbance type and ( B ) predisturbance forest type and disturbance type group. Selective logging and fire categories do not represent complete tree cover loss but rather the area affected by these processes. See tables S2 and S3 for SEs of the estimates.

Estimates are disaggregated by predisturbance forest type and disturbance type. Selective logging and fire categories do not represent complete tree cover loss but rather the area affected by these processes. See table S1 for SEs of the estimates.

Most tree cover loss in the BLA between 2000 and 2013 occurred in dense primary humid tropical forests ( Fig. 1 and table S1). The rates of human clearing in all forest types decreased after 2005 ( Fig. 2B ). The relative difference between the maximum and minimum tree cover loss years was 73% in primary forests (maximum, 2003; minimum, 2013), 75% in natural woodlands (maximum, 2004; minimum, 2008–2009), and 66% in other forests (maximum, 2002; minimum, 2012) (table S2B). Fire disturbance had three peaks (2005, 2007, and 2010). By 2013, human clearing of other forest types, together with natural forest loss and non–stand-replacement disturbances (fire and selective logging) in all forest types (including primary), was comparable in area to that of clearing of primary forests (0.70 ± 0.08 Mha versus 0.63 ± 0.07 Mha, where the ± term is the SE of the estimate) (table S3 and Fig. 2B ). That is, by 2013, deforestation in woodlands and secondary forests, together with natural tree cover loss and degradation in all forest types, had reached a magnitude of area similar to that of deforestation in dense primary humid tropical forests, which is the main target of current national-level mitigation efforts.

As illustrated in this study, quantifying forest disturbance dynamics is a complex task. Comprehensive tracking of predisturbance state (primary versus secondary), disturbance factor (for example, fire versus mechanical clearing), and subsequent land use (for example, soybean versus mining) is a challenge. The work of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) on documenting these dynamics is at the forefront of all similar national capabilities, as evidenced by the host of INPE products seeking to track comprehensive forest change. Our study demonstrates the increased need for such systematic monitoring because the relative amounts of tree cover loss due to different factors have changed dramatically since 2000. For applications such as carbon monitoring, the omission of forest disturbance types other than large-scale clearing may lead to inaccurate emission estimation. To address this issue, national forest monitoring systems could produce wall-to-wall characterizations of forest type, loss, and gain. Such maps could then be used to construct strata for the allocation of a probability sample, resulting in unbiased, precise estimators of forest cover loss dynamics and associated carbon losses and gains ( 17 , 36 , 37 ).

National forest monitoring should not focus only on forest clearing and conversion to nonforest land uses (“deforestation”). Non–stand-replacement disturbances, such as selective logging, paired with climate change and increased vulnerability to fire, may lead to significant carbon emissions and biodiversity losses and eventually to conversion of forests to other land covers. DEGRAD is one example of such a national-scale degradation monitoring effort, even though limited by a single-date image analysis approach. Our results suggest that the use of the entire record of satellite observations, rather than a single best image for a given year, may yield better results in tree cover loss date attribution and improve near–real-time forest disturbance monitoring ( 35 ). An independent nongovernmental MapBiomas system is moving in this direction by using the entire archive of Landsat observations to map annual land-cover and land-use transitions in all biomes of Brazil.

Brazil conducts the most advanced operational forest monitoring system, integrating near–real-time deforestation monitoring [DETER and DETER-B ( 28 )], annual deforestation [PRODES ( 1 )], forest degradation (DEGRAD), and postdeforestation land-use (TerraClass) mapping within primary forests. However, the increasing contribution of tree cover loss in other (nonprimary) forest types to gross tree cover and carbon loss suggests that national monitoring systems should expand beyond the ever-decreasing primary forest resource that is currently monitored by PRODES. For example, secondary forests have rapid carbon and nutrient accumulation potential ( 29 ), which may be offset by their widespread reclearing. Cerrado woodlands and savannas have high species richness and endemism, high rates of land conversion to agriculture, and low level of protection, which pose an imminent threat for biodiversity, water recycling to the atmosphere, and other deleterious impacts ( 30 – 32 ). Brazil has prototyped a deforestation monitoring system for other biomes outside of the Amazon region (PMDBBS system, http://siscom.ibama.gov.br/monitora_biomas/ ). This effort included producing a baseline map of 2002 vegetation for Caatinga, Cerrado, Mata Atlântica, Pampa, and Pantanal biomes and mapping 2002–2008 and 2008–2009 vegetation changes using data from Landsat and CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) satellites. However, the maps were updated for the years 2010 and 2011 only for the Cerrado biome; no updates are available for the following years. TerraClass postdeforestation land-use mapping was expanded to include the Cerrado region but only for the year 2013. Moderate-resolution (MODIS-based) monitoring of vegetation changes in the Cerrado region has been prototyped in several studies ( 33 , 34 ), but not yet implemented operationally, as with DETER in primary forests.

Forest monitoring systems using remote sensing have traditionally been map-based. Wall-to-wall maps are useful for a variety of applications, including regional forest management and law enforcement, planning of ground-based measurement campaigns, and informing ecosystem and biodiversity modeling. Sample-based validation data provide critical information necessary to quantify classification errors and biases present in the maps and to produce unbiased area estimates and their associated uncertainties expressed as confidence intervals ( 17 ). Here, we demonstrate how sample reference data can be used for multiple research objectives, complementing map-based monitoring, including (i) unbiased area estimation, satisfying Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions reporting requirements, which specify the absence of over- or underestimation so far as can be judged, and reduction of uncertainties as far as practicable ( 27 ); (ii) verification of temporal trends from the maps or revealing their biases over time; and (iii) attribution of additional thematic information (for example, forest disturbance type or predisturbance forest type).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study area The study area is the BLA; Brazilian states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins; and the western part of the state of Maranhão (Fig. 4). The boundaries of BLA were obtained from the database of the Woods Hole Research Center (http://whrc.org/publications-data/datasets/large-scale-biosphere-atmosphere-experiment/) and modified to exclude the east of Maranhão in accordance with the PRODES study area. Most of the BLA (81.2%) lies within the tropical moist broadleaf forest biome (Fig. 4); 16.3% within tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, including Guianan savanna in the north of the region and Cerrado woodlands in the south; 1.2% within Chiquitano tropical dry broadleaf forests; 1.0% within Pantanal flooded savannas; and 0.3% within coastal mangroves (38). Although most states in the BLA are dominated by humid tropical forests, significant parts of Tocantins, Maranhão, and Mato Grosso are occupied by Cerrado woodlands.

PRODES and UMD data sets PRODES is a deforestation monitoring system operated by INPE. PRODES maps deforestation within an ever-decreasing “nominally intact” forest mask (Fig. 9) (39); clearing of secondary forest regrowth is not mapped. The PRODES forest mask includes primarily dense humid tropical forests; Cerrado woodlands are mostly considered nonforest (Fig. 9). The PRODES methodology is a scene-based semiautomated classification, involving (i) generation of fractional images using linear spectral mixture modeling, (ii) image segmentation, (iii) unsupervised classification of segments, and (iv) visual interpretation and correction of mapping results (39). Scene-based approaches are more affected by cloud artifacts, which are labeled as no data areas in PRODES (Fig. 9). The minimum size of the image segment in PRODES mapping method (minimum mapping unit) is 6.25 ha (1), which likely introduces omission of deforestation associated with clearing of smaller forest patches. Fig. 9 PRODES forest mask and 2001–2013 forest cover loss and UMD 2001–2013 tree cover loss within BLA. The UMD global tree cover loss product (10) maps the loss of any woody vegetation taller than 5 m (with % canopy cover of >0), regardless of it being natural intact vegetation or secondary regrowth. Hence, the UMD product characterizes tree cover dynamics both within and outside of the PRODES forest mask (Fig. 9). The UMD mapping method is a more data-intensive pixel-based approach that uses all available cloud-free pixels (40), allowing it to map tree cover loss within PRODES no-data (cloudy) areas (Fig. 9).

Sampling design We aggregated all forest loss areas detected by PRODES and UMD products from 2001 to 2013 as “combined forest loss” to define the region of interest. Combined forest loss was buffered by 120 m (four Landsat pixels) to include areas with likely forest loss omission in both products. The population from which the sample was selected consisted of the combined PRODES and UMD forest loss and associated buffer (Fig. 10). A total of 10,000 sample pixels (30 m × 30 m) were selected from this region via simple random sampling. Sample-based estimates of forest loss area were produced for the entire BLA and for each state separately (Table 7). The SE of the estimated area depends on the absolute size of the sample (see Eq. 2) and not on the percent of the population sampled (41). For example, the sample size of 10,000 yielded an SE of 1.3% for the total 2001–2013 forest cover loss estimate in BLA (table S1), which we consider to be sufficiently precise. Fig. 10 Population from which the simple random sample of 10,000 pixels was selected. Table 7 Sample size (number of pixels) and area of target region by state in BLA. View this table: A direct estimator of area for simple random sampling (16) was used to estimate the area of tree cover loss based on the sample reference values. These area estimates are based on the reference data and sample labeling protocol described in the following subsection. For each sampled pixel, the proportion of area of tree cover loss was recorded as 0, 0.5, or 1. The estimated area of tree cover loss type i within a region of interest was computed as (1)where is the sample mean proportion of tree cover loss of type i (that is, mean of the n sample pixel values of 0, 0.5, or 1), A tot is the area of the region of interest, and n is the number of sample pixels in the region of interest. Area estimates can be produced for the full population or regions of interest such as states. For the full population, the sample size is n = 10,000. Sample sizes for each state are listed in Table 7. The SE of the estimated area is (2)where s i is the sample SD of tree cover loss type i in the region of interest (that is, the SD of the tree cover loss values of 0, 0.5, and 1 for the n pixels sampled in that region). The estimates for regions of interest such as states are considered “domain” or “subpopulation” estimates, and the estimators implemented are those recommended by Cochran [(41), section 2.12].

Reference data and sample labeling protocol Reference values for each sampled pixel were derived via visual interpretation of annual Landsat composite images for 1999–2013 and, when available, high-resolution imagery from Google Earth. Reference data and final interpretation results for each sampled pixel are available at glad.umd.edu/brazil. Landsat annual composites represent median normalized reflectance values from all available cloud/shadow-free pixels for a given year. Methods for cloud screening, image normalization, and per-pixel compositing are described by Potapov et al. (40). In addition to annual Landsat composites, 16-day composite images from 1999–2013 were examined for sampled pixels identified as having experienced forest degradation (from fire and selective logging) in the initial sample screening. This was done to get a more precise estimate of the timing of these events: Low-intensity disturbances such as fires occur in local dry seasons and during droughts. If these disturbances occurred late in the year, their annual allocation might be incorrectly assigned to the following year using median annual composites. Each sampled pixel was initially visually assessed independently by two experts. Sample pixels with disagreement between experts were subsequently revisited until a consensus was reached. All sampled pixels were identified as yes/no tree cover loss. Pixels with tree cover loss were further attributed with (i) loss year (2001–2013), (ii) likely disturbance type, and (iii) predisturbance forest type. Mixed sample pixels, located on the boundary of tree cover loss patches, were marked as edge pixels and treated as “0.5 loss” in area calculations, with 404 of 10,000 sample pixels (4%) identified as boundary pixels. We identified only the first stand-replacement forest disturbance event during the study period (2000–2013) and the associated land-cover transition. For example, if a forested sample pixel was initially converted to pasture, and later transformed to cropland, our analysis would assign it as a forest-to-pasture conversion. If a sample pixel experienced tree cover loss at the beginning of the study period followed by tree-cover regrowth and a second tree cover loss event, we would record only the first loss event and ignore the subsequent dynamics. However, this example case would be labeled as a forestry land use, that is, the clearing of trees to be replaced by tree cover in the management of a plantation. Types of forest disturbance were subdivided into stand-replacement (human forest clearing and natural forest disturbances) and non–stand-replacement (degradation), which consists of fire and selective logging (Table 8). For stand-replacement disturbances, a sample pixel was considered “loss” if the entire pixel or half of the pixel (in case of mixed boundary pixels) experienced complete tree cover loss. Human forest clearing includes large-scale agroindustrial clearing for nonwoody crops, tree plantations, and pasture; small-scale clearing; clearing for mining, road construction, and other construction; and flooding of forests after the construction of dams (Table 8). Agroindustrial forest clearing is reliably distinguished from all other clearing types at Landsat resolution based on the size, shape, and spatial pattern of a clearing. However, distinguishing agroindustrial clearing for row crops from newly established pastures may be challenging in the absence of high-resolution imagery on Google Earth. Georeferenced ground images from Panoramio provide additional information for interpreters in these cases. Small-scale clearing was identified by its size and postclearing land use (combination of cropland, pasture, orchards, and residences) for older clearings and by size only for the fresh clearings. Median area of loss patches identified as small-scale clearing is 5 ha. Only 24% of small-scale clearing sample pixels fall within the most recent INCRA (National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform) settlement map, which indicates that these small-scale clearings are created not only by smallholders (rural settlers) but also by agroindustrial enterprises. Natural forest disturbances include windfalls, river meandering, and other natural disturbances. The latter category is very rare and implies that the type of natural disturbance could not be identified reliably (for example, it was not clear whether tree cover was lost due to a windfall or as an after-effect of a drought). Table 8 Types of forest disturbance. Images are subsets of pre- and postdisturbance (top and bottom, respectively) for annual Landsat composites (band combination, 5-4-3). Small red rectangles represent sampled pixels.

View this table: For non–stand-replacement disturbances, which included forest degradation due to fire and selective logging, a sample pixel was marked as affected by forest disturbance if it experienced canopy damage or was located within a 120-m buffer around visible fire or logging damage. The 120-m buffer (four Landsat pixels) is the minimum number of 30-m Landsat pixels, containing a 100-m buffer, corresponding to the area initially affected by felling of individual trees in conventional selective logging (42) and containing the most edge effects associated with increased tree mortality and altered forest structure (43). If a sample pixel experienced degradation (due to fire or logging) before being cleared within a study period, we considered clearing to be the major type of forest disturbance and recorded only clearing to avoid double-counting. Tropical forest fires have a distinct pattern of concentric circles (Table 8) because of diurnal variation in precipitation and humidity (44), which enables their identification on Landsat imagery. Selective logging is marked by the presence of logging roads and a semiregular pattern of gaps caused by tree extraction (Table 8). Major predisturbance forest types were defined as dense (>60% canopy cover) tropical forests (both humid and dry), woodlands and parklands (10 to 60% canopy cover), and tree plantations (Table 9). Dense tropical forests were further subdivided into primary and secondary, which in Landsat imagery have different spectral responses (primary forests are usually characterized by low spectral reflectance in the shortwave infrared range) and texture (primary forests have larger crowns creating a recognizable texture, whereas secondary forests look comparatively uniform). Primary and secondary forests can be unambiguously distinguished in submeter imagery when available from Google Earth by the size of tree crowns. Primary forests identified this way using satellite imagery include primary intact and primary degraded (for example, previously selectively logged) and may include some old-growth secondary forests (for example, cleared during the rubber boom of 1879–1912). Field data show that tropical secondary forests regain the density, basal area, aboveground biomass (AGB), and species richness similar to those of primary forests after 40 years (45), and selectively logged primary forests fully restore their AGB in about 25 years (46). This evidence suggests that primary degraded and old-growth secondary forests, indistinguishable in circa 2000 satellite imagery from primary intact forests, have carbon storage and biodiversity value analogous to those of primary intact forests, and that possible inclusion of such forests into our “primary forest” category will not affect the main conclusions of the study. Table 9 Predisturbance forest types. Images are subsets of pre- and postdisturbance (top and bottom, respectively) for annual Landsat composites on the left (band combination, 5-4-3) and Google Earth imagery on the right. Small red rectangles represent sampled pixels.

View this table: Woodlands and parklands were also subdivided into natural (primary) and secondary. Natural woodlands and parklands correspond to the uniform woody vegetation patches in the “Tropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands” biome (38). The biome map also helped distinguish between dense secondary forests in the tropical forest biome and natural woodlands. Secondary woodlands and parklands represent sparse secondary regrowth in both tropical forests and savannas. Tree plantations are characterized by regular patch shapes, high reflectance in the shortwave infrared range and uniform texture in Landsat imagery, and systematic planting recognizable in high-resolution imagery.

Quality of reference data The quality of sample visual interpretation depends on multiple factors, such as the availability of reference satellite data, distinguishability of various classes with the available satellite data (discussed in the previous subsection), image interpretation experience of validation experts, and usability of validation interface. Here, we will discuss several indicators of the quality of the reference sample data, which is a basis of the current analysis. The primary source of reference data to identify the presence or absence of forest loss in each sampled pixel was annual Landsat cloud-free composites, produced using the entire archive of Landsat ETM+ data for the study period. Eighty-one percent of the sampled pixels had at least one cloud-free observation in each year (2000–2013), 9% had one missing annual observation, 4% had two missing observations, 2% had three missing observations, 3% had four missing observations, and 2% had five or more missing observations. Additionally, 44% of all sample pixels had at least one very high resolution (VHR; resolution, <1 m) image on Google Earth, 34% had SPOT image (resolution, 2.5 m), and 22% had only Landsat. These higher-resolution imagery sources (VHR and SPOT) facilitated identification of forest loss cause and predisturbance forest type. Sampled pixels with detected forest loss had higher availability of high-resolution imagery on Google Earth (58% VHR, 38% SPOT, and 4% Landsat only), which is probably due to the fact that high-resolution imaging systems target settlements and areas of human development more often than undisturbed forested areas. Visual interpretation of each sample pixel was first performed by each of the two experts independently; initial agreement between the interpreters on the sampled pixel belonging to the yes/no/boundary forest loss category was 87%. The remaining 13% of sampled pixels were iteratively reinterpreted until consensus was reached. From the sampled pixels with initial forest loss agreement, 80% had loss year agreement and another 12% had a 1-year difference in loss date between the two interpreters. Sampled pixels with initial forest loss agreement had 78% agreement for loss type and 82% agreement for predisturbance forest type. High rates of initial interpretation agreement illustrate that interpretation criteria, described in the previous subsection, were applied by the experts consistently.

Auxiliary data: DEGRAD DEGRAD is a forest degradation monitoring system operated by INPE (www.obt.inpe.br/degrad/). DEGRAD data for the BLA exist for 2007–2013 and identify three types of degradation: mild (small gaps from selective logging), moderate (later stages of selective logging, skid trails, and other logging infrastructure are visible in the imagery, but large trees and the structure of canopy are still preserved), and intensive (significant loss of large trees and understory due to heavy selective logging, often accompanied by recurring fires). The DEGRAD methodology is based on visual interpretation of a single good image during the year. Hand-drawn polygons of forest degradation outline the forest area in which degradation events were observed. Of the degradation area mapped by DEGRAD, 49% is outside of our sampling region, which includes forest canopy damages, detectable in Landsat imagery and mapped by PRODES and UMD, and a surrounding 120-m buffer. To ensure an adequate comparison of our sample-based fire and logging estimates with DEGRAD, we analyzed DEGRAD only within our sampling region.

Auxiliary data: TerraClass and TerraClass Cerrado TerraClass is another project operated by INPE (www.inpe.br/cra/projetos_pesquisas/dados_terraclass.php) with the objective of mapping land uses following deforestation in primary forests of the BLA (26). TerraClass is currently available for the years 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Each year’s map assigns the type of land use to all areas that were deforested by that year according to PRODES using single-date Landsat imagery. Current year’s deforestation does not have an assigned postdeforestation land use (for example, year 2004 TerraClass has “Deforestation 2004” class). Therefore, to compare our sample-based disturbance types (which reflect only the first transition of forested vegetation to other land covers) to TerraClass postdeforestation land uses (which may change over time), we overlaid sample pixels identified in our study as 2001–2003 forest loss with 2004 TerraClass; 2004–2007 loss sample pixels with 2008 TerraClass; and 2008–2009 with 2010, 2010–2011 with 2012, and 2012–2013 loss sample pixels with 2014 TerraClass. Only the sample pixels identified as human clearing of primary forests were used in the comparison to ensure the best match with deforestation as mapped by PRODES. All TerraClass pasture categories (pastures, pastures with shrubs, pastures with bare soil, and pastures with tree regeneration) were combined into one pasture category to facilitate the comparison; secondary vegetation and reforestation classes were also combined (Table 4). Combining pasture categories into one class was reported to decrease confusion between TerraClass postdeforestation land-use classes from 23 to 10% based on a sample validation using SPOT reference data (26). TerraClass Cerrado is a similar Landsat-based system mapping land uses following the conversion of natural vegetation into other land uses in the woodland region of Cerrado (www.dpi.inpe.br/tccerrado/). TerraClass Cerrado is available only for the year 2013. We compared the 2013 TerraClass Cerrado land-use map with the sample pixels labeled as human clearing of natural woodlands in 2001–2012 of our current study (Table 5); year 2013 was eliminated from the comparison due to the possible omission of late 2013 forest loss in TerraClass, which uses single-date Landsat imagery.

Auxiliary data: MapBiomas MapBiomas is a nongovernmental land-cover and land-use mapping project, operated by a consortium of nongovernmental organizations, universities, and geospatial companies in Brazil (http://mapbiomas.org/), using modern cloud computing and data storage technologies. Currently, the project is still under development. Collection 1 annual land-cover and land-use maps are available for the years 2008 to 2015; accuracy assessment information is not yet available. Maps are produced from multitemporal Landsat image composites using a combination of spectral mixture analysis (to map forests) and supervised Random Forest classification (to map pasture, cropland, and planted forests) and a set of priority rules to combine individual thematic layers. Because in the current study we identified only the first land-cover transition after stand-replacement forest disturbance, we compared our forest loss sample pixels with the temporally closest MapBiomas map: 2001–2007 forest loss samples were compared with 2008 MapBiomas classes; 2008 loss with 2009 MapBiomas; 2009 with 2010; 2010 with 2011; 2011 with 2012; 2012 with 2013; and 2013 forest loss samples with 2014 MapBiomas land-cover and land-use classes. MapBiomas is available for all biomes, and therefore, we were able to compare it with sampled pixels identified in the current study as human clearing of all forest types (primary and secondary dense humid tropical forests, natural and secondary woodlands, and planted forests).","Wed, 12 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1601047/F1.large.jpg,"['20002013', 'rates', 'pixels', 'legal', 'forests', 'clearing', 'area', 'tree', 'brazilian', 'forest', 'amazon', 'sample', 'cover', 'primary', 'loss', 'types', 'disturbance']",

51,51,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,What ever happened to Eric Cantona? The Man Utd legend who traded Kung-fu kicks for movie stardom - Goal Ireland,https://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/what-ever-happened-to-eric-cantona/c6ud564rlvgw1wgmh0kpyl1qx,"What ever happened to Eric Cantona? The Man Utd legend who traded Kung-fu kicks for movie stardom

The French genius quit football almost 20 years ago, and has become a star of the big screen since calling time on his career at Old Trafford

When a press conference related to Eric Cantona was called by Manchester United in May 1997 it was the common consensus that a new contract was to be announced. The Frenchman’s retirement just a few days before his 31st birthday stunned United supporters all across the world.

Even Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t want to believe the star No.7 was done with football, telling Cantona in a letter three months later: “When we re-started training, I kept waiting for you to turn up as normal but I think that was in hope not realism and I knew when we met at Mottram your time at Manchester United was over.”

Man Utd should look to sign Tielemans

He had been the beating heart of a United side who had ended a 26-year title drought and gone on to collect four Premier League trophies in five seasons. Despite the kung-fu kick on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons which saw him banned for eight months in 1995, his time at Old Trafford had been overwhelmingly positive thanks to his brash flair-filled style, his artistic arrogance, enviable skill set and mesmeric leadership.

At the time it felt like such a shame. Here was one of the most talented and captivating footballers of many a generation abandoning the game at an early age. Moreover, he was not quitting to become a manager or to play a different role within football, but was waving goodbye to the sport entirely.

Having already played a couple of cameo roles in an independent French film and a TV drama, he would quickly become an adept supporting actor in the film world, most notably in the 1998 film Elizabeth with Cate Blanchett and future Doctor Who lead Christopher Eccleston. Later, he would be the main subject of the excellent Ken Loach drama ‘Looking For Eric’ in which a Manchester United fan looks to draw inspiration from Cantona in dealing with serious issues in his family life.

In total he has appeared in more than 20 movies since his retirement, most recently playing the male lead in a Croatian fantasy drama called Anka in which he meets up with a young girl fleeing from a difficult home life.

Over the past 12 months he has also been catching the eye in a series of Eurosport TV advertisements, acting as the ‘Commissioner of Football’ in which he passes sentence on the latest headlines and controversies in the game.

Marcelo blasts Ronaldo envy

From the mimicking of Oscars errors and the application to become England manager to commenting on French politicians and labelling Lionel Messi a “poor man’s Justin Bieber”, Cantona has offered a refreshingly unique take on the modern game with his periodic missives. Since his retirement from football almost 20 years ago, his direct involvement in the game has been limited - so long as we’re not counting a brief foray into beach soccer.

Beyond his acting career Cantona has also dabbled with photography, explaining in 2009: “I like to be fascinated by the people I photograph. Sometimes I don’t admire people but I’m interested about their lives. I’d like to do [photograph] a dictator, I don’t like them, but I’m interested about them.”

He has become known for his views on French politics, speaking out on both president Francois Hollande and former prime minister and current presidential nominee Francois Fillon during his TV soapbox skits. He has also shown his hand at film-making with a series of TV documentaries aired in his home country.

A tour of public speaking engagements in early 2017 courted some controversy when tickets worth up to £1,000 a head were sold for an evening with Cantona which turned into a glorified auction with only 45 minutes of pre-planned questions for the star of the show. Fans were also asked to take no pictures or videos despite the costly outlay, and some booed when left waiting over an hour for Cantona to take the stage.

It was one of Cantona’s rare forays into the public arena, but perhaps it is no great surprise that he has largely stepped away from the everyday spotlight since his retirement considering his persona back in his dressing-room days.

“Cantona led by his presence more than anything else, his charisma,” said United midfielder Roy Keane. “A captain doesn’t have to be loud; Eric rarely said a word.” Former Marseille team-mate Chris Waddle added: “I found Eric a nice lad. He used to come in on his Harley Davidson and he was fine, quiet.”

He has had the odd flirtation with football since 1997, with his appearances in benefit games at Old Trafford and beyond supplemented with an ill-fated spell as director of soccer at New York Cosmos. In 2011, he appeared in an advert puffing on a cigar and announcing “We are back” as Pele’s former club relaunched their brand ahead of a 2013 return, but in 2014 he was fired after receiving a police caution for assaulting a photographer in London. He would later file a law suit against the club over almost $1 million in unpaid salary.

The quiet guy with the loud temperament left one hell of an impression on United fans, who still sing his name to this day as they continue to reminisce about one of the greatest players ever to play for their club. Eric, though, does not share their love for looking back at the past.

“I don’t know where my medals are. No shirt, nothing,” he told the BBC in 2011. “I played for France 45 times, we had two shirts for every game, so that’s 90 shirts… I don’t have even one. I don’t want to have something that keeps me in memories like a prison. It was a strong time, the adrenaline was great. But you can feel very quickly like a prisoner of your past.

“I prefer to be free and think about tomorrow. I want to look forward, to have new ambitions, new goals, new passions.”

What will tomorrow bring for the nomadic post-footballing Eric Cantona? Whether film, tv, photography, cinema, poetry, beach soccer or a completely new passion, there is one thing for certain about the future according to the man himself.

“I support United, still, and all my life. I will die with United in my heart.”","Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['football', 'french', 'man', 'utd', 'movie', 'stardom', 'cantona', 'tv', 'retirement', 'happened', 'traded', 'game', 'film', 'kicks', 'eric', 'dont', 'legend', 'kungfu', 'united']",

In Zaragoza, a company called Chocoter uses local cherries and other fruits to produce a product with added value and available all year round: chocolate coated fruits.





""We work with cherries, oranges, apples, apricots, peaches, plums and pears,"" explains José Caro, and these are all grown in Spain. ""We buy the fruits already confectioned and whole from local suppliers, although we supervise the confectionery to make sure that the quality and the calibres are good. We are then in charge of chopping them and coating them in chocolate.""

Without preservatives

Caro explains the process. ""The fruits are introduced into sulphur dioxide to stop the ripening; then, glucose and sugar are added. By doing this, we can guarantee that they will be suitable for consumption for at least a year without using any preservatives other than sugar. Lastly, the cherries are macerated in alcohol for two months more so that they acquire the liqueur taste that we want; the rest of fruits retain their natural flavour.

For Chocoter, quality is the most important aspect, so they always use Spanish fruits, so they don't have to store them for too long, and dark chocolate with a cocoa content of between 55% and 60%.





10% for the United States

Chocoter sells most of its products in the domestic market and doesn't export them to many countries, although it does sell a large volume to its largest export market: the United States. ""We make 10% of our total turnover from sales to the United States, mainly of chocolate coated oranges. We also have secondary markets, such as the United Arab Emirates, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Italy, although we don't sell a lot in central Europe,"" affirms the entrepreneur.

Chocoter is the leader of this segment in Spain, and although its competitors are mainly the most famous chocolate brands, the latter's products do not really have much to do with Chocoter's. ""They offer liquor pralines, rather than cherries coated in chocolate. On the other hand, here in the area of ​​Aragon, there are also manufacturers of polvorones and shortbread, although their products are of a different quality to ours and they focus mainly in the Christmas season. There are only two or three manufacturers like us producing all year round.""





Tourism and own consumption

This product is aimed at different types of consumers, so the company offers them in different presentations. ""Our most important market at any time of the year is tourism. There are usually sales of the well-known Aragón fruit baskets (with miniature replicas of the traditional wooden boxes used in fruit picking), which are very typical and we try to be in all service areas, airports and important transit locations. Then, during the Christmas campaign, great quantities of our products are also sold for own consumption.""

However, these products are not very successful in supermarkets, since they are usually placed on the shelves with candy and other sweets, so consumers mix them up with more expensive confectionary. They are usually better sold in specialty and gourmet food stores, nut stores or pastry shops.





Third generation

The company Chocoter has been devoted to coating in chocolate since the 50's, when José Caro's grandfather started developing this product, so he is already part of the third generation which has followed the family tradition. The company always works with a specific variety of cherry, the Napoleon, which is cultivated in Aragon, as well as with Salustiana oranges.

His 12th goal of the season did not part lips in wonderment nor spark mass extolment on social media like his previous one, but Roberto Firmino’s header at West Bromwich Albion was as emphatic as his 25-yard stunner away to Stoke.

West Brom 0-1 Liverpool

It strengthened Liverpool’s push for a Champions League place and furthered their credentials in conquering these sort of unpleasant encounters - the kind that have too often proved to be their undoing in 2016-17.

On Easter Sunday, the Reds refused to allow that to be the case again and finally overcame a Tony Pulis team on their travels in the league.

As per Jurgen Klopp’s judgement of their run-in after the Merseyside derby and the season-ending knee injury to Sadio Mane, his charges had to forget about rolling over teams and roll up their sleeves in the battle to consolidate their top-four ambitions.

The Hawthorns was always going to provide an examination of just how well Liverpool could deal with menace and they succeeded in not just getting stuck in, but seeing an uneasy match out.

Could Liverpool sign Oxlade-Chamberlain?

""It is one of the most difficult places to come because in no game can you feel comfortable,"" Klopp said.

""Somebody asked me which result would have kept me a little bit calmer in the last few minutes and I said only 4-0 after 86 minutes! Maybe then I would have felt OK, but now it’s done.

""It was very, very important because showing this concentration level until the end didn’t work each week in the last few months – but today, it was really good and I am happy about this.""

Firmino was at the heart of their attacking verve and defensive diligence. No player created more chances than the 25-year-old and none topped him for ball recoveries. He led the way in take-ons and won 64% of his duels.

The forward's decisiveness did not just materialise in the opposition's box, but Liverpool's too as his vital touch prevented Nacer Chadli from converting for the Baggies.

Klopp has described his focal point as “unbelievable” on several occasions, not simply due to his obvious excellence on the ball but his tirelessness out of possession.

The 1-0 victory offered the perfect snapshot of how intelligently Firmino applies his attributes for Liverpool.

The result provided the visitors with their first clean sheet since the 2-0 victory over Tottenham on February 11 and, given there had been so much focus on West Brom’s lethalness in the air and from set-pieces, it made the manner of the decisive goal all the more enjoyable for the Reds.

James Milner’s free-kick from the left was flicked on by Lucas and Firmino, who’d already been in the thick of the game's best moments, broke free at the far post to head Liverpool in front.

Simon Mignolet once again turned in a steely performance between the sticks to ensure it stayed that way, denying Matt Phillips with his legs in the final 10 minutes.

""He made an important save and in the end, it doesn’t look that spectacular, but he was really present around the set-pieces,"" Klopp noted.

""I think three, four, five fists away, which was really good, I have to say. He was really lively, front-footed, all that stuff. Very important again.""

Emre Can, meanwhile, continued his assertiveness in the centre of the park. The midfielder has contributed massively to his club's seven-game unbeaten run, helping to negate the absence of Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana.

""I really thought that the boys were in a really difficult game in not the easiest situation, but they did really well,"" Klopp offered.

""You can always do better, but we learned in the game and I liked it a lot that the second half looked better tuned than the first.

""We knew what to do, but in the first half it looked a little bit static in a few moments and in the second half it looked much better. I am really happy about the performance.""

There were many other noteworthy shifts on Sunday, but it was the man from the east coast of Brazil who led Liverpool closer to their return to Europe’s elite.","Sun, 16 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['win', 'beast', 'beauty', 'better', 'liverpool', 'leading', 'game', 'roberto', 'assumes', 'firmino', 'role', 'looked', 'important', 'really', 'half', 'west', 'klopp', 'ugly']",

Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead - Goal.com,https://www.goal.com/en/news/bow-to-your-king-genius-messi-single-handedly-drags/tazpeii4khwb1i1jh8rfq1ajz,"Bow to your King! Genius Messi single-handedly drags Barcelona back from the dead

The Argentine proved his genius - and resilience - by leading the Blaugrana to a sensational victory in Madrid that has blown the title race wide open

COMMENT

Marcello Lippi was asked earlier this week if Lionel Messi was in decline. ""Every time I see Barcelona's results,"" the legendary Italian coach responded, ""I see goals and assists from Messi.

""I don't think he has declined; it's the rest of Barcelona that has declined. The drop-off is more in terms of the defence and that affects the whole team.""

Sunday's Clasico showdown at the Santiago Bernabeu proved Lippi right on both counts: Messi was as brilliant as Barca's defence was brittle.

Messi wins Clasico for Barca at the death

Yet the Catalans, thanks to their talismanic No.10, managed to prevail over their great rivals Real Madrid, thus breathing new life into a Liga title race that had appeared dead by claiming a dramatic, last-gasp 3-2 victory in one of the greatest games this famous fixture has ever seen.

Indeed, many Madrid fans had come to the ground expecting to bury Barcelona. Avoiding defeat would all but seal the title and deal a fatal blow to a Blaugrana side seemingly on the way out after their comprehensive Champions League elimination at the hands of Juventus. Remarkably, even Messi was being written off beforehand.

The Argentine had come into the game without a goal in his previous six matches against Real Madrid. This unprecedented drought was viewed by some as evidence that Messi was no longer the phenomenon of old - in spite of the fact that no player has scored more goals in all competitions across Europe's top five leagues (now 47 in just 46 games).

When it comes to appraising the talents of Messi and Ronaldo in the modern era, it seems that they are only as good as their last game, and whereas the Portuguese had fired Real into the last four of the Champions League with a hat-trick against Bayern, Messi had drawn a blank in Barca's midweek draw with Juventus.

Luis Enrique was even asked in his pre-game press conference if it was time for his No.10 to shine again. ""I think it’s time for FC Barcelona to show their full potential,"" the Barca boss replied. ""We shouldn’t focus on just Messi or anyone else.""

Messi scores 500th goal for Barca

Real did focus on Messi, though, seemingly intent on nullifying his influence by any means necessary. Casemiro was booked just 13 minutes in for cynically scything the 29-year-old down after being embarrassed by Messi's quick feet in the middle of the park.

Marcelo, meanwhile, left the Clasico's all-time record goalscorer (23) prone on the Bernabeu turf with blood pouring out of his mouth with a careless elbow to the face.

Messi would have his revenge, though, retaliating not with aggression but artistry, bravely refusing to stop running at his rivals. He made five dribbles in the first half alone; the rest of the players on the pitch managed two between them.

He was felled twice more by Casemiro before the break, twice more he picked himself up off the ground and continued to carry the fight to Real.

Thirty-three minutes in, he finally lost his Brazilian tormentor for the first time and capitalised in scintillating fashion. He took a pass from Rakitic in his stride to glide past Luka Modric before then leaving Dani Carvajal swinging at thin air as he slotted the ball coolly past Keylor Navas to level the game.

Messi was involved again as Barca took the lead with 17 minutes to go. The Argentina captain found his path to goal blocked - legally, for once - but Rakitic picked up the pieces and unleashed a thunderous strike that left the brilliant Navas with no chance.

When Sergio Ramos was rightly shown a straight red card for throwing himself into a disgusting two-footed lunge at Messi just four minutes later, the game appeared to be up for Real. However, the 10 men incredibly drew level when substitute James Rodriguez turned in Marcelo's cross.

Messi wasn't done, though. With just 13 seconds of injury time to go, he timed his arrival into the area to perfection before driving home Jordi Alba's pull-back to silence the Santiago Bernabeu with his 500th goal for Barca. Bloodied, battered and still sporting a black eye from a bruising encounter with Juve, he celebrated by showing them his jersey as a reminder that he remains the King of the Clasico.

They thought his reign was over. They were wrong. Barca may be in decline but Messi most certainly is not. As Luis Enrique pointed out afterwards, ""Messi is decisive even when he is at home eating dinner! He is the best player in history.""","Sun, 23 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['title', 'barcelona', 'bernabeu', 'barca', 'madrid', 'king', 'real', 'messi', 'drags', 'bow', 'goal', 'singlehandedly', 'genius', 'minutes', 'dead', 'game']",

58,58,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Talk yourself right into a job - Science Magazine,https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/04/talk-yourself-right-job,"Talk yourself right into a job

I’m sure you’ve heard the expression used to describe people who can work a room: They have “the gift of gab.” The people we describe that way seem to have been born with the ability to converse. They move comfortably through crowds at social events, going from conversation to conversation with what appears to be the greatest of ease.

Luckily for most of us, that kind of outgoing nature is not necessary for job search success. Yes, communication is crucial. But unlike the innate gift of gab, you can develop the career communication skills you need. With attention, practice, and some self-awareness, you’ll be in good shape to make your communication skills work for you at various steps throughout your job search and career development path.

Reach out and listen

Industry careers are so different from academia that I think of that world as being in a parallel universe. Sure, it looks much the same. There’s the lab bench, and people are doing science. But, just as in those science fiction movies, all the rules have subtle but important differences. And it’s important to learn as much as possible about this new universe of jobs before trying to become a part of it. Doing so requires that you talk to people—and, even more importantly, that you listen.

Most conversations are 50-50. If you and I sit down to talk sports over a beer, we’re going to each spend about half the time talking up our own team. But when you open up a conversation with someone on the far side of a parallel universe, you’re in the listening zone. This isn’t the time for some kind of sales pitch about how great you are—or questions about whether there are openings at their company. Instead, focus on the fact that you want to learn what their world is all about: how companies grow, how and why they hire, what your contact’s job is like, and how she or he managed to land it in the first place. The most helpful kind of information can be found via a serious sit-down, typically referred to as an informational interview.

Being a good listener doesn’t mean that you don’t talk about yourself at all. You still want to communicate that you would be a good potential hire or network contact. But the latest thinking is that the frequently referenced “elevator pitch” is too one-sided and doesn’t offer enough space for conversation to develop. (We should probably take that word “pitch” and erase it from our job search lexicon, leaving it completely to vendors and insurance salespeople.) Today, you might instead add to the conversation by interjecting short nuggets of rehearsed language about your key skills and abilities, as well as other personal information.

I can’t tell you which of your strengths you should highlight in this way, but the Challenge-Approach-Results exercise is a good way to remind yourself of what they are and how they’ve worked to your advantage. This easy process will remind you how important it is to talk about your skills and accomplishments in succinct language to emphasize the value that you offer.

Make yourself a candidate

When people talk about the job search, “applicant” and “candidate” are often thrown around interchangeably. But there’s a difference. In hiring manager parlance, an employer can have hundreds of applicants for a job, but there are probably only a handful of them who are actually candidates. And one of the ways to elevate yourself from applicant to candidate status is—you guessed it—communication.

Applicants are often treated as if they are a dime a dozen. They come in swarms off the internet via online job applications. A job is posted on Thursday afternoon and—wham!—300 applicants by Monday morning. Sadly, employers can mistreat applicants because there are so many of them. Job ads can list 10 requirements—which may not actually be crucial for performing the role—in an attempt to thin the herd. Or, applicants can be required to fill out stupid questions on an online application. (“What is your expected salary here at ABC Biotech?”) But with candidates—that short list of people who are actually a good fit for the role and will move forward in the interview process—companies make an effort to ensure that they don’t lose even one of them along the way.

A few applicants may turn into candidates. But the best way to set yourself up as a candidate instead of an applicant is by getting an internal referral. To the human resources executive tasked with sorting through the pool of job seekers, it’s a relief to have some that come pre-approved, ready to be interviewed by a hiring manager.

Wouldn’t you rather be positioned as a candidate, as opposed to being a part of the swarm? If that’s the case, get out there and talk to people at the companies you’re interested in. Even if you’re not in job search mode yet, starting this process will help you begin to see which industry jobs might be a good fit for you so that you can build your network and, when the time is right, target jobs.

Two big opportunities on interview day

If you’ve made it to interview day, first of all, congratulations! You’re a bona fide candidate. But that doesn’t mean that communication ceases to be important—quite the contrary. How you present yourself during your interview is a crucial part of how employers decide whether you’ll move on to the next round or get the offer. It’s important throughout the day, which is usually filled with meetings featuring back-and-forth exchanges aimed at uncovering the fit between the company and the prospect (you). But there are two moments that are particularly important: your first impression and when you close each of those meetings with your last impression.

The job talk is often put at the front end of the day, so you will be making a first impression on a lot of people all at once. In the front of their minds, your audience at the job talk will be reviewing the science you present—but they wouldn’t have invited anyone into an interview who doesn’t do good science. Sure, you need to present well and be prepared for tough technical questions. But much of the first impression will depend on factors other than your science. Keys to a good first impression include the sound of your voice, your confidence, and the demeanor you project—which will ideally convey the warmth and friendliness of a potentially great teammate.

So, think about all aspects of the message you are sending. Did you separate the “we”s from the “I”s when you talked about your work? (“In the Smith lab, we do trait integration into legumes. In this particular experiment, I identified the marker for drought resistance in pigeon pea and then began a marker-assisted breeding program for that trait.”) Did you reinforce the “I’m a problem solver” nature of your experience? Employing these types of tactics is not bragging; it’s completely ethical self-promotion. You should do so sparingly, but at critical moments.

Finally, the last impression you make as you walk out the door of each office is important too. The things that will make you memorable will be your smile, your eye contact, the positive and engaging way you kept the conversation going, and other aspects of your meeting that have nothing whatsoever to do with CRISPR-Cas9 or the size of your bioreactors.

60,60,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Why Water Pricing and Management in Singapore Needs to be More Ambitious - BRINK,https://www.brinknews.com/why-water-pricing-and-management-in-singapore-needs-to-be-more-ambitious/,"Photo: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images

A recent poll in Singapore’s national daily, The Straits Times, showed that 75 percent of Singaporeans have no idea what their monthly water bill is.

Yet, when the Singapore government recently announced that the country’s water price would be increased in two stages, they opened the sluice gates to a torrent of mainstream and social media comments that questioned need, relevance and appropriateness of the price increases.

Singapore last increased its water price in 2000, so almost a generation has grown up with no adjustment in water prices. In comparison, electricity rates are adjusted regularly, so when electricity rates are modified, it is not news. Reactions from the media and the public are very different regarding changing water prices.

The impact of the price increase will be softened by the increase in the value of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) voucher, one of the support measures by the government to help lower-income households in the face of a slowing economy.



Singapore needs to change the narrative from an argument of cost recovery for domestic and industrial water supply, to one of managing a scarce, strategic and essential resource. For this, a profound societal mindset change is necessary as to how water should be managed in the future.

The Situation Now

Consider some facts. First, the Public Utilities Board (PUB), the national water agency, has been an incredibly efficient institution. It managed to increase its operational efficiency, managing to balance its books until 2010, when it last made an operational profit of S$48 million ($36.9 million). From 2011, it has been making operating losses, which were subsidized by government grants. PUB losses have increased from S$36 million in 2013 to S$57.2 million in 2015.

Our studies indicate that between 2000 and 2014, because of inflation, the price of water decreased by 25.48 percent in real terms. In contrast, electricity and gas prices have increased at a rate slightly higher than inflation.

In addition, the monthly median income of employed residential households was S$4,398 in 2000. This increased to S$8,292 by 2014. Thus, assuming a household used 20 cubic meters of water per month in 2000, the water bill represented 0.69 percent of income. By 2014, it had declined to about 0.36 percent.

At present, about 50 percent of the water used in Singapore comes from Johor, Malaysia. Due to recent prolonged drought, storage at Linggui Reservoir in late 2016 was at a historic low. On January 9, Foreign Minister Balakrishnan noted in the Parliament that there is a “significant risk” that the reservoir may not have any water if 2017 turned out to be a dry year.

Water demand in Singapore will be significantly higher by 2050. Efficient water management must become a priority.

Fortunately, storage is now over 30 percent, but nothing assures this may not change again in the near future.

If the Linggui dries up, Singapore would lose half its water supply and could experience a significant reduction in its NEWater production—high quality recycled wastewater. If the supply from Linggui is cut by half, the question is how would this affect wastewater generated and thus NEWater production?

Add to this the potential uncertainty imposed by climate change, which is likely to contribute to prolonged droughts—a situation already being witnessed in many parts of the world. A prudent strategy for Singapore will be to prepare for not if, but when the supply from Linggui will be reduced to a trickle. Over the past six years, we have regularly argued that it is not floods, but droughts, that Singapore needs to fear.

The current estimate of water demand in Singapore by 2050 is expected to be significantly higher than what it is at present. Accordingly, efficient water management must receive priority and national attention.

At present, in Singapore, domestic and industrial water uses are far too high for comfort. Both need to be reduced significantly by judicious use of pricing, economic incentives, public education and awareness, and, above all, behavioral changes.

Take domestic water use. Per capita daily consumption in Singapore stands at about 150 liters, which is among the lowest for Asian cities, but it is over 50 percent more than the per capita consumption in many other water-efficient cities.

What Can Singapore Do?

Water conservation practices will count, and a combination of economic instruments and attitudinal changes by developing conservation ethics can ensure more efficient use of water.

Singapore’s current targets are to reduce per capita water consumption to 147 liters by 2020 and 140 by 2030. This is too little, too late. The city-state should be much more ambitious.

Between 1960 and 1970, Singapore carried out a unique study on how much water an individual needed to lead a healthy life. It showed that when consumption went over 75 liters per day there were no health benefits for individuals. An average Singaporean now uses twice this amount. Given that many European cities have progressively reduced their daily water consumption to less than 100 liters, Singapore needs to consider a much lower target of around 110 liters per day by 2035, which is achievable. By 2035, based on our estimates, it is likely that the population in the most water-efficient cities will be using around 85 liters per day.

Finally, a mindset change is needed in terms of benchmarking good practices. Major technological breakthroughs often come from the developed world. However, many of the most significant policy breakthroughs are coming from the developing world. For example, the city of Jaipur in India informs people, in their regular water bills, of how much they are receiving in the form of public subsidies. For most Singaporeans, it may come as a surprise to know that they do not pay for all their water-related services through their water bills. For example, the government pays for all stormwater management services as public goods, which households in numerous cities pay directly through their water bills.

Given the strategic importance of water in Singapore, it is essential to engage the population in the formulation of future policies through a robust communication strategy with all the facts, figures and implications of possible decisions. This will ensure its water security for decades to come.

KINGSTON, Jamaica, Apr 24 2017 (IPS) - Keen to tap its natural resources as a way to boost its struggling economy, Guyana struck a multi-million-dollar deal with Norway in 2009.

Under the deal, Norway agreed to pay up to 250 million dollars over five years, if Guyana, a Caribbean Community (CARICOM) country in South America, maintained a low deforestation rate.

""It is a plant, it does photosynthesis, but it happens to be the fastest growing plant in the world so the absorption of CO2 by bamboo forests is quite significant.” --Dr. Hans Friederich



It was the first time a developed country, conscious of its own carbon-dioxide emissions, had paid a developing country to keep its trees in the ground.

The initiative was developed by the United Nations and called REDD+ (for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus conservation).

The main aim was to allow for carbon sequestration – the process involved in carbon capture and the long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

Trees are thirsty for the potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, soaking it up during photosynthesis and storing it in their roots, branches and leaves. Each year, forests around the world absorb nearly 40 percent of all the carbon dioxide produced globally from fossil-fuel emissions. But deforestation increases the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as trees are burned or start to decompose.

Most of the other Caribbean countries do not have the vast forests present in Guyana, but one expert believes there is still a huge potential to sequester carbon.

While the bamboo plant can be found in abundance in several Caribbean countries, the director of the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR), Dr. Hans Friederich, said its importance and the possible role it could play in dealing with climate change have been missed by many of these countries.

“Bamboo and rattan, to a lesser extent, have been in a way forgotten as mechanisms that can help countries both with mitigation of climate change and with adaptation. And I think, certainly for the Caribbean, for Jamaica, both aspects are important,” Friederich told IPS.

“Mitigation, because carbon is sequestered by bamboo. It is a plant, it does photosynthesis, but it happens to be the fastest growing plant in the world so the absorption of CO2 by bamboo forests is quite significant.”

“The stems are thin but, over a period of time, the total sink of CO2 from a bamboo forest is actually more than the average from other forests. We’ve tried this, we’ve tested this and we’ve measured this in China and that’s certainly the case over there,” he added.

As far as adaptation is concerned, Friederich said bamboo also has a key role to play.

“For example, helping local communities deal with the effects of climate change in relation to erosion control, in relation to providing income in times when maybe other sources of income are no longer there or have been affected through floods or droughts or other environmental catastrophes,” the INBAR official explained.

“So, bamboo really is something that should be included in the overall discussion about climate change mitigation and adaptation.”

INBAR has facilitated a trip to China for a group of Jamaicans, to show them how the Chinese are using bamboo as a source of energy, as a charcoal source – to replicate that intelligence and that experience in Jamaica and help the island develop a bamboo industry.

In 2014, the Jamaica Bureau of Standards announced the country would embark on the large-scale production of bamboo for the construction of low-cost houses and value-added products such as furniture and charcoal for the export market.

The bureau also facilitated training exercises for people to be employed in the industry, and announced plans to set up three bamboo factories across the island.

The agency said it would also offer incentives for people to grow, preserve and harvest the bamboo plant for its various uses.

The following year, the bureau and the Small Business Association of Jamaica (SBAJ) collaborated to establish the country’s first ever Bamboo Industry Association (BIA).

The BIA’s mandate is to engage and heighten awareness among owners of properties with bamboo, about the potential economic values to be derived from the plant, of which there are more than 65,000 hectares of growing across the island.

“We believe in changing the nation…so we are here to make an impactful difference in the lives of the average citizen of this country,” SBAJ President Hugh Johnson said.

It seems the importance of bamboo might be slowly catching on in the Caribbean and elsewhere.

“Does it connect? It depends really with whom. I think our members, we now have 41 states that are part of the network of Inbar – they recognize it. And more and more do we get requests to help countries think about ways that we can develop the industry,” Friederich said.

“But beyond the people that understand bamboo there is still a lot of awareness raising to be done . . . to make people understand the opportunities and the benefits.

“The nice thing about bamboo is that the start of the production chain, the start of the value chain is something that basically involves unskilled, poor people. So, it is really a way to address Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number one – poverty reduction and bringing people out of real bad conditions. Therefore, that is something that we are working our members to see how we can support local communities with activities that basically promote that,” he added.

INBAR is an intergovernmental organisation established in 1997 by treaty deposited with the United Nations and hosted in Beijing, China.

Friederich said reactions from the producing countries have been very positive.

“From the international community, equally, I think those working in forestry like the Food and Agriculture Organisation, they definitely see the opportunities,” he said.

“From the investment community, maybe less so.

The picturesque Ovid winery is Silver Oak's latest acquisition.

A $50 million Napa winery sale was negotiated around the kitchen table, W. Blake Gray reports.

What does it mean, when one of Napa Valley's most popular wineries buys one of its most exclusive?

It seems like an odd fit: Silver Oak, which makes 100,000 cases of wine annually, buying Ovid, which makes about 2000.

Silver Oak's wines are not cheap: its Napa Cabernet is $125; its Alexander Valley Cab is $75. But Ovid's wines are at another price level: about $300, if you can find them.

Silver Oak is consistently in the Top 10 of Wine & Spirits' Restaurant Poll as one of the most-ordered wines in America. I think it's fair to say that relatively few Americans, even among wine drinkers, have even heard of Ovid, which didn't release its first vintage (a 2005 wine) until 2009.

Before I go into a disquisition on the meaning of the $50 million sale of such a small luxury brand, it's worth noting that often a first-generation business is sold just because the founders want to sell.

""They were just ready to move on,"" Silver Oak president and CEO David Duncan told Wine-Searcher. ""They have their own reasons. This is a friendship thing, literally decided around the kitchen table. They were really looking for the next steward of the brand.""

And how much is $50 million in the California wine business, really?

Stagecoach Vineyard with 600 acres planted on Napa's Atlas Peak, sold to Gallo just last month for just $180 million. It's 40 times as big as Ovid yet fetched only 3.6 times as much money.

For further perspective: in 2015, Constellation paid $315 million for the Meiomi brand, with no vineyards whatsoever. Which would you rather have? All of Stagecoach Vineyard, all of Ovid's vineyard and Ovid's winery, and $85 million cash – or the brand name ""Meiomi""?

For the ordinary consumer, it might be a little comforting that Meiomi and its multiple wines under $20 is worth so much more than the vineyards and wineries that create $300 wines.

Silver Oak is somewhere in between. It's too expensive to be an everyday wine of the people, but it is a wine that middle-class drinkers have on special occasions. And Duncan said there is more crossover between Silver Oak's customers and Ovid's than you might think.

""I've received dozens and dozens and dozens of emails from longtime Silver Oak clients that are also Ovid clients,"" Duncan told Wine-Searcher. ""Just because you listen to the Rolling Stones doesn't mean you don't enjoy Beethoven or Mozart. I don't see them as completely different things.""

Ovid's value was built quickly. Owners Mark Nelson and Dana Johnson made their money by building and selling a medical software company. They took their earnings and, according to a Napa Register story by L. Pierce Carson in 2011, bought the Pritchard Hill property in 1999 just because it was beautiful and they wanted to live there.

When they tried their neighbors' wine, they decided they should make some of their own. They hired a Napa dream team, in the early years of when that became the thing to do: vineyard manager David Abreu, consulting winemaker Andy Erickson and architect Howard Backen for the winery. They didn't try to build the brand with purchased fruit, instead waiting until they had estate wine to sell, nearly 10 years after they bought the property.

Their time in the wine industry has thus been relatively short: less than eight years since they first starting selling wine. Of the 19 Ovid wines reviewed by the Wine Advocate, 11 have scores of 95 or better, topped by a 99 for the 2013 Ovid Red Blend Hexameter. Even in an era when 100-point scores are commonplace, that's still quite good.

Unlike Meiomi, which now comes in Chardonnay and Rosé flavors as well as the original Pinot Noir, I wouldn't expect Ovid to expand its production or range of wines. The appeal of Ovid for wine lovers is the Pritchard Hill site and the exclusivity.

""Our job is to keep Ovid Ovid,"" Duncan said. ""There's a customer base for that price point. That's also one of the greatest pieces of property in Napa. It's just a fabulous site to grow Bordeaux varietals.""

What you might see, if Duncan chooses, is Ovid in more places.

""Silver Oak is one of the few small-to-midsize brands with enough market clout the get a new brand into the three-tier distribution system if it chooses,"" said wine industry analyst Barbara Insel, president of Stonebridge Research. ""It adds to the private client market for Ovid. Silver Oak's following is quite remarkable. No matter how much the somms complain, they will all tell you that their lists have to include Silver Oak and Rombauer because a significant group of customers demand it.""

One of the things I have always loved about Silver Oak is that it makes no special reserve wines. Sadly few of the larger wineries in Napa and Sonoma County have this policy (hello, Jordan.) This means that all the best grapes go into the main Silver Oak label. They don't get enough credit for that.

Buying Ovid allows the Duncan family to have a special reserve level without touching the quality of their main wine, which is arguably the most popular expensive wine in America. They deserve credit for that too. Perhaps $50 million was a bargain.","Thu, 27 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/60/90/silver1-10006090.jpg,"['flexes', 'wine', 'oak', 'ovid', 'purchase', 'duncan', 'muscles', 'brand', 'winery', 'napa', 'silver', 'million', 'wines']",

The 24th anniversary of Thembisile Chris Hani’s murder was definitely among them. By RICHARD POPLAK.

In the East Rand’s industrial ass-end, where decades from now robots will wander through the remnants of South Africa’s degraded industrial economy, and where energy from Russian nuclear reactors will fizzle uselessly in the drought-swirled dust—a memorial service for a fallen comrade.

Twenty-four years ago, Chris Hani was murdered by Janusz Walu? and Clive Derby-Lewis, during another of those terminal events that was intended to push SA over the brink, but instead left us staring into an abyss that appears bottomless. Hani, the quintessential victim of swart gevaar/communist/racist paranoia, was an actual communist and an actual armed-resistance veteran, and if his speeches and writings are anything to go by, it’s unlikely that he’d have much good to say about the chaos capitalism that has arisen since he was assassinated.

Indeed, relations have become grim between the South African Communist Party and the industrial grade looting machine to which it has been allied for so many years. During the recent cabinet “reshuffle”, although members of the SACP for the most part emerged with their portfolios and salaries intact, they were unimpressed by how it all unfolded. Their deputy general secretary, the excessively genial Solly Mapaila, has been rather vocal in his demands for the president to step down. Meanwhile, the ANC has sort of rallied around Zuma, because what else are they going to do? Stand on principle? When you’re living inside the beast’s intestinal tract, it’s impossible to know whether the host you’re leaching from is dead or alive—until, of course, it’s too late.

Well, it is too late.

And so here we were, in another of the ANC’s nostalgia loops, another one of its reactionary celebrations of a stalwart who would likely find no place in, and indeed would not recognize, the organization celebrating his memory. To cover the ANC in 2017 is to become complicit in drafting their Trümmerliteratur—the genre of historical revisionism that scrutinizes the rubble of a movement or civilization that has caved in on itself. In this particular case, the ANC laments the purity of a liberation movement that has been destroyed by the politics of the belly—whose belly happens to depend on the faction one belongs to. “The once proud ANC,” and all that crap. Just a couple of tweaks, just get rid of the right/wrong people, and the khongolose is back in the game.

Well, no. “Every major social transformation leaves behind a fresh Eden that can serve as the object of somebody’s nostalgia,” writes the American political scientist Mark Lilla. “And the reactionaries of our time have discovered that nostalgia can be a powerful political motivator, perhaps even more powerful than hope. Hopes can be disappointed. Nostalgia is irrefutable.”

Which is exactly what has made the recent memorial orgy, despite the undeniable goodness of the men being memorialized, so utterly reprehensible. The Hani tent was full of fake communists, fake women’s leaders, fake religious types, along with the occasional real struggle vet—none of whom participate in the same narrative any longer. We’ve become so inured to this idiotic incoherence that it no longer registers as parody. But imagine you’d been dead for 24 years, and you lurched up from the Highveld loam into this madness, with Jacob Zuma—of all people—standing on the presidential podium, addressing a country in which the pittance earned from being bussed into political events likely registers as a decent portion of the GDP, and where the crowds sing “My president! My president!” in the praise of man unpicking the country from the inside out.

Anyway.

According to the presiding Reverend Maphatsoe, Zuma had asked that no one—no one, hear!—was to use this platform to extend the factional fighting. “Who are we to judge,” asked the pastor. “Because God judges.” Then, Zuma laid wreath. (He is still astonishingly spry when he bends down to attend to such matters.) Fikile “Razzmatazz” Mbalula laid a wreath. Solly Mapaila laid a wreath. Limpho Hani laid a wreath. Whether or not they felt awkward, I cannot say. But I certainly did. It felt like a shabbas dinner following a catastrophic and bitter divorce, during which the cook burns the tsimis. Zuma stared into the middle distance, at—what? What does a budding dictator in the middle of a coup think about during photo-ops, other than the fact that photo-ops will soon be a thing of the past?

He then took his seat, and listened to the early going, which was devoted to Ekurhuleni pimping itself as a “smart, connected, development city—the aerotropolis”, which is the sort of technocratic gobbledygook the ANC has always intoxicated itself with.

Limpho Hani then stood at the podium:

“At the moment we are loving at a time of extreme paranoia and factionalism,” she said. She told of going to a church service following the cabinet reshuffle, prayed for the country, and was promptly accused of being against Zuma. “I come from a church family, and God has never failed me,” she said. “Comrades, I do not belong to a faction. I belong to the ANC, and there is only one ANC. I will not respond to those who ask, What would Chris do? I do not know.”

Why did no one march after over a hundred poor black people were left to die during the Life Esidimeni tragedy, she wanted to know? What about the taxi gang rapes recently reported in Soweto? The answer, of course, is that almost no one cares about poor people or the victims of sexual violence—the latter having been normalized, I might add, by the man preparing to address the crowd. Such is the way of things in vicious, zero-sum societies. Then Hani thanked Zuma for helping her through troubled times with her daughter’s “cocaine addiction”.

“President, I have no words.”

Oh, and I think I failed to mention her big reveal: Zuma was the last ANC leader to see Hani alive, said his widow. Surprise, surprise, history books!

Do you see how pliantly the past crawls toward the powerful?

Then the King strode to the stage. His body language gave no indication that this was to be one of the signature speeches of his long political career. The rent-a-crowd sang. “Amandla,” he roared. And he began to tell a story that became a parable.

[Comrade Hani’s] killers wanted to plunge the country into civil war so as to prevent us from achieving a democracy in which government would be built by the majority will of the people. [He] demonstrated throughout his life and at the hour of his death that he lived for his people. He taught many young men and women within the ANC and the Alliance that personal suffering was the price to be paid in defence of the interests of the oppressed black people. In their actions, the killers of Chris Hani, sought to sow division amongst the people of South Africa so that they could protect minority interests. However, the leadership of President Nelson Mandela rose to the occasion and called on all of us not to allow minority interests and the actions of disruptors to shift our focus. President Mandela called on all of us to honour the sacrifice of Comrade Chris Hani by uniting and accelerating our advance towards democratic elections. Indeed, we used that sombre occasion as a platform to push harder for freedom and democracy and eventually held our first democratic election on 27 April 1994; on the principle of one person, one vote.

This—or a version of it—was now happening again. And why? Because, as Zuma noted earlier this year to his State of the Nation Address, the long arc of South African was bending toward radical socio-economic transformation, and “minority interests” were trying to halt its progress.

Zuma referred to the sanctity of the Constitution. (And it was only Monday). He quoted OR Tambo. He spoke about the black middle class he’d just screwed with a downgrade entirely engineered by him. He spoke about the black business his recently evacuated Treasury DG admitted the government used as “cashflow management”, another way of saying they don’t get paid. He spoke of the poor, “the majority of whom are black and female”—traditionally a huge concern of Zuma’s. He spoke about structural racism in the private sector, and other serious transformation issues that could not be ignored.

He’s right, of course. South Africa needs to change now, and not in some halcyon future. And he is the one that will change it. But, versions of Hani’s killers are once again on the loose, looking to derail the national democratic project. And it was in the final movements of the speech where the parable found its meaning:

We have sadly not yet succeeded in building the non-racial society that we envisaged. There is a resurgence of racism in our country. It is also clear that racists have become more emboldened. The marches that took place last week demonstrated that racism is real and exists in our country. Many placards and posters displayed beliefs that we thought had been buried in 1994, with some posters depicting black people as baboons. It is clear that some of our white compatriots regard black people as being lesser human beings or sub-human. The racist onslaught has become more direct and is no longer hidden as was the case in the early years of our constitutional democratic order. Racists no longer fear being caught or exposed. In the fight to combat racism, we should look beyond only overt racist utterances and public displays that we saw during the marches last week. We should also look at the ideological and institutional machinations that continue to give racism more traction. Racism is a gross violation of human rights and plunged this country into decades of conflict in the past. We cannot allow and assist racists to take our country backwards.

It was a beautiful, elegant, and supremely dangerous counter-attack, delivered with zero passion, as if he was reading the instructions to a Furby. Yes, racists marched. As did Sufis, Baha’i, ghosts, insufferable white liberals, insufferable black liberals, insufferable coloured liberals, and bespoke puppies. Freedumb of expression was on proud display. But baboon placards?

Come. On.

Solly Mapaila—no one’s idea of a upper-class Camp’s Bay anti-poor mass murderer, and who spoke with such fire at the Pretoria event—sat stone-faced, looking out at the crowd that would later boo him as he attempted to speak. Zuma was then whisked off into power’s bosom. Immediately thereafter, the heavens burped, and then emptied with deluge that can only be described as Biblical. This country is clearly some celestial screenwriter’s idea of a good time.

Is this what constitutes an honour in South Africa? To have your final resting place used as the opening salvo in a race war that will function as cover for robbing the country into eternal penury? As a means of answering that question, perhaps we should take a moment to bring up a little historical moment that both Zuma and his latest hagiographer, Limpho Hani, neglected to mention. In 2004 and 2005, Zuma took time out of his busy schedule to meet the architect of Hani’s assassination, Clive Derby-Lewis. No one is precisely sure as to why they engaged in some friendly facetime. Was Zuma going to collect smallanyana skeletons on his many enemies? Was Derby-Lewis trying to influence a spoiler in order to rustle up a presidential pardon? Was the future president trying to solicit a killer’s (very good) lawyers to represent him in his innumerable legal battles?

All good theories—but in final reckoning, it really doesn’t matter. What does matter is that the two men met, and that according to the extant pictures, their encounters were pleasant and recrimination-free. We mustn’t get too sentimental about politics. But we also can’t pretend away the past. In other words, the memorial was not the first time Zuma had used Hani’s assassination to further his own purpose.

So: this is the ANC, and this is the man who has captured it wholesale.

In the past 48 hours, Zuma and his minion henchmen have used the memorials of two legendary ANC stalwarts in order to further an agenda that neither man – that no one sane, really – would support. It doesn’t matter how many widows, comrades, friends or followers get churned up in the process – onward into the past!

South Africa’s past is monstrous; there is no fresh Eden to return to. If there is to be any hope, the country has to begin making the future instead of submitting to Zuma’s increasingly aggressive revisionism. “Nostalgia is irrefutable”, said the professor. And yet refute it we must, and loudly. DM

There's a lot to play for in AFC Cup as the big names take to the field on Tuesday and Wednesday...

Asia's secondary club competition is about to witness yet another vital round of matches in the South, Central, East and ASEAN Zones on Tuesday and Wednesday. While several groups will see matchday five, some are only in their third round of matches. As such, let's take a peek at what awaits us in the coming days.

GROUP D (CENTRAL ZONE)

Dordoi FC (KGZ) v Altyn Asyr (TKM): Kyrgyz Republic's Dordoi FC will have nothing but a win on their minds when they host Turkmenistan's Altyn Asyr on Tuesday in Bishkek. Dordoi will be pumped up after defeating FC Alay 1-0 in the previous round, which has propelled them to three points, one below joint-leaders Istiklol and Altyn Asyr. As such a win could see them stake claim to progress from this round.

Altyn Asyr might be the fancied side in this tie but after a listless draw against FC Istiklol in the previous round, they have to get going from the outset. A win will be the bare minimum they will want too.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

AFC Cup: West Zone preview

FC Istiklol (TJK) v FC Alay (KGZ): Tajikistan's FC Istiklol host bottom-placed side FC Alay on Tuesday, looking to surge clear at the top of the table. Though Istiklol played out a 1-1 draw against Altyn Asyr in the last round, the 2015 runners-up are the favourites to gain all three points against a struggling FC Alay who are yet to notch a point in the tournament.

There are some scares for the teams with Istiklol without the suspended Romish Dzhalilov while FC Alay do not have the services of Murolimzhon Akhmedov for the same reason. Will FC Alay pull off a surprise? We'll have to wait and watch.

Venue: Dolen Omurzakov Stadium, Bishkek

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+6

GROUP E (SOUTH ZONE)

Bengaluru FC (IND) v Abahani Limited Dhaka (BAN): Last year's runners-up Bengaluru FC have the perfect opportunity to extend their lead atop Group E when they host Bangladesh's Abahani Limited Dhaka on Tuesday. After downing Mohun Bagan in the opening round, they had to rely on an injury-time goal to overcome Maziya S&RC in Maldives in the previous round. They had a good outing domestically as well over the weekend and will be buoyed as a result as they take on Abahani.

The Bangladeshi team, however, are without a point after two back-to-back defeats in the tournament. They could fall well beyond having any realistic chances of progression if they lose against Bengaluru.

Venue: Sree Kanteerava Stadium, Bangalore

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+5:30

Know Bengaluru's Rivals: Abahani Ltd

Mohun Bagan (IND) v Maziya Sports & Recreation (MDV): Mohun Bagan host Maziya S&RC in Kolkata on Tuesday in a crucial Group E encounter. Both teams have a win in their kitty and have three points each. As a result, an adverse result or a draw could see them fall off the pace with Bengaluru poised to move further forward, barring an upset against Abahani.

Mohun Bagan have been winning games domestically without playing at their best and are chasing the I-League title. As such, their attention could be towards the domestic league which is something Maziya will look to exploit. This should be a tight game.

Venue: Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, Kolkata

Kick-off: April 18, 19:00 UTC+5:30

GROUP F (ASEAN ZONE)

Magwe (MYA) v Global FC (PHI): Philippine side Global FC stormed to the top of the table in the last round with a victory over Johor Darul Ta'zim and now they are in a position where they can be assured of a top-two finish with a point against Myanmar's Global FC who are placed bottom in the group. Global FC have nine points from four games and have been quietly impressive in the group so far. A win will put them in pole position to secure a win with just one more game remaining.

Magwe, meanwhile, will know that anything less than a win will see them crash out of the tournament. With just two draws so far in their kitty, they are not expected to put up much fight on Wednesday.

Venue: Youth Training Centre, Yangon

Kick-off: April 19, 15:30 UTC+6:30

Beoungket Angkor (CAM) v Johor Darul Ta’zim (MAS): Johor Darul Ta'zim will be desperate to get back to winning ways when they travel to Cambodia to take on Beoungket Angkor FC on Wednesday. Having been outsmarted by Global FC in the previous round, Johor need to win this tie. A Johor loss coupled with a win for Global would see the Philippine side win the group. Johor have been really inconsistent in the tournament so far and need to step up.

The Cambodians have four points from four fixtures and a surprise win against JDT will see them draw level with the Malaysian side but a loss will see them crash out. Anything can happen but for this game, JDT are the favourites.

Venue: National Olympic Stadium, Phnom Penh

Kick-off: April 19, 18:00 UTC+7

GROUP G (ASEAN ZONE)

Ceres Negros (PHI) v Hanoi FC (VIE): Group G is extremely compact at the top with just three points separating the top three teams. As such, surprise leaders Hanoi FC, who have eight points, will be looking to pull clear when they face Philippine side Ceres Negros who were defeated 3-0 by Felda United in the previous round. Hanoi can guarantee themselves the top spot with a win and a little help from Tampines Rovers against Felda United.

Ceres Negros will welcome back Manuel Ott from suspension but are without Martin Steuble as they look to mastermind a victory that will take them level on points with Hanoi. This round will be extremely important for the final outcome in the group.

Venue: Pana-ad Park and Football Stadium, Bacolod City

Kick-off: April 19, 19:30 UTC+8

Felda United (MAS) v Tampines Rovers (SIN): A rejuvenated Felda United are up against a struggling Tampines Rovers on Wednesday as they look to make up ground on group leaders Hanoi FC. Felda had just two points after the initial three rounds but a morale-boosting 3-0 win over Ceres Negros has put them back in the reckoning for progression from the group. But they need a positive result in this game.

Singapore's Tampines Rovers have just the three points to show for their efforts so far and were crippled by back-to-back defeats inflicted on them by Hanoi FC. Felda are the favourites on form but Tampines Rovers cannot be written off yet.

Venue: Tun Abdul Razak Stadium, Jengka

Kick-off: April 19, 20:45 UTC+8

GROUP H (ASEAN ZONE)

Home United (SIN) v Yadanarbon (MYA): Singapore's Home United are in pole position to win the three-team Group I, provided they defeat Myanmar's Yadanarbon on Tuesday. Having registered back-to-back wins over Than Quang Ninh after an opening round defeat to Yadanarbon, Home United sit atop the group with six points from three games while Yadanarbon have four points from two games.

The away team badly need a draw or a win even though they have another game against Than Quang Ninh and will draw inspiration from their opening game victory against the side from Singapore.

Venue: Jalan Besar Stadium, Singapore

Kick-off: April 18, 19:30, UTC+8

Fans' Asian Player of the week

GROUP I (EAST ZONE)

4.25 SC (PRK) v Kigwancha SC (PRK): It's a Pyongyang derby for the first time in the AFC Cup as 4.25 SC host Kigwancha SC in Group I on Tuesday. Having played a game each, both against Mongolian side Erchim FC, the two teams are joint top of the three-team group with a win each. 4.25 SC had the most sparkling of the wins - a 6-0 spanking at home with Kim Yu-song scoring an astounding five goals.

Kigwancha SC, on the other hand, hammered Erchim 3-0 away. As such, this game could very well have a big say in deciding the Group I winners. These two teams should unleash be a fascinating spectacle in Pyongyang.

Milan, Inter & Serie A all winners after dramatic derby draw at spectacular San Siro

The two sides were scrapping for sixth place in Serie A but the pair's performances suggested both have bright futures under their new owners

COMMENT

A sold-out San Siro, an estimated television audience of 862 million, two talented teams playing at full pelt and a fittingly dramatic finish - the first ever 'Chinese Derby' was, in every sense, a spectacular success.

The game was drawn but, to the neutral, this looked like a victory for both sides - and, perhaps more importantly, Italian football as a whole. It has been too long since one of the most prestigious fixtures in football could be called a major event and this was, lest we forget, a San Siro showdown between two sides scrapping for sixth place in Serie A.

Milan earn dramatic derby draw with Inter

However, Milan's fans celebrated Cristian Zapata's 96th-minute equaliser like they had won an eighth European Cup, while their Inter counterparts were left disconsolate. This mattered to them. More importantly, it felt like it finally mattered again to football fans across the globe.

It might not look like it right now for the Nerazzurri but this was the kind of match that these two clubs needed. The world was watching, intrigued by the prospect by these old rivals being reinvigorated by new money, and the pair produced an exhilarating spectacle, from start to finish.

Indeed, both sets of players seemed determined to put on a show worthy of the incredible coreografie that had preceded the kick-off.

The Curva Sud had channelled the spirit of Robin Hood, declaring, ""For us bandits, you are unwelcome guests."" It was Inter, though, who looked more like canny thieves, with the 'hosts' nicking a goal against the run of play in the 36th minute.

Mattia De Sciglio may have been to blame for losing the flight of the ball but there was so much to admire in the way in which Roberto Gagliardini picked out the run of Antonio Candreva with a lofted, 40-metre pass from halfway - while the winger's hooked finish over the advancing Gigio Donnarumma wasn't too shabby either.

The goal understandably rocked the Rossoneri, who had earlier struck the woodwork through the electric Gerard Deulofeu, and Inter took full advantage, doubling their advantage with another splendidly-worked strike.

Mauro Icardi had come into the derby without a goal in his previous three Serie A outings but he ended his mini-drought in fine style, chesting Ivan Perisic's pass back into the winger's path before then racing into the area to side-foot home the resulting cross.

Ronaldo reps slam 'disgusting' rape claim

The two combined wonderfully well all afternoon and really should have produced another goal 10 minutes into the second half when Icardi found Perisic with a perfectly-weighted ball across the Milan box only for the Croatian to shoot tamely at Donnarumma.

It proved a pivotal moment in an enthralling contest as Milan - inspired by Deulofeu, the game's outstanding player - never stopped attacking and deservedly halved their deficit when Alessio Romagnoli impressively stabbed home a Suso cross with just seven minutes remaining to set up the grandstand finish that the game, and indeed the occasion, merited.

The Rossoneri looked to have run out of time as the clock ticked past the allotted five minutes of injury time but they were afforded one last corner by referee Daniele Orsato. Incredibly, they made it count, with Manuel Locatelli flicking Deulofeu's corner into the path of Zapata, who drove the ball over the line - via the cross bar - despite the best efforts of Gary Medel.

BVB considered pulling out of CL

Milan were as joyous as Inter were crestfallen but both sides should take a huge amount of encouragement out of a high-quality encounter. Vincenzo Montella's Milan are only going to get better - particularly with the addition of some quality, experienced signings this summer. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that, over the course of the game, they fielded eight players aged 24 or under.

The Derby also underlined the massive improvement in Inter's fortunes since Stefano Pioli replaced the disastrous Frank de Boer at the helm. This makes it four games without a win for the Nerazzurri, with Icardi admitting just after the full-time whistle that he and his team-mates were ""sickened"" by the result.

However, at times, they again looked like the coming force they appeared to be in matching Juventus in the Derby d'Italia earlier this year and the big-name players that they are presently being linked with suggests that they, too, have a bright future ahead of them.

Zapata enthused afterwards, ""It was a very intense derby, both teams played well and in the end the draw was a fair result. We’re on the right track.""

He may as well have been speaking for both sides. Yonghong Li had claimed beforehand that Milan's new owners, just like the Suning Group, are primarily focused taking small steps on the road to recovery. However, just making the Derby a major event again felt like a pretty big one - for everyone involved.","Sat, 15 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['inter', 'derby', 'sides', 'winners', 'san', 'run', 'draw', 'milan', 'fireworks', 'goal', 'looked', 'serie', 'dramatic', 'spectacular', 'siro', 'players']",

67,67,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,What Pick n Pay's results tell us about retail in sub-Saharan Africa - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/pick-n-pays-results-tell-us-retail-sub-saharan-africa/58320/,"South African supermarket chain Pick n Pay this week released its financial results for the year ending 26 February 2017. Headline earnings per share rose 18%, while turnover growth of 7% reflects the tough consumer environment in South Africa, Pick n Pay’s largest market. Outside South Africa, the retailer has stores in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe .

How we made it in Africa’s Justin Probyn looks at what Pick n Pay’s results and associated commentary tell us about the state of retail in sub-Saharan Africa.

1. Online retail gaining traction

Online retail in South Africa seems to be gaining traction. Pick n Pay’s e-commerce turnover in the Western Cape province grew 30% year-on-year, driven by the success of a dedicated online picking warehouse situated close to Cape Town. As a result of the performance of this warehouse, the group opened a second one outside Johannesburg at the end of 2016.

Despite low profit margins in online retail, the group still views it as a growth engine. “Customers definitely like it, and you definitely have to be in it,” said CEO Richard Brasher. “You can’t ignore the future, so you better be involved in it.”

2. Strained consumers seek value

South African customers across all socio-economic groups are seeking lower prices and better value for their money. The South African economy grew by only 0.3% last year, and the rand came under significant pressure. Consumers had less money for more expensive products.

Last month Pick n Pay announced a R500m (US$38m) investment to lower prices, starting with reductions across 1,300 grocery lines, with a particular focus on fresh meat, fruit and vegetables.

“Customers are more price sensitive and are shopping more frequently for smaller baskets,” said the group’s CFO Bakar Jakoet.

3. Shoppers want convenience

The group currently has 111 Pick n Pay Express stores – double what it had two years ago. The rapid growth of these outlets, in tandem with the rising number of smaller-format Pick n Pay Local stores, suggests consumers want to shop smaller trolley sizes, more frequently and from convenient locations.

The group believes the future of convenience shopping is not only selling snacks, but also fresh foods and produce in small stores that are close to where people live.

4. Nigeria remains on the radar

Nigeria has proved to be a difficult market for some South African retailers. In 2013 Woolworths said it would close its stores in the country, blaming high rental costs, duties and supply chain challenges. Last year fashion chain Truworths also pulled out due to difficult regulations and problems getting money out of the country. Nigeria has been hard hit by the fall in the oil price, with the economy contracting by an estimated 1.75% in 2016. But despite these difficulties, Pick n Pay still sees opportunities in the west African country, with its first Nigerian store expected to open over the next two years.

5. Money to be made in Zimbabwe, despite tough economy

Pick n Pay’s associate in Zimbabwe, TM Supermarkets (TM), delivered strong performance, despite a tough macroeconomic environment, characterised by liquidity constraints, rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence. Its share of TM’s earnings grew 74.7% to R80.2m (about $6.1m), representing growth in local currency terms of 71.8%. TM has 56 stores in Zimbabwe, 16 of which trade under the Pick n Pay banner.

“We use Zimbabwe as a testament to the fact that whatever the headwinds, you can improve a business for customers,” Brasher said.

6. Zambia holds long-term opportunities

In Zambia economic performance was impacted by drought and related water and power outages, as well as a low copper price. This in turn dampened retail activity. However, notwithstanding current economic headwinds the country faces, the group remains positive of its long-term opportunity. Pick n Pay opened six new stores this year as part of its ongoing investment in Zambia, bringing the total up to 17 stores in-country as of February 2017.","Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pick-n-pay-express200x240.jpg,"['africa', 'stores', 'pick', 'group', 'pay', 'african', 'tell', 'pays', 'south', 'zambia', 'zimbabwe', 'subsaharan', 'n', 'results', 'retail']", 
68,68,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,"As tensions rise with Russia, U.S. colleges still pay for Snowden speeches - Yahoo Finance",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snowden-paid-speeches-colleges-amid-russia-tensions-103054930.html,"A poster for the Ohio State University event.

Last November, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden was beamed in from somewhere in Russia to address a crowd of Ohio State University students.

“Democracy only works for all of us when we all work to uphold the system,” Snowden, appearing on a giant video screen, told the sold-out crowd of about 1,700. “The letters of the constitution are not going to jump off the page and protect your rights. People give those letters strength.”

The university paid $30,000 through an American speakers’ bureau to digitally host Snowden, one of his largest known contracts to date, according to documents obtained by Yahoo Finance. The Ohio State event was one of a series of speeches that have netted Snowden — who is still a fugitive in the eyes of the U.S. government — well over $200,000 in the past two years, as Yahoo News first reported last year. He has continued to give paid speeches, including at U.S. colleges, in 2017.

The ongoing speaking contracts come at a time when Snowden’s fate and influence are more uncertain than ever. A campaign by Snowden’s supporters to win him a pardon was rebuffed by the outgoing Obama White House, and new President Donald Trump previously labeled him a “terrible traitor.”

Moreover, Snowden’s efforts to present himself as an Internet privacy pioneer are now complicated by an American political environment colored by increasing wariness and hostility toward Snowden’s host since June 2013: Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The July 31, 2013, document granting Snowden asylum in Russia for one year.

‘It definitely looks bad’

In January, U.S. intelligence agencies publicly asserted that the Kremlin executed an elaborate influence campaign aimed at hurting the candidacy of Putin foe Hillary Clinton and boosting the candidacy of Putin admirer Donald Trump. (U.S. agencies are also investigating contacts between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials.)

“There is no question that there has been a dramatic shift in the surveillance debate in the U.S. since the Russian hacking of the 2016 presidential election,” Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University, told Yahoo Finance in an email.

Story continues

EPIC is currently attempting to compel the office of the director of national intelligence to release its complete assessment on Russia’s election interference. Rotenberg noted that the debate ignited by Snowden’s advocacy has given way to considerations of Russian meddling.

“Snowden raised important questions about the scope of U.S. government surveillance,” Rotenberg said. “And his efforts led to reforms, including passage of the Freedom Act. And he continues to make good arguments for legal control of surveillance authority. But now the focus is on understanding and preventing cyberattacks on democratic institutions. Without democratic institutions, it is not possible to enforce the rule of law.”

Snowden’s speaking events highlight his peculiar situation as a 33-year-old former U.S. intelligence contractor being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking contracts — some from public American colleges — while living under guard at an undisclosed location in the territory of a resurgent adversary.

“It definitely looks bad that he’s over there in Russia,” Chris Weber, a cybersecurity expert who co-authored the 2002 book Privacy Defended and supports more transparency about government surveillance, told Yahoo Finance. “It could be damaging to privacy advocates and to all of the progress that has been made since his original revelations, because he is still in Russia and there’s a lot of tension.”

Weber, who has been writing about U.S. government surveillance since before the 2001 passage of the Patriot Act, which expanded the government’s authority to conduct the kind of surveillance Snowden exposed, noted that it’s reasonable to wonder whether Snowden could be manipulated as part of a larger game.

“He turned the lens around for a brief period so that we could look in the mirror,” Weber said. “Now that lens has been turned back around,” Weber added, noting that Snowden’s mysterious living situation “kind of invalidates things for a lot of people.”

‘Foreign interference is a common thing’

Snowden, for his part, has given mixed messages about his view of political tensions between Moscow and Washington.

He has sometimes been publicly critical of the Kremlin’s invasions of Internet privacy and its crackdowns on dissidents through tweets sent out to more than 3 million Twitter followers. Snowden and his supporters contend that these comments show he is not a Russian tool, as some critics claim.

But he has also downplayed Russia’s election meddling, taking a “so-what-if-they-did” attitude toward the Russian activities.

“All countries are doing this,” Snowden told the CeBIT technology conference in Germany on March 21. “The Russians are interfering in our elections. The Chinese are interfering in our elections. The Germans are interfering in our elections! In a very light, very polite way in their case. … Foreign interference is a common thing.”

Snowden later asked: “If elections have been interfered with throughout history, why did it actually matter this time?”

Snowden’s CeBIT talk also included praise of WikiLeaks, which published emails during the US presidential campaign that were stolen by Russian hackers and published CIA hacking tools in early March 2017. Russian state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik used Snowden’s comments to argue that the U.S. lacked evidence of Russian election tampering and to promote WikiLeaks’ actions.

Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating the Russian activities connected to the election, called them an “assault on our democratic institutions.” The House intelligence committee released an unclassified report on Snowden in December that called him “a serial exaggerator and fabricator” and alleged: “Since Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, he has had, and continues to have, contact with Russian intelligence services.”

,/p>

On March 22, Snowden signaled support for claims by the Trump White House that incidental collection of Trump transition staffers’ communications amounted to spying by the U.S. government under former President Barack Obama. Ironically, one of Snowden’s tweets on the subject was retweeted by Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer.

Trump's personal lawyer retweets Snowden.

‘Compelled to support his livelihood’

Ohio State University paid Gotham Artists $30,000 to host Snowden via video chat for 90 minutes on Nov. 30, 2016. Emails obtained by Yahoo Finance do not show exactly how the event came about.

The Ohio Union Activities Board “brainstorms ideas and receives suggested speakers, events and activities from a number of agencies that they work with regularly,” Ohio State Public Relations Director Benjamin Johnson told Yahoo Finance. “Our students became interested in Snowden in connection with the movie starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt.”

The money came from the student activity fee, a fund that charges $37.50 each semester to all undergraduate, graduate and professional students enrolled at Ohio State’s Columbus campus. At least one Ohio State student disagreed with the arrangement.

“What bothers me the most is having no choice but to be put in the unethical position of paying someone with … criminal charges pending against him,” fourth-year student Robin Smith wrote in a letter to the school paper. “OSU students, whether you agree or disagree with Snowden’s actions, we all have been compelled to support his livelihood.”

On June 14, 2013, Snowden was charged in a Justice Department criminal complaint with theft of government property and two violations of the U.S. Espionage Act for disclosing classified communications. Thus far, the U.S. has chosen to refrain from targeting his financial livelihood through actions such as sanctions by the U.S. Treasury, executive orders, or specific law enforcement mechanisms.

“It appears that so far the U.S. government’s approach has been one of diplomacy and a focus on extradition as opposed to traditional legal weapons that might be used against criminals in other cases,” Jonathan Schanzer, a former U.S. Treasury analyst and current vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Yahoo Finance.

‘Social engineering the next generation’

Snowden began speaking at U.S. colleges with a video chat at Harvard in January 2015. Promotional material from Open Mic Productions, an events production company that promotes Snowden speeches exclusively on YouTube and Twitter, touts the positive receptions he has received on college campuses.

“At campuses across North America, including Harvard, University of Chicago, McGill, University of Arizona, Columbia, University of Iowa, Stanford and others, he has received rave reviews and standing ovations,” the brochure states.

Snowden is the only speaker that Open Mic Productions lists as a client.

A person close to Snowden previously told Yahoo News last year that the American made more than $200,000 between September 2015 and August 2016 through digital appearances organized by the American Program Bureau. Three contracts during that time were signed with public U.S. colleges — the universities of Iowa, Colorado, and Arizona — totaling $79,000.

“There is nothing remotely improper about Edward Snowden making a living by speaking to global audiences about surveillance and democracy,” Snowden’s primary US lawyer Ben Wizner, who coordinates the appearances, told Yahoo last fall.

Jeremiah Talamantes, president of the cybersecurity company RedTeam Security, sees a clear strategy in Snowden speaking to colleges (beyond the lucrative contracts).

“There’s a reason he’s speaking at universities,” Talamantes told Yahoo Finance. “It’s almost as if … he’s social engineering the next generation.”

Talamantes, an expert on social engineering to target specific people with influence operations, said American students are an ideal audience for Snowden.

“Who are you targeting? … He’s talking to these very impressionable folks,” Talamantes said. “If I were to inspire a movement, the first place I would go to is universities and start from the grassroots. It’s pretty clear to me in terms of what he’s trying to do.”

So far in 2017, Snowden has spoken to three colleges — the University of Waterloo in Canada, the University of Pittsburgh, and Middlebury College in Vermont — in addition to addressing several tech conferences. Amid the geopolitical tensions, Snowden’s statements about U.S. surveillance are especially provocative to Washington.

“These programs were never about terrorism,” Snowden told Middlebury students on March 16, repeating a line he first used in December 2013, referring to the mass surveillance programs he exposed. “They are about economic espionage, diplomatic manipulation and social control. We should never permit them to say they are saving our lives if they can’t show evidence that they are.”

The University of Pittsburgh paid an unspecified amount to host Snowden, emphasizing that payment was “provided to the agency representing Snowden rather than directly to the speaker.” The Middlebury Student Government Association, which invited Snowden, told Yahoo Finance that the organization is “obligated by contract [to] not share any information about our agreement with Mr. Snowden.”

OPINION: Football is being dragged inch by inch into the 21st century.

For decades, football, led by dinosaurs like Sepp Blatter, has resisted the use of technology. Other sports used it, the world used it, but not football.

No no, football didn't need technology. It's such a great game, its esteemed leaders feel, it can exist in a timewarp, immune to the advances made in every other aspect of life.

GETTY IMAGES Frank Lampard scores his team's second goal against Germany at the 2010 World Cup, only for it to be incorrectly disallowed.

Blatter kept telling us that not only are refereeing mistakes part of the game, they are – and he really believed this – GOOD. They give us something to talk about. If TV replays were used to clear up every close call, what on earth would the fans talk about? Blatter perhaps forgot that there's been a fair amount of discussion about, for instance, World War Two, but that is generally regarded as not so good.

* Arsenal end long EPL drought away from home

* Man United beat Chelsea 2-0 to open up EPL race

* Tottenham win again, keep EPL title race alive

But then Blatter contradicted himself. I was at the Germany- England game at the 2010 World Cup, down in the cheap seats below Emperor Blatter and his fat cat buddies spilling over the sides of the best seats in the house.

Fans found it hard to know what to look at. The game, Blatter, or the German players' wives and girlfriends who were sitting in a section up to our left. But when Frank Lampard launched a shot that hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced down way beyond the goal line, and out again, and the officials said No Goal, all eyes turned to the odious Swiss as he did his best to look Not Guilty.

His negligence had cost England that goal, a goal which would have made it 2-2. Who knows how the match, which ended 4-1 to Germany, would have panned out had the goal stood?

Afterwards, Blatter (who, remember, had been in favour of referring blunders) changed his tune. He said ""Perhaps now iss ze time to reconsider technology in ze instance of if it's a goal, if it's not a goal.""

That's how we ended up with computer chips in the ball and gamma rays on the goal line.

Now with that particular dinosaur sinking into the quicksand of his own making, the tectonic plates are sliding a little more.

Various leagues and competitions, including the A League, are trying out new innovations to improve the game and help the refs, whose job, which had always been difficult, has in recent years been made impossible by the increased speed of the game and the increased determination of the players to deceive him.

How absurd that all these years, with cameras on hand which would let the referee make the correct decision within moments, the referee has been denied use of them?

I was also at the Brazil-Ghana at the 2006 World Cup, when Brazil scored a goal from an offside position. Replays of controversial incidents were not shown on the stadium screens normally, but somehow this one slipped through the system, and the Ghana players could see that the scorer, Adriano, was offside. They pleaded with the referee to look at the proof. He refused. The referee's decision is final. Even when he's wrong. Even when he knows it.

Two weeks ago a Leicester player fouled an Atletico player outside the box in a Champions League match. As refs have done since time began, this one incorrectly gave a penalty. Atletico scored. A moment of incompetence potentially costing Leicester millions of pounds.

Wrongs like this need to be righted, and anything that allows referees do so is good. The argument that football is a flowing game, that TV replays will slow it down, is invalid. Modern football seldom flows, it's a game of stoppages made difficult to watch because the players are constantly trying to get the game stopped, with their fouling and diving. The stoppages are frequently extended by over a minute as the players bicker with the ref, his assistants and each other every time an important call is made.

But players have stopped arguing about goal line decisions because they know the technology has made the right call, and that's sped the game up.

Video assistance with fouls will have the same effect.","Sun, 23 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/i/n/l/c/8/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1inl9j.png/1492871385769.jpg,"['fouls', 'football', 'look', 'players', 'bill', 'video', 'world', 'replays', 'assistance', 'harris', 'referee', 'used', 'technology', 'goal', 'blatter', 'needs', 'game']",

Winemakers Jeffrey Stambor (center) and Trevor Durling see double as they taste the Rarity.

Tireless adventurer W. Blake Gray tries some new things in the morning – and likes one of them.

I had a $1000 bottle of wine for breakfast. I'm going to tell you all about the wine: how it was made, what it tastes like, and why it worries me about Napa Valley's most iconic wine. But I want to linger on that image for a moment: omelets and a $1000 bottle of wine.

The wine has the most basic name possible for a $1000 Napa Cab: ""Rarity"". It's as if a brothel were named ""Sex"": the name tells you exactly what you're overpaying for.

How did I end up having it at breakfast? I was invited by Treasury Wine Estates to come to a hotel room to pay homage to the $1000 wine in a one-on-one tasting with the winemakers. The hotel's location was inconvenient; I didn't want to go. But the wine sounded so mockable: a $1000 wine called ""Rarity"", of which 1500 magnums were made (thus making it more like a brothel named ""Love"".) I had a big problem: I wanted to taste it and make fun of it, but I didn't feel like schlepping across town. I am that lazy.

So I asked if there was any way the winemakers could meet me in my neighborhood. They could! They set up a breakfast tasting at a restaurant I had never visited whose signature breakfast item is called ""millionaire's bacon"" ($9 for two slices).

I saw the check after breakfast: Treasury paid more than $250 for two winemakers, myself, and two PR people. For breakfast. Though to be fair, that did include corkage. I guess when you're tasting a $1000 magnum, it's appropriate.

The wine, full name Beaulieu Vineyard ""Rarity"" Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2013, is a special selection of 10 barrels that had been harvested and vinified to go into Beaulieu's Georges de Latour Private Reserve. That wine is the gem of Beaulieu's portfolio, and along with Penfolds Grange, could be a star of the whole 70-plus-brand Treasury portfolio.

But it's an important wine from a prior generation. After Prohibition, Georges de Latour Private Reserve was the first premium wine made in Napa Valley, selling for the unheard-of price of $1.50 in 1940. Before Robert Mondavi opened his winery in 1966, if you wanted to taste the best wine Napa Valley could make, it was either Inglenook or Beaulieu's Georges de Latour Private Reserve.

However, the wine lost its luster in the 1980s as a succession of corporate owners ramped up production and pinched pennies on equipment. Longtime winemaker Joel Aiken eventually managed to convince then-owners Diageo to take the flagship wine more seriously, but by then Napa Valley had moved on to a different model of expensive wine based not on legacy, but on, wait for it ... rarity.

Flash forward to 2013. Beaulieu winemaker Jeffrey Stambor, who has been at the company since 1989, calls 2013 one of the best vintages he remembers in Napa. California's five-year drought was in its early stages and, in 2013, it provided just the right amount of stress for the vines. A mild winter led to an early start to the growing season and an early harvest. Stambor was already fermenting many of the grapes for the Georges de Latour Private Reserve in barrels instead of tanks, meaning he had many small lots to blend together.

""As we got through tasting the lots in barrel, we put together a few A++ blends,"" Stambor told me over his breakfast of Millionaire's Benedict ($17). ""One of those sub-blends just showed unbelievable concentration and intensity. There had always been a hesitation to produce anything above the Georges de Latour. That's the flagship of the winery.""

The Rarity has comfotably assumed its place in the pantheon of Beaulieu Vineyard's wines.

But maybe Stambor knew which way the wind was blowing. In 2015, Diageo sold its wine properties, including Beaulieu Vineyard, to Treasury Wine Estates. Treasury is a big public corporation, but it's different from Diageo in a crucial way. Diageo is a spirits company that owned some wineries. Treasury is a wine company. Wine companies understand modern wine marketing and Treasury, which has owned Beringer since 2000, is no stranger to Napa Valley. Even if the name ""Rarity"" is a blunt instrument, it's the key if you want to sell a bottle of wine for $1000 instead of $100 – and why wouldn't you? That's $900 extra profit.

""I went ahead and bottled one of those sublots,"" Stambor said. The group of barrels included one of Petit Verdot that had been fermented separately; Georges de Latour Cabernet often includes small percentages of the other Bordeaux varieties.

The true meaning of Rarity might be not the size of production: 1500 bottles, all magnums, isn't that rare. In fact, you can buy it right now fairly easily; try that with Screaming Eagle Sauvignon Blanc. No, the true meaning of ""rarity"" is the frequency. Stambor said Beaulieu has made four special bottlings in its entire post-Prohibition history; the most recent was in 1990. All four were field blends of varieties like Petite Sirah, Charbono, Alicante Bouschet and Valdiguie. None were Cabernet-based. He also said that he currently has no more Rarity in the production pipeline.

""The danger is in calling out something as special when it really isn't,"" Stambor said. ""I think there's potential in 2016, but we'll have to wait and see.""

In fact, that won't be Stambor's decision. He is leaving the winery in June after 28 years and has not yet decided on his next winemaking post, only that ""you need a new challenge once in a while"". His replacement, Trevor Durling, also came to breakfast. Durling had been winemaker at Provenance Vineyards, another property recently sold by Diageo to Treasury, and thus has worked together with Stambor with some of the same vineyard sources for a decade. Durling also was delighted to sample some millionaire's bacon, which made me understand why the winemakers were willing to accommodate my request to meet across town. Expense account!

Now, I like Stambor, having interviewed him before, and I like breakfast, but I honestly did not expect to like this wine. It just sounded so cheesy: a wine called ""Rarity,"" which is not a single-vineyard wine, and in the original PR outreach email it wasn't even noted that it was Cabernet. It sounded like a marketing pitch I got the same week from a Swedish guy who claims to be making the world's best rosé, but opted not to let me taste it because Wine-Searcher isn't Hollywood enough. I thought I would go, sip and spit the Rarity but not drink any, have an $18 breakfast entree, and come home and make fun of the whole experience. (Each bottle comes in a thick case heavier than a microwave oven lined with what the PR person told me is a ""leather-like substance."")

The twist is that I ended up loving the wine and drinking a glass and a half of it before 11 am, so I can no longer claim to be a guy who never drinks Cabernet before noon. And I hated my $18 breakfast entree; I left it barely touched. So I had $1000 wine for breakfast, and yet came home to make fun of the whole experience because that's what I do.

Rarity is – no joke – terrific. It's fresh and lively, two words I don't lead with often enough when writing about Napa Cabernet, but it's also intense and full-flavored with dark fruit and long. The sappy tannins give it an interesting mouthfeel: they're not rough on the palate, instead giving a muscular yet brief impression like an octopus grabbing your arm and letting go. It's 15.5 percent alcohol but it's not heavy at all, and, especially because I was hungry and my $18 breakfast was lousy, I reached for the decanter to pour myself more of it, which I hardly ever do at tastings. And I didn't spit after the first tasting-notes tastes. It's yummy. Maybe ""Rarity"" actually is ""Love"".

The downside is – and it pains me to say this – the 2013 Georges de Latour Private Reserve wasn't as delicious as I'm accustomed to. It's fine, but the tannins need time to open and it doesn't have the lively freshness of Rarity. I had to ask if it would be better with the 12 barrels of Rarity added to it.

""I don't think so,"" Stambor said. ""It takes out 250 cases of premium wine. The impact of producing this wine is greater than the loss to the Georges de Latour.""

Mathematics note: Stambor made 6500 cases of Georges de Latour in 2013 (down from 17,000 at its worst, excessive, corporate peak.) I'm sure that even without the Rarity barrels, it's better than the worst years. The barrels that made up Rarity would have been less than four percent of Georges de Latour. This is the way Napa Cabernets are made and sold now. Treasury has taken Beaulieu Vineyard at long last into the 21st century. But I say this with a pang of regret.

Nonetheless, Wednesday was a good day. I had a $1000 wine for breakfast. Tomorrow it's probably cereal.","Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.wine-searcher.com/images/news/60/86/bv1-10006086.jpg,"['wine', 'stambor', 'beaulieu', 'love', 'breakfast', 'sex', 'rarity', 'treasury', 'napa', 'latour', '1000', 'georges']",

The England international will be looking to down La Liga opposition in the second leg of a Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday

Diego Godin believes Jamie Vardy would get into the Atletico Madrid team as he prepares to face the Leicester striker in the Champions League.

The Foxes frontman drew a blank against Atleti in Spain as the La Liga outfit established a narrow 1-0 lead in their quarter-final encounter.

Leicester's 5-step plan to beat Atletico

Vardy will, however, be looking to make his presence felt in a return date at the King Power Stadium on Tuesday, with Godin fully aware of the threat posed by the England international.

He told the Daily Mail: “He is a great player.

“He fights and competes in every game and never gives a single ball up for lost. A striker like that is fundamental for a team that plays the way Leicester do. They wouldn’t be the Leicester we know without him.

Pressed on whether he would make an Atletico side that already includes Antoine Griezmann up top, Godin added: “Of course he would.

“I think he would fit in at the vast majority of teams in the world. Who wouldn’t want a striker who kills himself for the team and then gives you so many attacking solutions?”

Morgan in line for Atletico return

Vardy has netted 13 times in all competitions this season, with only one of those efforts coming in Europe.

It was, however, his 24-goal haul that helped Leicester to secure a remarkable Premier League title triumph last season and he remains a fearsome frontman when in the right frame of mind.

Uruguay international Godin will be charged with the task of keeping him quiet in midweek, with the 31-year-old a vastly-experienced defender who has tested himself against the best forwards in the world down the years.","Mon, 17 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['season', 'striker', 'quarterfinal', 'team', 'world', 'atletico', 'wouldnt', 'leicester', 'godin', 'vardy', 'claims']",

KAMPALA, Uganda, Apr 20 – A plague of crop-destroying fall armyworm caterpillars has spread to East Africa where officials confirmed their presence for the first time in Uganda on Friday.

An outbreak of the caterpillars in several southern African nations has already raised alarm with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warning they pose “a huge threat to food security”.

Uganda’s Agriculture Minister Vincent Ssempijja said the presence of the innocuous looking but hugely destructive brown caterpillar had been confirmed in over 20 districts of the country.

“This will negatively impact on the nation’s food and nutrition security,” Ssempijja told a press conference in Kampala.

An estimated 10.9 million people already don’t have enough to eat in Uganda, according to a UN report on food insecurity released last month.

Fall armyworms are native to the Americas and were first spotted in Nigeria and Togo last year, with one theory saying that they arrived in Africa on commercial flights from South America or in plants imported from the region.

They have already caused damage to staple crops in Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Ghana while reports suggest Malawi, Mozambique and Ghana may also be affected.

The caterpillars eat maize, wheat, millet and rice key food sources in southern and eastern Africa, where many areas are already struggling with shortages after years of severe drought.

They also attack cotton, soybean, potato and tobacco fields.

Chemical pesticides can be effective, but fall armyworms have developed resistance in their native Americas.

In Uganda the caterpillars were spotted in May last year. Samples had to be sent to Australia to determine if they were the native Africa armyworm less destructive and which responds to pesticides or the fall armyworm.

“If nothing is done we could lose up to 15 percent of our maize production,” said senior agriculture minister official Okasai Opolot.

Uganda produces close to four million metric tons of maize grain annually, contributing to the livelihoods of more than 3.6 million households, according to government statistics.

Kampala has set aside one billion shillings ($280,000, 257,000 euros) for emergency response work including distribution of pesticides and educational materials for farmers.","Thu, 20 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/files/2017/04/Armyworms.jpg,"['africa', 'fall', 'armyworm', 'pesticides', 'cropdestroying', 'native', 'agriculture', 'food', 'maize', 'uganda', 'spread', 'caterpillars', 'million', 'capital']",

By Andrew M. Mwenda

The president of Sierra Leone, Ernest Bai Koroma, wants to amend the constitution and remove term limits on the presidency. Koroma is not the first and will not be the last president of an African country to attempt this. Many others have done it with success while a few have failed. Yet each time a country attempts to remove term limits, we have a standard explanation: the leader is greedy for power. Since the 1990s, we have regurgitated this explanation, reducing a social issue to the character of an individual.

Term limits were entrenched in the constitutions of many nations of Africa in the 1990s and 2000s. From thence, the efforts to remove them have been widespread in many countries regardless of how the government that seeks to remove them came to power: whether it was through an election victory by an opposition party, a military coup, an armed struggle, a popular insurrection or a peaceful succession after the death of an incumbent president.

The countries that have attempted it have different regime types in different regions of the continent; different bases of power, their leaders have different age, the colonial masters were different, etc. So why does this diversity produce the same politics? Anyone can infer from this that the problem is not leaders but term limits. Theoretically, term limits are an attractive innovation but they seem not well suited to the political circumstances of some nations. Hence, each time to respect term limits comes; the political elite seek to remove them.

Africa needs to think! Term limits may be too much ado over little or nothing. Most of Europe does not have them. Some leaders of Western European democracies in the post-World War Two era have served for long: President Urho Kekkonen of Finland did 26 years, Prime Ministers Tage Erlander of Sweden and Ainar Gerhardsen of Norway did 23 and 17 years respectively. Therefore, long tenure by leaders is not distinctly African. But all too often poorly performing governments get voted out of office.

Even Africa does not need term limits to change governments. In Senegal, presidents Abdou Diouf and Abdoulaye Wade were both defeated by rivals as happened in Benin against Mathieu Kerekou and Nicephore Soglo, Madagascar against Didier Ratsiraka, Congo Brazaville against Denis Sassou Nguesso, Malawi against Kamuzu Banda and Joyce Banda, in Zambia against Kenneth Kaunda and Rupia Banda, in Nigeria against Goodluck Jonathan, most recently in Ghana against John Mahama and in Gambia against Yahya Jammeh. In all these cases, poorly performing incumbents were shown the exit by irate voters without need for term limits.

Secondly Africans are not passive victims of manipulative leaders. Some leaders in Africa tried to remove term limits and failed – Frederick Chiluba in Zambia, Bakili Muluzi in Malawi and Olusegun Obasanjo in Nigeria. Blaise Compaoré in Burkina Faso was in 2015 chased out of power by angry youths for attempting to remove term limits. In DRC, the opposition last year succeeded (at least for now) in stopping President Joseph Kabila from amending the constitution to remove term limits and he has agreed on a retirement timetable.","Mon, 24 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/seirra.jpg,"['constitution', 'africa', 'does', 'term', 'leaders', 'president', 'limits', 'word', 'remove', 'problem', 'power', 'different']",

The Philadelphia Union pushed their winless slide to six games, 14 dating back to 2016, as their attack stagnated yet again in Friday's loss to NYCFC.

CHESTER, Pa. — As soon as the final whistle blew on Friday night to signal the end of the Philadelphia Union's latest failed attempt at winning a match, the boos immediately began raining down at Talen Energy Stadium. You couldn't really blame Union supporters. Not after a loss that stretched their team's winless rut to 14 total matches spread over two seasons and eight months.

David Villa's floating shot from more than 50 yards away provided a fitting end to New York City FC's 2-0 road victory over the Union on a night when NYCFC was clearly the better team, created the better chances, and outplayed a Union side that once again lacked attacking punch.

WATCH: David Villa scores 50-yd goal

This has become the trend for a Union side that has struggled for answers in the final third, an issue that returned on Friday night even after coach Jim Curtin shook up his lineup. Curtin turned to Roland Alberg in the playmaking role he was expected to fill when the season began. Concerns about Alberg's fitness kept him from starting prior to Friday, but Curtin gave him a start to see if he could spark a Union attack that had managed just five goals in its first five matches.

Alberg failed to provide a spark, and offered little to the attack before being replaced by rookie Adam Najem in the 72hd minute. Instead of showing Curtin why he deserved to be in the lineup, Alberg did more to show Union fans why Curtin had kept him out of the starting lineup to start the season.

However, Alberg was by no means the one to blame for Philadelphia's lackluster display. It was a group effort, or rather a group lack of quality, particularly in the attacking half of the field, where wingers Chris Pontius and Ilsinho put a lot of defensive work into pressuring NYCFC's offense, but couldn't muster much in the attack.

NYCFC stuck with most of the same starters it has had all season, save for a shift at right back, where Ethan White returned to the lineup in place of Felix Brillant, whose defensive blunder led to D.C. United's winning goal last week. The NYCFC front six controlled play for stretches, and created good chances, only to be thwarted by bad finishing or Andre Blake's acrobatics.

Blake was the lone bright spot on the night for the Union. The Jamaican shot stopper kept the Union in the match with a series of top-shelf saves. Blake delivered the save of the night in the 22nd minute when he denied a Jack McInerney blast from 20 yards that kept the visitors off the scoreboard and helped keep the pro-Union crowd from turning on its struggling team. Blake delivered once again just eight minutes later, stretching to deny a Maxi Moralez blast immediately after Richie Marquez stopped a Villa shot with a sliding chest block that replays showed to be a handball — something that didn't go unnoticed by NYCFC, which protested vehemently at the no-call.

The Union had their share of luck in the first. Not only in the form of the missed penalty call on Marquez's handball, but also on a sliding tackle from behind by rookie Jack Elliott on Villa that drew a yellow card, but could easily have been a red.

The home side couldn't turn that good luck into an advantage though and watched as NYCFC took control of the match through healthy stretches of possession and sharper passing than the Union could string together.

Jack Harrison's 52nd minute goal gave NYCFC the lead, and control of the match. Curtin tried to counter with attacking substitutions such as Najem, Jay Simpson and Fabian Herbers, but none led to any serious testing of the NYCFC goalkeeper Sean Johnson.

Curtin's team didn't lack for hustle, but what the Union lacked in abundance was creativity. Only Haris Medunjanin really offered anything in the way of consistently effective passes. Medunjanin showed why he is among the league leaders in chances created, with his ability to break defensive lines with his pinpoint long passes from deep in midfield, but those passes were too often wasted by bad touches, poor runs and weak follow-up passes.

NYCFC grew sharper as the game went on, no doubt settling into a comfort zone when it became clear the Union weren't going to pose much of a threat in the second half. The visitors appeared content to return to New York with a 1-0 victory before Villa's prayer of a shot from near the center circle, which Blake couldn't race back in time to keep out. The goal summed up the Union night so perfectly. Blake had been their lone bright spot, but even he was left to hang his head in shame as the final whistle blew and disgusted Union fans voiced their outrage.

The Union return to Talen Energy Stadium next week to take on equally-struggling Montreal, in a match Philadelphia must win if this season is going to be turned around before it falls into nightmare territory. Union fans probably think 2017 has already reached that low.","Fri, 14 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['match', 'couldnt', 'hapless', 'philadelphia', 'night', 'halts', 'shot', 'nycfc', 'win', 'kept', 'blake', 'york', 'fc', 'curtin', 'lineup', 'road', 'union', 'city', 'slide']",

BARACOA, Cuba, Apr 18 2017 (IPS) - Early in the day, when a gentle dew moistens the ground and vegetation in the mountains of eastern Cuba, street vendor Raulises Ramírez sets up his rustic stand next to the La Farola highway and displays his cone-shaped coconut sweets.

“These will maybe be the last ones… the cones will disappear, because the hurricane brought down all the coconut palms in Baracoa,” the 52-year-old private entrepreneur told IPS. He makes a living in Cuba’s oldest city selling this traditional sweet made of coconut, honey, fruits and spices, wrapped in the fibrous cone-shaped palm leaf.

“Look at all this!“ exclaimed Ramírez, pointing to the ground next to the highway littered with the trunks of coconut palm trees knocked down or bent by Hurricane Matthew, which hit Baracoa and other parts of eastern Cuba on Oct. 4-5, 2016.

He expects to continue making his sweets for a while longer thanks to his reserves. His main customers are Cubans who pay the equivalent of 25 cents of a dollar for each “cucurucho” or coconut cone, a typical sweet of this municipality, with an agricultural sector based on coconut and cacao, among other products.

“We have to provide the local population with support to produce staple crops and provide new sources of income, until the commercial perennial crops begin to produce.” -- Theodor Friedrich



When his coconut reserves are finished, he will have to look for a different source of income than the one that has sustained his family for the last five years. “The tourists like to buy dried fruit,” he said, referring to the growing influx of foreign visitors in the area.

Ramírez’s situation is in some way similar to that of the entire agri-food sector in this municipality with a population of 81,700, which is facing a tough challenge: recovering their main long-cycle crops that were ravaged by the strongest hurricane ever registered in the province of Guantánamo, where Baracoa is located.

“We estimate the shortest possible time for coconut production to recover is four years, while cacao will take two and a half years. But reforestation will take many more years, between 15 and 20,” said Baracoa Mayor Luis Sánchez, referring to the fundamental components of local economic development: cacao, coconut, coffee and forestry products.

In the affected territories in Guantánamo, agriculture was among the hardest-hit sectors, with 70,574 hectares damaged. According to official reports, 27 per cent of the cacao, coconut and coffee plantations and 67 per cent of the forest heritage was lost.

The hurricane damaged 35,681 hectares of the main crops in this mountainous coastal municipality. Only four per cent of the vast plantations of coconut palm trees are still standing, which were used to obtain part of the seeds vital to the recovery effort.

“In small areas on the outskirts of the city some coconut palm trees still remain on private farms and in people’s yards, which are the source of the coconuts vendors are using to make their cones, but the state-run factory is not producing any,” Rodríguez said, about the temporary disappearance of this symbol of Baracoa.

The factory, the only one that made coconut cones and distributed them in the provinces of Guantánamo, Santiago de Cuba and Holguín, is now producing tomatoes and fruit brought from other parts of the country. The cocoa industry is still active, even producing several by-products, thanks to reserves of cacao.

So far, only 3,576 hectares of forestry, coconut, coffee, cacao and fruit plantations have been recuperated, since the authorities are putting a priority on “the areas dedicated to short-cycle crops to quickly obtain food, such as vegetables and fruits for domestic consumption,” said the mayor in an exclusive interview with IPS.

“Baracoa, the cacao capital” reads an enormous poster at the entrance to this city founded 505 years ago by Spanish colonialists. Alongside coconut cone vendors like Ramírez, men and women sell big scoops of home-made dark chocolate along the La Farola highway.

Hurricane Matthew thwarted a project to create production chains based on coconut and cacao, with investments to foment cultivation of the crops and modernise the food industry in the municipality. The initiative hoped to tap into other potential sources of income, especially using coconuts.

The current production based on coconut and cacao does not cover domestic demand in this country of 11.2 million, nor demand from international tourists, who reached the record number of four million in 2016.

“Meanwhile, we have to provide the local population with support to produce staple crops and provide new sources of income, until the commercial perennial crops begin to produce,” advised Theodor Friedrich, representative of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Cuba.

He told IPS that to this end, FAO is supporting several initiatives for agricultural and food production recovery in the area affected by Matthew, through two projects financed by the United Nations’ Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and FAO resources. In addition, it is awaiting the approval of a bigger third project financed by a donor.

“There is an urgent need to recover the most commercial crops, to avoid delaying this process,” said Friedrich, an agronomist who advocates the need of restoring them with resilience to future climate shocks.

“In part, these crops can be used to intersperse food crops and integrate new crops with their corresponding value chains,” he said.

In the case of the territories affected by the hurricane, and together with the local authorities, FAO promotes the proposal to plant drumstick or horseradish trees (moringa oleifera) among the perennial crops, a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree which provides a micronutrient-rich ingredient used to fortify food and animal feed, while also offering a natural fertiliser for the soil.

This initiative can strengthen small industries in the area involved in the manufacturing of fortified foods and in livestock production. “It will increase the production and availability of high value-added foods, while at the same time providing a financial income to farming families,” said the FAO representative.

The government of Baracoa also identifies another economic option for local residents.

“Tourism is the most feasible alternative, because the recovery of agriculture will take some time, even though there is a programme for agro-industrial development,” said Mayor Sánchez. “After Matthew, visits here by local and international tourists fell, but now we are experiencing a surge.”

In the area, government-run hotels and other lodgings offer at total of 275 rooms, and another 367 rooms are available in 283 private houses, where the number of rooms offered has climbed to cater to the current tourism boom.

Near Baracoa’s seafront, retiree Dolores Yamilé Selva’s hostel, which she has run since 1998, is full. She believes that there is still untapped tourism potential in the area. “The tourists that come to our town, mainly from Europe, is interested in our natural surroundings,” she told IPS.","Tue, 18 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2017/04/b.jpg,"['typical', 'posthurricane', 'production', 'local', 'baracoa', 'agriculture', 'cuban', 'coconut', 'food', 'sweet', 'cacao', 'challenge', 'crops', 'hurricane', 'income', 'fao', 'symbol']",

These inspirational projects are making a positive difference to people’s lives in their own communities and creating social change at a national level.

For the last four years, Nominet Trust has identified and celebrated 100 different socially-motivated startups from across the globe. In our 2016 NT100, we feature some extraordinary examples of how pioneers from across Africa are using tech for good to promote education equality, economic empowerment and access to medical care.

Education equality

1. OneUni

In Kenya, a lack of physical space at universities and the prohibitive costs of attending can be barriers to often capable students pursuing degree programmes. Daystar University in Nairobi and California startup, OneUni, partnered up to tackle this and make university education accessible to more Kenyans. Together they created Africa’s first smartphone degree programme, Daystar Mobile, where all course materials are made available through an app. They now have plans to expand the model to other African countries to reach thousands of more students, aiming to make university education more accessible across the continent.

2. Tunapanda Institute

Another venture bolstering education in Kenya is Tunapanda Institute. Approximately one-third of Kenyan children do not enrol into a high school because of financial constraints, so brothers Jay and Mick Larson created a free, open source online training programme to help bridge this digital divide. Tunapanda Institute currently delivers three-month intensive learning courses in technology, design and business, giving students access to vital skills that can act as an alternative to traditional high school diplomas. At the institute’s HQ in Nairobi, specific workshops are also held to provide girls with skills in the STEM subjects, helping address the gender gap in these fields. To date, 100 people have graduated from the programme, of whom 85 percent are in meaningful employment as a result.

3. Well Told Story

After the disputed elections in Kenya in 2007, over 800 people were killed, leaving a generation of youths feeling disenfranchised. To help get to the heart of what young Kenyan’s wanted to talk about, Rob Burnet established Well Told Story, a research consultancy which is famous for creating Shujaaz, meaning ‘heroes’ in Sheng. Shujaaz is a free, international Emmy-winning comic book that now has a monthly circulation of 500,000 and a readership that Burnet estimates to be five million Kenyans aged between 10 and 25. The content is lovingly crafted by young people based in Well Told Story’s Nairobi office and offers readers tips on everything from planting maize to contraception, information about upcoming elections and careers.

In Cape Town, communities living in deprived areas are threatened by the devastation caused by house fires which can sweep through the neighbourhood. Lumkani, which means ‘beware’ in Xhosa, was created by a group of students horrified by the danger faced by less advantaged citizens in their city, to help save lives in the event of these fires. Lumkani transmits a signal to devices within a 20-metre radius so that neighbours are aware of potential danger and can mobilise help or evacuate. Since launching in 2014, Lumkani has been installed in 7,000 homes in Cape Town, and co-founders Francois Petousis and Samuel Ginsburg say that the device has already prevented the spread of what could have been five major fires.

5. Digital Matatus

Although 70 percent of Nairobi’s population rely on the matatus – 20,000 private vans which transport people around the capital – there’s very little information available on how to navigate this seemingly chaotic system. In 2011, researchers at MIT, Columbia University and the University of Nairobi, together with design agency Upshot, began a collaborative mapping project to make sense of the matatus system to support those travelling on it. By recruiting Kenyan students to ride the matatus and log journeys using mobile and GPS, by 2015 Digital Matatus had recorded almost 3,000 stops on more than 130 routes. Since its release, the city of Nairobi has adopted the map as the capital’s official transit guide and more than 5,000 people have downloaded it online.

Economic empowerment

6. Illuminum Greenhouse

Childhood friends Brian Bett and Taita Ng’etich, whose families are farmers, set out to explore better solutions to farming after their young tomato crop was destroyed by flooding. They developed a system using low-cost materials and advanced sensor technologies to monitor their crops to prevent this happening again. When neighbours started asking them to build their own greenhouses, they founded a new business: Illuminum Greenhouses. Each greenhouse is fitted with sensors that monitor temperature, humidity and soil moisture, alerting farmers to change the settings via text messages. To date, more than 750 Kenyan farmers are using Illuminum’s technology and the pair aspires to scale the innovation so it can be deployed all over Africa and Latin America.

7. SAPARM

Around 200 million pastoralists in Africa seek pasture for their herds using a combination of word of mouth, scouts and knowledge of local terrains – but this has become increasingly challenging due to climate change and drought. To modernise pastoralists’ search for land, Chris Bessenecker from Project Concern International (PCI) developed project SAPARM (Satellite-Assisted Pastoral Resource Management) in partnership with USAID and the World Food Programme. Through SAPARM, PCI can share maps featuring satellite images of vegetation cover with pastoral clan leaders every 10 days. Since SAPARM’s launch in 2013, over 80 percent of participating pastoralists use the maps, and more than half have said that it’s their most important source of information.

8. Giraffe

In 2016, South Africa’s unemployment rate hit a 12-year high. Shafin Anwarsha believed the main challenge was a lack of access for jobseekers who often live in segregated townships with poor transport and limited internet access, so he developed a recruitment app called Giraffe. Giraffe aims to reduce unemployment by providing a free resource which helps employers hire medium-skilled workers faster and more easily. Since its launch in early 2015, Giraffe has attracted over 150,000 jobseekers, invited over 30,000 of them for interviews, and helped hundreds of businesses recruit workers faster and cheaper than ever before.

Access to medical care

9. Vula

While volunteering in Swaziland, Dr William Mapham would often drive eight hours to diagnose patients, who would then have to endure the same journey to receive treatment. This inspired Dr Mapham to create Vula — a name derived from the siSwati phrase for ‘open your eyes’. The app enables health workers to capture basic patient and eye health information using a smartphone camera and securely share it with a specialist thousands of miles away to gain an expert opinion. Dr Mapham and his team are currently focused on increasing the app’s reach in Swaziland, before extending it to Zambia.

10. Project Khuluma

According to UNAIDS, 15 percent of women and 5 percent of men aged 15–25 in South Africa are infected with HIV. While medical treatment has been improving, little has been done to support patients’ mental health. Project Khuluma was set up by international NGO, SHM Foundation, to help teenagers facing HIV by providing around-the-clock support through a smartphone. Project Khuluma uses mobile group chats to create a safe environment for young people to discuss anything from their HIV medication to sex, relationships and social issues. The young people have the option to remain anonymous and each group is supervised by a trained facilitator, who can identify teenagers showing signs of depression, mental illness, or resistance to their antiretroviral treatments.

All these inspiring ventures, and others Nominet Trust profiles in our NT100, demonstrate how digital technology can bring ideas to life and make a huge difference to people’s lives, whether it’s accessing education, improving healthcare provision or connecting jobseekers with employers. We hope that these projects will inspire more entrepreneurs in Africa to apply their technical skills to the social challenges facing their own communities.","Mon, 10 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://venturesafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tech-Startup-mistakes-1.jpg,"['watch', 'africa', 'social', 'education', 'help', 'startups', 'using', 'project', 'african', 'nairobi', 'young', 'university', 'good', 'tech', '2017', 'students']", 
82,82,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The startup CEO accused of firing employees before their stock option vest admits: 'I can be hard edged' - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/startup-ceo-accused-scandalously-firing-001141080.html,"Tanium Orion Hindawi

Orion Hindawi, the CEO of Tanium, has just posted an open letter after news stories broke this week that accused him of a litany of bad behavior.

In one story, employees alleged that he had fired some people before their stock options vested in an attempt to keep his controlling interest in the company from being diminished (a charge the company denies). They also accused him of mocking and insulting people and spreading sex or drug rumors about current and former staffers, according to the report from Bloomberg.

At least 10 senior executives have left or been fired from the richly-valued security startup since the summer, the Wall Street Journal reported.

On top of that, the WSJ uncovered that Tanium had been giving prospective customers a view into a hospital's live network while not fully protecting the identity of the hospital, a situation the company admits to.

The hospital also told Business Insider that it was unaware that the company was accessing parts of its live network and showing it to Titanium prospects and that it is now ""investigating."" That kind of thing, as you might imagine, would be a major no-no for a security vendor to do, if it proves true. The reason companies buy security software is to protect themselves from unauthorized prying eyes.

In the open letter, Tanium admits that it did use the hospital's live network in product demos, as well as other customers' networks, but says it can only do so if it has been granted explicit permission including the technology for remote access.

As for accusations of brutish behavior, Hindawi took a lesson from PR crises 101 by including a come-clean section in his letter where he explained himself, admitting he ""can be hard-edged"" and that the company can be ""a stressful environment.""

Here's the heart of that section (emphasis ours):

I also want to say there are some things they got right about their portrayal of Tanium. We see the mission of protecting and serving our customers as nearly sacred, and to that end it is absolutely true that we’ve built a culture that is highly demanding and mission oriented, and that we expect our employees to drive themselves hard with that same commitment to the mission that we have. When taken to an extreme, that drive can make for a stressful environment, which we are working to balance and prevent. It is true that I personally can be hard-edged, and that I’ve had to apologize to people at Tanium when I’ve gotten too sharp at times. It is true that we fire people when they don’t meet our ethical or performance standards, and we understand that from the outside that may raise questions about the number of people leaving.

Story continues

Tanium was founded by Hindawi and his father a decade ago. It came to prominence after raising $287 million of venture investment at a valuation of $3.7 billion. Much of that came from the VC powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz after urging from former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, an adviser for Andreessen Horowitz. Sinofsky once called Tanium's technology ""magic.""

Here's the full open letter from Hindawi addressed to the company's customers.

I can imagine that many of you are getting tired of waking up to the bad Tanium press stories hitting your inbox in the last week. Most of you know our company well, and reading these stories can be disturbing to all of us. Unfortunately, it’s not always effective to use the press directly to set facts straight in circumstances like this. That said, I don’t think they’re painting an accurate picture of our company, so I’m reaching out directly to all of you to give our side of this.

First, I would like to directly address the question we’re being asked, which is whether we have used customers’ environments for demos. Tanium is an on-premises deployed platform. Unless you explicitly provide it to us (which the vast majority of our customers never should or would) we do not have access to your on-premises installation of Tanium, and won’t ask for it unless we’re helping support you and only for that purpose. We do have a few customers who have agreed for us to use their environments for external demos, and have provided that access to us. Since 2015, we’ve insisted that before a customer is willing to let us demo from their environment, regardless of the access they offer us, we document that in writing and agree on what data we can show to ensure there isn’t any confusion. Other than the few customers who have signed those documents and provided us remote access to their Tanium platforms, we do not — and in fact cannot — demonstrate customer environments with Tanium.

That said, we take responsibility for mistakes in the use of this particular customer’s demo environment. We should have done better anonymizing that customer’s data. While viewers didn’t connect the demo environment to that customer for years, and we do not believe we ever put our customer at risk with the data we showed. Looking at those demos, we see there are easy things we should have done to obscure and anonymize further.

More generally, I also want to say there are some things they got right about their portrayal of Tanium. We see the mission of protecting and serving our customers as nearly sacred, and to that end it is absolutely true that we’ve built a culture that is highly demanding and mission oriented, and that we expect our employees to drive themselves hard with that same commitment to the mission that we have. When taken to an extreme, that drive can make for a stressful environment, which we are working to balance and prevent. It is true that I personally can be hard-edged, and that I’ve had to apologize to people at Tanium when I’ve gotten too sharp at times. It is true that we fire people when they don’t meet our ethical or performance standards, and we understand that from the outside that may raise questions about the number of people leaving. And it is true that as we’ve grown, we haven’t matured processes in some areas as quickly as we’ve added people, which is something we’re working hard to build faster. These are in fact all things we need to work on, and we’re doing so every day.

What is not true is that we have a toxic culture. Mission-oriented, hard-charging, disciplined, even intense, but not toxic. We do not belittle each other at work, and it is completely untrue that we fire people to save a few shares of stock. David and I are proud that many of the best people we worked with at BigFix chose to come work with us at Tanium, that many of them have done well for themselves and their families through these companies, and that they find fulfillment and joy in Tanium. I hope that I get to continue working with many of the people at Tanium for the rest of my career. That doesn’t happen if we’re stingy or cruel.

We don’t know when this news cycle is going to end and unfortunately we can’t control whether the press is wrong in the way it paints our company. That said, we can choose to learn what we can from these stories, then channel that learning and our commitment and passion for Tanium’s mission into great products and services for you. David and I are personally deeply committed to that mission, and we believe our whole team is even more motivated after these attacks on our character and company. To that end, I’d encourage you to reach out to the people you trust most at Tanium and get their view on our company and where we’re going.

It’s an honor to be a vendor and partner you trust, and we will work to earn that every day. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out directly to me.

84,84,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,The Ducati Scrambler was a bike for hippies — but now it's a motorcycle for hipsters - Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ducati-scrambler-bike-hippies-now-160712814.html,"Ducati Scrambler

I recently took a short vacation to Bologna, Italy and while I was there I spent some time at the Ducati factory and museum.

Ducati is a very old motorcycle brand, founded in 1926 and headquartered in Bologna for its entire history.

In recent years, the company has gained renown for its so-called ""naked"" bikes, mainly the Ducati Monster, which was rolled out in 1993 and has achieved widespread popularity (it has an open trellis frame that exposes its unique desmodromic v-twin engine).

Ducati is also well-known for its aggressive superbikes, such as the Panigale — often called the ""Ferrari"" of motorcycles.

But it's biggest hit of late is a reboot of a motorcycle that it first built back in the early 1960s and discontinued in the early 1970s. It was called the ""Scrambler,"" and Ducati resumed making it, with a completely different level of technology and much more horsepower, in 2015.

Ducati Scrambler

I was a big fan of the Monster, but the Scrambler is really just about my favorite bike on the road right now. For Ducati, it gives the brand a bike to put against some of the revived ""cafe racers"" that have been produced by the likes of Triumph and even Harley-Davidson, which is famous for its hulking cruisers.

Triumph's bikes are pure hipster, but the Scrambler nods at a subset of hipsterdom: riders who want to tackle the road and the trail. In this sense, they probably would have appealed to somebody like Steve McQueen, a motorsport nut who actually sampled a whole bunch of dirt bikes for Popular Mechanics in 1966.

The original Ducati Scrambler wasn't on his docket, but it should have been.

Ducati made the original Scrambler for the US market, and if a photo I snapped while I was at the museum is any indication, it was a bike beloved by counterculturalists:

Ducati Scrambler

I'm not sure if the new Ducati is similarly pitched; the target market seems to be especially chic hipsters. In fact, the Scrambler has been so successful that rather than allow it to exist as a single model in the overall Ducati lineup, the company has turned it into a standalone brand selling a variety of different bikes.

Story continues

From a business standpoint, this shows a pretty bold pivot for Ducati. The bike maker is now appealing to several different markets, uniting them with its high-end, design-and-engineering-driven DNA.

As I learned when I stopped by the New York Motorcycle Show last year, American bikers are now absolutely spoiled for choice. There are far more great, modern motorcycles now than there were when I was growing up. Back then, it was essentially cruisers and sport bikes; if you wanted something different, you had to scour the vintage realms.

Nowadays, kickstarting is a thing of past and all these retro-bikes are outfitted with state of the art tech. But as in the case of the Scrambler, they haven't lost their spirit. The bikes of the 1960s and '70s may have appealed to hippies, but there aren't that many of those folks around these days. So a hipster dirt bike with an Italian pedigree is perfect.

Liverpool 1-2 Crystal Palace

Premier League, Anfield

April 23, 2017

Goals: Coutinho 25′; Benteke 43′, 74′

Taking on a Palace side battling to avoid relegation, it was always going to be a difficult afternoon for Jurgen Klopp‘s Reds.

But after Philippe Coutinho broke the deadlock with an excellent free-kick, it was hugely disappointing to let the points go as Christian Benteke’s brace struck his old club.

With just four games left to play before the end of the season, and with Man United producing a 2-0 win away to Burnley earlier on Sunday, this was a frustrating result in the Reds’ top-four pursuit.

Here’s how supporters reacted to Liverpool’s 2-1 loss at home to Palace on social media.

88,88,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Michael Jordan's Failed Motorsports Team: The Full Story - Highsnobiety,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/michael-jordan-motorsports-racing-team/,"Michael Jordan's competitive nature is the stuff of legend — responsible not only for unprecedented success in the NBA, but also a post-basketball life that has made him one of the ""most powerful NBA owners"" and the figurehead behind the popular Jumpman imprint which continues to carry Nike to new heights.

While to err is simply human, Michael Jordan has used that tireless desire for winning to avoid any major missteps aside from that fateful year of minor league baseball after he became disenfranchised with basketball following the death of his father.

But even the biggest MJ ""Stans"" might be surprised to learn that Jordan's foray into baseball isn't his only misstep in the athletic realm. There was a time right after his last retirement when he bet on himself as the owner of a superbike motorcycle team, aptly titled ""Michael Jordan Motorsports.""

Combining elements relating to high-octane performance and merchandise, Michael Jordan Motorsports could and probably should have been an added dimension to his portfolio of assets. But the venture never took hold; immortalized by a friends and family Jordan IV ""Motorsport"" silhouette which was given out to team members in 2006 and recently retroed — a not-so-subtle reminder of His Airness's need for speed.

Michael Jordan Motorsports wasn't as unlikely a venture as it may seem given the automobile ties to some of the Jordan Brand's most popular silhouettes over the years — highlighted by the Air Jordan VI being based of the Porsche 911, Air Jordan XIV based off the Ferrari F335 and 550M, Air Jordan XVII based off the Aston Martin, Air Jordan XXI based off the Bentley Continental GT Coupe, and elements of the Air Jordan 31 based on Ferrari seats.

When the Chicago Bulls drafted Jordan with the third pick in the NBA draft, one of the major stipulations was that he could no longer ride a motorcycle for fear that even the most minor an accident could jeopardize a team's fortune - highlighted by that very thing which occurred to the Bulls 20 years later when their top pick, Jay Williams, crashed his motorcycle and nearly died.

""I started riding dirt bikes when I was 7 or 8 years old,"" Jordan recalled. ""Way back when. I kind of got into it, and obviously I couldn't ride because of my contract stuff. But as soon as that was over with, I got back into it.""

""It's skillful. I grew up in NASCAR, so I've been a big race fan,"" Jordan added. ""But the thing about motorcycles is the instinct, the reactions — you see the riders working the bike. It takes a lot of skill to be in position on the bike, to be able to downshift and upshift and all that stuff, which is a little bit different than NASCAR. NASCAR is always left-hand turns, and circles the whole time. There's an art to what they do, I'm not diminishing that. I just felt from coming from a sport where it's a reaction sport, to see how they react much quicker — their decision-making has to be really quick. I was intrigued by that.""

According to Kenneth Abbott, Jordan's media manager, Jordan decided to explore his motorsport options after a chance encounter with James Casmay — a Chicago-based motorcycle enthusiast — who often zipped around the city and enjoyed talking intricacies of motors and tires with fellow riders.

""One of the guys went up and started talking to Mike and said, ‘If you want to go riding, here’s my card, give us a call,'"" Casmay recalled of his first interaction with Jordan at a Chicago gas station.

""We started having a good time riding late at night, probably ride at 1 o'clock, 1:30, up and down the freeway,"" remembered Jordan. ""Once I started coming out, everybody seemed to migrate to where I was riding. Instead of riding with eight or nine guys, we started riding with 30 or 40 guys, which is just an accident waiting to happen. So we started trying to secretly get out. But obviously once they saw I was out, everybody started looking for me.""

Despite Jordan's seemingly endless amount of wealth and access to some of the brightest apparel minds in the business, Casmay and other riders were struck by just how ill-equipped Jordan seemed to be for riding a high-performance motorcycle on the Chicago streets.

""I'm looking and I'm like, 'something's not right with this picture,'"" recalled another rider, Noble Williams, a Chicago police officer who noted that Jordan's attire was more akin to how a person would warm up for a basketball game than go for a motorcycle ride. ""The whole thing was just wrong. He came up with a Jordan shirt, jogging pants and Air Jordan shoes.""

""The gloves he had on were the weightlifting gloves that had the fingers cut off the front,"" recalled another rider, Montez Stewart, who would prove to be instrumental in Jordan's first major venture after he had retired from the NBA. ""It was funny. When I saw that, I was cracking up.""

Much like a rookie accepting ribbing from veteran players, Jordan was appreciative of the riders' concern.

""If it wasn't for those guys, I could have gotten myself injured, and would have never been in this sport,"" recalled Jordan.

Jordan eventually made good and phoned Casmay to discuss if there were any opportunities to take a local rider and give him a push toward a professional career. Casmay insisted that Montez Stewart was that guy.

“We had no intentions of starting a race team,” said Casmay, who was running a small investment company at the time. “But after introducing Montez to Mike, we said, 'you know, this is fun on the streets, but it’s more fun on the track.'”

After a day at the track where Jordan assessed Stewart's racing acumen, he knew he was the perfect rider to serve as the inaugural pilot for the yet-to-be-minted motorsports team.

Ken Abbot, CCS-Formula USA Road Race Competition Director, said of Stewart's abilities at the time that he was “probably the dominant rider in the Midwestern Region of the CCS by the end of the 2003 season.”

""He asked me as friends, 'Montez what can I do to help you fulfill your dream as a road racer?"" Stewart recalled. 'If you're serious, we can pursue this together.'""

Although it took Jordan 20 years to rekindle his passion for motorcycles, he established Michael Jordan Motorsports in 2004 with the help of Pete Mauhar — a seasoned team manager in the pro circuit with a decade worth of Superbike experience — to help him navigate a sport dominated by factory teams from Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki, Ducati and Yamaha since the sport was officially recognized on a global scale in 1988.

“I got a call from James Casmay, someone I didn’t know, who was asking about whether we’d want to help Michael Jordan go into racing. Which was a pretty bizarre call, really,” Mauhar said. “Honestly, I thought it was some of my friends messing around with me.”

While it takes a motorsports team a year or longer to secure sponsorship, get equipment, find riders and mechanics, and get approval from the sanctioning body for SBK, Jordan Motorsports managed the monstrous task in only five weeks time — surely aided by Jordan's name recognition that had people on the periphery of the sport buzzing.

According to Forbes, ""Almost overnight, Yamaha had provided new bikes fresh off the boat from Japan at a discounted price. Then those bikes were sent to Gemini Technology Systems, a Wisconsin company that makes motorcycles race-ready and provides crew and race team management. Gemini even applied the Carolina Blue color scheme to honor Jordan’s old college team.""

With sponsors like Jordan Brand, Gatorade, Hanes, Upper Deck, and the National Guard painted on the side of his YZF-R1 AMA Superbike, Montez Stewart was on the starting grid at Daytona for the first American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) road racing event of the 2004 season.

“I’ve done a lot of club racing, and I always wanted to be a pro racer and come race with the AMA and run with the big boys,” Stewart said at the time. “So I’m really glad to be here.”

As The Los Angeles Times noted in its coverage, ""Michael Jordan attracted most of the attention before the main event as the retired NBA legend was on hand to encourage his young protege, Montez Stewart of Matteson, Ill. It didn't help much, however, as the rookie rider — who looks more like an NBA prospect at 6' 3"" than a motorcycle racer — qualified 33rd in superstock and 39th in supersport.""

Stewart turned lap times good enough to make the grid in both classes. In Superstock, Stewart qualified in the ninth row, turning laps at 1:58.620. In Supersport qualifying, he made the grid in 43rd position, turning a fast lap of 2:01.075.

Stewart ultimately finished 26th at Daytona and 23rd overall in the standings out of 40 riders for the entire season.

For some, this may have been a small victory. But for Michael Jordan, how would he interpret a middle-of-the-pack finish?

""Knowing me, I wanted to win the first year,"" Jordan told E60. ""But I knew — mechanically — I didn't have the right equipment to win. But that doesn't mean that I don't hope for some type of win,"" while adding, ""I like being the underdog. When you least expect it, you go out and find ways to beat the favorites. It's tough, because the factory teams are well-equipped. But what's starting to happen is they're seeing no matter what, my interest and my passion is strong enough that, sooner or later, I'm going to find the right things that make it work, and get us up in front and get us winning.""

Whereas branding and motorsports often meld machine and merchandise, Jordan's involvement also allowed his team to bring footwear into the mix thanks to the help of Nike designer Mark Smith, who helped design the look of the bikes so that they could be paired both with the latest Jordan game shoe and retros.

“We weren’t doing it to create any heat in the market with sneakerheads,” Smith said. “What I was doing was making something specific for the race team. And it’s appropriate, it matches up with the bike and it matches up in the paddock. I look at things as a photograph. There was nothing better than a pair of sneakers on a motorcycle. That was enough of a reason to do it.”

A prime example of this fusion came in 2009 when Smith designed the 6 Rings sneaker, which matched nicely with a bike heavily draped in a classic elephant print.

Despite the ""look good, perform good"" mantra, Jordan Motorsports failed to win a single race after 93 appearances at various events between their inaugural season and 2010.

If Michael Jordan's various championship-winning Bulls are viewed as the benchmark for NBA success, then Suzuki's Yoshimura factory team during this period could best be described as a dynasty — winning 10 consecutive championships and 53 straight races — and owning the new millennium between 2000-2010.

""I felt like it was an unfair playing ground,"" Jordan said. ""When manufacturers were winning every single race. We didn't have the parts. Obviously we didn't have the technology. We had no chance at winning.""

2009 ultimately marked a radical shift in the rules of superbike racing — creating uniformity amongst suspension, tires and engines that teams were able to use.

""I am a competitor to the end, and I will fight until I get to the front,"" Jordan said a year later, adding ""may the best rider win.""

Jordan's team went from a single top-three finish in 2008 to ninth the following year. However, he still hadn't managed to crack the winner's circle despite the hit that Suzuki had taken following the rule changes.

The Jordan Motorsports drought ended in 2010 when Jake Zemke took the basketball legend’s race team to Victory Lane at Daytona International Speedway while Jordan watched from the press box. It was clear that Jordan wanted to go down and celebrate, but instead he opted to let his rider and crew relish in the achievement.

In subsequent seasons, Jordan Motorsports added Ben Bostrom and his Suzuki GSX-R1000 bike to the team — draping the machine in a Chicago Bulls colorway and signature ’23’ logo on the front and rear end.

Bostrom would finish in second place during a rain-soaked race at Barber Motorsports Park in 2011.

“A huge thanks to the Jordan Motorsports boys,” commented Bostrom. “The results were not what I hoped, but the bike has really come together and now the rider has to step it up. We’ve struggled for a few events for sure and it’s nice to have fun riding again. We’ve got a few weeks off to ready ourselves for Mid-Ohio, where I’m sure the Jordan bike should be at the front. The bike is ready, the rider needs a little work and we will have a winner. I like Mid-Ohio and so do the Suzukis, so let’s see if we can sweep another podium in three weeks.”

In 2013, Michael Jordan Motorsports announced that it was suspending operations of its AMA Pro Superbike team and would instead focus on transitioning to international competition as early as 2014.

“We’ve decided to not move forward with our AMA Superbike program,” Michael Jordan Motorsports Corporate Relations Director Kreig Robinson said. ""We have no bad feelings toward AMA Pro Racing. This is where we are, where we’re from. We like the property. We don’t have any bad feelings toward anyone in particular, but the property as it stands right now doesn’t allow us to go out and get the sponsorship that we need.""

Even with Michael Jordan's involvement and a financial commitment of $1 million annually (of a $5 million operating cost), the loss of key sponsors like the National Guard ultimately proved to be the final nail in the coffin.

That’s a 770-kilometer crude oil pipeline in the Southeast Asian nation of Myanmar. Owned and built by China — and giving that country unprecedented access to crude flows in the Indian Ocean.

The first-ever tanker of oil began loading to the new pipeline on Monday, according to reports from Chinese media. With this initial slug of 1 million barrels to begin transiting across Myanmar, bound for refineries in Kunming, southern China. You can see the route in the chart below.

(Click to enlarge)

China’s new crude pipeline (green line) runs 770 kilometers from the Myanmar port of Kyaukphyu all the way to Kunming

The inaugural oil shipment here comes after years of delays for this mega-project. With China having previously announced commissioning of the oil pipeline in early 2015 — a year after a twin natural gas pipeline (red line in the map above) began operating.

But oil shipments failed to launch at that time. Due to political wrangling between Myanmar and China over commercial terms for oil exports (all of the pipeline’s crude goes to China, with Myanmar simply acting as a transit route).

That caused the pipe to sit empty for two years. Until an agreement was finally hammered out this past Monday between the Chinese and Myanmar governments — opening the door for crude shipments to finally begin.

If the pipeline indeed ramps up to full capacity, this will be one of the biggest developments of the decade for global crude flows. With China now able to receive oil from key producing centers like the Middle East and Africa directly off the Indian Ocean — eliminating days of sailing through the treacherous Strait of Malacca between Indonesia and Malaysia.

That lowers the landed oil price for Chinese buyers. And should incentivize more purchases from Indian Ocean oil nations. It may also lead China’s E&Ps to a greater focus on projects in this region — such as East Africa, Iran and India. Watch for news on the pipeline’s rise to full capacity, and for knock-on shifts in Chinese energy investment.

Here’s to opening the back door.

93,93,Drought_Ghana_2017_April,Oil Majors See Huge Opportunity In Eastern Mediterranean - OilPrice.com,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Oil-Majors-See-Huge-Opportunity-In-Eastern-Mediterranean.html,"Quite suddenly, there is remarkable oil industry news to come out of the East Mediterranean region. If the plan is executed, in the space of seven years the balance of energy security in Western Europe will be radically changed. In geopolitical terms, this will be immense; when the planned Israel-Cyprus-Greece-Italy gas pipeline is built, European countries will be able to cut their ever-increasing dependence on Russian gas supplies.

The story of major gas discoveries in the East Mediterranean started in the shallow-water offshore Egypt, with Miocene Nile Delta discoveries progressively stepping out into deeper and deeper water. The first discovery was made by Phillips Petroleum in 1969, when it drilled the play-opening Abu Qir 1 NFW. It discovered gas in the Messinian Abu Madi sandstones. Subsequent exploration was led by the likes of AMOCO, BG, BP, Eni and Shell. There are now over 100 mainly gas and wet gas fields in the offshore Egyptian Nile Delta, with all production being piped onshore. The story continues to the present day, with recent large discoveries in the deeper Oligocene play, such as Salamat (2013) and Atoll (2015), alongside large Messinian discoveries including Nooros (2015) and Baltim South West (2016).

The latest super-giant and play-opening discovery is, of course, Zohr in 2015 lying over 160km offshore, and in WD of 1,450m. Over 30 Tcf of dry gas was discovered in a massive Miocene-Cretaceous reef structure, on the edge of the Erastothenes Platform. Italian giant Eni is pressing forward quickly to bring this onstream, and pipe-laying from the field to shore (150 km) by the Saipem deep water lay-barge “Castoro Sei” is ongoing and should be completed later in 2017. Imponderable for the moment is the possibility of oil; current well Zohr Deep 1 is targeting a deeper Cretaceous-Jurassic carbonate reef play below the gas field. The initial Zohr prospect was postulated to be oil prone. However, Egypt has a large negative energy balance, and serving the large domestic market with more gas is the number one priority.

Levant Basin Steps Up

But the gas that is getting the European politicians so excited is from the Levant Basin in Israel and Cyprus. In the Israeli offshore sector, a series of discoveries has been made in waters of up to 1,500m. Noble Energy, starting its exploration in 2008, has made major gas discoveries; Tamar (2009), Dalit (2009), Dolphin (2011), Noa 2 (2011), Leviathan (2011), Tanin (2012), Pinnacles (2012) and Karish (2013). Most of the biogenic gas was found in a thick succession of deep marine turbidite sands of Oligo-Miocene age, with smaller but significant amounts found in younger, Pliocene turbidite sands. Out of the Noble discoveries, so far only Tamar and the smaller Noa are onstream, with Leviathan to follow in 2019. The Israeli government, fearful of dominance of the sector by just one player, has ordered the divestment of Karish and Tanin to Energean, a Greek company, which is in the process of farming down.

In the Cyprus offshore sector to the north-west, Noble also discovered Aphrodite (2011), where the gas resource figures are most recently estimated at 4.54 Tcf. So, taken together, we now see quantities of gas to make potential export look much more attractive to offset the considerable deep water investments which will be required. Noble Energy currently cites in excess of 35 Tcf of gross resources in these two offshore sectors.

The big export markets for gas are not in the Middle East; they are in Western Europe. The principal challenge is to lay a 1300km deep sea pipeline through the Mediterranean to Greece (west coast) and across the Adriatic to landfall in Italy. The European high-pressure gas transmission network (ENTSOG) can be picked up there. Alternatives have been suggested – such as landfall in Southern Turkey – but the former is preferred for many non-technical reasons.

Project Looks Feasible

So the key revelation in this last week is that the technical feasibility of a pipeline has been passed by engineering consultants IGI Poseidon. Ministers from the EC, Israel, Greece, Italy and Cyprus signed an agreement in Tel Aviv, Israel and a time-frame of seven years is put on the project. The headline cost for a 1,300 km, 500 Bcf/annum pipeline is €5.34 billion (US$6 billion).

Unlike African gas mega-projects which face a Sisyphean challenge of putting the value chain together (witness Kudu in Namibia, or the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline), the East Med Pipeline seems to be pretty solid. Financiers in New York and London are already expressing interest. Related: Drillers Remain Cautious Despite Shale Success

There is also a substantial exploration upside in the East Mediterranean region, and there is a major focus of interest here. In the Cyprus sector, the Third Licensing Round has just concluded with an ExxonMobil-Qatar Petroleum JV having signed a contract for Block 10. An Eni and Total JV has successfully bid for Block 6, while Eni secured Block 8 on its own. Given that the IOCs have already acquired 3D seismic data, the time lapse to first wells should be no more than one year (a commitment given at the signing ceremony). Cyprus Minister of Energy Lakkotrypis is far more expansive, saying “a total of twelve exploration wells will be drilled in the newly licensed Blocks 6, 8 and 10.” Some of these are likely to be contingent. The first well in the area, Total’s Onesiphonous 1 targeting a Zohr-like play in Block 11, should spud this summer.

Israel is currently holding its first offshore bid round and officials are hopeful of attracting major interest. Independent research found that at a best guess there were resources totaling around 6.6 Bbo and 75 Tcfg as yet undiscovered in Israeli waters.

In the Lebanese sector to the east of Cyprus, the authorities are gearing up for an offshore licensing round after several years of delay. Companies are encouraged by the success with Zohr, and no fewer than 46 have pre-qualified so far. But joining the Lebanon into an export consortium with Israel is an additional geopolitical dimension, and should not be assumed.

Export of gas into Western Europe can be achieved by 2020. A 48” pipe could deliver 10.5 Tcf (300 Bcm) over a period of 10-15 years. Further exploration success – which the majors are betting heavily on – could extend this towards 2050. In the case of major new exploration success in the Lebanon or Cyprus sector, one can imagine a second pipeline in a follow up phase.

What is the Russian dimension? The current dependency of Europe on Russian gas exports varies from 100 percent (in the Baltic States) to 38 percent in Germany.

One of the key gas developments to watch is the Nordstream pipeline, a dual 48” pipe bringing Russian gas under the Baltic Sea and into Germany and Europe. Russian state company Gazprom delivered 6.35 Tcf (180 Bcm) of gas to Europe in 2016, almost 12.5 percent up on 2015, and no less than 34 percent of the total market, according to Deputy Chairman Aleksandr Medvedev. Although there are of course other significant suppliers – for example Norway (24 percent), Algeria (11 percent), Nigeria and Qatar – the energy dependency on Russia is obvious. Shell predicts that Russia will remain the number one supplier of gas until at least 2035. There are currently substantive discussions on the doubling of capacity of the Nord Stream pipeline (by adding two more 48” lines). Although Germany is pro, Denmark and the Baltic States are firmly opposed to this expansion. Related: Oil Industry Worried About Trump’s “Buy American”

But the biggest drawback for any East Mediterranean gas is that it must compete with relatively cheap Russian gas. It is estimated the probable landed gas price in Europe would be at least US$ 7/MMBtu. This compares with the average price of Gazprom gas in Europe in 2016 of US$ 4.90-5.00/MMBtu – a differential of some US$ 2.00/MMBtu.

The intensity of competition from Russian gas in Europe is set to increase further with the proposed 1.94 Tcfg/annum Nord Stream 2 pipeline which will side-step transit fees across Ukraine and Poland. The 1,224km Nord Stream 2 pipeline which parallels Nord Stream 1 could be completed in 2019 (well before an East Med pipeline could become operational).

Given the very tense political situation between the West and Russia, a reduction in this dependency – by adding the East Med as a major new gas source – would be a highly desirable outcome. The politics should drive the development of this pipeline very quickly.

Yesterday, Governor Alejandro Murat Hinojosa offered a rosier outlook: far from leaving, Walmart is going to open at least three new stores and Mexican hotel owner Grupo Posadas will build a new 200-room hotel in Oaxaca city.

The governor said during a meeting yesterday with members of the Mexican Association of Real Estate Professionals, or AMPI, that the conditions are in place to guarantee investment in the state, reactivate the economy and create jobs.

In addition to a third project — a 200-million-peso boutique hotel at the Yagul archaeological site, about 36 kilometers from Oaxaca city — the governor revealed he had met recently with Mexican and foreign investors who are considering projects worth US $2 billion.

In order to make things smoother, he said, the state will create a new agency to reduce bureaucratic procedures for those who wish to invest.

Although the sites of the new Walmart stores were not revealed, Grupo Posadas’ new Gran Fiesta Americana hotel will be located near the Parque El Llano in Oaxaca city’s historic center. The 500-million-peso property (US $27 million) will be self-sustaining, said company official Mariano Rosales, employing energy-saving lighting and systems to recycle and save water.

He said construction is almost set to begin and completion of the project will take about 18 months. The hotel will employ 250 people.

Meanwhile, the Oaxaca local of the CNTE teachers’ union, Section 22, is planning to mobilize in May, as it has done for years, and reorganize in order to “resist the assault by the state.”

Ltd.

Currently Chevron Bangladesh operates Block 12, Bibiyana Field, and Blocks 13 and 14, the Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar fields. Closing of the Bangladesh transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, the U.S. oil and gas major said today.

Himalaya Energy is held by a consortium of China ZhenHua Oil and CNIC Corp Ltd, a Chevron company spokesman told Reuters, but declined to say how much the deal was worth, or when completion was expected.

Back in February, ZhenHua Oil was said to have signed a preliminary deal to buy Chevron’s natural gas fields in Bangladesh estimated to be worth around $2 billion, Reuters reported.

Last summer Chevron was said to be selling $5 billion worth of assets in Asia as part of a plan to raise $10 billion total through global asset sales.

At the end of December 2016, Chevron said that its wholly owned subsidiaries had entered into a sales and purchase agreement with Star Energy Consortium to sell Chevron’s Indonesian and Philippines geothermal assets.

“This sale is aligned with our strategy to maximize the value of our global upstream businesses through effective portfolio management,” Jay Johnson, executive vice president, Upstream, Chevron Corporation, said back then.

Chevron announced the completion of the Indonesian asset sale on March 31, 2017, when it said that the conclusion of the sale of its geothermal business in the Philippines is expected later this year. Although the U.S. corporation has not released sums of the deals, Reuters had reported that the assets in Indonesia and the Philippines combined were valued at around $3 billion.
