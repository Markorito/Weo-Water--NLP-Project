0,0,Drought Sri Lanka,"With drought looming, Sri Lanka tries something new: preparing - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-drought-resilience-idUSKBN1520X6,"COLOMBO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With rainfall in many areas just a third of that last year and many water reservoirs far below normal levels, Sri Lankans have begun holding traditional ceremonies to invoke rain – some with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.

But this time, national officials are also doing something new to prepare for what many fear could be the worst drought in decades: Developing plans, in advance, to deal with it.

Those include everything from allowing communities to take only drinking water from drying reservoirs to removing taxes on imported rice and looking for alternatives to hydropower to maintain the national electric grid.

“The change came about because we were able to predict the onset of the drought well in advance and with detailed information,” said Lalith Chandrapala, the head of Sri Lanka’s Meteorological Department.

The country has had clear signs since last October that drought was coming, officials say. During 2016, Sri Lanka had only one period of exceptionally high rainfall, with some areas receiving over 300 mm (11 inches) of rain in three days, leading to flooding and landslides.

Apart from that, rain was less than normal almost all year. “We have a rainfall deficit and it is likely to stay that way until the next monsoon” in June and July, Chandrapala said.

According to the Meteorological Department, in some districts rainfall has been 30 to 40 percent of normal levels. Some of these districts are also among the country’s largest agriculture producers.

LESS RICE, LESS POWER

The lack of rainfall severely affected paddy rice production in the last growing season. According to the Disaster Management Center (DMC) only around 300,000 hectares out of a possible 800,000 were cultivated, largely because of a lack of irrigation water.

Reservoirs that will provide water for the next growing season, which starts in March, need to be at least half filled by that time to support a normal harvest. But DMC officials and Chandrapala said the country’s main reservoirs were currently less than a third full.

“It nothing like I have ever seen before,” said Ranjith Punyawardena, an agro-climatologist at the Department of Agriculture.

The lack of water is likely both to hurt agriculture and cut into supplies of vital hydropower. Already, as a result of drought, the country is getting 80 percent of its electricity from coal and oil and only 11 percent from hydropower.

Normally, at this time of year, the country would get at least 40 percent of its electricity from hydropower, according to the electricity board.

MAKING PLANS

To deal with the coming problems, Sri Lanka has set up a cross-ministry committee to come up with an action plan, said Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.

The committee includes high ranking officials representing agriculture, power, disaster management, finance and meteorology and has been meeting every two weeks, with meetings expected to become weekly from the middle of January on.

In an effort to stabilize rice prices in the market the government removed all taxes on rice imports on Jan. 7. Rice imports are expected rise in the next two months as available local stocks dwindle.

According to Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, minister of power and energy, the government is also prepared to enter into short term power-supply agreements with private companies to meet any further drop in hydropower production capacity.

The inter-ministerial committee is expected to launch a national power and water conservation program as well.

The committee has recommended that water use from national reservoirs be strictly monitored, something that has not be done in the past. Water from some of the reservoirs already has been limited for drinking purposes only.

“This time we are taking some precautions. Hopefully they will help us ease the worst impact” of the drought, Chandrapala said.","Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['reservoirs', 'tries', 'national', 'preparing', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'rainfall', 'drought', 'hydropower', 'officials', 'looming', 'rice', 'normal']", 
1,1,Drought Sri Lanka,Under the Radar: Sri Lanka’s drought threatens credit downgrade - Global Risk Insights,https://globalriskinsights.com/2017/03/under-the-radar-sri-lankas-drought/,"Sri Lanka’s ongoing drought is not only a humanitarian crisis, but also an economic one, as the country’s economy suffers on multiple fronts.

Sri Lanka has been experiencing rainfall shortages since last October, resulting in the worst drought in 40 years. With the country’s economy under severe stress, there is little relief in sight until the June / July monsoon season. Some districts have seen a 60-70% reduction in rainfall, resulting in widespread land degradation. This has led to the lowest amount of cultivated acreage in 30 years, with the World Food Program noting that only 35% of the country’s rice paddies had been cultivated by November 2016.

Concerns over food production are common during droughts, yet the situation in Sri Lanka highlights the convergence of multiple risk factors. The lack of rain has not only damaged rain-dependent crops, but has also led to a shortage of irrigation water necessary for the country’s water-intensive staple crop – rice. Agriculture accounts for 9% of Sri Lankan GDP and employs 28% of the country’s workforce. In response to the drought, the government announced the implementation of relief payments to the approximately 900,000 people affected by the drought.

Specifically, the government will provide Rs. 10,000 ($66) for every acre of blighted land per family per month for four months. With around half of national rice paddy acreage affected (1.5 million acres), the cost of this effort will account for between 0.1 and 0.2% of GDP; this does not include relief efforts for other crops.

Entire agricultural supply chain in turmoil

The agriculture sector is not expected to make a full recovery in 2017, even if sufficient rain falls during the rest of the year. In order to combat food shortages, the government has accepted food and water aid from India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand as well as increased food imports. To encourage imports Sri Lanka has cut import taxes on rice from 15 to 5 rupees per kilo. While this may aid imports, the measure also adds additional fiscal pressure on a government whose foreign reserves are dwindling.











Another issue are the government price controls on rice which, while fixing prices between Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kilo of various types of rice, risks unrest. The government is attempting to prevent inflation and price-gouging from further exasperating the food crisis, but not everyone is happy. While the move benefits (especially low income) citizens, rice millers are complaining about losses. Having purchased rice at higher wholesale prices prior to pricing limits, millers are now being forced to sell at a loss. On February 13th, some 120 leading millers refused to sell at government prices, calling for between Rs 80 to Rs 90 per kilo, and demanding to meet with President Maithripala Sirisena.

On February 21st, Sri Lanka’s price control agency conducted cross-country raids on 52 stores, arresting the owners for selling rice above government prices. Unlike small business owners, major millers have significant political clout, with one of the largest being Dudley Sirisena, the president’s brother. The government must walk a careful line in order to ensure cooperation from millers and protect food security. President Sirisena finds himself in a difficult position, especially since he championed his outsider status during the 2015 elections to win the presidency; touting his hardworking attitude, degree in agriculture and origin from Sri Lanka’s north-central rice bowl. If the populace thinks Sirisena is not doing enough to combat the drought, or is bending to pressure from business, the likelihood of unrest will increase.

More than food production affected

Concerns about the balance between business and public interest goes beyond rice milling, with MP Douglas Devananda warning against plans to relocate Coca Cola’s largest South Asian plant from India to Sri Lanka. Devananda has cited water-related complaints against Coca Cola’s 57 Indian bottling operations, including the fact that the company has been banned from drawing from the Thamirabaran river.

“With such [drought] conditions prevailing in Sri Lanka, Coca Cola wants to use our water resources to meet the demands of their largest consumer market in the region: India. How can this be allowed?” Devananda complained in parliament on February 24th.

The drought has also led to an energy crisis in Sri Lanka, as reservoirs are only at 29% capacity. As a result hydro-electricity generating rates are only 30% of installed capacity, a major problem for a country that relies on hydro-power for around 40% of total production. This forced state-owned utilities to purchase $50 million worth of electricity from the private sector in January and increase fuel imports: oil imports doubled in January alone. Increased fuel imports have further widened the trade deficit which has grown to $957 million (December 2016) up from $827 million in 2015. This is yet another financial drain on Sri Lanka and contributes to the rupee’s continuing devaluation. The rupee has already lost 1% in 2017, following a 3.9% drop in 2016 and 10% fall in 2015.

The rupee’s devaluation combined with increased imports and other drought effects saw consumer price inflation hit a record high of 6.8% in February compared to the same period in 2016. Dwindling foreign reserves threaten balance-of-payments pressure from foreign outflows at a time when Sri Lanka is negotiating up to $2.5 billion in foreign financing.

Drought threatens Sri Lanka’s IMF loan goals

Overall the effects of the drought have already lowered the 2017 GDP growth forecast from 6% to 5%. Direct government actions against the drought could cost $264 million, with state minister for finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena stating that the government may need around $1.5 billion for drought contingencies. By way of comparison the entire national budget for 2016 was $5.5 billion. The effects of the drought have derailed Sri Lanka’s efforts to tackle systemic overspending, with the government projecting a 17% increase in spending, versus a 0.6% increase in 2016.











With a budget deficit of 7.4% of GDP in 2015, Sri Lanka was already facing serious fiscal headwinds, as the country’s inability to rein in government spending undermines its financial stability. As a result the drought is hampering Sri Lanka’s efforts to reduce the budget deficit to 4.6% – a key goal of the country’s $1.5 billion IMF loan. With fiscal deficit calculated at 5.2% for 2017, Sri Lanka faces a credit downgrade if it fails to meet its loan conditions.

In response, finance minister Ravi Karunanayake countered that “we have drafted the budget factoring in these uncertainties […] The budget deficit doesn’t need to swell up just because of one abnormal condition.” The minister went on state he expects 6% growth despite the drought and that the government is not considering a waiver on the IMF’s deficit target. International observers are less optimistic, with Moody’s warning of the “negative credit effect of the drought” and assigning Sri Lanka a B1 credit rating with negative outlook.

Production of rice, the country’s staple food, is forecast to drop almost 40 percent to 2.7 million tonnes in 2017, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) said in a report on Thursday.

Other crops including pulses, chillies and onion are also expected to take a blow, it said.

Sri Lanka was hit by the worst drought in four decades last year, with poor rains continuing into 2017, causing many farmers to lose their crops and income, the agencies said.

In May, the situation was exacerbated by the worst torrential rains in 14 years, which triggered floods and landslides in the country’s southwest, killing some 200 people and forcing many from their homes.

But in drought-affected areas in the north, rains were not sufficient to replenish reservoirs, and the second 2017 rice paddy harvest is expected to be at least 24 percent lower than last year’s, said FAO official Cristina Coslet.

“The level of water in irrigation reservoirs is still well below the average,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

Some 225,000 households - or 900,000 people - face food insecurity, and have been forced to eat less and lower quality food, the report said.

Unable to grow their own crops, many families have to buy food at local markets where prices have spiked due to the crisis, it said.

FAO and WFP said seeds, equipment, irrigation support, and cash assistance are urgently needed to help farmers in the next planting season starting in September, and to prevent conditions from deteriorating.

“If (the planting season) fails the situation will worsen a lot for the families affected,” Coslet said.","Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['situation', 'worst', 'wfp', 'threaten', 'sri', 'security', 'lankas', 'food', 'drought', 'crops', 'season', 'production', 'slash', 'floods', 'rains', '2017', 'thomson', 'rice']",

Following the bad harvests, many, the agencies add, are now also forced to buy food from local markets.

As access for families to nutritious food has been reduced – forcing many to eat less – prices at local markets have risen sharply, with rice prices reaching an all-time high in January.

Now, nearly 225,000 households (or about 900,000 people) face food insecurity, the UN agencies say.

A previous joint assessment showed that in 10 districts about one third of the drought-affected population had its regular income reduced by more than half.

To cover immediate needs, FAO and WFP are calling in the current Crop and Food Security Assessment for the urgent provision of seeds, as well as planting and irrigation equipment for the next planting season, from September to December, as well as support for irrigation systems.

Additionally, both agencies recommend quick and targeted cash assistance for the poorest and most vulnerable families to ensure adequate food intake and to prevent them from incurring unsustainably high debt or adopting other coping mechanisms that could have long-term negative effects.

Rice production to drop by nearly 40 per cent in 2017

Based on findings in the report, which assesses the seriousness of a crisis situation by looking at the food produced nationally and the extent to which poor people can meet their basic food needs, both agencies argue that drought conditions in 2016 and early 2017 led to widespread crop failures, in particular for rice paddy – the country's staple food.

Total paddy production in 2017 is forecast at 2.7 million metric tonnes, almost 40 per cent less than the last year's output and 35 per cent lower than the average of the previous five years.

Following last month's severe flooding and landslides, the agencies note that the heavy rains did not ease the water supply constraints in the drought-impacted north-central and eastern parts of the South Asian country.

Looking ahead, the situation may further deteriorate if the next cropping season fails. Current predictions show the second 2017 paddy harvest – known as Yala, due to be harvested in August and September – is forecast at 1.2 million metric tonnes, 24 per cent below last year's level.","Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2017/06/27506/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['situation', 'food', 'floods', 'vulnerable', 'paddy', 'regional', 'season', 'wake', 'agencies', 'tonnes', 'sri', 'warn', 'wfp', 'cent', 'lankas', 'drought', 'gap', '2017', 'widens']",

* Drought affects 16 districts of Sri Lanka, government to compensate farmers

Sat, Feb 25, 2017, 09:30 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Feb 25, Colombo: As prevailing drought continues to affect people in Sri Lanka farmland, the government has decided to continue to provide compensations to the affected people.

Dry Weather Sri Lanka has been experiencing in most of the country since the beginning of 2016 has affected people in 16 districts while a vast area of agricultural lands has been destroyed.

According to the Disaster Management Center, as of 21 February 899,235 people of 228,906 families from 103 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in 16 Districts including Trincomalee, Kalutara, Gampaha, Hambantota, Monaragala, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Puttalam, Kandy, and Matale have been affected by the prevailing dry weather.

Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadarshana Yapa says the extent of land destroyed by the drought is being assessed at the Divisional Secretariat level, and the government has decided to continuously provide compensations to the owners of those agricultural lands for four months from March.

President Maithripala Sirisena last week instructed the relevant officials to take necessary measures to provide an allowance of Rs.10,000 per month each for all the drought-affected farming families in the island.

Accordingly, Rs. 10,000 will be granted for a destroyed acre of paddy field while other crop plantations are also compensated, the Agricultural and Agrarian Insurance Board said.

Ministry of Finance has already allocated Rs. 50 million to provide required drinking water for the people in those districts.

The Government through the District Secretaries has already spent Rs. 32 million for drinking water, clearing the sources, fuel for bowsers, over time payments for bowser drivers and assistants and for administrative expenditures. In addition, 2,370 of the 1,000L water tanks have also been distributed and 3,000 more tanks have been ordered, the Minister further said.

The current drought is forecast to have a devastating impact on rice production. Even if rainfall is received in the early months of the year, Sri Lanka's agricultural sector is unlikely to make a full recovery in 2017, ACAPS said in a recent report.

The drought has impacted on the power sector also as water levels in reservoirs that generate hydropower have dropped to 31 percent of capacity.","Sat, 25 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",,"['farmers', 'rs', 'affects', 'compensate', 'agricultural', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'districts', 'drought', 'affected', 'provide', '16']", 
5,5,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka hit by worst drought in decades - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/1/22/sri-lanka-hit-by-worst-drought-in-decades,"Dry spell affects more than a million people, with authorities warning of more water shortages.

Sri Lanka is suffering its worst drought in four decades, according to officials, with more than a million people experiencing acute water shortages.

The lack of rain last year has lowered water levels in rivers in parts of the country. With less water available to drain the sea salt, supplies have been contaminated, especially in the town of Kalutara, south of the capital, Colombo.

In the village of Kaluganga, more than 200,000 people are affected, as they lack access to clean drinking water.

With rain not expected for another two to three months, the government is warning of worsening shortages.

Reservoirs in the country are running low and some are now down to a fifth of their capacity.

“This drought is affecting both the agricultural and the hydro-power generation,” Lalith Chandrapala, director general of the meteorological department, told Al Jazeera.

“It is one of the worst droughts since the 1970s.”

Farmers have been badly hit by the dry spell as they have managed to plant only a third of the usual 800,000 hectares of paddy fields – the lowest in 30 years.

There are disturbing signs that up to half of the crops will fail and the next planting season is also in jeopardy.



“All our paddy was destroyed,” said Rabanda, a farmer. “We don’t have a way to survive and now we don’t even have water to drink.”

A task force has been set up by the government to deal with food shortages and rising prices as a result of the drought.","Sun, 22 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/0fb74b2e4935475f99591a263a8e9621_18.jpeg?fit=999%2C562,"['warning', 'spell', 'million', 'dry', 'rain', 'worst', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'drought', 'hit', 'lack', 'paddy', 'decades']", 
6,6,Drought Sri Lanka,"In parched Sri Lanka, biggest shortage is of water policy: experts - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sri-lanka-drought-water-idUSKCN12I0PA,"MAHASENPURA, Sri Lanka (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In this village in southern Sri Lanka’s Hambantota District, water sales are big business.

Beset by a prolonged dry spell and day-time temperatures reaching above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Farenheit), the village has seen all of its wells run dry.

Water arrives once every three days in the form of a free government tanker, but it’s not always enough to last. Buying a tanker of water privately costs 5,000 rupees ($34), more than most people can pay.

Instead the village’s farmers and traders buy their water in one-liter bottles from small-scale vendors who charge four to 10 rupees a liter (less than one U.S. cent) for drinking water brought from about 30 kilometers away.

“We buy drinking water, and try to use other sources for cooking and washing,” said Sarath Mahanama, one villager. Those other sources include the muddy puddle left in the bottom of a nearly empty nearby water reservoir.

Mahasenpura is not alone in its shortages. Nine districts in Sri Lanka’s Southern, Northern, North Eastern and southeastern Uva provinces have been hit by drought. According to the national Disaster Management Center, by mid-October over 875,000 people were being provided with government tanker water in these areas.

The worst hit area, where over 160,000 people are currently dependent on water brought in from outside, is north-central Polonnaruwa District.

“This is what we undergo every year. After the floods, there will be a drought and we are almost dying of thirst,” said Tissa Poddibanda, a villager from the Lankapura area.

Lankapura is one of the worst-affected sites in the country, with close to 30,000 persons waiting for transported water.

DROUGHT TO FLOODS

As the weather becomes more extreme, Sri Lanka finds itself increasingly in a debilitating pattern of alternating between drought and floods – both of which can lead to shortages of clean water.

In May, large areas of the country were flooded which caused damages of more than $3 billion, according to the Finance Ministry. Three months later drought hit.

While weather experts and policy makers increasingly see the worrisome pattern, potentially effective national interventions are not yet in place, experts say.

Today, in some drought-hit areas of Sri Lanka, for instance, water remains in storage dams but officials are reluctant to release it, fearing there will not be enough irrigation water for farmers to plant in the next growing season that starts in November.

The Parakarama Samudraya, the largest reservoir in northern Polonnaruwa District, is currently at about 50 percent of capacity, officials say. But government irrigation officials say they don’t want to release the waters – and the next wave of heavy rains is expected only in mid-November, with the onset of the Northeast monsoon season.

As competition for water grows, better cooperation is needed between the various government agencies handling water to balance the needs of farmers, hydropower suppliers and household users, said S.L. Weerasinghe, director-general of the national irrigation department.

“Right now there is very little coordination between various entities handling water, from power to agriculture. We need a much more cohesive water management policy to safely release water stored for agriculture,” Weerasinghe said.

‘NOT PREPARED’

Lack of public awareness about the extent of the country’s water problems – and how they might be better managed – is another problem, water management experts say.

“We are not prepared to meet these impacts” of climate change, said Kusum Athukorala, who heads the Sri Lanka Water Partnership, a non-profit national organization working on water management.

She said that since Sri Lanka’s devastating 2004 tsunami the island has upgraded and strengthened its disaster response capacity but hardly any work had been done on preparing for disasters and building public awareness about them.

Villagers such as Poddibanda, who are the mercy of changing rainfall patterns, have had little help in learning to manage water better, though it is crucial to their economic well being, experts say.

Poddibanda, like most farmers in water-short Lankapura, waits until he believes rains are close to arriving to prepare his paddy rice plot for cultivation – and he expects the government to provide free irrigation water, irrespective of rain and reservoir levels.

He said he has not responded to government requests for farmers to break with tradition and plant when water is available, rather than at traditional times.

“I don’t know how to do that,” Poddibanda admitted.

Athukorala said a sustained public awareness campaign is needed to build community knowledge about water management, and a national water management policy is needed to coordinate water planning among sectors such as power, agriculture, weather, irrigation and disaster management.

In addition, “we have to take care of each spring, each river, each well. You do preventive medicine and spend less on curative medicine,” she urged.","Tue, 18 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['weather', 'farmers', 'national', 'biggest', 'lanka', 'water', 'sri', 'drought', 'irrigation', 'experts', 'management', 'parched', 'shortage', 'policy']", 
7,7,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought Could Cost Sri Lanka Billions - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/drought-could-cost-sri-lanka-billions,"Sri Lanka is heading into one of its worst droughts in recent history, and according some estimates the worst in 30 years. The reservoirs are running on empty, at 30 percent or less capacity. Only 12 percent of the island’s power generation is currently from hydropower and 85 percent comes from thermal, with a staggering 41 percent from coal.

The rains have stayed away like never before. According to a recent survey by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the government, last year’s rains were 23 percent less than the 30-year average.

Now the instructions: Use water sparingly, do not wash vehicles with pipe-borne water, do not put air conditioning below 26 C, and light bonfires in the morning if you want to protect your crops from the morning mist, a forerunner, according to local yore, of a impending drought.

“It is a very serious situation, something that we have not faced in a long time, but we are taking precautions,” said Lalith Chandarapala, the head of the Meteorological Department. It was his department that first warned of the drought when the rains failed yet again last year around September.

In fact, in 2016, there were only three days of exceptionally high rains, during mid-May, when 300 mm fell on some parts of the island. On either side of them, it was drier than usual.

The effects have been catastrophic. Of a possible 800,000 acres, only a little above 300,000 was planted with the staple rice crops during the last harvesting season due to lack of water.

“This is the lowest cultivation level experienced in Sri Lanka during the last thirty years,” the WFP-government joint survey said. It estimated that by end of December, already close to a million people were affected by the drought in 23 of the 25 districts. By the third week of January, the government’s Disaster Management Center said that over 900,000 were receiving water brought in from outside.

“Even if the country receives average rains in the months of January and February 2017, it is highly unlikely that the current drought situation will improve until March 2017,” the joint assessment warned.

The government has already slashed taxes on rice imports to fend off price hikes as well as shortages and decided to buy power on short-term agreements from private suppliers till the next rains. The additional power purchases are expected to cost the government Rs 50b.

It has also restricted water supply to areas where there is an acute shortage of safe water and ordered a survey of private wells. Millions of Sri Lankan households use dug wells for domestic consumption without any purview by any authority. Any move to curtail such use or to use these wells for public supplies will be a deeply unpopular move.

Apart from the short-term impacts of such frequent extreme weather events, experts also worry about the long term implications.

“Changing climate is an issue we have to deal with, our policies now have to reflect awareness as well as adaptation measures,” Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshna Yapa said.

One of these long-term consequences that is rarely highlighted is the impact droughts have on land degradation.

The United Nations’ Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates that 45 percent of the country’s rural population was living in degrading agricultural areas at the turn of the millennium, and that within a decade that population grew by a further 20 percent.

Researchers at the UNCCD headquarters warned that “when there is drought, most of the plant cover dies, which leaves the land exposed to wind erosion, and to water erosion when the rains return. In addition, long dry spells can make it difficult for the ground to soak up the rainfall, which is the source of ground water.”

A little known fact is that land degradation has serious impact on Sri Lanka’s economy. “Land degradation may be costing Sri Lanka up to about 300 million United States dollars every year. That is approximately one percent of the country’s gross domestic product,” UNCCD said in a statement to IPS.

In rural Sri Lanka, the impact of generations of land use without proper care is clear. In the southern Hambantota District, farmers who depend on water supply for cultivation have been moving deeper into forests and reserves as water availability becomes less and less reliable in more populated areas.

In the Andaraweva area in Hambantota, about 20 km from the closest town a large banana plantation has come up within what is essentially a forest reserve. The plantation which could be as large 20 acres, gains water from a tank meant to be for wildlife nearby.

The cultivators who have obtained written permission from local government officials to use the tank water, much to chagrin of wildlife officials, use five industrial level pumps powered by small tractor motors to pump the water and send it about a1km into the plantation.

The small lake is being dried out by the over use of water, forcing wildlife officials to despair over water for animals.

“We have been abusing our water resources for so long, at least now we should be more careful with it, or we would have to be really, really sorry,” head of the Hambantota Wildlife office Ajith Gunathunga said.","Wed, 25 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/SLdrought-629x448.jpg?itok=YTnMjPkw,"['unccd', 'land', 'wells', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'drought', 'cost', 'long', 'wildlife', 'rains', 'billions']", 
8,8,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka: From Drought to Flood in Less Than Two Months – Food Tank - Food Tank,https://foodtank.com/news/2017/06/sri-lanka-worst-flood-in-decades/,"Recently, Sri Lanka experienced the worst flooding in 14 years, brought on by monsoon rains across southwestern portions of the country which have affected an estimated 684,000 people, according to the country’s U.N. Resident Coordinator. A total of 212 deaths had been confirmed and 79 people remained missing as of early June.

The main cause for severe flooding was two rivers overflowing, particularly in the southern Galle and Kalutara. CNN reported that Ratnapura—63 miles southeast of the capital Colombo—experienced up to 453 millimeters (17.8 inches) of rain over just three days. Ratnapura was the district with the highest death count of any area, with 79 deaths. There, shops and houses remained submerged in 3 to 9 meters (10 to 30 feet) of water.

As average rainfall begins to decrease, it’s replaced by concern about landslides, mainly in Ratnapura, Kalutara, Galle, Kegalle, Matara, Nuwara Eliya, and Hambanota districts. About 22,000 people remain temporarily displaced in 202 safe locations, while 2,500 houses have been destroyed and 15,890 are partially damaged, according to U.N. Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka.

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reported that the Government has released a grant of 166 million Sri Lankan rupees (nearly US$1,084,000) for the flood response. A total of 22 agencies are currently providing health, protection, education, food security, WASH, emergency shelter, Non-Food Items (NFIs), and early recovery activities in nine districts. U.N. Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has set an Emergency Response Plan for US$22.7 million, which outlines the support between U.N. agencies and NGOs.

Meanwhile, some are pointing to a lack of prevention measures prior to these events. In a speech in Galle, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena said “people who oppose prevention plans are the ones who cry hoarse when the floods occur” The Wire reports.

International response has been prompt, as neighboring countries like India, Australia, Russia, China, and Bangladesh have provided assistance with the emergency and recovery operations. Rains have also hit Thailand, producing heavy rainfall and widespread flooding.

Extreme weather caused these monsoon rains to be the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003. This comes just two months after nearly 900,000 people were affected by the country’s worst drought in 40 years, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), and were undergoing serious food insecurity and malnutrition.

9,9,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka's food production hit by extreme drought followed by floods - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/sri-lankas-food-production-hit-by-extreme-drought-followed-by-floods/,"A severe drought followed by heavy rainfalls in Sri Lanka has hit large swaths of cropping areas, threatening the food security of some 900,000 people, according to a report published last week by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).

According to the joint Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission, drought conditions in 2016 and early 2017 led to widespread crop failures, in particular for rice paddy - the country’s staple food. Total paddy production in 2017 is forecast at 2.7 million tonnes, almost 40 per cent less than the last year’s output and 35 per cent lower than the average of the previous five years.

Other crops, including various pulses, chillies and onion, which rely mainly on rainwater, were also heavily damaged by the dry weather.

The situation was exacerbated by subsequent heavy rainfalls in May. Floods and landslides in the south-western parts of the country caused deaths, large population displacements and damage to infrastructure. The rains did not ease the water supply constraints in the drought-impacted north-central and eastern parts of the country.

Now, nearly 225,000 households (or about 900,000 people) face food insecurity. The most vulnerable groups are struggling to earn an income after losing their own crops and have fewer employment opportunities.

In ten districts, a previous joint assessment showed that about one third of the drought-affected population had its regular income reduced by more than half, compared to the income generated from the 2015 to 2016 Maha season.

The situation may further deteriorate if the next cropping season fails. Due to a critical shortage of seeds and a lack of water for irrigation, the second 2017 paddy harvest - known as Yala, due to be harvested in August and September - is forecast at 1.2 million tonnes, 24 per cent below last year’s level.

Increasing food insecurity

Most families surveyed would usually grow their own food, but with the bad main harvest, many are now forced to buy food from local markets, where food prices have risen sharply. Rice prices reached an all-time high in January 2017 reducing the ability of families to access nutritious food.

Many of those affected have been forced to eat less. Interviews with households and market vendors showed that people were buying cheaper food whenever possible. Many reported a reduction in the purchase of meat and fish.

Urgent assistance required

To cover immediate needs, FAO and WFP call for the urgent provision of seeds as well as planting and irrigation equipment for the next Maha planting season from September to December, as well as support for irrigation systems.

The poorest and most vulnerable families should also quickly receive targeted cash assistance in order to ensure adequate food intake and to prevent families from incurring unsustainably high debt or adopting other coping mechanisms that affect them negatively over the longer term.

Recognising the increasing frequency of natural disasters affecting the agricultural sector and the impact on food security, it is also recommended to introduce longer-term measures to increase farmers’ and households’ resilience to natural disasters and climate change, such as promotion of drought tolerant crops and varieties and livelihood diversification.","Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://eco-business.imgix.net/uploads/ebmedia/fileuploads/6820527414_1e335884b1_z.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,"['families', 'extreme', 'income', 'followed', 'sri', 'households', 'lankas', 'drought', 'hit', 'food', 'security', 'irrigation', 'production', 'crops', 'floods', '2017', 'paddy']", 
10,10,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka ramps up fuel imports as drought hits hydropower - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/sri-lanka-fuel-imports-idUKL4N1FO2MR,"* Severe drought curbs hydropower in Sri Lanka

* Stokes imports of diesel, fuel oil -sources

* Infrastructure push could also support demand for diesel

SINGAPORE/COLOMBO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s fuel imports in January jumped to double typical monthly levels, with the country rushing to plug an energy shortfall as severe drought hits its hydropower output, industry sources said.

The South Asian nation is suffering its worst drought in over 40 years, dragging hydro’s share of Sri Lanka’s power mix to below 11 percent in 2016 from an annual average of about 35 percent, said Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at energy consultancy FGE.

“As a result, fuel oil and diesel consumption in thermal power plants increased, partly to offset the hydropower deficit,” Kumaran said.

“High fuel oil imports should continue amidst range-bound crude prices.”

Ceylon Petroleum Corp, the country’s state-owned oil importer, has been requesting bigger-than-usual volumes of diesel and fuel oil in the spot market, traders said.

It has bought about 260,750 more barrels of diesel in January than December and around 260,000 more barrels of fuel oil, said a source close to the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Sri Lanka typically imports 26,000 to 32,000 barrels per day (bpd) of diesel and 6,000 to 10,000 bpd of fuel oil, Kumaran said.

A delay in awarding term oil contracts also caused a spike in spot imports, traders said.

“We have decided to increase imports of fuel oil mainly and more diesel as well because the Ceylon Electricity Board needs more for power generation,” a senior Ceylon Petroleum official said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with the media.

“(Ceylon Petroleum) is also going to maintain additional stocks of fuel and diesel due to the drought. So both these products will be maintained at more than required levels.”

Sri Lanka’s fuel oil demand will likely grow by about 14 percent year-on-year to 24,000 bpd in 2017 and diesel demand will increase by 7 percent year-on-year to 53,000 bpd, FGE’s Kumaran said.

An improving housing market, lower interest rates and government efforts to speed up infrastructure projects will keep supporting diesel demand in the next two or three years, Kumaran added.

14,14,Drought Sri Lanka,Coping with Climate Change and Variability: Lessons from Sri Lankan Communities - Sri Lanka - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/sri-lanka/coping-climate-change-and-variability-lessons-sri-lankan-communities,"Summary

Across Sri Lanka, climate change related weather aberrations and resultant extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common. While this affects the country at large, farmers and agricultural workers face the worst impacts of this variability. The increased frequency of flood and drought incidence in the last ten years has caused severe hardship to poor farmers across Sri Lanka.

The Small Grants Programme of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF SGP) in Sri Lanka with the financial assistance from Australian AID implemented a number of Community Based Adaptation (CBA) initiatives during 2010 to 2014 seeking solutions to some of the impacts of climate change. These projects could be considered among the country’s first scientifically designed responses to manage risks of climate change-induced changes: to weather patterns and natural resources depletion.

In the design and implementation of these projects, GEF SGP attempted to improve livelihood resilience and ensure water and food security to communities at risk by directly engaging in aspects of science, technology and research. The combination of laying a scientific basis for the interventions, implementation of projects through community based organizations and the engagement of local government actors strengthened the delivery of project targets, and laid the foundation for their eventual sustainability.

This publication is an attempt to capture the lessons and document the important challenges faced during the five years of project implementation, which is important to improve the country’s strategic focus on adaptation to climate change.

Main Lessons Learnt During Implementation: There is a lack of awareness about climate change impacts on livelihood among farmers and local government officials especially those engaged in water management and agriculture extension. As such, farmers are not supported to adapt to changed rainfall patterns and seasons with proper advice on crop choice, water saving methods or diversification of livelihoods so that dependence on rainfall is minimized. Year after year, farmers cultivate the same crop combinations, depending on seeds imported by the private sector and on agrochemical suppliers to provide them with information and advice for managing threats to their crops. This trend has resulted in deep indebtedness among rural households and a lack of disposable income for capital investments needed to a durable change in resilience.

While communities are willing to take action to reduce their vulnerability, they feel that the barriers are too great to overcome by themselves. Communities list poverty (lack of finances to invest in solutions) and lack of technology or awareness of available options and lack of supportfrom local When designing the activities in each CBA location, a rapid Vulnerability Reduction Assessment (VRA)1 and a trend analysis of weather changes of the previous five years was undertaken at every project site. Activity design therefore responded to the most pressing climate related weather change. However, during the project period, all pilot project sites experienced far greater level of climatic extreme events than anticipated or planned. This placed great stress on the communities and the local organizations that found themselves responding to the urgent humanitarian needs of flood and drought instead of investing in longer term resilience building.

It was also noted that the initially designed project period (18 months) is insufficient to build long term capacity for resilience among the very poor farmers who face the greatest climate change related livelihood risks. Further, while projects addressed one dimension of vulnerability- the physical exposure to climate risks; often communities have other, underlying and entrenched (social, economic) factors that could not be addressed by the planned intervention due to financial and time constraints. In some locations, strong partnerships developed during the implementation of the project, especially with local governments, which had positive results such as communities’ ability to overcome marginalization and lack of services. However stronger policy-level initiatives are required to support communities to overcome entrenched inequality and marginalization.

Some of the best practices that emerged from project implementation are;

1) Strong local presence of the civil society organizations entrusted with project implementation.

Through this, there was greater investment in local capacity building and retention of that capacity in the villages. The CSOs worked closely with locally established committees to design and deliver the interventions. Their local presence, even after the project was completed meant that the CSO remained accountable to the local people.

2) High level of cooperation from government officials, technical institutes, and extension services such as from the Agriculture Instructors working in the districts meant that the government was on board and engaged to provide solutions and ensure post-project sustainability. While there were many teething issues at the beginning of project design and implementation, all pilot projects were completed with satisfactory levels of local government officials’ cooperation.

3) In every location strong and active farmer/community organizations either existed or were initiated through the projects to implement and upkeep the interventions. All meetings and training programmes were conducted with the participation of community members to demonstrate transparency. In many locations farmer organizations were actively engaged in monitoring project progress and supervising any external contractors tasked with civil works during the project.

4) A number of technical best practices can be acknowledged, such as seed and crop selection, agronomic practices such as improving soil quality, crop-livestock integration, land management, water harvesting and improving kitchen gardens were successfully undertaken through the project. These have enhanced the knowledge of marginalized farmers mainly on resilient agriculture and water management.

Up Scaling of Community Based Adaptation (CBA) Initiatives and Best Practices

Successful adaptive practices that have shown positive results in these pilot projects of the CBA have been up-scaled and integrated in to larger climate adaptation projects. A US$ 8 million proposal for rain-fed and minor irrigated areas in the Mahaweli River Basin which based its modalities on the CBA practices is now funded through the Adaptation Fund and implemented by the Ministry of Environment, in collaboration with the World Food Programme. A second initiative on rural livelihood development to withstand climate related shocks is being implemented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs funded by Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). A larger initiative on rehabilitation of tanks is approved (2016) to rehabilitate small village irrigation systems funded through the Green Climate Fund (GCF)

Steps taken by the government of President Maithripala Sirisena in recent days included deploying soldiers, establishing a presidential commission and urging the population to be prudent in the consumption of water, Efe news reports.

The National Water Supply and Sanitation Council warned on Sunday of the need to rationalize the consumption of drinking water, as the currently available reserve is only expected to last for two months.

Alahudeen Ansar, the head of the council, said that drinking water demand had increased by 15 per cent and that measures have already been taken to restrict its use in many areas of the 13 affected districts.

Sri Lankan authorities have expressed concern that the situation may lead to social instability in a country where 31.8 per cent of its 22 million inhabitants directly depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.

The Deputy Minister of Provincial Council and Local Government, Karunarathna Paranawithana, said on Saturday that there had already been rumours about farmers are threatening to open water reservoirs to access the vital resource.

The situation led President Sirisena this week to appoint a presidential task force with the participation of key ministries and secretaries of state to take action to tackle the problem after the Department of Meteorology said on Friday that the country was facing the worst drought in 40 years.","Sun, 15 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1484512472-slk.jpg,"['state', 'warns', 'worst', 'situation', 'sirisena', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'council', '40', 'drought', 'presidential', 'president', 'taken', 'measures']", 
16,16,Drought Sri Lanka,"With Rains Erratic, Competition for Water Increases in Southern Sri Lanka - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/rains-erratic-competition-water-increases-southern-sri-lanka,"HAMBANTOTA, SRI LANKA - Tucked inside a large forest near the drying Andaraweva iirrigation reservoir, a well-tended plantation of young banana trees is growing strongly despite dry weather.

The plantation, of at least 10 acres, is unauthorized but has been growing for two years, say wildlife rangers policing the forest.

""They just come in, clear the jungle and plant whatever they want. There is absolutely nothing that anybody can do,"" said Ajith Gunathunga, head of the Hambantota wildlife office.

Illegal plantings in forest areas are on the rise in drought-hit southern Sri Lanka, where farmers struggling with water shortages worsened by climate change are looking for any way to get a crop.

Jayalath, who lives in a village near the banana plantation and who would not give his surname, fearing legal action, said he and other residents had together planted the bananas, as water for other crops outside the forest ran low.

Asked permission

""We sought government permission to use the water from the tank nearby as a farmer collective and got permission,"" he said.

The group did not mention to the village official who gave permission to use the water that it was for the banana plantation, Jayalath said.

The official, who did not want to give his name, confirmed he had verbally approved the group's use of water from the tank. Wildlife rangers say they cannot act to remove illegal crops in forest land, because that action needs to be taken by the Forestry Department.

But forestry officers say that since the farmers' collective has received some type of official authorization to use water in the forest, taking action against the plantation would be difficult.

The banana plantation is fed from a water storage tank — intended for animals — located about a kilometer away. The water, sucked up by five industrial water pumps powered by small tractor engines, flows in channels to the field.

But the heavy use of water for the plantation is now leaving others — including elephants, deer and other wild animals in the area — with less water available, said Gunathunga of the wildlife service.

""The problem is there is overuse of water and the animals now find it hard to survive. The unpredictability of the rains makes this competition for water very serious,"" he said.

Unreliable rain

Rains are becoming increasing erratic in the region. In May this year, heavy rain fell, but then was followed by four arid months where temperatures consistently hit 40 degrees Celsius, according to the Meteorological Department.

In the past, temperatures would have been lower, with the summer months interrupted by rain.

""The impact of climate change is here and clear. What we need now are measures to adjust to those changes,"" said W.H. Karunarathne, the Hambantota District secretary, the top government official in the district.

Such measures should include more monitoring of water use and planting of crops that require less water, he said.

He admitted that it was difficult to take action against farmers who are struggling with a lack of water. But the top government official in the district added that farmers and state officials were devising new means to adapt to varying water availability.

""The crux of the problem is that water availability does not follow traditional patterns now, and people don't know what to do,"" he said.

This year, when the rice harvest was completed in May, Karunarathne's office urged farmers to plant crops that need little water in their fields before planting paddy rice again the following season.

That is a change from the traditional practice of leaving dried-out rice paddies unused until the next rains.

Government seed

Over 4,000 acres were planted with government-provided green gram seed — also known as mung beans — this year. Though the experiment was not wholly

successful, some farmers were able to earn the equivalent of 80 cents per kilo for the additional crop.

A number of farmers resisted the effort, Karunarathne said, but he believes fewer farmers will be skeptical next year after seeing the harvest.

In another case this summer, Karunarathne used weather information provided by the Meteorological Department to authorize the release of water stored for rice production to rescue dry banana plantations, after the farmers sought his

help. Such releases remain rare in Sri Lanka.

""I had a look at the weather updates and released water based on that despite protests by traditional paddy farmers in the region,"" Karunaratne said. In the end, ""we saved the bananas as well as the paddy.""

Wildlife official Gunathunga believes more such coordinated action is needed.

""We are all on the same page here: the farmers, the animals and the officials. We need to work together,"" he said.","Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/443D30F9-0A6D-4D7D-9F22-94141D3172D3.jpg,"['farmers', 'lanka', 'water', 'sri', 'competition', 'forest', 'action', 'crops', 'increases', 'banana', 'rains', 'plantation', 'wildlife', 'southern', 'erratic', 'rice', 'official']",

COLOMBO – Concluding a three-day mission to Sri Lanka, the Executive Director of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, joined government, civil society, the private sector, academia and the UN community in the launch of the National Strategic Review on Food Security and Nutrition – Towards Zero Hunger. Cousin praised the efforts of the Government to place food and nutrition security at the core of the country’s development agenda.

“This Strategic Review offers concrete short and long term recommendations for achieving zero hunger. The Sri Lankan Government has embraced the recommendations for addressing the food security and nutrition challenges created by recurrent droughts and floods,” said Cousin.

“Every Government official with whom I met welcomed the offer of assistance from WFP for meeting the needs of those affected by the most recent drought while also acknowledging the assistance and value of the Strategic Review in fulfilling the country’s potential to feed its own people. The Sri Lankan leaders I met are clearly committed to developing sustainable food systems,” said Cousin, after her meeting yesterday with President Maithripala Sirisena.

WFP and the Government are planning to expand existing cash and food for work programmes to support farmers and rural communities who risk falling deeper into food insecurity because of the current drought, which means the upcoming Maha harvest could be the worst main agricultural harvest in decades.

Latest estimates indicate that already around one million people across the country have been affected by the drought in the form of lost crops or income and restricted access to water. The Government currently estimates that some 480,000 food-insecure people will need assistance to prevent them spiralling deeper into debt, hunger and hardship.

Cousin attended the launch on Monday of Sri Lanka’s National Strategic Review on Food Security and Nutrition, the blueprint for the country’s ongoing efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2; end hunger, achieve improved food security and nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. The exceptional research effort was led by former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, chairperson of the South Asia Policy and Research Institute, and involved consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.

“This strategic review provides a framework for the partnerships across sectors that are vital to translate global aims into local actions. The Government has shown strong leadership in the review process but addressing the ambitious recommendations in the report will also require partnerships with private sector, civil society, academia, NGOs and the UN.

“WFP is also changing the way it works, and through its five-year Country Strategic Plan will seek to ensure its activities are closely aligned with the priorities set by the Government,” added Cousin

In her meetings with the president and cabinet ministers, Cousin discussed how WFP could support Sri Lanka’s efforts to create more robust, resilient food systems, to overcome climate-induced shocks that are increasingly frequent.

Cousin also traveled to Monaragala, one of the country’s poorest districts, to view WFP’s work to boost the resilience of vulnerable communities. She visited cash for work programmes involving organic home and community gardens and elephant fencing, designed to prevent the loss of lives homes and farms due to elephant-human conflict, which is likely to be exacerbated by the current drought.

“Maha” cereal crop in 2017 significantly impaired by dry weather conditions

Rice import needs forecast to increase in 2017

Prices of rice hit record levels in December, while those of wheat remain generally stable

Large numbers of people affected by lingering effects of drought in 2016

Dry weather conditions impair the 2017 “maha” cereal output significantly

The bulk of the 2017 largely irrigated “maha” rice crop, normally accounting for 65 percent of the annual production, was planted by the end of December. The below-average rainfall since the start of the season in October, coupled with low irrigation water availability, resulted in significant cuts in the area planted, further reducing yield prospects for the season. The latest official estimates of plantings indicate that, as of end-November, 327 000 hectares were put under the 2017 “maha” paddy crop, 50 percent below the area planted at the same time in 2016. The FAO’s Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) for the 3 dekad of December 2016 indicated a risk of drought conditions developing in various main rice-producing areas, including Northern, North Central and Eastern provinces. As a result, FAO’s outlook for the 2017 “maha” season paddy output is unfavourable. Given the current low water levels in main reservoirs, there is also concern for the 2017 irrigated secondary “yala” crop, to be planted from April, if rains do not improve in the coming weeks.

Prospects for the 2017 main season maize crop, to be harvested from February, are also unfavourable, due to the dry spell.

Rice import requirements forecast to increase in 2017 on expectations of reduced output

Total cereal imports requirements in 2017 are forecast to increase from last year’s already high level. The increase is mainly driven by the unfavourable prospects for the 2017 rice production. Imports of wheat, which is not produced domestically, are anticipated to remain at last year’s high level of 1.2 million tonnes, reflecting strong domestic demand.

Prices of rice hit record levels in December, while those of wheat generally stable

Domestic prices of rice, the main staple food in the country, rose considerably for four consecutive months, reaching record levels in December 2016. The spike in prices is due to the reduced 2016 secondary “yala” output, harvested in September, and the unfavourable prospects for the main 2017 “maha” crop. In an attempt to ease rice prices, the Government began releasing paddy from public stocks to millers in late December. In addition, the Government plans to import rice and reduce duties and taxes on imported rice in early January 2017. Wheat prices remained overall stable, reflecting adequate market availabilities, following the high level of imports in recent months.

Concerns remain for vulnerable rural groups

Food security conditions are expected to deteriorate on expectations of significant cereal production losses for the ongoing “maha” season, which follows a reduced “yala” harvest in 2016. Subsistence farm households, particularly in the North Western, North Central, Uva and Southern provinces, will likely be most affected and require some humanitarian and emergency recovery assistance. According to the Disaster Management Centre, almost 1 million people in 23 out of 25 districts have been negatively affected by drought conditions. Record prices of rice negatively affect food access and further stress the food security situation of the most vulnerable populations.","Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/704454-LKA.png?itok=ECJ7-DoW,"['crop', '17january2017', 'lanka', 'sri', 'season', '2016', 'country', 'maha', 'prices', 'unfavourable', 'brief', '2017', 'main', 'giews', 'rice', 'wheat']",

About 20,000 people were also driven out of their homes in the south and western parts of the country, the Disaster Management Centre said.

""The Southwest monsoon began with very intense rain,"" deputy minister for Disaster Management Dunesh Gankanda told reporters in Colombo.

""There are some areas where we are unable to reach, but relief operations are under way.""

The DMC said the toll rose to 91 dead and another 110 missing as reports came in from areas which had been inaccessible earlier in the day.

Sri Lanka appealed to the international community including the United Nations and neighbouring countries for help as the numbers of dead and missing climbed.

Heavy rains in the southern and western parts of the country have destroyed hundreds of homes and cut off several roads.

""The (foreign) ministry will continue to monitor the flood situation and seek assistance as required in consultation with the Ministry of Disaster Management,"" the government said in a statement.

Sri Lanka is appealing to the international community and neighbouring countries for help

It said Colombo had already sounded out the UN and its South Asian neighbours.

The latest flooding was the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful southwest monsoon, officials said.

Today, the military deployed thousands of troops to reach marooned villagers and the airforce carried out several rescue operations to pluck people from rooftops of flooded homes.

In the early hours of the day a mountainside collapsed on a women's hostel at a tea plantation at Neluwa in the island's south, killing at least seven women, police said.

Evacuation notices were issued to residents along the Kelani river, which flows to the Indian Ocean through the capital Colombo, amid fears that it was about to burst its banks.

""The residents who are living along the Kelani should evacuate to high ground within six hours,"" the DMC said.

DMC officials said the monsoon had been expected last night and ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydro power generation.

The rains filled the reservoirs used for hydro power, which had hit rock bottom, raising concerns of power shortage in June.

But officials said most reservoirs were now so full they were in danger of spilling over and causing dangers of flooding to people living downstream.","Fri, 26 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.rasset.ie/000e1b60-1600.jpg,"['missing', 'landslides', 'homes', '91', 'flooding', 'monsoon', 'lanka', 'sri', 'kill', 'south', 'officials', 'power', 'floods', 'management', 'parts']",

Many people are unable to find a drop of water to drink, while farmers are facing a crisis in protecting their crops from the merciless heat. Farmland across the country have been affected by the drought.

People residing in much of rural Sri Lanka are facing four major crises at present.These are continuing forest fires, wild elephant incursions, the chronic shortage of drinking water and the destruction of crops.

Farmers engaged in dry land farming in the Lunugamvehera and Walawa schemes are facing severe difficulties. Numerous cultivations including mung beans and bananas have already been destroyed.

Farmers say that since they have pawned most of what they own to cultivate, the destruction of their crops has flung them from the frying pan into the fire.

Pepper plantations in Welipothayaya, Kalthota, Batugammana, Hapugahakumbura and Meddekanda in Balangoda have been severely affected by the drought.

The main cash crop in Welekumbura, Mawela, Hatharabage, Oluganthota, Vijiratkumbura and Pillakumbura is tea. Tea bushes in these areas have also lost their lustre in the burning heat.

Villagers in Batugammana, Hapugahakumbura and Thotupalathenna, who cultivate tea bushes, can only look on in despair as the heatwave claims their hard work.

Vegetable crops in several villages in the Palagala Administrative Division in Kekirawa, have been harmed by the drought.

Chillies, Okra, Tomato, Cabbage, Knol khol, Cucumber and Capsicum cultivations have been decimated due to the lack of water and farmers have abandoned these crops.","Sun, 09 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.newsfirst.lk/wp-content/themes/nfst-eng-theme/assets/dist/images/favicon.png,"['farmers', 'facing', 'cultivations', 'rural', 'hapugahakumbura', 'water', 'sri', 'crops', 'destruction', 'tea']",

Colombo, Jan 17: At least 600,000 people in Sri Lanka have been hit by the worst drought since 2006 in nearly 13 of the 25 districts, disaster management officials said on Tuesday.

""They are hit by shortages of drinking water and damage to crop,"" Pradeep Kodippily, spokesman for the disaster management centre, said.

Most irrigation tanks in the island have run dry, the Irrigation Department said. According to the Water authorities, restrictions have to be placed on the drinking water supplies. The hydro powered electricity capability has also been affected.

The government has requested that all air conditioners be set at 26 degrees in view of the electricity supply being affected by the drought. The Meteorological Department said a temporary reprieve to the dry weather may happen from January 20 with some showers expected to fall.

Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena's office said that UN agencies - Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Food Programme - called on him on Monday to assure international assistance to extend drought relief.

Sirisena on Friday appointed a special task force with the participation of all related institutions to make preparations to face the severe drought prevailing in the country.

If the drought continues as predicted, it would be disastrous on the economy with water for agriculture available only till March, creating problems of a scarcity of water, electricity and food shortages.

These alarm bells were sounded by Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, State Minister of Finance when he addressed the launch of Construction Expo 2017 organised by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) held last week in Colombo.

The exhibition will be held from June 2 to 4 at the BMICH.

Mr. Abeywardena said that it is estimated that the Government would need around US$1.5 billion to meet the contingencies attributed to this impending climatic disaster with international organisations like the UN pledging around US$500 million, which is still short of the need.

In this situation, Government would have no option other than pull out the funds allocated for other activities. He said that the scarcity of water and electricity would also affect the construction industry.

Speaking of the construction industry, he asserted that the construction industry in Asia is heavily expanding and moving forward. Sri Lanka too is striving to keep pace with that trend, while the industry is adopting new environmental and safety trends. Specially, he said there was a big change in the construction industry in Sri Lanka after the war.

He pointed out that in 2014 the construction industry contributed 7.2 per cent to the GDP but it has declined to 6.4 per cent in 2015 due to the elections which is normal. However he pointed out that the industry has gathered momentum and during the first three quarters of 2016 it has increased to 6.9 per cent. The target for 2017, he indicated is 12 per cent.

Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, Chairman, CIOB said that they are working towards a ‘Green Sri Lanka’ – Green Concept in the construction industry.

The association is conducting ‘Construction Expo’ for the fifth consecutive year. He said that it gathers momentum year after year making it the country’s premier building construction exhibition on machinery, technology supply and services. He said more and more companies are interested in obtaining the ‘Green Marketing Concept’ for recognition of their products and services.

This move, he pointed out is to take the construction industry in Sri Lanka to be in par with the most advanced countries in technology and other aspects with sustainable construction methodology with the intention of providing all the knowhow. He said that adapting to the ‘Green Concept’ would save up to 40 per cent of the expenditure as it reuses the waste resources.","Sun, 29 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170129/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/drought_25012017_B05_CMY-300x181.jpg,"['concept', 'pointed', 'lanka', 'impending', 'sri', 'bln', 'construction', 'drought', 'cent', 'water', 'tackle', 'industry', 'crisis', '15', 'green', 'technology', 'needs']",

FAO also notes that adverse weather conditions are exacerbating the threat of famine in Somalia. Refugees from civil strife in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Central African Republic are putting additional pressure on local food supplies in host communities.

It also points out that some 5.5 million people are estimated to be severely food insecure in South Sudan, where maize and sorghum prices are now four times higher than in April 2016. In Somalia, about 3.2 million people need food and agricultural emergency assistance, while in Yemen the figure is as high as 17 million.

In northern Nigeria, disruption caused by conflict has left 7.1 million people facing acute food insecurity in the affected areas, with even more deemed to be in less dire but still “stressed” conditions, according to the report.

According to FAO, 37 countries require external assistance for food, namely Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe.

Southern Africa rebounds, East Africa is parched

While worldwide cereal output is near record levels, production outcomes are mixed across the globe.

According to the report, South America is expected to post strong increases, led by Brazil and Argentina.

Regional production in Southern Africa is expected to jump by almost 45 per cent compared to 2016 when crops were affected by El Niño, with record maize harvests forecast in South Africa and Zambia. This should help to reduce food insecurity in countries, such as Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.

After two consecutive years of bumper crops, the report notes that the overall food supply situation in the Sahel region is satisfactory.

However, at the start of the 2017 season, East Africa has suffered insufficient rainfall, armyworm infestations and local conflicts, leaving in the sub-region a record 26.5 million people in need humanitarian assistance.

The report warns that the situation could be aggravated further as the lean season peaks, saying, “An estimated 7.8 million people are food insecure in Ethiopia, where drought has dented crop and pasture output in southern regions.”

Moreover, cereal domestic prices reached exceptionally high levels in May, with the local cost of maize jumping by as much as 65 per cent this year in parts of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

The report also notes that a severe drought in Sri Lanka, followed by heavy rains and local flooding in late May, will likely reduce the country's paddy production by nearly a third, compared to the average.","Fri, 09 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/assets/2017/06/27427/image770x420cropped.jpg,"['east', 'million', 'agency', 'local', 'sudan', 'report', 'republic', 'deepen', 'drought', 'food', 'conflict', 'somalia', 'south', 'yemen', 'middle', 'africa', 'insecurity']", 
26,26,Drought Sri Lanka,No rain no grain - Ceylon Daily News,https://dailynews.lk/2017/01/18/features/104994/no-rain-no-grain,"Blue skies and drying reservoirs are to be a regular feature in the foreseeable future as we are to brace ourselves for one of the worst droughts in our recent history.

As water bodies dry up district after district, the Ministry of Disaster Management as of yesterday has estimated that thus far 111,329 families in the districts of Trincomalee, Kandy, Kalutara, Hambantota, Monaragala, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Mannar, Batticaloa and Ratnapura have been affected by the drought. The numbers are staggering and yet this is just the beginning of our problems.

What do we know so far?

It has now become apparent that due to the less than average rainfall experienced during the monsoons last year, currently there is a water shortage in all our reservoirs. Furthermore, the Meteorology Department has predicted below average rainfall in the next three months.

The rains are next expected in Mid March and the country needs to find a way to survive until then.

The water shortage will also spill into other areas such as power generation and food production and this will add to the current precarious situation.

Minister of Disaster Management, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa at a media briefing last week revealed that most main irrigation tanks were up to 27 percent capacity while 220 medium size tanks were at 30 percent capacity. In addition, this year, only one-third of all agricultural lands were cultivated which meant that there would be less food produced during the Yala season with effects spilling over to the Maha season as well.

“We have also had less than 35 percent of the rice fields sowed in the main rice belt of the country,” said Yapa adding that the government had decided to import 250MT of rice to meet the demand.

With the drought thus posing a serious challenge to the country’s food security, Prof Mohan Munasinghe, founding Chairman of the Munasinghe Institute for Development and Chair of the Expert Commission on the Sustainable Initiative said,

“The issues we are going to face in the next three months is a good warning about what will happen in terms of climate change in the next 20-30 years. Our study at the Institute shows that in the next 20-30 years, small farmers in the Dry zone will suffer very much. Climate models also show that rice output in the Dry zone can drop by 15 percent or more.”

This begs the question, do we save water for drinking or let our agricultural fields which grow our food have it? The government in the meantime has warned that they would be shutting off water for agricultural purposes in certain areas given the shortage. Running short of drinking water thus has been a major worry all around but the National Water Supply and Drainage Board General Manager, G.A. Kumararathna speaking to the Daily News said they had not made assessments of reservoirs and rivers as of yet as the problem had not become grave thus far but they would look into having some controls in another six weeks. “We will look into controls during the latter parts of February,” said Kumararathna.

According to Amarnath Giriraj, Sub Theme Leader, Water-related Disaster Risk Management at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), however, the best solution to deciding where the water should go could be planned using knowledge on the current water resource availability and its demand, which is efficiently monitored through water resource modelling and satellite data.

More Importantly, he asked that the “Irrigation, Agriculture and Water Resources Department have better coordination on the demand and supply chain on the implications of drought on livelihoods and agricultural practices.”

Meanwhile, adding to the problem, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has warned the government that they would have to find an additional 60MW electricity to avoid a power crisis in the next six months. They warned that the risk would be most severe during January and April with the country’s reservoirs experiencing the lowest water levels in the last 10 years. Accordingly, the government has taken steps to purchase power from private power generators. Other recommendations from the PUCSL include encouraging of self-generation mechanisms, installation of new generation plants and to have rooftop solar generation.

What should be done?

This is not the first nor will it be the last time, the country would face a drought. According to Giriraj, “Overall, South Asia is experiencing an increase in the intensity and frequency of the drought events.”

When it comes to Sri Lanka, he said, “The two major recent droughts in 2012 and 2014 were a result of monsoon failures in either of the Maha or Yala seasons.”

Similarly this year too, the failures of the monsoons in the Yala and Maha seasons of 2016 have led to the current drought.

With droughts becoming a familiar feature of the Sri Lankan landscape, it has become vital that we safeguard our most precious resource- water.

“We will have to look into saving water,” said Kusum Athukorala, Chair of Net Water and Regional Coordinator for the Global Water Partnership.

“We are heading into a situation where droughts will become the norm and we can reduce the problem by stopping the illicit logging and destruction at the catchments, stop polluting our waterways and save the good quality water we have and adopt household water savings,” she explained.

Household water savings are not a new concept; dual flushes, water efficient fixtures and fixing leaking taps have been advocated for a long time but it is the implementation of it all that is lacking.

“In Parliament, I saw taps that were leaking. They should set an example first,” she observed.

More importantly, she pointed out that the country had very little preparedness to deal with environmental disasters such as drought.

“We are still hoping that business, as usual, will prevail. We are only looking at bringing in more bowsers rather than looking at protecting our catchments,” she said.

“Further, we have always chosen curative rather than preventive measures. It is suggested that we look at desalination plants but that is very expensive. If we looked at preventive measures, we would be keeping our catchments pristine, even if we are to have less rainfall, we have a better chance of recharging our groundwater if the catchment was in good condition,” she said.

More policies, less action

Sri Lanka, however, is not a dry country per se, it is home to 103 rivers with 90 percent of the total land area of Sri Lanka belonging to a river basin. We also have 3,540 identified water sources in the island in addition to the 12,000 tanks located in the Dry zone alone. The problem thus is the proper utilisation and distribution of water.

The Ministry of Land and Land Development in 2014 in a bid to become more proactive came up with the “Draft National Policy on Protection and Conservation of Water Sources, their Catchments, and Reservations in Sri Lanka”.

“Considering the utilisation pattern of the country’s water resource, it appears that the protection of the above-mentioned sources is a fundamental requirement for the sustainability of both the surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers. For instance, the capacity of the shallow aquifers in the Kalpitiya peninsula could have fulfilled the drinking water requirement of a large population. But such waters have been contaminated to a level which could not be purified due to the excess adding of chemical fertilizer, agrochemicals, and insecticides to the soil,” stated the draft.

“Today Sri Lanka is badly experiencing the threat of silting in reservoirs which generate hydropower and supply irrigated water due to the clearance of catchment areas in high altitudes and poor water and soil conservation practices. For instance, 38 percent of the capacity of Rantambe reservoirs has been silted within 09 years of its construction while Polgolla and Rantambe reservoirs are being silted annually by 2.52 percent and 6.95 percent respectively,” it further noted.

The draft policy also identified that one of the major obstacles in the path to taking any action lay in the fact that around 40 legislations passed since 1930, pertaining to water sources conservation was included under various sectors from land development, water, and forest conservation to soil conservation. Hence no one was directly responsible for conserving our water sources.

In addition, though there are a number of institutions involved in various activities related to the conservation of water sources, they are not properly conserved and protected due to the dearth of human and physical resources, various institutional as well as technological factors and improper exchange of spatial data related to this. Though some foreign funded projects were launched for the conservation of catchment areas, their objectives could not be achieved as they are not carried out after the prescribed project period.

The suggestions the draft policy proposed were, “Identify, demarcate boundaries, protection and conservation of water sources, empower the institutions related to the conservation and protection of water sources, monitor activities and follow up action, awareness and participation in water conservation programmes at community level and the granting of financial provisions and facilities for programmes”.

The policy, however, did not see the light of day and the officials of the present Lands Ministry are not aware of the existence of this very policy.

All is not lost

Environmental disasters, in the end, while cannot be avoided, can always be mitigated or be prepared for. Giriraj explained that prediction of weather forecasts over the recent years has improved substantially with 90 percent of monsoon forecast skills being highly reliable.

“Our drought forecast system for South Asia can predict lead-time of 15-20 days in advance on the probability of drought conditions using climate and weather information,” he said.

Given the advantage of the technology at hand, he proposed that we use active early warning systems such as the nowcasting drought monitor to identify slow motion of drought progress.

In the long term, Giriraj proposed, “Investment in soil and water management, such as the improved development and management of fragile catchment areas and river basins, including small-scale irrigation; reviewing the appropriateness of current crop production patterns and possibilities in support of more intensified crop diversification policies; redirecting research towards more appropriate farming systems and improved rangeland and livestock management”.

In the end however, there are only so many water bowsers that the government can muster and Giriraj said that ultimately the government would need to review institutional arrangements and physical infrastructure of many of its agencies in order to deal with situations such as drought in addition to looking into developing new crops, cropping strategies and insurance schemes when settling into a very dry future.","Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/styles/node-detail/public/news/2017/01/17/z_p08-No-rain-01.jpg?itok=Hax0ib10,[], 
27,27,Drought Sri Lanka,Q&A: Land degradation could force 135 million to migrate in next 30 years - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/qa-land-degradation-could-force-135-million-migrate-next-30-years,"By Manipadma Jena

NEW DELHI/BONN, Oct 18 2016 (IPS) - One of the critical challenges facing the world today is that emerging migration patterns are increasingly rooted in the depletion of natural resources.

Entire populations are being disempowered and uprooted as the land that they rely on for their survival and for their future no longer provides sustenance.

Many people will move within their own region or to nearby cities, driving unplanned urbanisation. Up to 135 million people are at risk of distressed migration as a result of land degradation in the next 30 years, says a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) vision document.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) along with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change both envision land rehabilitation and restoration as significant actions in development and addressing climate change.

Governments from all over the world are currently meeting in Nairobi in order to agree on the strategic direction of the Desertification Convention. IPS correspondent Manipadma Jena interviewed Monique Barbut, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD, ahead of the ongoing fifteenth session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC15) in Nairobi. Excerpts from the interview follow.

Q: With as many as 170 countries affected by drought or desertification, how could these factors drive conflicts and forced migrations?

A. Two Somali proverbs,_nabadiyocaano_ meaning ‘peace and milk’ and _col iyoabaar_ which means ‘conflict and drought’, illustrate the strong connection between stability and access to pasture and water. The world’s drought-prone and water scarce regions are often the main sources of refugees.

But neither desertification nor drought on its own causes conflict or forced migration. But they can increase the risk of conflict and intensify ongoing conflicts. Converging factors like political tension, weak institutions, economic marginalisation, lack of social safety nets or group rivalries create the conditions that make people unable to cope. The continuous drought and water scarcity from 2006 to 2010 in Syria is a recent well-known example.

Droughts are natural phenomena, they are not fated to lead to forced migration and conflict. Severe droughts also occur in countries like Australia and the United States, but government intervention has made these experiences bearable.

For poor countries where safety nets do not exist, the intervention of the international community is vital.

In Mali, for example, unpredictable and decreasing rainfall seasons have led to a decline in harvests. More and more herders and farmers’ are moving into cities searching for employment. In Bamako, Mali’s capital, population in just over 20 years has grown from 600,000 to roughly 2 million with living conditions becoming more precarious and insecure. As Lagos fills up with those fleeing desertification in rural northern Nigeria, its population now 10 million. Disillusioned, unemployed youth are easy prey for smugglers, organised drug and crime cartels, even for Boko Haram.

Pastoralists face similar challenges when they are compelled to move beyond their accepted boundaries in search of water and pasture and risk clashing with other populations unwilling to share resources. Clashes between pastoralists and farmer are a serious challenge for governments in Somalia, Chad and Niger.

Q: Which other countries are showing signs of vulnerability to extreme droughts in the near future?

A: Drought occurs in almost every climatic region. With climate change, droughts are expected to spread to new areas and to become more frequent and more intense. The vulnerable regions are Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle-East and North Africa, South-Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Australia, Brazil, India, U.S. and China. In the coming decades, most of the United States, the Mediterranean region, Southwest Asia, Western and Southern Africa and much of Latin America, especially Mexico and Brazil, will face extreme droughts.

The more important question, however, is “who is going to be affected and what can be done about it?” The livelihoods of the poor in developing countries will be the most impacted because they rely heavily on natural resources. So, more investment is needed to incentivise them to adopt sustainable land management (SLM).

But frankly, the investments we have for land rehabilitation are insufficient. We must also improve land tenure security because farmers with secure ownership are more likely to adopt good practices. Improving access to markets and rural services will create alternative non-farm employment, reducing pressure on land and the impacts of droughts in turn.

Q: A lot now hinges on achieving Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) which requires a paradigm shift from ‘degrade-abandon-migrate’ to ‘protect-sustain-restore’. UNCCD aims to achieve LDN by 2030. Given the tremendous and diverse pressures on land for economic growth, also from large populations in regions like Africa and Asia, where do you see their achievements in 14 years?

A. We want to move from business as usual to a future where the amount of productive land passing from one generation to the next remains stable.

In the current scenario, large numbers of people and a large share of national economies are tied to the land sector, particularly in the developing countries. So any degradation of the land reduces a country’s productivity. Unsustainable land use practices costs Mali about 8 percent of its gross domestic product, for example.

By 2030, along with a higher world population, a large middle class will emerge, accelerating the demand to draw more from these land-based sectors. For Africa and Asia to bridge these gaps, the farmers need to keep every inch of their land productive. This switch to sustainable land management however needs strong government support – to move farmers to scale up these good practices, to recover degraded lands and to prevent losing the most productive lands to urbanisation.

Reforms would move credit, market access and rural infrastructural development to ignite sustainable growth in agriculture. This is what it will take, to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030.

The Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative that seeks to restore degraded lands and create green jobs in the land-based sectors is a good example of this vision. The Desertification Convention is working with partners around the world to develop initiatives that are linked to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of achieving land degradation neutrality by 2030.

Q: Which countries are faring better in turning around land degradation and what is the key factor driving this achievement?

A. A 2008 global assessment showed that most of the land restoration since 1983 was in the Sahel zone. But we have seen a rise in global attention to land degradation through diverse initiatives. that include the Conventions on Biological Diversity and Climate Change,the Bonn Challenge on Forest and Landscape Restoration and the New York Declaration on Forests. There are also regional initiatives such as Initiative 20×20 in the Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa’s Great Green Wall and initiative AF100, also in Africa.

Once the SDGs were adopted last year, our ambition for 2016 was to have at least 60 countries committing to set voluntary national targets to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030. We have surpassed that target. Today, we have more than 100 country commitments.

This achievement is due, in part, to the success of a pilot project that enabled 14 countries to assess and politically communicate the potential returns each would get by reversing land degradation in target areas. Armenia, Belarus and Ethiopia could quantify how they could meet their national obligations under the climate change agreement by pursuing land degradation neutrality.

Some common patterns among the countries that tend to fare better in fighting land degradation and drought (DLDD) is strong government leadership that values the socio-economic benefits accruing to their people and political commitment to make effective policies. They also have active champions of good land use practices which can be NGOs, development and private sector partners as well as small and large farmers.

Q: UNCCD is open to private business funding for projects under LDN. Which type of projects would businesses -for- profit show investment interest?

A. There is a growing appetite in the private sector for sustainable land use projects that can contribute to land degradation neutrality. More industry players have committed to LDN-related initiatives and other environmental targets. Companies committing to reduce the ecological impacts of their commodity supply chains rose from 50 in 2009 to nearly 300 by 2014, Supply Change reported in 2016. Many businesses dealing in agricultural and/or forestry commodities get raw materials from the land, and may be interested in investing in projects that make their supply chains more sustainable.

But there is no dedicated public funding pool investing globally in projects to combat land degradation, and public financing alone is not sufficient to protect our planet’s ecosystems. The private sector needs to step up. This is what created the need and opportunity for a new dedicated funding source –the LDN Fund. It combines public and private capital in support of the SDG target of land degradation neutrality.

The sustainable agriculture, sustainable forestry (including agroforestry), land rehabilitation and conservation, and the ecotourism sectors can support profitable investments. Forestry has attracted 77 percent of all capital raised for LDN investments to date. Agriculture is expected to see the strongest increase in investments and to grow by nearly 350 percent by 2021. It is clear that projects that incorporate at least some component of food and/or timber production are more likely to generate a stable cash flow are more appealing to private investors in LDN.

In the developed countries, many of the conservation activities receiving private investment are backed by government legislation. A strong regulatory framework provides certainty to the market and helps to create end buyers. As a result, the investments attract steady flows of private capital.

Q: Do governments need to put in place smallholder-safeguard mechanisms for private investments in land?

A. Safeguard mechanisms that recognise the land rights of smallholders are vital, even when the farmers have no formal tenure. Smallholdings support billions of livelihoods, which makes these households extremely sensitive to land use change.

In developing countries, government policies designed to attract investment are often biased towards large-scale farming, and hardly offer the protection to smallholders require. Private investors should have their own safeguards but governments have a responsibility to implement and enforce mechanisms to protect smallholders. The LDN Fund is designed to align with progressive global environmental and social standards.","Mon, 24 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/drought-sri-lanka-629x418.jpg?itok=1ti2PxOc,"['million', 'land', 'world', 'countries', 'private', 'investments', 'desertification', 'projects', 'migrate', '135', 'drought', 'sustainable', '30', 'qa', 'degradation', 'force', 'ldn']", 
28,28,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought-bungling and graft-cries rise from a desperate million - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170219/news/drought-bungling-and-graft-cries-rise-from-a-desperate-million-229582.html,"Drought-bungling and graft-cries rise from a desperate million By Kevin Akash Widanapathirana View(s): View(s):

People in many more districts are facing ruin because of the unprecedented drought, while farmer groups are insisting that the government pay Rs 50,000 for every acre destroyed. Farmers charge that government incompetence and corruption has made the situation worse.

Some estimates suggest that at least a million Sri Lankans are desperate.

Government officials say money has been made available to provide drinking water and rice is being imported.

Latest data from the Disaster Management Ministry show 845,343 people in 16 districts are suffering in the drought. In the Western Province alone, with a 298,848 are badly affected.

Gampaha and Kalutara are the worst affected. In Gampaha, 101,516 have been identified as victims, while in Kalutara there are 197,332.

Gampaha, Assistant District Secretary, Prasad Indika, said out of 13 divisional secretariat areas, eight have been badly affected.

“The situation is terrible. Dompe was added recently to the list. The conditions are becoming worse,” he said.

In the district, 252 water tanks have been placed for the collective use of the public. These tanks are being filled by using 9 water tankers operated under the District Secretariat with the assistance of Pradeshiya Sabhas.

“It is challenging to supply water to 23,845 families with only nine water tankers. We have requested a few more from the army. If the situation worsens we might have to seek the support of non-government organisations as well,” he said.

The Attanagalu Oya flowing across the district is in danger of drying out, said T D Wijesuriya, divisional irrigation engineer in the Gampaha district.

“The meter reading of the Attanagalu Oya was -0.22 m (according to a reference scale) on Friday. This is a severe stage.’’

He warned of a possible severe drinking water shortage by mid-March. “Water pumped from the Attanagalu Oya was distributed to mitigate the drinking water scarcity. If this also dries up, it will be serious,” he said.

In the Northern Province people are desperate. According to the Disaster Management Centre, 14 divisional secretariat areas have been affected in Jaffna district. Relief operations are not functioning in certain parts of the province.

The Disaster management officer of the Polonnaruwa district, Upul Nanayakkara said that at the moment the recent rains have helped to ease the drinking water shortage.

“All the paddy lands have been cultivated except in Kawudulla and Girithale. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Agriculture to pay compensation to the farmers in the two areas,” he said.

However, other sources said 50,000 acres of paddy lands out of 150,000 acres that are usually cultivated have been abandoned.

The Director General of the National Disaster Relief Service Centre, Chaminda Pathiraja, said: “The government has granted Rs 50 million through the Treasury to provide drinking water facilities. Another fleet of 100 tractor bowsers and more 1,000 litre water tanks will be bought. The government has provided funds for overtime payments, fuel, hire more bowsers and to buy water.’’

Pathiraja also said 25 metric tonnes of rice from Pakistan will be imported and another 5,000 metric tonnes will be shipped from Indonesia. These would be available in the market by March.

“Officials are gathering data about drought affected farmers to grant relief. Discussions are underway to provide compensation to the farmers. There are proposals to employ them in development projects but a final decision has not been made,” he said.

He said that non-government organisations could assist and all foreign donations could be coordinated via the External Affairs Ministry.

The Department of Meteorology said although light rain can be expected from time to time it wouldn’t be enough to ease drought conditions.

“On 18 and 19 evening showers may occur in most parts of the island except in the Northern Province. In mid March a change in the dry weather will start to occur and by May the drought will totally be over,” predicted duty meteorologist Srimal Herath.

The Assistant Commissioner of the Agrarian Services Department, M L M Sandamali, said the damage to paddy lands is being estimated to calculate compensation.

“A significant decline in the yield is visible in cultivations during this harvesting period. We were able to dig irrigation wells and to pump underground water with the help of the irrigation department for cultivation. In Gampaha district we recovered 3,600 hectares of paddy this way,” she said.

The national organizer of the All Ceylon Farmers Federation, Namal Karunarathna, charged that mismanagement and government corruption were responsible for the crisis. “The government says that the reason for this drought is the low rainfall last year. That’s not the truth. Last year also we received the usual rainfall but the there was a slight difference between the time periods. The problem is the inability to store that.”

He also said the Maha cultivation has failed for the first time in four decades.

“The officials didn’t release water properly last year. The harvest was low as a result. The Padaviya Tank had not been renovated since 1950s,” he said.

Renovations and de-silting of tanks should be done and new tanks should also be built. “The so-called experts have no idea about the technology in irrigation systems as our ancestors had. For example, the Minneriya tank had 62 small tanks known as kulu wewa to control the water flow in the main tank,’’ Karunarathna said.

“The farmers have lost their livelihood completely. Their paddy, vegetable, and corn cultivation have been devastated. We demand the government pay Rs 50,000 for every acre of damaged cultivation and to pay other cultivations according to the damage,” he stressed. “The government cannot refuse that. This is the first compensation farmers have demanded in 40 years for a Maha season.”

UN WFP to help overcome drought related hardshipThe UN World Food Programme (WFP) has come forward to assist Sri Lanka to overcome difficulties faced by the public due to the severe drought prevalent islandwide.The WFP will conduct this programme in partnership with the ministries, non-government organisations and the private sector. As per the requests made by the Ministry of Disaster Management and the External Resources Dept, for drought related support, WFP’s technical experts conducted a preliminary drought assessment and a report submitted to a ministerial Sub Cabinet meeting on the drought. In February, the WFP and the Government will lead a joint emergency assessment of the impact of the drought on household food security and livelihoods. Meanwhile, the WFP is assisting 14,000 farming families in the Mahaweli River Basin, while 72 small tanks will be rehabilitated this year under a Climate Change Adaptation Project. The WFP has also highlighted the food and nutrition insecurity due to the increased frequency of natural disasters such as floods and droughts. The WFP noted that the heavy rains received in late January did irreversible damage to the Maha season crops, which resulted in the 2017 harvest being considered the worst in the last decade.","Sun, 19 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundaytimes.lk/170219/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/85-300x108.jpg,"['droughtbungling', 'tanks', 'million', 'farmers', 'graftcries', 'wfp', 'drinking', 'water', 'pay', 'drought', 'rise', 'desperate', 'district', 'disaster', 'paddy']",

* Farmers in Puttalam battered by drought

Sun, Jan 15, 2017, 01:22 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Jan 15, Colombo: The prolong drought has affected a large population in the Puttalam district and farmers have been struggling with the severe drought, according to media reports.

Farmers in the ""Nila Bamma"" farm area and the people living in farming colonies around that area say they are facing a severe distress caused by lack of water for their cultivations.

One farmer told BBC Sinhala Service that due to the lack of water for his orange cultivation, he lost about Rs. 5 million.

Another farmer said that this is the first time in nearly fifteen years that they are facing such a drought situation.

The farmers point out that paddy cultivation and chena cultivation in Puttalam district, have been significantly destroyed due to the drought.

Although the authorities said that drought has not affected the paddy cultivation, Anura Chandrasekara, a farmer in Ponnankanniya area of Chilaw says a hundred acres of paddy fields including his paddy field have been destroyed due to lack of water.

He further said that although some places have water, due to the officials' inability to implement a systematic program to streamline the water supply to these paddy fields, the fields have become infertile and farmers are not able to get any profits.

Puttalam District Secretary, N.H.M. Chithrananda said that due to the risk of drought farmers in Puttalam district have not cultivated two-thirds of arable lands this year.

He further said that the farmers have only cultivated about 5,000 hectares this year. ""There is no destruction of the harvest yet, the cultivated area is still there. We are trying to save the cultivation until the harvest,"" the official said.

Puttalam District Secretary added that, Chena cultivation in ""Karuwalagaswewa"" and ""Anamadu"" divisions have been badly affected by the drought.","Sun, 15 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",,"['farmers', 'cultivation', 'lanka', 'sri', 'water', 'drought', 'fields', 'lack', 'puttalam', 'district', 'battered', 'paddy', 'area']",

The flooding was brought on by monsoon rains across southwestern portions of the country, according to Sri Lanka's Ministry of Disaster Management.

As many as 99 people are missing, according to Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center, and the death toll is expected to rise as authorities battle to rescue those still stranded and warn of the possibility of crocodile attacks. The Center adds that there are 112 people injured.

More than half a million people have been affected. India and other countries have sent aid.

Local Sri Lanka Red Cross volunteers and staff workers have been on the scene to give first aid, help with search and rescue missions, and distribute food, water and supplies.

The Red Cross is providing financial and technical support, said a statement by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies

Particularly affected is the district of Matara. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that there were still pockets where people were marooned, and rescue work was continuing. The nearby Ratnapura district, 63 miles southeast of the capital, Colombo, had the highest death count of any area, with 79 deaths.

'Never seen such floods'

The monsoon rains are the the worst to hit Sri Lanka since 2003. They come after two months of drought, which had grown severe enough to warrant aid from the World Food Programme.

Sri Lankans fleeing the floods say in many cases everything has been lost.

Banakiyanage Gnanawathie, who lives in the badly hit town of Matara, said by phone that her home is uninhabitable.

""I have never seen such floods, though I have spent my entire lifetime in Matara,"" she said. ""We have lost all our belongings and remain in the clothes we wore. I am still happy we escaped the floods and even the crocodiles.""

""It was only the next morning that troops arrived in boats, and took us to safe ground,"" she added.

She said they won't be able to return home for days.

""There is only a roof and building. We have lost everything else.""

Sri Lankan villagers cross a landslide site as military rescue workers and villagers search for survivors in Athweltota village in Kalutara.

The heavy rain occurred over a very short period, leading to the displacement of 112,000 people, according to Pradeep Kodippily, spokesman for Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center.

The bout of severe weather triggered landslides throughout the country.

The southern coastal city of Galle has seen 223 millimeters (8.78 inches) of rainfall over the past three days, and Ratnapura, further inland, has experienced 453 millimeters (17.8 inches) of rain over the same period.

Police and military rescue teams are moving by boat to rescue those marooned as well as retrieve corpses.

Houses and shops remained submerged in 10 to 30 feet of water. The expressway from Colombo to Matara, 100 miles south of the capital, was flooded in several areas.

A Sri Lankan home is surrounded by floodwaters in the suburb of Kaduwela in the capital, Colombo.

'We could not stand up'

Stonemason Kirindagamage Pathmasiri, another Matara resident, said the police had urged people to evacuate, but he and his family stayed put as they had nowhere to evacuate to.

""The next day the waters began to rise gradually. Then the flow was so fast that we could not stand up. My wife, four children and I were very frightened. We did not know what would happen to us now. With great difficulty we managed to walk out,"" he said. They are taking temporary shelter in a school.

He said his house is submerged under 8 feet of water.

""A bigger shock awaits us when the waters recede and we return home. We have lost all our possessions,"" he said.

Sri Lankan residents travel by boat through floodwaters in the suburb of Kaduwela in the capital Colombo.

Overseas help

Sri Lanka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs activated its emergency response unit and called on the United Nations' International Search and Rescue Advisory Group, as well as neighboring countries, to help in the recovery effort. The government has deployed 2,000 military personnel to affected areas.

Australia has pledged $500,000 for inflatable boats and outboard motors to assist with search and rescue efforts, the country's embassy in Colombo said Tuesday.

India has dispatched three naval vessels to its southern neighbor to deliver relief aid and disaster expertise.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately directed provision of all necessary assistance,"" a statement issued by High Commission of India, Colombo, read.

""He also expressed condolences at the loss of lives and property and said that India stands with her Sri Lankan brothers and sisters in their hour of need.""

The navy's official Twitter handle posted media of one of the vessels, INS Shardul, docking in Colombo and unloading aid Sunday. It joins the INS Kirch. A larger vessel, INS Jalashwa, is also en route, as is a Pakistani vessel carrying relief supplies, and three Chinese ships ferrying aid to the beleaguered country.

36,36,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka feels the heat - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/4/29/sri-lanka-feels-the-heat,"Over the past few weeks, temperatures across South Asia have steadily built up ahead of the summer rains.

There has been much talk of the severe heat and, at times, drought conditions that have accompanied this pre-monsoon heat across India and Pakistan.

Sri Lanka has suffered alongside them as the sweltering conditions have intensified.

Temperatures in Colombo, the nation’s capital, have been running just above the April average of 31 degrees Celsius. However, the humid onshore winds have made it feel more like 36C.

Despite the high temperatures, this remains a part of the world where many people do not have air conditioning in their homes.

The young and the elderly are most vulnerable and warnings have been issued across the country.

The heat has even been felt up on the higher ground. Nuwara Eliya is a city in the tea country hills of central Sri Lanka, it is known as little England because climate in the city is similar to that in parts of Europe.

Nuwara Eliya normally has an April temperature of around 10 to 15C. The mercury reached 24C on Wednesday. Recent days have seen highs nearer 22C.

The heat will only really be broken with the onset of the southwest monsoon and the summer rains.

That remains another month away. In the meantime much of south Asia will feel the heat and increasing humidity for some time to come.","Sat, 29 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/f888afef4e984f28b5aee649475879a2_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['feel', 'summer', 'city', 'heat', 'lanka', 'temperatures', 'sri', 'conditions', 'south', 'feels', 'eliya', 'remains']",

* Sri Lanka President instructs to get Tri-forces help for drought relief

Fri, Jan 13, 2017, 10:08 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Jan 13, Colombo: Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has given instructions to the officials to get the assistance of the Tri-forces in addition to the contribution of the public servants in the process of providing relief to the people affected by drought in the country.

Addressing a gathering at the Commissioning & Passing-Out Parade at Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) Academy in China Bay on Friday, the President lauded the service rendered by the armed forces towards national security and in providing disaster relief to the people.

The President said that, as the Commander-in-Chief of the country as well as the Defense Minister, he has placed immense confidence in the valiant soldiers and assured that the government will take steps to develop the resources given to Tri-forces while providing necessary technical skills and technological knowledge, to make them ready to face the challenges of tomorrow.

The President who arrived at the Sri Lanka Air Force Academy, China Bay was received warmly by the senior Air Force officials including, Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathi. A guard of honor was held for the President at the venue.

Commissioning of the officers who completed 8th and 56th cadet officer courses, pinning of official badges to the officers who completed 84th air cadet officer course and the passing out of the male and female officers who successfully completed the 162nd Regular Airmen course and 32nd Regular Airwomen course respectively, were held at this occasion.

The President presented awards to those who demonstrated special skills during their courses.

Governor of the Eastern Province Austin Fernando, Defense Secretary Karunaratne Hettiarachchi, Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathi and the Chancellor of the Sri Lanka Air Force Academy China Bay Air Vice Marshal P. D. K. T. Jayasinghe were among those participated in the ceremony.","Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.colombopage.com/Imgs_17A/MS01132017A_3.jpg,"['instructs', 'triforces', 'help', 'force', 'lanka', 'sri', 'drought', 'air', 'providing', 'course', 'president', 'relief', 'officers', 'marshal']",

China’s development of the key Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, which is a gateway to crucial shipping lanes, has raised concerns in New Delhi about Beijing’s widening naval influence in its neighborhood.

In New Delhi, India and Sri Lanka signed a memorandum of understanding on economic cooperation and expressed commitment to its implementation. Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Gopal Baglay, tweeted that it signaled “deepening economic collaboration.”

The specific deal to develop the World War II oil storage facility in the eastern port of Trincomalee, South Asia’s deepest natural harbor, is expected to be signed next month when Modi visits Colombo.

Although India’s planned investment in energy infrastructure in Trincomalee will be far more modest compared to Beijing’s ambitious Hambantota project, analysts say it will enable New Delhi to secure a foothold and ensure that no other country uses the harbor for military purposes.

While Colombo has assured India that Hambantota will be used only for commercial activity, its potential use as a naval base worries New Delhi. Those worries have intensified since a Chinese submarine docked briefly in Colombo port in 2014.

India has long fretted about China’s expanding foothold in the Indian Ocean region through infrastructure projects in countries such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“We find that India is now getting more and more strategically encircled by economic infrastructure projects,” according to Vijay Sakhuja, Director of the National Maritime Foundation in New Delhi.

Besides Hambantota port in Sri Lanka, he points to China’s building of Gwadar port in Pakistan. Warning that these projects, built to facilitate trade, also have a strategic element, he says, “We should not be surprised by frequent PLA [People’s Liberation Army] navy presence in the Indian Ocean, particularly in Gwadar, which will cause some discomfort to the naval planners in New Delhi.”

For Sri Lanka, India’s planned investment in the energy project in Trincomalee will help counterbalance the massive infrastructure deals signed with China by the former government of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who had leaned heavily toward Beijing.

“The spin off of that [project] is balancing what is perceived as predominant Chinese influence as far as the economy is concerned,” said Paikiasothy Saravanumuttu at the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo.

The new government is trying to move away from the heavy dependance on Beijing for foreign investment. During a recent visit to Tokyo, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe sought Japanese investment for the Colombo and Trincomalee ports.

The first months of Donald Trump’s presidency have raised serious concerns about the new administration’s understanding of climate change and the associated security risks. President Trump’s vocal skepticism of climate change and his appointment of several prominent climate deniers to his Cabinet, along with deep proposed budget cuts to government activities aimed at slowing or adapting to climate change, could see the new administration do untold damage to the environment, human health and security, economic development, and international peace and stability.

The Trump administration’s disengagement comes at a time when severe weather conditions spurred on by climate change are having devastating effects in the United States and around the world. In California, for example, despite a recent respite, the state’s long-running drought cost the state’s agricultural sector an estimated $2.7 billion in 2015 alone, and the state is expected to experience chronic water shortages in the future. In southern Africa, for example, millions are at risk of starvation following a two-year drought and above-average temperatures. And in Sri Lanka, the worst drought in 40 years has left more than 1 million people affected by acute water shortages.

These worrying signs early in the Trump administration contrast sharply with the legacy of former President Barack Obama. Before leaving office, President Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum on Climate Change and National Security designed to elevate and address the national security implications of climate change. Hailed as an historic step, the memorandum directed federal departments and agencies to “ensure that climate change-related impacts are fully considered in the development of national security doctrine, policies, and plans.” Released alongside a National Intelligence Council, or NIC, report, “Implications for US National Security of Anticipated Climate Change,” the memorandum reflected the consensus among U.S. national security experts that climate change is a core national security concern and should be addressed as such. Indeed, even some within the Trump administration agree with this consensus: Trump’s Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in his written testimony following his confirmation hearing, noted that climate change poses a serious threat to American interests abroad.

Both Obama’s presidential memorandum and the NIC report argue that extreme and more frequent weather events, droughts, heat waves, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification—all driven or exacerbated by climate change—will increasingly threaten food and water security, energy and transportation infrastructure, and other crucial systems in the decades to come. These disruptions can seriously stress or overwhelm affected governments’ ability to respond to crises, threatening human security and eroding state legitimacy. Deteriorating conditions or severe crises can undermine economic livelihoods and contribute to decisions to migrate. Taken in the aggregate, these stresses can create political instability and amplify conditions that lead to conflict, especially in already fragile or unstable regions. And, as many recent crises have demonstrated, instability and violence in one country often do not remain confined solely within that country’s borders. Both reports therefore conclude that it is in the United States’ national interest to try and address the underlying drivers of crises abroad to prevent future instability and avoid more expensive crisis interventions.

While the Trump administration’s approach to the issues outlined in the memorandum and the NIC report are shaping up to be hostile, the fact that such challenges exist is unequivocal. The administration would do well to heed the advice of climate and national security experts and ensure that the United States continues to address these issues.

Climate change and water security

Perhaps the most pressing area of concern at the nexus of climate change and national security is that of water security. As outlined clearly in a recent World Bank report, the effects of climate change will come through the water cycle—affecting food, energy, urban, and environmental systems as populations, cities, and economies continue to grow and strain increasingly limited water resources. According to the World Bank, roughly 1.6 billion people already live in countries with water scarcity, and that number could double in just two decades. The continued impacts of climate change on water supplies, if not properly managed, will have far-reaching consequences for national and international security. Indeed, these consequences are already visible.

In recent years, there have been regular reports of heightened social tensions and even violent conflict, partially as a result of climate-induced disasters related to water security, such as prolonged droughts and increased desertification. One of the more notable cases demonstrating this has been that of Syria, where prolonged drought linked to climate change and the Syrian government’s poor response to it—while not a direct cause of the conflict in the country—played a role in exacerbating the social, economic, and political conditions that led to the outbreak of conflict in 2011 and the resulting refugee crisis, in which more than 4.9 million Syrians have fled the country as of March 2017. A more recent example is that of Tunisia, where there have been concerns that the country might be heading toward a “thirst uprising.” Since July 2016, there have been several protests in regions across the country sparked by water scarcity from prolonged drought and years of poor resource management.

Some of the most critical questions that come next include how and where serious climate-related national security concerns might manifest in the future, and what the United States and the international community are doing to try to prevent, respond to, and mitigate them.

Water supply and demand

At the most basic level, the greatest challenges regarding water security and climate change come back to issues of supply and demand. According to U.N. predictions, the world population will reach 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050, with Africa expected to account for half of this growth. As populations grow, so do economies, both of which require increased water resources. For instance, it takes about 4,000 gallons of water to produce roughly two pounds of beef; 240 gallons of water to manufacture one cell phone; and three to six gallons of water to produce one gallon of gasoline. Additionally, as countries become more prosperous and incomes rise, water use increases dramatically—and often unsustainably. As a result of these pressures, the United Nations projects that by 2050, global water demand will increase by 55 percent, with the greatest demands coming from manufacturing, thermal electricity generation, and domestic use.

On the supply side, the amount of total surface water around the world is expected to remain fixed in the coming decades. However, the distribution of this water varies greatly and could become more uneven, with many already water-stressed regions becoming more so in the future, as snowmelt and precipitation patterns become more variable around the world due to climate change. The decline in surface water is projected to hit hardest in the least developed countries, where water availability is most critical for agriculture, energy production, and economic development. Also of note is the fact that there are currently 150 million people who reside in cities with perennial water shortages, and as demographics shift, this number is projected to increase to almost 1 billion people by 2050—with much of this growth happening in the developing world.

Climate change will also affect groundwater found in aquifers, which contain roughly 30 percent of the world’s available freshwater. Groundwater reservoirs will be directly affected by climate change through recharge patterns—in areas where total surface water declines, groundwater resources are also likely to decline. And as temperatures rise, the risk of increased groundwater salinity grows, meaning the quality and usability of water resources will decline in some areas.

If nothing is done to increase water efficiency and better manage and protect both surface water and groundwater in the face of a changing climate, demand could exceed current sustainable water supplies by 40 percent by 2030.

Effects of water scarcity

The consequences of water scarcity, as with the distribution of water supplies, vary greatly around the world as a result of a number of factors, including political, social, and economic conditions; existing infrastructure—or lack thereof; and policy decisions. Of particular concern are the impacts of water scarcity on human livelihoods and social tensions, which can contribute to cycles of poverty and violence.

If not appropriately addressed, water scarcity has the potential to negatively affect economic performance at all levels, as economic growth requires greater water resources. This in turn inhibits poverty alleviation, which is highly dependent on economic growth. Water scarcity also adversely affects agricultural production, food security, and commodity prices, all of which directly affect human livelihoods and contribute to cycles of poverty. This is especially true for the almost 78 percent of the world’s poor who rely on agriculture, livestock, or aquaculture to survive.

Additionally, as water supplies become constrained, social tensions over access to available resources can escalate and even turn violent. This is especially likely in fragile states that have a history of conflict and in areas where access to water resources has been politicized. The United Nations has found that while disputes over natural resources are rarely the sole driver of violent conflict, they certainly can be a contributing factor when other drivers are present, such as poverty, ethnic polarization, and poor governance.

The case of Darfur in Sudan highlights some of the consequences of water scarcity when combined with complex political, social, and economic conditions. As with most conflicts, the origins of the violence in Darfur are highly complex and driven by many forces; any discussion of environmental drivers should in no way exculpate those who have carried out violent acts or enacted destructive policies. However, as highlighted by the United Nations, “regional climate variability, water scarcity and the steady loss of fertile land” in the country played an important underlying role in the conflict that broke out in 2003. These underlying environmental factors combined with increased population and livestock density to help foster violent competition among various groups in the region, 75 percent of whose livelihoods were directly dependent on natural resources. While these environmental and demographic shifts were taking place, the Sudanese national government in Khartoum took steps to undermine and eventually eliminate local governance systems that had evolved to prevent resource conflicts. With few mechanisms to resolve disputes, the region was left vulnerable to violent conflict driven in part by competition for resources—competition propelled, in turn, by environmental and demographic trends. The United Nations estimates that between 2004 and 2008, as many as 300,000 people died and 2.7 million people were displaced as a result of the conflict.

Main areas of concern

To determine where water scarcity may drive security risks, it is critical to understand both future water constraints and a particular state’s ability to cope with such stresses in the context of the other social, economic, and political challenges it might face. One way to identify these areas of concern is by cross-referencing indices that track water constraints and state fragility around the world. Projecting the effects of climate change, shifting and expanding demographics, and economic changes is extremely difficult and subject to countless variables, but there are a number of tools that can provide a general picture of where these factors are likely to strain water supplies in the future.

One such tool, developed by the World Resources Institute, or WRI, is the Aqueduct Projected Water Stress Country Rankings. To develop the data set, WRI used a number of climate models and socioeconomic scenarios to project future water stress under three different scenarios—“business-as-usual,” “optimistic,” and “pessimistic”—in 167 countries in 2020, 2030, and 2040.

Examining the top 50 countries in Aqueduct’s business as usual scenario across all three time spans gives a sense of which regions will experience the most severe water stress if action is not taken to improve water efficiency and resource management. Not surprisingly, the Middle East and North Africa account for the highest proportion of high-risk countries across all three time spans, with 18 countries likely to face high water stress in each period. Europe accounts for the next highest proportion with 12 countries facing water stress in 2020 and 14 countries in both 2030 and 2040. Next is Asia with 11 countries in 2020 and 2030 and 12 countries in 2040. Also of note here is the United States’ presence on the list for each time span.

But projecting future water stress does not account for a state’s ability to respond to these trends. While it is difficult to predict a state’s ability to cope with future stress, there are several indices that highlight current state fragility and coping abilities, which can help pinpoint areas of concern. One index that captures these elements is the Fragile States Index 2016 by the Fund for Peace. Using their own analytical platform, the Fund for Peace analyzes millions of documents from three primary sources each year to inform scores on 12 social, economic, and political indicators, which then allows them to rank 178 states by their own measurement of fragility.

Looking at the Fragile States Index and the Aqueduct index together, eight countries stand out: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen. These countries appear in the top 50 on Aqueduct’s business as usual list of the most water-stressed countries in 2020, 2030, and 2040 and also appear in the top 50 on the Fragile States Index rankings for 2016. In addition, of the top 50 fragile states, Eritrea appears as one of the top water-stressed countries in 2020 and 2030; Timor Leste in 2020; and both Haiti and Sri Lanka in 2040. Some countries not included in this cross-reference still warrant concern given historical tensions over water, such as Palestine and Israel, as well as India and Pakistan.

It is clear from these various lists that some of the greatest areas of concern with regard to water security will continue to be the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, and mostly in countries that have experienced or continue to experience protracted conflicts.

U. S. and international community responses

The United States has undertaken a number of efforts in recent years to address climate change and water security, such as through President Obama’s executive orders directing agencies to integrate various dimensions of climate change into their planning, including national security, and through their leadership role in negotiating the Paris Agreement. Under a Trump administration, however, many of these efforts remain vulnerable to attack. Although there are still some measures which are not as easy to dismiss.

As mandated by the Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act of 2014, President Trump—with the help of the U.S. Agency for International Development, the State Department, and other federal departments and agencies—must submit to Congress a Global Water Strategy by October 1, 2017 outlining how the United States plans to “increase access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene in high priority countries; improve the management of water resources and watersheds in such countries; and work to prevent and resolve intra- and trans-boundary conflicts over water resources in such countries.” Presumably, government agencies have been working on contributions to this strategy since this law was enacted, and hopefully a Trump administration will come to see the necessity of continuing to provide resources for completing and eventually implementing such a strategy, as mandated. In the process of doing so, the administration will have the opportunity to see the evidence, including the conviction of many in the military and intelligence community, that climate change is indeed a critical factor in maintaining national and international security.

Absent U.S. leadership in this area, there are a number of other multilateral organizations and individual countries that have shown a desire to act on these issues. For example, in addition to the historic Paris Agreement on combatting climate change, which has been ratified by 134 parties and passed the threshold for entry into force, the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Agenda includes two goals which directly address climate change and water security: SDG number six on ensuring “the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” and SDG number 13 on taking “urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.” Furthermore, Germany has now taken over the G-20 leadership and has identified the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals as their main priorities, both of which are critical to addressing issues of water security.

Conclusion

As consistently argued by the U.S. military and intelligence community, scientific and academic experts, the United Nations, the World Bank, and America’s closest allies, climate change is a threat multiplier; it has the potential to exacerbate existing social, political, and economic tensions to devastating effect. If humans continue to ignore climate change and its impacts, such as on the world’s critical water supply, the consequences will only grow more dire. In a world of increasing uncertainty, it is essential to not only change behaviors that lead to further climate change but also to work to prevent and mitigate the now unavoidable impacts the world will face as a result of it.

41,41,Drought Sri Lanka,Rainwater harvesting : Resource guaranteed for the underprivileged - Ceylon Daily News,https://dailynews.lk/2017/03/22/features/111126/rainwater-harvesting-resource-guaranteed-underprivileged,"Today is World Water Day. The Daily News sat down with Executive Director of the Lanka Rain Water Harvesting Forum Dr. Tanuja Ariyananda to discuss what her organization does to combat water scarcity in Sri Lanka. As the world undergoes climate change, seasonal rainfall is becoming more erratic, further challenging scientists and policymakers who wish to ensure water availability for everyone. One such manner of guaranteeing access to water is through rainwater harvesting, whereby rain is captured in large above-ground tanks. Dr. Ariyananda’s organization has set up thousands of these systems to combat drinking water scarcity for people throughout the island.

Excerpts follow:

Q: Can you tell me about the work you do?

A: We promote the idea of collecting rainwater, or rainwater harvesting, for domestic use, especially in areas where water is scarce. Sri Lanka is a high-rainfall country, so you might wonder why we need to do this, but it is very important. Although we generally have good rainfall, from 900 millimeters to 5,500 millimeters (mm) in the hilly areas, we have some pockets that barely get enough rainwater. But the water in these areas is not collected efficiently in my opinion.

These areas suffer from lack of water from time to time because rainfall is seasonable and variable. Some areas don’t get rain throughout the year, but get it in two seasons. In countries like Sri Lanka, rainwater harvesting is ideal, and the basic concept is collecting rain and using it during the dry season.

We have set up about 7,000 tank systems ourselves, and we have worked with other organizations, including the government, the Water Board, and other NGOs, to set up about 40,000 of these systems.

Q: Sri Lanka just emerged from a serious drought. Is this an effective system for supplying water during droughts?

A: Very much so. We get more requests to set up tanks during droughts than during the rainy season, but that is too late, since you should collect rainwater when it is still raining. But I think droughts and floods are now a part of daily life.

The seasons have changed to the drought season and the flood season, rather than the monsoon season, so our systems are ideal for both situations. If you collect water during floods, you reduce the flood level as well, because you are collecting and arresting the water. And then during the drought, you use that water that you’ve saved.

Q: Where are you concentrating your efforts in Sri Lanka?

A: We try to help people all over Sri Lanka, but most of our work happens in the dry zone areas in the North, East, and some parts of the South, like Uva Province.

Q: Can you tell me about the systems you use to collect rainwater?



Dr. Tanuja Ariyananda

A: We mostly set up roof water harvesting systems. We have special gutter systems that deliver the water from the roof to the catchment and into ferrocement tanks. We use chicken mesh as a frame and use cement to build around it. It’s a low-cost system that is generally built above ground. It’s easy to manage and easy to maintain. That’s the basic system, but the type of tank does not matter as long as it can be closed. An 8,000-litre tank will cost about Rs. 65,000 to build, including labour.

Q: Is there some kind of filtration mechanism?

A: Yes, we have what is called a first-flush system where we don’t collect the first rain from the roof because it might contain some debris and dust. We let the first rain itself wash the roof.

Then the clean water goes into the tank. Even before that, just before it enters the tank, there is another filter that takes out any debris that might come in with the water. It’s a homemade filter made from small pebbles and charcoal, with some cloth or mesh on it as well. Any leaves, debris, or unwanted material also get arrested there.

Also, when we extract water from the tank, we don’t take it from the bottom. We allow any sediment that might come in to settle at the bottom of the tank, and then we take water from a little above the bottom so that we don’t get any of the sediment. But people wash out the tanks from time to time and get rid of the debris and sediment.

Q: Are there any problems with this system?

A: The only issue is maintenance. The user maintains the rainwater harvesting system. There is no external person coming in to check on it. You have to maintain it yourself. If you don’t know how to maintain it or neglect to maintain it, you can have problems. For instance, if you leave the lid open, mosquitoes can go in and breed.

The above ground tanks themselves are very solid. They have lasted for 20 years quite well. Also, plastic tanks last up to 20 years, if not more. We have had some problems with underground tanks, and that is why we don’t promote these systems too much now. Roots pierce and crack underground tanks.



Resident maintaining the water tank

Q: How are you funded?

A: We have different funders. That’s always a challenge for us. We always have to look for funding. USAID has been funding us for three years for projects in the North and the Uva Province. We have been funded by the Japan Water Forum, the Korean Water Foundation, and the Canadian Development Agency, among others, in the past. But we don’t give the whole system for free.

We get some commitment from the beneficiaries themselves. They contribute by building gutters on roofs and providing labour during construction. About 15 percent of the cost is borne by the beneficiaries.

Unfortunately, the system isn’t being taken up more because of the initial cost. Rainwater is free, but you need to spend some money at the start. It would be great if a bank or the government could provide that initial investment in the form of a loan, perhaps an interest-free loan.

Q: How do you manage implementation? Who goes and builds the tanks?

A: We have a skilled group of masons scattered throughout the island for that purpose. Every time we work in a district, we recruit masons from the area, and we train them ourselves.

Then they do future projects in their respective districts. We have been promoting ferrocement tanks because they give some business to local guys as well.

We have trained more than 400 masons so far. I should also add that we rarely build single tanks. We generally provide many for a village. We select the number of beneficiaries, do an awareness program, then provide the supplies. We can construct about 15 to 16 tanks in a week’s time.

Q: Are you involved in any awareness campaigns around the island?

A: Yes, awareness is a very important aspect of our work. Although this concept is not new in Sri Lanka, it’s a traditional concept that has been around for centuries. So we have to remind ourselves that this is a possibility. And of course there are a lot of obstacles.

When people first see the tanks, they are not sure whether they are reliable. So, awareness is really important, and we have to do it from top-down and bottom-up. We meet with government agents, and they invite people from that district for an information session on the tanks. We also work at the household level to raise awareness.

When we visit a village, we don’t just dish out rainwater harvesting systems for everybody. We tell them what it is first, and ask them to apply for a system. They apply, and we pick who should get one based on our selection criteria. The criteria are based on a household’s access to water, and anybody who has to go beyond 250 metres to get their drinking water is eligible.

We emphasize helping women-headed households, especially in war-affected areas. We also look to help households that have a lot of children and those that have people with disabilities. Lately, we have targeted people with water-borne diseases, especially those in areas where many suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease.

Q: How have the outcomes been for the beneficiaries?

A: There is initially some reluctance to adapt it in new areas. Everybody wants pipe water supplies, but it isn’t possible for many places in Sri Lanka. If they can’t have water pipes, they want wells, but that’s not always possible.

Even if it was possible, water in the wells is not good for drinking. We have to convince them that this is another option, so we conduct tests with a few people in a village who are willing to have the system, and find out if they want their own systems. We have a huge demand after the tests.

Q: What do most people use harvested rainwater for?

A: They use it for anything you would use water for. But drinking is an especially important one, especially in areas where water is not of high quality. People in areas where there is a lot of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) generally drink rainwater.

But rainwater isn’t used for bathing and large-scale washing so much. They can use it during the rainy season for these purposes, but there’s not enough water during the dry season for bathing.

Q: How clean is rainwater?

A: Rainwater is the purest water. There are only a few places where there is acid rain, but this is limited to areas where there are coal power stations. So far, we don’t have a lot of problems with acid rain here. But in urban areas, where there is a lot of vehicle exhaust, the pH of rain can be a little low, say between 4.5 and 5.

In those areas, I wouldn’t promote rainwater for drinking, but you don’t need to harvest water in those areas because most of them have pipe water supplies. But any other uses, like toilet flushing, gardening, washing cars, you can use rainwater for.

In my opinion, it’s a crime to use pipe water for any of those purposes because, for instance, in gardening, you’re using chlorinated water, which is bad for plants and the country.

Q: Do you think this is the future of self-sufficient water management in Sri Lanka?

A: I hope so. Even if you have another water supply, whether it’s a pipe water or well water supply, having a rainwater harvesting system is not a loss. It’s only a gain, because you can use the water for anything.

42,42,Drought Sri Lanka,Is Vietnam in for Another Devastating Drought? - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2017/02/is-vietnam-in-for-another-devastating-drought/,"Advertisement

The Tet Holiday (Vietnamese lunar New Year) has come to an end, marking the commencement of a new dry season in Vietnam’s lower Mekong Delta. Right now in coastal provinces around the Delta, thousands of farmers, especially those who miserably suffered during last year’s historic drought, are mobilizing to prepare for another similarly devastating drought, which is expected to arrive in the Delta in a few weeks.

During last year’s dry season, the record drought, followed by saltwater intrusion, cost Vietnam VND 15 trillion ($669 million) due to the heavy toll on agricultural production. It also caused dire humanitarian and other economic impacts: almost half a million households lacked fresh drinking water and experienced food shortages and thousands of affected people had to migrate to urban areas in search of jobs. The drought was mainly caused by Mekong upstream dams built by China in connection with El Nino effects.

To mitigate agricultural losses caused by a possible repeat of the 2016 double disaster – severe drought and inland salinity intrusion, remarkably exacerbated by Chinese dams – most of the disaster prone provinces of the Delta have begun to secure freshwater by all measures available to them. In many vulnerable communes in Hau Giang, Ben Tre, and Tien Giang provinces, farmers have used water tanks to collect rain-water and drilled wells to extract groundwater. They also have reduced the annual rice crop and switched to cash crops that require less water. Meanwhile, local authorities have been dredging canals and irrigation facilities and setting up fresh water pipeline networks in hotspots of drought. In addition, a number of temporary dams and desalination plants are being built in a hurry around the Delta to prevent saltwater from entering the major waterways.

However, many local peasants and environmentalists still remain worried about the future of the Delta. “These are necessary yet palliative measures,” said an environmentalist at Can Tho University who requested anonymity. “Acute drought like what happened last year will happen more frequently in the future since the region’s ecosystem is already damaged by non-sustainable development and Chinese dams, which are affecting everything from water levels to water temperature to fish migration patterns and trapping of silt.”

The environmentalist and other local activists are deeply concerned that if China remains slow and reluctant to release adequate water throughout the period of low water, like it did last year, downstream agriculture will be endangered, thus once again generating environmental risks for the whole Lower Mekong Basin.

In addition, Chinese dams on the Mekong’s upper reaches also trap as much as 80 percent of the sediment that reaches the region. The Mekong River’s silt is vital to fertilize the Delta’s vast low-land areas, since it replenishes nutrients that wash away during monsoon season and sustains the delta against rising sea levels and coastal erosion. Thus, even though the Mekong Delta authorities and people can secure freshwater for dry season, without upstream water and sediment supplies this low-lying delta may not escape inevitable erosion and disintegration, which are likely to arrive earlier than estimated in recent sea level rise scenarios in Vietnam.

The impacts of Chinese dams became more glaring and irrefutable in the last year’s drought, which ruined downstream agricultural-rich regions along the Mekong. In short, China has been partially responsible for the dire situation across the region. However, as I argued in The Diplomat previously, Beijing’s responses to the problem remain controversial and different from what its state leaders have vocally pledged in regional and bilateral cooperation forums. Given this fact, the Mekong Delta’s farmers remain pessimistic and stoic as they don’t know how much longer they can make a living from farming.

“Worry or don’t worry, it’s no different and does not matter because we are voiceless,” said Lam Ngoc Tien, a 32-year-old ethnic Khmer farmer in Binh Dai district, Ben Tre province, where the 2016 drought’s traces remain clear and present. “We can’t control climate change with hotter and hotter weather nor stop dam building by upriver countries. And when their impacts come to us at the same time, it is a real nightmare that downstream low-land ordinary farmers like us are being forced to bear,” he added.

There are a few weeks left for the Delta’s people to get ready and well prepared to cope with a new drought season. It’s worth looking back at the recent developments and incidents in the Mekong Delta to unravel some enduring lessons for Vietnam’s government and people in their approach to climate-resilient development in this biodiversity-rich yet vulnerable region. We hope these measures will help them avoid a crippling double disaster like that of last year, as we wait to see more responsible responses from China to substantially alleviate the low-water season in downstream regions.

Lesson #1: A Decades-Old “Growth First” Policy Meant Irrecoverable Environmental Costs

Since the establishment of the first industrial zone in Can Tho City some 20 years ago, all of the provinces in the agriculture-rich Mekong Delta have emerged to compete against each other in developing industrial zones and inviting foreign investments, triggering a persistent “industrialization race” in the region. To boost economic growth, the provincial authorities have assertively revoked fertile agricultural land for private development projects. According to a report by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI), the Delta’s authorities have en masse established as many as 74 industrial zones and 214 industrial clusters with a total area of about 42,000 hectares – most of which was revoked from high-yield agricultural production areas along the major waterways. Many villages well-known for their specialty fruits and rice (such as green-peel and pink-flesh grapefruits, king oranges, durians, milk apples, and fragrant rice in Long An, Dong Thap, Hau Giang, Vinh Long, Can Tho, etc.) have been industrialized without serious considerations for food security and environmental impacts.

Hundreds of thousands of farmers in these industrializing villages have given up their ancestral land, which is both their major property and means of production, and moved to resettle in urbanized areas. Some of these households suddenly became richer thanks to multi-million VND compensations for their revoked fields, but without the necessary preparation and capability for a new, non-farming livelihood they soon returned to poverty, working as low-cost labors in factories erected right on their former land.

More ironically, only a small portion of the more than 40,000 hectares mentioned above has been substantially industrialized, yet immediately those few projects become high-profile pollution emitters doing a lot of harm to the local environment and ecosystems. Meanwhile, the majority of the revoked land remains unused so far due to either foreign investors deciding to withdraw from contracts or multi-billion dollar projects that proved unrealistic, causing huge waste and agricultural losses year after year as the land lies empty. Eventually, what’s left behind are blighted jungles and polluting factories scattered like tombstones across the Delta. This situation further contributes to the Delta’s environmental degradation, raising local temperatures and shrinking the regional forest cover area and farmers’ orchard density. These dwindling forests and orchards play a major role in moderating climate hazards such as scorching days, drought, and floods since they are able to detain and store the sheer volume of water during the wet season underground beneath the water table.

Lesson #2: God Helps Those Who Help Themselves

While their counterparts around the Mekong Delta are struggling to cope with the severe weather conditions, farmers in Cu Lao Gieng islet on Vietnam’s Mekong River – a representative disaster prone area in the delta, located near the Vietnam-Cambodian border – have been celebrating a big Tet Holiday after another fruitful year in 2016.

For generations, Cu Lao Gieng rice farmers harvesting their shining emerald paddies have completely relied on the Mekong River, which formed their triangular islet, to water their crop. But since being increasingly threatened by the impacts of climate change and Mekong mainstream dams, instead of crying over environmental change, the islet’s peasants have proactively switched to growing high-yield mangoes which they named “xoai ba mau” (mango of three colors) since the mango skin changes from green to a reddish purple when it ripens. Farmer Nguyen Hoang Du, the pioneer who imported the seeds and popularized this kind of mango in the isle commune, summarizes his great idea and contribution succinctly in a loud voice: “Many farmers in here now become millionaires thanks to the mangoes.” He adds that the villagers are no longer worried about the changing weather nor decreased upstream water flows.

Du is among dozens of farmers in the islet who have been lifted out of poverty since they decided to get rid of their traditional plants and switched to growing the large three-color mangoes some five years ago as their own way of coping with the environmental change. Along with earning hundreds of millions of VND from year-round mango harvesting, the isle farmers are benefiting from a remarkable tourism income since their orchards are becoming eco-tourism hotspots in An Giang border province. “These achievements are very impressive and significant to reduce the commune’s hunger and poverty rate,” said Huynh Van Cuong, chairman of the commune’s People’s Committee. He informed the local media that provincial state authorities have strongly supported this climate-resilient agricultural model by providing multi-million VND financial aid to help the farmers’ mangoes meet the national Good Agricultural Practice (VietGap) standards.

The isle farmers’ enduring efforts to triumph over adversity finally paid off. The way they have simply yet miraculously overcome the environmental hurdles that are facing the entire Delta reminds Vietnam’s government and other affected people elsewhere of a popular moral: God helps those who help themselves. As the furthest downstream country set to shoulder the increasingly unbearable impacts of Chinese-backed Mekong mainstream hydropower projects, Vietnam could take a leaf out of the Cu Lao Gieng farmers’ book by sustaining freshwater-based agricultural activities and protecting local ways of life while boosting community-based ecotourism.

This economic development model may look familiar elsewhere, but it is really invaluable in the fragile Mekong Delta since it appears to perfectly link ecological protection to poverty alleviation in the region, enabling vulnerable communities to effectively deal with the dangers and impacts simultaneously posed by climate change and Chinese dam-building projects. In this respect, the isle farmers’ approach further reveals a clear policy alternative for Vietnam’s self-help climate-resilient strategy in the Delta, instead of waiting in vain for any “water savior” to emerge from among its upstream neighbors. What the government will have to do, among other things, is to empower and provide enough avenues for concerned citizens to raise their voices on issues of national importance while realizing the ambitious agricultural development strategy, which aims to develop a “sustainable, modern and high-value agriculture in the Mekong Delta,” as Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in remarks at the Mekong Delta Forum in June 2016.

Lesson #3: A Need for a “Rice First” Policy

The farmer-billionaires’ success story in Cu Lao Gieng also sheds some light on why Vietnam should seek a “rice first” policy, which advocates freshwater-based agricultural production, at least in the near future, in its Mekong Delta. First of all, related to the first lesson, hasty industrialization without careful preparation — both increasing local authorities’ capability in industrial administration and environmental management and preparing farmers to take up non-farming jobs — may inevitably accelerate the environmental risks posed by Mekong upstream dams and result in social disorder due to spontaneous migration and a soaring poverty rate.

Second, the Mekong Delta remains the core agricultural production base in Vietnam, not only contributing significantly to both national food security and agricultural exports, but also playing a key role in the country’s economic development. The delta’s agricultural sector in particular is a rich source of inputs, such as the capital that comes from agricultural exports and invested and income-based savings, to feed the growing industrial and other modern sectors of Vietnam’s economy. Thus, the more agricultural land area in the delta shrinks, the more serious potential threat Vietnam’s economic growth may face.

Third, even though the Delta is deemed as the country’s biggest “rice bowl,” producing agricultural products year-round, hunger and poverty remain challenges, especially during the dry season. The humanitarian crisis due to food and freshwater shortages, promptly followed by sky-rocketing food prices, during last year’s drought highlights the need to strengthen the local capacity of agricultural production and foster a self-reliant food supply.

Fourth, in recent years farmers in coastal provinces such as Soc Trang, Ca Mau, and Bac Lieu have transferred from rice farming to a shrimp-rice model, which is believed to have potential to be more sustainable and profitable than traditional rice cultivation. However, it is worth observing that most rice-shrimp farmers in the Mekong Delta remain unsuccessful while the local environment and mangrove forests are irreparably damaged due to saline contamination after a few crops of shrimp breeding. From the standpoint of environmentalists, climate variability, increased water temperature and salinity, and rainwater scarcity coupled with pollution all make it quite difficult to grow rice in the wet season, while shrimp farming is being increasingly affected by uncontrollable disease outbreaks and sub-optimal water quality. As a result, shrimp-rice farming communes appear extremely vulnerable to food and freshwater shortages during the dry season since their fields and shrimp ponds, heavily contaminated by saltwater, are no longer usable for rice or any other vegetable farming.

Thus, as long as local irrigation systems and network of dams and desalination plants remain incomplete and inefficient, the delta’s state authorities and farmers will have to secure their freshwater-based agricultural areas by all means in order to prevent further expansion of agricultural land contaminated by saltwater intrusion.

Lesson #4: It’s Time for Local Wisdom

The above-mentioned success story from An Giang’s multi-billionaire village demonstrates that the Mekong Delta’s farmers, most of whom are not well-educated, can enrich themselves with creative agricultural production models, which may further generate new jobs and supporting economic activities on the spot. On the other hand, it also underscores the local inhabitants’ wisdom and experience in adapting to the changing environmental context on their own. Apparently, these isle villagers have enhanced their capacity to solve climate hazards and mitigate dam-building’s impacts by accommodating traditional farming paradigms to fit neatly into their changing ecosystem. Such local wisdom should be acknowledged as an important part of the region’s broader approach to climate-resilient development.

From the standpoint of policymaking, local peasants’ tactics to respond to changing climate conditions should be incorporated into the government’s decision-making. Thus, any policies or measures suggested by either policymakers or experts should not just look fixedly at the exercise of educating — or, more bluntly, imposing their perspectives and solutions on — the local people; rather, they should pay more attention to local wisdom with a view toward moderating the delta’s development process for all actors’ benefits – farmers, economic stakeholders, and local authorities.

Concluding Remarks

Climate hazards, notably floods and drought, are not new phenomena in the Mekong Delta. However, the last year’s historic, devastating “double disaster” drought serves as the most visible example to understand how fierce climate hazards can be when they are facilitated and exacerbated by Mekong mainstream dams. To make thing worse, the non-sustainable industrial development undertaken by the delta’s state authorities adds another danger to this environmental security risk, undermining regional ecosystems and increasing social disorder. Still, the success story of farmer billionaires in Cu Lao Gieng, a disaster prone isle commune in Vietnam’s Mekong River, appears to reveal promising prospects for Vietnam’s self-help climate-resilient strategy. Even though the region has witnessed some relative stability and improvement in environmental protection, it pays for Vietnam to remain prudent and patient in policymaking.

While pursuing anti-dam diplomacy over the Mekong River, Vietnam needs to practice self-reliance by sustaining freshwater-based agriculture, boosting agricultural modernization attempts, and learning local wisdom. All these are necessary steps for a climate-resilient development strategy, especially when the Mekong River Basin continues to be fraught with foreseeable environmental security risks and complex inter-boundary impacts.

Tue, Mar 21, 2017, 07:24 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

Mar 21, Colombo: In a special event held at the Presidential Secretariat today, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu ceremonially handed over the keys of eight Lorry Water Bowsers to President Maithripala Sirisena, as part of India's assistance to augment Drought Relief measures in Sri Lanka.

The commitment to donate eight water bowsers and 100 metric tonnes of rice as immediate assistance for drought relief was made by Foreign Secretary of India Dr. Jaishankar on behalf of Minister of External Affairs, Mrs. Sushma Swaraj to Sri Lanka Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mangala Samaraweera, during his recent visit to Sri Lanka in February 2017.

Pursuant to this commitment, India handed over eight lorry mounted water bowsers, locally purchased from Lanka Ashok Leyland, at a cost of Rs. 25 million to Sri Lanka today.

Handing over of the bowsers is part of India�s continued commitment to assist Sri Lanka whenever required, the High Commission said

44,44,Drought Sri Lanka,Somalia drought forces children out of school - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/3/4/somalia-drought-forces-children-out-of-school,"One-third of children in Somalia could drop out of school as the country is threatened with famine.

A third of children in Somalia’s drought-affected areas are at risk of dropping out of school, the UN says, as a shortage of food and water has left more than 6.2 million people needing urgent help.

The drought is threatening the lives of millions and almost three million are going hungry. Three million children in the country are missing school and more than 100,000 could join them, according to the UN.

On Tuesday, Somalia’s newly elected President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed declared a “national disaster” due to the drought.

The Horn of Africa nation is one of three countries – along with Yemen and Nigeria – that the aid agencies say are on the verge of famine.

The desperate search for water and food proving particularly difficult for children.

“I’d love to go back to school, but I’ve been forced to leave because I’m the eldest child in my family and I need to work at home,” Sadia Omar, a former student, told Al Jazeera.

“I fetch water and grass for the animals, but now because of the drought there is more work.”

Al Jazeera’s Fahmida Miller, reporting from Dollow in southern Somalia, said severe drought was forcing families to migrate in search of help.

“The number of children at this school [in the Dhuma Dhuma area] has halved in just three months,” she said.

“Families here live off their livestock and they’re doing all they can to keep their animals alive. If that means keeping their children out of school to look after them, many families are prepared to make the sacrifice.”

On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that Somalia was at risk of its third famine in 25 years. The last one, in 2011, killed almost 260,000 people.

The drought has led to a spread of acute watery diarrhoea, cholera and measles and nearly 5.5 million people are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases.

According to the WHO, more than 363,000 acutely malnourished children and 70,000 severely malnourished children need urgent, life-saving support.

“If the drought continues, these children will continue missing school and it will also impact their future learning and they won’t come back,” Abdihakim Ahmed, the headteacher at the school in Dhuma Dhuma, said.","Sat, 04 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/fbc83e95d4644593bbcd58ddfa5244cc_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['million', 'school', 'water', 'urgent', 'children', 'drought', 'food', 'forces', 'somalia', 'dhuma', 'risk']",

Its consequences are so severe that it is increasingly contributing to migration, and this incidence is likely to escalate much more in the years to come as climate change impacts become more serious.

Migration has always taken place in South Asia, for long before climate change became an issue. “Push factors” include conflict, poverty, land access and ethnicity, while there are also many “pull factors” such as development, livelihoods, seasonal labour, kinship and access to health or services. However because of this background of migration, South Asian countries are slow to recognise the role of climate change as an additional push factor, and the level to which it is driving migration. Climate change is thus still largely invisible in the migration discourse in South Asia.

This study looks at climate change and its impacts on migration in South Asia, and particularly in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The South Asia region is particularly vulnerable to climate change events. Droughts, heat waves, cyclones, rising sea levels, heavy rainfall, landslides and floods strike, are often felt by two or more neighbouring countries in the region, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) anticipates that these are likely to be felt more severely in future.

A drama is presently unfolding in the coastal city of Cape Town, South Africa, and maritime technology could offer a solution here and in other cities around the world.

Cape Town depends on winter rainfall to replenish the city’s water storage dams that located in the nearby coastal mountains. Last winter, Cape Town received minimal rainfall, and the city’s largest dam is below 20 percent capacity. Tanker ships carrying water offers modern coastal cities new options for enduring temporary droughts, and an analogous solution could also provide support to cities during power outages.

El Nino and La Nina weather occurrences deliver excess precipitation to some regions of the world and drought to others. During earlier times, such weather occurrences forced populations to relocate and abandon many cities and towns. In the U.S., the state of California recently received rainfall after a drought that lasted eight-years. Water diverted from other regions through channels provided some relief to California. Centuries earlier, this was not an option, and drought decimated much of the thriving Mayan Empire of Central and South Africa.

Even in modern times, the situation can be challenging. Some 10-years ago, a change in wind direction reduced rainfall over a watershed region of Quebec, Canada that was home to multiple hydroelectric power dams that supplies much electric power into the northeastern U.S. While the drought was short lived, it reduced water storage in Quebec’s hydroelectric power dams to the point where it became a matter of much concern. Several years ago, a prolonged drought emptied a main storage dam in Southern Australia and threatened the quality of life in the communities that depended on the dam. Drought has threated the water supply and power generation in other nations.

Maritime Water Tankers

During such times, converted tanker ships could carry potable water from a region of generous rainfall to a drought-stricken region. Ocean going tanker ships have periodically been converted to carrying potable water. In the Mediterranean Sea, such a ship has carried potable water from the south of France to Israel.

The viable operation of such ships would require that some regions become regular seasonal customers for potable water carried onboard tanker ships. Generous seasonal monsoon rainfall occurs in areas of Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, while regions of Southern India or Western Australia could endure the occasional drought. A location along the route of the water tanker ships that experiences an unexpected seasonal drought could prompt the shipowners to revise sailing schedules to deliver emergency potable water.

At some locations, the combination of oversea and submerged water pipelines could represent a competitive alternative to ship transport. However, excess seawater depth in some regions would discourage the installation of such pipelines and relegate water transport to the maritime sector. In Canada, discussions about transporting water from northwestern Canada to places such as California have also resulted in some public opposition to such transport.

Energy Ships

Many navies operate nuclear powered ships and nuclear powered submarines while the commercial maritime sector operates ships powered by diesel and by natural gas with engines capable of 30MW to 100MW output. Siemens build a gas turbine engine of 300MW capability, and such an engine could easily be installed within the hull of a ship. The market for electric power fluctuates seasonally in some regions of the world and an energy ship that visits seasonally could be a future option. There are also coastal cities that experience emergencies such as prolonged reduction of hydroelectric power due to weather occurrences.

An available energy ship could provide relief to a coastal city that faces a seasonal or unexpected shortage of electric power. Such a ship could either berth at an available dock or moor offshore in protected waters, with an undersea power cable providing a connection to the shore and to a local power distribution system. A floating LNG tanker barge could provide several days or several weeks of energy storage capacity. Advances in small scale thorium-based nuclear energy conversion could result in future energy ships using such technology to provide short term electric power.

Wind Powered Ships

During the early 20th century, German inventor Anton Flettner installed several vertical-axis turbines on the deck of a ship that sailed across the North Atlantic. Wind energy interacted with the Flettner rotors and provided sufficient power to drive the propeller and propel the ship across the ocean. Shipping companies are again considering wind-assisted propulsion for ships, and the choice of technologies includes deck mounted wind turbines. While such a ship is moored in a windswept bay, the deck mounted turbines could drive electric generators to produce power for shore-based applications.

Airborne kite sails are one of the technologies being used to assist in providing ship propulsion along routes where trade winds blow parallel to sailing direction. The winds blow at higher speed at higher elevation.

On land, certain designs of kites have been used to alternately pull and release tension on cables connected to ground level electrical generators. There may be scope to modify airborne sails to provide propulsion when the vessel is sailing at sea and drive electric generators when the ship is stationary and moored to provide electric power for local land-based consumption.

Desalination Ships

The development of energy ships allows for the development of desalination ships that may moor alongside the energy ship. A long pipe that leads far offshore would carry brine from the desalination ship. Such ships would become the option where extended sailing distances of water tanker ships would be impractical.

A desalination ship could include both reverse-osmosis-membrane technology as well as thermal desalination technology to provide potable water. Either a short-distance water pipeline would connect the desalination ship to the shore, or a water tanker ship would shuttle potable water from offshore desalination ship to shore-based water tanks.

Desalination ships could source energy from multiple sources. Offshore wave energy technology could drive wave pumps and push seawater under pressure through a pipe to ships with reverse-osmosis technology. Wind energy ships could use rotary turbines or airborne sails to directly drive water pumps that could produce sufficient pressure to sustain operation of reverse-osmosis desalination technology.

Large ships could also carry arrays of solar PV panels to generate electric power for reverse-osmosis desalination or carry solar thermal concentration technology to sustain operation of thermal desalination technology. Small-scale, ship-based nuclear power could also provide energy for seawater desalination.

Conclusions

Drought has occurred throughout the earth’s history and even at the present day, regions of the world experience prolonged drought. During earlier times, drought forced populations to relocate and abandon established cities and towns. Modern day drought reduces hydroelectric power generation.

During modern drought periods, maritime based technology can achieve much in terms of providing temporary relief to drought-stricken coastal regions. Maritime based technology can provide electric power and potable water on a seasonal basis to many locations around the world, thereby making such technology viable.

As of 19 March, over one million people are affected by prolonged drought in 17 out of 25 districts of Sri Lanka. According to a joint household assessment, an estimated 900,000 people were identified as in urgent need of food assistance, with 25,000 people severely food insecure. Food, water and sanitation, health and agriculture are urgent priority needs. UN agencies are currently finalizing a request for UN Central Emergency Response Fund grant application.

Since October 2016, an estimated 74,000 people originating from Rakhine State in Myanmar have crossed to Bangladesh – this figure has remained steady since 2 February. As of 4 March, Bangladesh confirmed that 384 undocumented Myanmar nationals returned to Myanmar through the Damdamia check point. With the fluid movements along the border, verifying the returns, however, remains a challenge. Additional WASH services and facilities are urgently needed by the new arrivals particularly in Kutipalong and Balukhali.

RATNAPURA, Sri Lanka, Mar 28 2017 (IPS) - As the mercury rises higher, Kamakandalagi Leelavathi delves deeper into the lush green mass of the tea bushes. The past few afternoons there have been thunderstorms. So the 55-year-old tea picker in Uda Houpe tea garden of Sri Lanka’s Hatton region is rushing to complete her day’s task before the rain comes: harvesting 22 kgs of tea leaves.

“The rain is very unpredictible. Now there are downpours but it has been very dry the past few months,” says the daily wager who owns a one-acre marginal farm.

Yet at the Uda Houpe tea garden, the situation is much better, says Daurkarlagi Taranga, Leelavathi’s daughter and fellow tea farmer. “We have not been affected as badly as others. Here, the bushes are still full (of leaves) and the ground is moist thanks to the techniques we use,” she says.

These techniques are assorted green actions taken by small tea planters to manage their farmland in an eco-friendly way, explains Alluth Wattage Saman, manager of the Uda Houpe estate. The most important of these actions is minimising use of synthetic weed killer (herbicide), widely viewed as the main reason behind the degrading health of soil and tea plants in the region.

Climate threat to a lucrative sector

The tea sector of Sri Lanka is 153 years old and remain the largest industry today, providing employment to 2.5 million people. According to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the industry counts for 62 percent of all agricultural exports and brings home 1.6 billion dollars in foreign currency each year. Contributing to this huge business is a 400,000-strong small tea farmer community.

However, the lucrative tea economy of the island nation has been witnessing growing environmental challenges – the biggest of them being severe land degradation.

According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), there is high rate of land degradation across the tea growing region in Sri Lanka. The biggest reason is that farmers here have used synthetic weed killer on the plantations for several decades.

They also paid little attention to protecting the water sources and biodiversity around the plantations. This has gradually affected the health of the soil, decreasing its fertility level, making it more acidic and also causing soil erosion.

While the degradation has affected the entire industry, the livelihoods and food security of the small tea growers are particularly threatened, says Lalith Kumar, project manager at the Tea Small Holding Development Authority (TSHDA) in Ratnapura, a region that produces over 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s tea.

Greening the Small Farms

The TSHDA is a government agency working with small tea growers in the country. According to Kumar, there are 150 small tea farms (less than 10 acres of land) in the Ratnapura region alone which provide livelihood to about 100,000 farmers. Climate change has worsened the situation with recurring droughts, erratic rainfall, and increasing soil erosion and acidification.

As a result, tea bushes are withering and moisture from the topsoil is evaporating, leaving the soil hardened and plant roots weak and damaged.

To help the tea farmers deal with this, TSHDA is currently working with the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) on a project to minimise herbicide use in the small tea farms and reverse the processes of degradation by sustainably managing the land.

According to a document by Global Environment Facility (GEF), the funder of the 2.9 million project, the goal is to “improve farm management practices, so that existing production land becomes more productive and forests, rivers, streams and other biologically important land situated on or adjacent to tea production areas are protected from negative impacts.”

A major step taken by the TSHDA is to train the farmers to manage their land in a sustainable way with minimum or no herbicides.

“We have started to train small farm managers in sustainable land management techniques that are simple, yet effective,” Kumar said. A lot of weeds grow around the tea bush, but only some of them are harmful.

“We train them in identifying the weeds and removing the harmful ones either by uprooting or cutting them at the roots. The weeds are then used as a bed of mulch, applied in between the two rows of tea plants. This helps retain the moisture on the land,“ he explained.

Training the Community

Saman, the manager of the Uda Haupe, is one of the 300 small tea growers who have been trained by TSHDA so far. It was an informal, hands-on training, reveals Saman, which included a day-long visit to a progressive and sustainably managed farm – the Hapugastenne tea estate.

There Saman saw small farmers like him managing their land without any synthetic weed killer or pesticides. He also learned to use organic manure, protect the water sources like natural springs within the plantation, as well the shedy trees, so birds and other animals can also survive. Finally, he learnt that the yield of the farm had increased almost by 60 percent since they adopted those techniques.

The visit, says the tea planter, helped him realize “small steps can bring bring big changes in a farm”.

The result has been encouraging: “I earlier spent 35,000 on herbicide every year, now I am saving that amount. My overall profit has gone up to 75,000 rupees,” says Saman, who has shared the newfound knowledge with his workers.

Some Unplugged Gaps

Saman and other small tea farmers in the area like Leelavathi sell their harvest to Kahawatte Plantation, a tea estate owned by corporate tea giant Dilmah. Early this month, the plantation received a Rainforest Alliance certificcation which recognizes that the estate maintains sustainability standards all along its supply chain, including the farms from where it buys the tea. This has already boosted the price of the estate’s produce, but suppliers like Saman are not aware of either the certification or its economic benefits such as higher market value.

“Nobody has told us about this,” Saman says.

Others want the government to help them with monetary incentives to better deal with climatic challenges.

At present, TSHDA offers a 50 percent subsidy to farmers who want to do a replantation on their farm – a complex and costly process that involves complete uprooting of all the tea plants, re-preparing the soil and replanting the saplings.

This is done when the yield in the farm drops dramatically due to either age (normally 30 years) or severe degradation of the land that cripples productivity. However, there are no other subsidies or incentives provided to the farmers right now for adopting sustainable land management – a policy that small tea growers like Leelavathi would like to see change.

“Since the use of the mulch, I began to save 700 rupees every month on herbicide and my total income rose to 15,000. But because of the growing droughts, I have to use most of it on fertilizer. If the government gives a subsidy, it will be very helpful. Or else I may have to migrate to another estate to earn more,” she says.","Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2017/03/tea1.jpg,"['farmers', 'saman', 'land', 'farm', 'managers', 'small', 'sri', 'uda', 'lankas', 'sustainable', 'turn', 'tea', 'soil', 'tshda']", 
50,50,Drought Sri Lanka,Ongoing drought; Sacred duty to save water - Opinion - Daily Mirror,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Ongoing-drought-Sacred-duty-to-save-water-121689.html,"Rice has been Sri Lanka’s staple diet for thousands of years and our country was once known as the rice bowl of the region. But the Agriculture Department has warned that due to the lack of rain Sri Lanka may face a rice crisis by June this year and we may have to import our ‘buth patha’.



Agriculture Director General Rohan Wijekoon has said the lack of water for paddy cultivation is expected to drastically reduce rice production by June this year. According to him, there has already been a sharp drop in paddy cultivation during the current season. Paddy farmers had hoped to cultivate about 800,000 hectares yet they were able to cultivate only about 300,000 hectares last year. The Agriculture chief says that last year, Sri Lanka had a paddy harvest of 2.7 million metric tons — higher than our requirement of 2.2 million metric tons. As a result the buffer stocks will be sufficient till next month. The lack of rain has also reduced water levels in the tanks or ‘wewas’. The Irrigation Department has told the Agriculture Department that it will stop or cut down the amount of water provided to the paddy fields, because it needs to preserve water for drinking and other essential purposes.



Mr. Wijekoon says that farmers who expect to cultivate paddy during the Yala Season from April to September this year may not get enough water from the Irrigation Department as the tank levels are low.



According to the Irrigation Director General S.S.L. Weerasinghe, the water levels of the tanks had gone down to about one-third of the capacity. He says some tanks are filled with mud and silt. Therefore retaining water even during heavy rain is difficult.



Whoever or whatever is responsible for this crisis, whatever the mess up or mismanagement, we need to look at the possible solutions where not only the government but also eco-friendly and responsible citizens could get proactively involved.



For instance the people need to voluntarily and willingly save fresh water. This is not just to reduce our water bills but more so to participate actively in an eco-friendly move to save fresh water at a time when the supplies are running low and we do not have sufficient water for paddy cultivation.

During the past two decades the United States and other big powers have gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq not just to curb terrorism but more so to gain control of oil and natural gas supplies. World political analysts have warned that in the coming decades worldwide fresh water supplies will be so low that big powers may even go to war to gain control of fresh water resources. Sri Lanka with so many big rivers and may be one of the targets.



While taking measures to prevent any such move to grab our fresh water resources, we also need to take steps to conserve water. If every responsible citizen could consciously save about 10 litres of water a day the overall saving will be millions of litres daily.



Going beyond that, more people need to go for the eco-friendly practice of rainwater harvesting. The internet has details of organisations where rain water experts rainwater could help families to install the equipment at a low cost.



Ages ago our great king Parakramabahu told us that not a single drop of rainwater should be allowed to go waste without using it for cultivation, drinking and other essential purposes. But today millions of litres of rainwater go waste while in times of drought the lives of farmers and others are severely affected. While responsible families need to act on the rainwater harvesting process the government also needs to revive an earlier plan to restore about 10,000 ‘wewas’ which have been acclaimed as marvels of ancient engineering.



This year being the year of poverty alleviation and the launching of the sustainable development strategy, the provision of water for drinking or other household purposes and for agriculture is vital. We urge the national government to provide incentives including tax concessions for household rainwater harvesting and also to give priority to the restoration of the ‘wewas’.","Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://static.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/advr_5d3f39d574.jpg,"['need', 'rain', 'opinion', 'duty', 'save', 'ongoing', 'water', 'sri', 'drought', 'department', 'rice', 'fresh', 'rainwater', 'responsible', 'sacred', 'paddy']",

Fueled by one of the worst droughts in decades, farmers in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, tired of the lack of adequate compensation, severe losses to their livelihoods, and rising rates of suicide took to Delhi to protest. When the National Human Rights Council issued a notice to the state, Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami released relief packages for drought hit farmers with compensation dependent upon whether their work was dependent on irrigation or seasonal rain. However, this proved to be inadequate for farmers who had staked or sold their gold or taken on loans with harsh terms, many of whom ultimately decided to fight for fairer compensation.

The protest has just crossed five weeks after having started on March 14 and is geared towards the goal of making the central government aware of their plight. Carrying skulls symbolizing their brethren who died or committed suicide, they demand a larger drought relief package of approximately $6 billion (similar to a loan waiver that was offered to farmers in the state of Uttar Pradesh) and a better support price.

In Delhi, they escalated their protest symbolically at multiple stages, beginning with skulls and proceeding to hold rodents to their mouth or eat food off the tar road, mixed with mud, indicating that the government was forcing them to eat dirt as food. After being denied permission to meet any high officials in the Prime Minister’s Office, some stripped and escalated to a nude protest before being apprehended by the police. As they crossed a month, they began to sing funeral songs and symbolically cut marital threads to allude to the plight of the widows of the farmers who committed suicide. Stopping at nothing, they went onto eat grass, hold mock funerals, beat their chests in mourning, and even strip outside the President’s office.

Their tactics and persistence has certainly grabbed attention in certain circles. Other political leaders, including the opposition Indian National Congress’ Vice President Rahul Gandhi, have all met the protesters, and Gandhi in particular berated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not hearing out their plight. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party held an emergency session and called for a state wide ‘bandh’ or protest on April 25 that will bring services to a halt, in solidarity with the farmers. In a manner similar to the opposition in New Delhi, the DMK has further used this as an opportunity to point to the inability of the state government to fulfill farmers’ demands. The Communist Party of India has also expressed solidarity and begun their own protests, declaring that they will not stop until the farmers have been compensated.

The central government has been placed in an extremely precarious position now as both the resolve and the support base of the farmers gets stronger. Recently, the protesters staged a scene where a man wearing a mask of Modi is shown to be flogging the protesters – alleging that by ignoring them, the prime minister was treating them in a manner tantamount to whipping.

The chances of the farmers gaining their entire demand of compensation remains to be seen as the protests carry on, but their chances of gaining an audience get better everyday. As groups in different state with similar agendas take note of this protest, the way New Delhi responds becomes crucial. All eyes are on the Modi government’s move.","Sat, 22 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat.com-800px-ploughing_with_cattle_in_west_bengal.jpg,"['seeking', 'farmers', 'state', 'similar', 'prime', 'suicide', 'drought', 'plight', 'modi', 'protesters', 'delhi', 'relief', 'protest', 'indian']",

54,54,Drought Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka struggles to build up foreign reserves - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/Sri-Lanka-struggles-to-build-up-foreign-reserves,"HAMBANTOTA, Sri Lanka A South Korean ship unloads its cargo of cars at the Hambantota port, the only sign of life at Sri Lanka's newest harbor on its southern coast. The rest of this $1.4 billion port, built with a loan from the Export-Import Bank of China, sits idle. Weeds are spreading and visitors to the port's administrative offices must tiptoe around feral dogs.

Emptiness has dogged the port since it opened in 2012. Only a handful of car carriers drop anchor each week. The ruling coalition government, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, says the port is a ""white elephant"" left by the previous regime, led by the autocratic former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mounting operating losses, estimated at $235 million, deepen the impression that the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port was a Rajapaksa vanity project.

The ruling coalition wants to end this drain on the economy. The cabinet has just endorsed a public-private partnership agreement with state-backed China Merchants Port Holdings, which will take an 80% debt-for-equity stake in a joint venture that will run the 1,500-hectare port. The government is hoping to recover $1.12 billion over the course of the 99-year lease, and will look for more Chinese cash if plans are approved for a 6,000-hectare special industrial zone on an adjacent site.

The Chinese government is strongly supportive of the port, which Beijing sees as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative. ""We want to help Sri Lanka build a transport hub and a logistics center,"" said Qiu Xinli, chief of the political section at the Chinese embassy in Colombo. ""It is a good project, no matter which government is in power in Sri Lanka.""

For Sri Lanka, giving a new lease on life to the Hambantota port is a big step toward building a maritime economy. But it is also a crucial element in the government's attempts to build up its depleted foreign reserves in the face of a looming debt repayment crisis.

By 2019, the country needs to repay $3.99 billion to foreign creditors. Foreign reserves fell to $4.23 billion in November 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund, which warned after a visit to Sri Lanka in March of impending repayment problems.

""MAJOR PLUS"" Indrajit Coomaraswamy, governor of the central bank, regards the Hambantota deal as a ""major plus"" for reserves. ""This year, at least, we could get $400 million if the deal goes through,"" he said. A member of the bank's monetary board echoed this sentiment: ""The government wants to look at this transaction to address some of the broader macroeconomic issues, so the deal is not just about the port.""

Coomaraswamy has set his sights on increasing Sri Lanka's foreign exchange reserves to $7.5 billion by the end of this year, part of which will be achieved through a planned $1.5 billion sovereign bond issue and a $700 million syndicated loan.

By February, the reserves recovered to $5.6 billion, according to the central bank, but Sri Lanka will require $7 billion by 2019 to cover loans and bridge rising fiscal deficit. According to the IMF, total external and domestic public debt amounted to 76% of gross domestic product at the end of 2015, the latest figures available. About $8 billion is owed to China for loans secured by the Rajapaksa regime between 2005 and 2015. The loans, written at commercial interest rates, funded a raft of infrastructure projects, including the Hambantota port.

The depth of Sri Lanka's looming economic crisis is illustrated by the deteriorating trade deficit, which grew from $8.4 billion in calendar 2015 to nearly $9.1 billion in 2016, according to the central bank. Earnings from Sri Lanka's narrow export base, largely in garments and tea, fell 2.2% in 2016 from the previous year, while imports rose 2.5%.

Sri Lanka's current account is likely to record a surplus for the year thanks to tourism earnings, which rose 18% to $3.5 billion, and remittances from workers in the Middle East and other parts of Asia, who sent home $7.2 billion, a slight increase from the previous year.

But the coalition government has had to stomach bad news about foreign direct investment. FDI inflows plunged 34% to $444.5 million in 2016 from a year ago.

AIR OF UNCERTAINTY Indeed, Sri Lanka's FDI record was far below Vietnam's and Myanmar's in 2015.

""In 2016, the investment climate [in Sri Lanka] was significantly affected by political uncertainty, policy uncertainty and tax uncertainties,"" said Shiran Fernando, lead economist at Frontier Research, a Colombo-based think tank. ""This negatively affected potential investments.""

Nature has not spared the island, either. The worst drought in decades during the main rice cultivation season cut the 2017 harvest by 53% to 1.82 million tons -- a severe blow given that agriculture contributes 9% of gross domestic product and employs 28% of the labor force. The department of census and statistics said in March that the drought -- and the severe floods that preceded it -- would cut GDP growth to 4.4% for 2016, compared with 4.8% the previous year. The government had to dip into its depleted foreign reserves to import rice from Asian neighbors.

The fragility of the economy has been highlighted by the IMF, which approved a $1.5 billion loan to Sri Lanka last year to stave off a crisis. ""A more prolonged drought could raise food and oil imports with adverse impact on growth, inflation and the balance of payments,"" said Jaewoo Lee, head of the IMF mission to Colombo in March. But Lee kept the Sri Lanka government guessing over the release of the $119.9 million third tranche of the loan, due to be transferred in April.

""Having an IMF program is the equivalent of being in hospital,"" Coomaraswamy said in January. ""We are not in the ICU [intensive care unit] but clearly in the hospital.""

The government's efforts to balance the books resulted in an upgrade by credit ratings agency Fitch, which in February revised Sri Lanka's credit outlook from negative to stable, and confirmed the country's B+ sovereign credit rating.

Fitch praised the government for pushing ahead with IMF prescriptions, including raising value-added taxes and reducing public spending to cut the budget deficit, which dropped from 7.4% of GDP in 2015 to 5.6% in 2016. There is new pressure, however, to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5% by 2020.

The government is also pushing ahead with restructuring state-owned enterprises despite the risk of a political backlash. It announced in late March the first steps toward the privatization of ""strategic assets"" such as Ceylon Petroleum Corp., the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan Airlines.

Finance Ministry officials have also discussed the sale of ""nonstrategic assets"" ranging from a five-star hotel to a hospital. But will the government stay the course? It may have little choice, given the depleted foreign reserves and ticking debt clock. The Hambantota port deal has surfaced as a gauge of whether it will be possible to unload more debt-ridden state assets for dollars. No wonder, at some seminars in Colombo, speakers give the impression that the country is facing an ""SOS moment.""","Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F9%252F7%252F1%252F4%252F2394179-8-eng-GB%252F20170403_SriLanka.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['million', 'port', 'reserves', 'lanka', 'sri', 'billion', 'lankas', '2016', 'struggles', 'foreign', 'hambantota', 'build']",

Three successive years of failed rains have left the island nation wrestling with crop failure and a chronic lack of food and clean drinking water, with agencies warning last month that nearly 850,000 people are experiencing “alarming” hunger levels.

“Three hundred and thirty thousand are on the verge of a food security catastrophe, next step being famine,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies and rehabilitation at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

“People go from one lean season to the next, resorting to negative coping strategies. People are eating anything to fill their stomachs, selling most of their belongings, cattle and land. It shows the severity of the situation and the need for us to act.”

Farmers talk of the earth changing; of failed rains and crops, and barren land. Meanwhile, agencies are fighting a desperate rearguard action. Unicef, the UN children’s agency, reports growing demand for the high-calorie, peanut-based paste used to combat severe acute malnutrition.

“People are living under extreme conditions. We are dealing with a development crisis that has lasted for decades now, worsened by El Niño. For many, it is day-to-day survival,” said Elke Wisch, country representative for Unicef Madagascar.

Wisch emphasised the need to build resilience in the disaster-prone country, where food production has all but ground to a halt as the El Niño weather phenomenon exacerbates the effects of the drought. “We know that natural disasters will occur,” she said. “The important thing is how the local population can respond to these shocks.”

Yet mounting any kind of response is complicated by huge funding shortfalls. The World Food Programme’s (WFP) operations across seven countries in southern Africa are only 50% funded between now and April, with the total deficit at roughly $300m. The organisation’s $82m drought relief operation in Madagascar, which runs until March 2017, faces a $50m shortfall.

The FAO is also struggling, with a $17.5m shortfall limiting the distribution of emergency packages to 75,000 of the the 175,000 farming households in need.

Appealing for further donations, both organisations have stressed the importance of the forthcoming planting season. “If we miss planting season, the need for food assistance could go into March 2018,” warned Burgeon.

Either way, the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. Poor infrastructure makes it difficult to get assistance to remote areas of the south, with journeys of more than 200km likely to take days by road.

Moreover, nutritional challenges are endemic, with more than 50% of children suffering from stunted growth, a condition caused by malnutrition over the first 1,000 days of life. The issue costs the world’s sixth poorest country an estimated $740m a year, roughly 7% of its GDP.

We're starting to see people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation Elle Wisch, country representative, Unicef Madagascar

“We have not even reached the peak yet, we are four to five months away from the next harvest,” said David Orr, the WFP’s regional spokesperson.



Madagascar’s president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, will be anxious to ensure that infrastructure issues in Antananarivo, the country’s gridlocked capital, do not impinge on the hosting of a summit for French language states this weekend. With hotel swimming pools being used for drying sheets and laundry, and the city’s river running lower than normal due to its use for bathing, washing and stone production, Antananarivo has not been untouched by the effects of the drought.

After the summit, Rajaonarimampianina will travel to the Paris headquarters of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for a donor conference.

In the absence of more immediate support, however, farmers in the region reliant on rain-fed agriculture face a precarious existence. “Worst case is another crop failure,” said Wisch. “Then you are looking at – and we’re starting to see this now – people eating seeds instead of planting them. That is a desperate situation.”","Fri, 25 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb22a58c75529f2ff18c5db211cde1e522a8b4c5/0_51_778_467/master/778.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fa35e469349cfd2c0bb52befb5308378,"['need', 'warns', 'situation', 'madagascar', 'drought', 'food', 'planting', 'country', 'famine', 'wisch', 'unicef', 'season', '330000', 'southern', 'step']",

61,61,Drought Sri Lanka,Protect wetlands to reduce disaster risk - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/protect-wetlands-reduce-disaster-risk,"By Jonathan Fowler

GENEVA, 2 February 2017 – Sites such as mangroves, coral reefs, flood plains or peat marshes are natural buffers against weather hazards including storms and floods, according to experts marking this year’s World Wetlands Day.

“Disasters and disaster risk are rising,” said Ms. Jane Madgwick, Chief Executive Officer of Wetlands International. “Ninety percent of those disasters are water-related. It’s no accident that such disasters are rising as wetlands are degraded.”

The 2017 theme of World Wetlands Day is disaster risk reduction, and Ms. Madgwick told a conference in Geneva that it was important to do away with the label “natural disasters”, given that the risk-increasing actions of humans are the critical factor.

“It’s actually in our hands how much of a disaster it is,” she said.

Ms. Martha Rojas-Urrego, Secretary General of the international community’s Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, underlined that 64% of the world’s wetlands have disappeared in the past 100 years. The current rate of loss is 1% per year, faster than any other ecosystem.

“Wetlands are drained or degraded to meet the increasing demands for water and land to cater for agriculture, industry and a growing urban population. It is crucial that more voices speak up for wetlands, more people become informed of their value and more decisive actions are taken to conserve and restore this valuable ecosystem,” Ms. Rojas-Urrego said.

“Well-managed wetlands make communities resilient in the event of extreme weather and help to minimize the damage from these hazards. Coastal wetlands such as mangroves protect against flooding and serve as buffers against saltwater intrusion and erosion. Inland wetlands such as floodplains, lakes and peatlands absorb and store excess rainfall, which reduces flooding as well as delaying the onset of droughts by storing water,” she explained.

Deploying ecosystem protection as a means to curb the impact of hazards is a key tenet of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, adopted in 2015. The 15-year Sendai Framework is the international community’s most comprehensive disaster risk reduction blueprint to date, and was the first building block of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

There is an abundance of the impact of protecting or degrading wetlands.

In Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka, protected offshore coral reefs helped break the power of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami so that damage extended just 50 metres inland. In nearby Peraliya, where coral mining had damaged the reefs, the damage extended 1.5 kilometres inland.

Mangroves showed their mettle during the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan storm surge disaster in the Philippines, said Ms. Maria Teresa T. Almojuela, the country’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, pointing to the case of the town of Palompon.

“A distinct feature of that town is that it is surrounded by a mangrove plantation. That protected it. The town was spared the devastation,” she said.

In the wake of the disaster – which was a stark sign of the “new normal”, Ms. Almojuela said – the Philippines brought together different arms of government to embed disaster risk reduction in its environmental policy.

Breaking down barriers between groups of policymakers is exactly the kind of approach advocated by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), which sees it as the key to success.

“It’s important to engage all players to reduce disaster risk,” said Ms. Kirsi Madi, Director of UNISDR, noting that this also applies to the business world.

Mindful that companies are responsible for the bulk of investment in the built environment, in 2015 UNISDR and its partners set up the Private Sector Alliance for Disaster Resilient Societies, also known as ARISE. Its projects include working with local governments and firms around the Gulf of Mexico to reduce the risk of a repeat of the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster, with measures including wetland restoration.

“Every public and private sector decision will have consequences. Therefore there’s a need to understand the long-term and not just the short-term gains,” Ms Madi said.

Wetlands also provide food for more than three billion people worldwide, are a source of fresh water for over one billion, and, by storing carbon dioxide, can slow the pace of global warming.

“If we think we can have all the food, the air and the water and not protect nature, we didn’t do the sums,” said Ms. Inge Andersen, Director General of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).","Thu, 02 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/report-images/mangroves.jpg?itok=LJHnmoXv,"['international', 'world', 'protect', 'ms', 'reefs', 'wetlands', 'reduction', 'water', 'risk', 'unisdr', 'reduce', 'disaster', 'town']",

63,63,Drought Sri Lanka,La Paz is short of water as Bolivia suffers its worst drought in 25 years - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-01-04/la-paz-short-water-bolivia-s-suffers-its-worst-drought-25-years,"Bolivia’s dried-out Ajuan Khota dam, a reservoir affected by drought near La Paz, was photographed on Nov. 17.

The rugged Dakar Rally auto race is about to blaze through Bolivia. But to many Bolivians, the timing could not be worse.

Thousands of La Paz residents have been protesting these days. Now they’re also shouting online with the hashtag #AguaSíDakarNo — “yes to water, no to Dakar.” In other words, they wish authorities would pay more attention to a deepening water crisis.

Jan. 8 will mark two whole months of a water shortage in La Paz. Bolivia’s government says the country is suffering from its worst drought in 25 years. It’s gotten so bad that President Evo Morales declared a national state of emergency, tightened up water rationing, fired a top water official and drew up infrastructure projects to remediate the crisis.

Some blame foreign mines near one of La Paz’s reservoirs for allegedly sucking up the supply. Some blame bad government planning. Others say this is climate change — including shrinking glaciers — bearing down on one of the world’s highest cities. The reality is possibly a combination of all three.

Problem is, droughts and water conflicts are not just affecting South America. They’re popping up anywhere from California to Syria to India — and, with populations growing and the climate changing, struggles over H2O are forecast to get a lot worse. Water is being called the new oil of the century, and some even predict international water wars to erupt over the next decades.

Fortunately for Bolivia, war has not broken out. But this current crisis in the Andes could be a bellwether for the Americas and beyond.

The government knows the glaciers are receding — by over 40 percent since 1985, according to one recent study. And it’s not just in Bolivia; Peru, Ecuador and Colombia are also losing ice cover. Bolivian cities get some of their water from glacial supplies, especially during dry months. Critics say the Bolivian government has failed to take measures to secure alternative water supplies.

Morales’ government, however, claims protesters are hyping up the water crisis to foment opposition to his 10-year rule.

Dicey water delivery?

Rationing has hit more than 100 neighborhoods and affected about 400,000 people in La Paz and the neighboring city of El Alto.

Trucks bring water every three to four days for residents to fill just two containers at a time.

However, the La Paz Medical Association has advised that the water be filtered and treated with bleach before it’s consumed. That’s because of media reports that the same delivery trucks were previously used for carrying gasoline and diesel.

The head of a fuel company reportedly acknowledged his trucks were being used, but claimed the company followed rigorous cleaning protocols before filling them up with water.

Officials at Bolivia’s water and sanitation agency did not answer requests for comment.

Many in La Paz have no other option but to drink the allegedly tainted water. Not everyone can simply buy bottled water to meet their daily needs.

Yet the crisis is taking a toll on families, regardless of their income. Even the city’s more affluent south side is having rough times because of it — a rare case for Latin American elites.

A history of water woes

The resource-rich country is no stranger to water conflict. Back in 2000, a popular uprising took water management away from private hands after deadly clashes with government security forces in the city of Cochabamba.

Even though Cochabamba residents are now better prepared, by collecting rainwater, the city and other areas continue to face shortages.

Lake Poopó, once Bolivia's second-largest lake, dried out last year, as these NASA images show. Climate has taken part of the blame.

“This is a picture of the future of climate change,” German glaciologist Dirk Hoffman told The Associated Press at the start of 2016.

Authorities and environmentalists also point to another factor: Mining sped up the depletion of the Desaguadero River that fed the lake.

According to Paola Cortés, an environmental lawyer in La Paz, large-scale gold extraction swallowed and polluted the river since the 1980s without any oversight.

And in another city, Potosí, Cortés recalls a recent scandal where countless truckloads of the public’s water were being sold to mining firms, reportedly for about 1,000 to 2,000 bolivianos (US$145 to $290) each.

Spilling over borders

Making matters worse, Bolivia is waging a water war with Chile in the International Court of Justice.

In June, the Morales government sued Chile at The Hague for channeling water from Bolivia’s Silala spring. Chile argues the water flows naturally downhill to its territory. The Chilean state-owned mining company and many private mining firms have been using the water for years.

The case is expected to take months, if not years, to be resolved.

But in the meantime, water problems are affecting both countries.

Take Calama, a city in Chile’s Atacama Desert that’s home to many of the region’s copper miners. “Water is not for sale!” reads a local mural. But water polluted with arsenic from the mines flows out of local household faucets.

How about the Rio Grande?

About 4,000 miles north, Mexico and the US have some issues, too. Water-sharing agreements for resources reaching eight states as far up as Wyoming could see turmoil — particularly with the incoming administration of Donald Trump, as Politico reported.

Lori Kuczmanski, foreign affairs secretary at the International Boundary and Water Commission, which oversees the treaties, says she expects work to continue as usual despite administration changes.

""We are looking for ways to cooperate together in the case of a drought contingency,"" Kuczmanski says.

Still, Lake Mead, in Arizona and Nevada, has registered historic lows recently and the Rio Grande is frequently at risk of drought — which could all affect the supply for thousands.

It all raises questions about how to better administer this crucial resource going forward. Residents want better government oversight. But plenty of countries rely on private management. Experts say the effectiveness of either model depends on water availability more than financial support.

Ryan Stoa at the Florida International University College of Law suggests local administration of water resources is a better route. Transferring authority to decentralized agencies specializing in water could improve small-scale management. Stoa calls it “subsidiarity”: making laws and regulating them at the lowest governance level “to promote efficiency and local ownership over policies and regulations.”

Meanwhile, observers say Bolivia needs improvement regulating, whether on the private- or public-sector side.

As for the Dakar Rally, its director Marc Coma has reportedly ordered six truckloads of water brought in for the competition.

“We decided to transport, from Argentina, our own water in enormous tanker trucks,” Coma said according to El Periódico newspaper, “so Bolivia won't have to worry about us.”","Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/open_graph/public/story/images/Bolivia%20drought%20crop.jpg?itok=bZs69-fH,"['running', 'dangerously', 'mining', 'bolivia', 'residents', 'low', 'paz', 'city', 'private', 'water', 'drought', 'glaciers', 'la', 'say', 'melting', 'bolivias']",

In drought-hit Somalia, children also face potentially deadly measles threat

UNICEF and partners conduct lifesaving vaccination campaign

© UNICEF/Mohamed Hersi On 24 April 2017, a mother gives her child a deworming tablet mixed with water at Beerta Muuri camp in Baidoa during the measles vaccination campaign launch.

BAIDOA, Somalia, 25 April 2017 – Almost 30,000 young children, many of them displaced by a searing drought, are being vaccinated against measles this week in an emergency campaign in Baidoa, a town at the heart of one of Somalia’s hardest-hit areas.

Many of the children have never been immunized before – they come from remote areas health workers often cannot reach because of a decades-old conflict that has ravaged the impoverished country in the Horn of Africa.



So far this year, almost 5,700 cases of suspected measles have been reported across the country, more than the total number of cases in 2016. Measles, a viral respiratory infection that spreads through air and contact with infected mucus and saliva, thrives in congested, unsanitary displacement camps, which have mushroomed across the town and surrounding areas. More than 100,000 people have come to Baidoa in search of assistance, including at least 70,000 in March alone.



“Among vaccine-preventable diseases, none is more deadly than measles,” said Steven Lauwerier, UNICEF’s Representative in Somalia. “And we know only too well from the 2011 famine that measles, combined with malnutrition and displacement, is an especially lethal combination for children.”



The threat of famine once again looms large over Somalia. Over half the population is acutely food insecure, water-borne and infectious diseases like cholera and measles are spreading, and up to a million children are, or will be acutely malnourished this year, with one in five requiring life-saving treatment.



“The only way to prevent sickness and death from measles is to make sure all children receive the vaccine. A child suffering from severe acute malnutrition is nine times more likely to die from a disease like measles than a healthy child. We have no time to lose,” Lauwerier said.



The Baidoa campaign is part of an effort to vaccinate about 110,000 displaced children below 5 years old in hotspots across south central Somalia, plus 250,000 children in Somaliland, against the deadly contagious disease, by the end of May. Conducted in partnership with the Ministry of Health, WHO, and several non-governmental organizations, it also includes a vitamin A supplement to boost immunity as well as de-worming tablets.

The village in India’s Poonch district, in Jammu and Kashmir state, sits on the disputed line of control between India and Pakistan, and people and cattle have often been maimed or killed in crossfire or by landmines.

Residents of Keerni’s 750 mud-built homes have also had to deal with intensifying border conflict following India’s strikes against purported terrorist camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir in September.

Now Keerni’s inhabitants must grapple not only with heightened security threats but also a state-wide drought that is hitting them especially hard. Jammu and Kashmir is reeling under the longest dry spell in a decade, say experts. Winter crops that would usually be sown by October or November cannot be cultivated this season in many areas of the state reliant on rainfall.

Sonam Lotus, director of Jammu and Kashmir’s meteorology department, told local press in early December that the state had been dealing with a dry spell since 2007 and that it was unlikely to break any time soon. Isolated border villages such as Keerni – which lacks road connections, piped water, a school or a hospital – are among those worst affected by the drought.

“Since our area has not received any rains until now, our farms remain unploughed. We’ll have to purchase food and fodder in the days to come,” says farmer Mohammad Fakir.

Two factors are making it increasingly difficult to stay in the village, he explains. “Farming is our only source of livelihood, and rains have become highly unpredictable. Second, the frequent ceasefire violations keep disrupting routine life, and no one feels safe here. In the wake of ongoing skirmishes, we couldn’t harvest crops in time. Due to the delay, wild animals damaged a lot of our standing crop.”

Fakir says he harvested 250kg of maize and 30kg of pulses from his half-hectare (1.25 acre) plot last season – a third of what he had anticipated.

In the past, water shortages were not an issue, he says. “About three decades ago, the village would get two to three feet of snow every winter, and there used to be no drinking water scarcity all through the year. But the snowfall has reduced drastically over the past few years. Now the village only gets a few inches of snow annually.”

With no electric-powered flour mill in the village, the single water-powered mill has been struggling to meet demand as the flow of the stream declines. Villagers fear the mill may shut down due to a lack of rain, long before the stocks of grain to be milled are exhausted.

Fakir says the security situation makes things even more complicated. “In the wake of border cross-firing, [the] few remaining water bodies also become inaccessible to us and our cattle.”Locals are accustomed to threats from ongoing border strife between India and Pakistan. In 2001, all of Keerni’s residents were evacuated for security reasons. When they were finally allowed to return to their rundown dwellings 10 years later, the village was virtually cut off from the rest of India by a huge fence on one side, and landmines marking the line of control on the other.

Keerni’s residents say they must cross this border fence – only open during specified hours – to get access to basic facilities such as healthcare and education.

Fortifying the area used up a large chunk of farmland and restricted access to resources such as water, residents say. What agricultural land remained had also degraded after being left uncultivated for almost 10 years.

Nazam Deen Mir, a local teacher with a monthly salary of 3,000 rupees (£36), says that because of the drought the government should act quickly to provide villagers with jobs under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, a rural job scheme. Otherwise, he says, “a majority of our men will have to leave their homes in search of alternative livelihood opportunities”.

Citing drought affecting many parts of the country, Prime Minister Modi said in April last year that a “massive effort” would be launched under the rural employment scheme to improve water conservation and storage.

Some villagers have already left Keerni with their families to work as labourers in the state’s winter capital, Jammu. Others sound increasingly devoid of hope about the future.

“A farmer in our border village knows exactly what to do in the face of exploding shells and bullets whizzing by,” says Khaleel Ahmed Mir, 22. “One can somehow cope with the loss of life, limbs and livestock. But one really doesn’t have any idea how to deal with this [drought] situation.”","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7836c8a7e95cc182eeb5820e19faa19e0153875/0_648_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dcc810c57d7d5320b2e35d842448d616,"['farmers', 'india', 'residents', 'village', 'jammu', 'water', 'caught', 'winter', 'villagers', 'drought', 'hit', 'kashmir', 'border', 'hard', 'crossfire']",

Organic farmer Nel Jayaraman has some advice for farmers struggling to grow high-yielding varieties of paddy during drought: Go organic. Having switched to growing indigenous paddy in an organic manner some 15 years ago, Mr. Jayaraman said farmers need spend only a little on input costs and can get good returns on their investment if they grew traditional varieties of paddy. Some of these rice varieties require less water compared to high-yielding varieties developed under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI).

“India is home to around 100,000 varieties of indigenous paddy, but the Green Revolution wiped out everything. I have managed to revive around 150 indigenous varieties, and these crops grow very well with no fertilisers and chemicals,” he said. Though the yield may be low compared to varieties such as IR-8, Mr. Jayaraman said organic farmers could earn more with less, unlike farmers now who produced higher yield but got less returns for their produce from the government.

“In a well-tilled field with good soil, I can grow 20 sacks (60 kg) of paddy in an acre of land. The market fetches around ₹30,000 in total at the rate of ₹1,500/sack. This is much higher compared to what farmers growing high-yielding varieties get from the government,” he said.

Low profit

High-yielding paddy fetches around 30-35 sacks/acre, which could be sold for ₹880-900 per sack, and the total expenses for cultivating per acre of paddy this way was around ₹30,000, farmers say. The margin of profit in SRI cultivation is low. There are native varieties that required only five bursts of rainfall to grow: during seed germination, during flowering, and so on, he said.

More than 3,000 organic farmers converged in Thiruthuraipoondi on Saturday to participate in an open seed festival, supported by CREATE, Mr. Jayaraman’s organisation, and NABARD as a major partner. Among those attending are horticulturist Usha Kumari and scientist S. Sulochana.

Usha Kumari, who represents Thanal, an organic farming organisation based in Thiruvananthapuram, said that a national-level ‘Save our Rice’ campaign that started in 2004 in Kumbalangi, Kerala, has begun to attract farmers from across the country who wish to switch to organic farming practices now. “After cotton, rice cultivation has the highest pesticide use ,” she said.

“In Tamil Nadu, varieties such as kattuyanam are both drought-proof and salt water tolerant. In places like Nagapattinam district where salt water intrusion has made farming difficult, farmers could grow these varieties.”

Health benefits

The Kattuyanam is a very tall variety of paddy, growing up to 8 feet tall. A red rice variety, it fetches more than Rs. 150/kg in the open market, Ms. Kumari said.

Besides good returns, the health benefits of organic rice is also a reason for its growing popularity.

Scientist S. Sulochana, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, said she had conducted studies that showed several indigenous paddy varieties had components that could cure cancer.

“Mappillai Samba, Kuzhiadichan, Kattu Ponni, Garudan Samba, Seeraga Samba and Poonggar are some of the indigenous paddy we studied. These traditional varieties contain squalene, compounds that are present in olive oil and cod liver oil, which can reduce bad cholesterol,” she said, sharing some of her research findings.","Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/article19096141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THNELJAYARAMAN,"['farmers', 'varieties', 'growing', 'reviver', 'beat', 'grow', 'indigenous', 'water', 'drought', 'rice', 'seed', 'organic', 'jayaraman', 'paddy']",

Lalitha Sridhar reports

The vast flatlands outlying Bidar face the brunt of the sun as it bears down on a thinly populated terrain marked by few trees and sparse foliage. But then a salubrious drop in temperature accompanies the rough descent down the six-metre-wide mouth of a medieval aqueduct to the north-west of the city. Here, about 25 feet below ground, is cool and softly flowing water, clear as crystal till bare feet touch the floor of the trough and raise a dense cloud of red sediment.

Medicinal ‘chamkora’ fern cluster around the white kaolin (calcium) deposits where the waterline meets the unleavened laterite. The play of water and light streaks the rock face in subtly rich mineral colours: black basalt, pinkish bauxite, umber iron, ochre clay. Harmless water bugs (Aquarius remigis) that help keep the water potable flutter in disarray. Fifteen metres into the tunnel, a 63-feet-high shaft opens to the sky and lets a swathe of light cast vague shadows on the inky darkness further ahead, where the water is deep enough to drown a man.

Harnessing old wisdom

Apertures in the towering walls indicate crevices from which, nearly 600 years ago, wicker lamps may have offered light to labouring workers. Five years ago, when V. Govindankutty, who was employed with, and represented, the Indian Heritage Cities Network Foundation in his work in Bidar from November 2011 to July 2013, and later became assistant professor of geography at Palakkad’s little known Government College of Chittur, first saw a trickle of water here, he did not realise that he had stumbled on an ancient engineering marvel — a series of an estimated 57 linearly placed vents connecting a cavernous and often winding 2.58-km-long subterranean tunnel, hewed to transport water from a perennial mother well at the start of a fault line (a linear geological fissure).

The water that now flows in the Naubad karez (aqueduct) is the result of months of challenging research and meticulous restoration, not only of the aqueduct and its vents but also of bawdis and kalyanis (open wells and tanks that dot the landscape here), a part of Bidar’s highly evolved and networked indigenous water systems.

Recently, the Karnataka government sought to declare drought in 26 of its 30 districts, 16 of which are to the north of the State and have received deficit rainfall, including Bidar, the northernmost. As a Cabinet sub-committee on drought assesses the situation, the restorers in the city of Bidar, also the district headquarters, expect water will last in the karez for another two-three months at current levels of usage, and it is early days yet for a project with life-saving implications. About 117 acres of farmland are irrigated by it and nearby neighbourhoods now turn to the karez for their water supply. The Naubad karez is the first of the very few known karez systems in India to be documented scientifically and restored.

Now running on plenty

A semi-arid Bidar receives 60-100 cm of rainfall annually. Its terrain is uniquely composed of ‘duricrust’ honeycomb-structured laterite (hard but porous and capable of absorbing rain water when forested with the right vegetation), below which lies the impermeable basalt of the Deccan trap that does not allow what is collected to percolate away.

Since that first excursion, Govindankutty has marked 814 bawdis and kalyanis along the three karez systems he has mapped around Bidar — the most accessible Naubad karez; the six-km-long Shukla Tirth, which begins at the old Gornalli kere (a lake-like waterbody) to provide water by terracotta pipes for the Agrahara village; and the poorly understood 1.33-km-long Jamna Mori, likely a water distribution system from the Bidar fort’s Fateh Darwaza to the moat of the royal enclosure, now buried under rampant urbanisation.

Following restoration efforts, after a brief spurt of heavy rains in September 2015, the Naubad karez was operational again for the first time in centuries — a monitoring team recorded water pouring out of its mouth at 120 litres per minute. Though it was dry again by the end of February 2016, the now-inspired restorers used the months that followed to continue with de-silting.

Nature handed them an unexpected turning point. Following the overall deficit rainfall since 2012, in the summer of 2016, for the first time in living memory, most of Bidar’s bawdis and kalyanis ran dry. “When this happened, people took the karez and bawdis seriously and it was easier to generate awareness about them. In a way, the crisis became an opportunity,” says Vinay Malge, 35, a civil contractor who co-founded Bidar YUVAA (Youth United for Vigilance, Awareness and Action) with friends in 2011.

Bidar YUVAA activists like Malge, Sabish Dande, Dileep Kumar and others carried forward Govindankutty’s work on the ground, egging on the local authorities to undertake the de-silting and cleaning of wells as part of MGNREGA projects; litigating against the encroachment of watershed land; protesting the proliferation of indiscriminately deeper tube wells that have caused the water table to drop drastically, adversely impacting the karez’s mathematical reliance on gradients; planting over one lakh indigenous trees so that rainwater wouldn’t run off before it could be absorbed; and creating awareness to prevent the dumping of garbage, and open defecation, along the karez.

Then, in September 2016, it rained copiously, and the Naubad karez, several irrigation reservoirs and many restored kalyanis have not run dry since.

A man and his mission

To date, Govindankutty has mapped 28 vents of the Naubad karez, which also serve as wells that harvest rainwater, although the numbers remain changeable as work on the karez’s restoration continues. In the beginning, he had little to go by besides the presence of fig and jamun trees and certain shrubs as indicators of water nearby. Often alone, the 43-year-old academic has climbed down four-storey-deep vents tied to a rope, taken several bruising falls down bramble and boulders, and had close encounters with a variety of fauna. Cobras, vipers, dragonflies, baya weavers, babblers, langurs and fruit-eating bats are a part of the biodiversity the karez supports, he says. He was, on one occasion, chased by a pack of dogs, and keeps his torch and camouflage cap handy at all times by way of defence.

As he made fortnightly trips from Palakkad to Bidar, taking off on weekends and holidays with modest personal funds, Govindankutty worked with Google Earth images, handheld GPS and GPS-aided mobile apps, survey devices like the dumpy level and prismatic compass, to record coordinates and create the Karez Geographic Information System, which he intends to make public once his research is completed. “The passion with which he has thrown himself into the painstaking and risky survey of the entire terrain is exemplary,” says K.K. Muhammed, retired regional director of the Archaeological Survey of India and now project director with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) in Hyderabad.

The Naubad karez or surang bhawi (‘tunnel wells’) is a complex system, Govindankutty discovered, which works inversely underground to leverage gravity — that is, the plateau’s natural gradient ascends from the mouth to the mother well but the tunnel underneath has been cut to descend from the mother well to the mouth. “Initially, even I was surprised,” Govindankutty says. “How did they do it?”

The professor, who will soon submit his PhD thesis on ‘Historic landscape conservation’ to the Kerala University, recalls inching forward on his stomach over some sections of the tunnel, relying only on his understanding of Bidar’s geology. “I knew the roof wouldn’t collapse, only the walls might slide,” he laughs, his energy for tromping terrain he now understands encyclopaedically quite boundless.

Today, as they continue to work their way underground from the mouth to the mother well, his efforts and that of local volunteers, now assisted by government funds, have rendered 16 vents accessible (vent 14 is additionally a junction with a branch ‘gallery’ that originates from the Naubad tank near here).

The Bahmani bequest

A marvel of engineering, the qanat (Arabic for ‘conduit’) or karez (Persian for ‘smaller channels’) system of collecting, transporting, storing and distributing water in arid areas, with very little lost to evaporation, originated in ancient Iran. The first karezs in India were built in Bidar, likely with help of Persian engineers — the Bahmani Sultanate was the first medieval Muslim kingdom to have links with Persia.

Bidar was discovered because of water. Ahmad Shah Bahmani ‘Wali’ was on his way from Berar to Gulbarga when he chanced upon a bamboo grove (bamboo is bidru in Kannada; the art of Bidri metal work that originated here is also said to give the region its name). His platoon of parched soldiers asked a shepherd named Bomkandeshwar where they could find water. The lad pointed to a spring. Soldiers removed stones to discover what later became the mouth of the Shukla Tirth karez. The shepherd had the village and lake that’s still here named after him in perpetuity.

The Naubad karez is likely to have been constructed after his reign was fully established in AD 1427. It was meant to serve a naubad (for new abaadi or population), a settlement that was never completed, leaving the abandoned karez to fill with debris.

Apart from Naubad, there is also a 14-km karez (the longest in India) in Aurangabad that still serves parts of its municipal water network despite neglect. Huge pipelines bring water into the bafflingly cross-connected 12.5-km-long multi-level karez in Bijapur, which may defeat restorers if they ever get there. Reference to a karez system is found in hydrological studies by the Geological Survey of India in Hukkeri near Belagavi. There also exists a six-km-long karez, locally called the kundi bhandara (open well reservoir) in Madhya Pradesh’s Burhanpur, also dysfunctional, but the town once preferred to convey water down this aqueduct’s origin in an alluvial fan (a cone-shaped deposit of sediments) in the Satpura ranges than rely on the Tapti river by which it stands.

Support and challenges

Meanwhile, Govindankutty persuaded C. Kunjambu attan, a highly regarded 76-year-old water diviner from Kerala, to travel by flight for the first time in his life and share his native wisdom at a March 2015 seminar on ‘The Glory That Was Bidar’, inaugurated by the late A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who took a personal interest in the subject and conversed privately with restorers for half an hour. “There is water here,” the old man from Kasaragod said simply, after reading the landscape and its botany, and placing his hands on the earth.

The academic has found supporters in Bidar’s dynamic district collectors: Dr. P.C. Jaffer, Anurag Tewari, and Harsh Gupta, who first tasked him with looking for what they thought were escape tunnels, and from Dr. H.R. Mahadev, who took charge recently. He could also rely upon AKTC’s Muhammed.

An example of the challenges they face may be seen in the 1.5-km-long Kamthana embankment to the south-west of the city — a perfect oval in Google Maps — which falls on the old route between Bidar and Gulbarga. The breached embankment is seen with its moat in ruins, the adjoining forested areas barren, and the tank to which its water channels lead in shambles.

Other problems persist. A ring road proposed by the Bidar Urban Development Authority’s Master Plan, which connects to the SH15 Naubad-Hyderabad highway and bypasses Bidar town, bifurcates the second of two agricultural zones that used to be fed by the karez, endangering the system. Similarly, new roads connecting the ring road via the Siddheswar and Papanash temples to Bidar town pass through the surrounding grasslands, already under threat with the loss of indigenous tree species like neem, tamarind and jujube. Gliricidia, a water-consumptive ornamental species planted along the edges of the plateau for social forestry, also needs to be replaced with them.

Rapid urban development is causing the unique laterite plateau to erode. The area around the Nanak Jira, sacred to Sikhs, is heavily concretised, with the well here now cemented on all sides and the course of small springs leading to it altered beyond recognition. A railway line cuts through the catchment area of the Naubad embankment, which lies directly above geologic fractures or water movement channels called lineaments.

Well done, more to do

The water warriors continue undeterred. Malge says, “People’s behaviour is the most difficult challenge. We clean and de-silt, water returns and everyone benefits. But the minute we go forward, garbage is dumped again. All we can hope is that the sanctity of these waterbodies will be respected.”

They have plenty more to do. Last year, there wasn’t a drop of water in the 117-acre Vilaspur tank to the north-west of Bidar. De-silted completely, it is now a beautiful expanse of water welcoming migratory birds. The Jahaz ki Bawdi, a 114-feet-deep well in the old city that had 86 feet of silt in it, is also full of water after massive cleaning.

Official help is also at hand. The Department of Tourism is funding some of their restoration work, with an initial outlay of ₹3 crore, followed by an additional ₹5 crore. The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation has identified the conservation of the Naubad karez system as one of 17 projects shortlisted for a pilot study. The Karnataka government’s Kere Sanjeevini (‘life-giving lakes’) scheme and Koti Vriksha Andolana (‘campaign for one crore trees’) are inspired by Bidar.

The antique land waits patiently. Cart tracks have left furrows on the plateau all the way to Bhalki, 24 km away, separated by disused step wells every kilometre or so, where parched wayfarers and draught animals must have quenched their thirst centuries ago. At an ancient and largely roofless farmhouse in the Naubad embankment, the walls are blocks of laterite so thick that the small homestead appears fortified. A family still lives in here, by a disused brick kiln and cowshed. They share their freshly plucked pulpy berushi mangoes with warm hospitality. The Naubad karez flowing beneath their land is a blessing — four vents lie within their property and they are happy to allow restorers access to them.

High above, the celebrated Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team, which takes off early every morning from the Bidar Air Force Station, flies daring practice sorties in the cloudless sky. Over 600 families of defence personnel rely on water pumped from one of Bidar’s many nameless bawdis near the old temple at Papanash. Somewhere between these aerial and subterranean realities is a third that is both fragile and threatened: though Karnataka is declaring drought, for now, Bidar and its surrounds have water.","Sat, 29 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/article18282458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THKAREZ,"['naubad', 'wells', 'vents', 'beat', 'water', 'govindankutty', 'drought', 'bidar', 'work', 'old', 'system', 'karez']",

Drought has displaced more than 135,000 people inside Somalia since November, according to data compiled by UNHCR, the Norwegian Refugee Council and community based organizations. Swift and substantial action and adequate funding are becoming urgently needed to avoid famine and a repeat of 2011, when some 250,000 people died, more than half of them aged under five years.

According to the authorities in Puntland, more than 20,000 families have moved to the Bari region. And 1,638 are in need of emergency assistance in the northern town of Galkayo.

People are leaving their homes because of the drought, rising food prices, dry weather forecasts, and ongoing insecurity and are heading for urban areas. This includes to Mogadishu and the town of Baidoa. The Government is seeking to have aid provided to people in their districts in order to avoid people making long a dangerous trip on foot in search of help.

There have been reports of deaths and illness, although these are not widespread. On Sunday, we received reports of 38 deaths due to drought-linked reasons in the Bakool region of South-Central Somalia. Medical cases include people with acute malnutrition, especially children, watery diarrhoea, and cholera. Detail is sparse.

Through an inter-agency response, UNHCR and partners are working to mitigate against a deterioration into famine. This includes tackling rising malnutrition, limiting displacement, and containing disease outbreaks and enhancing protection.

We have started helping the displaced in the worst affected areas – Puntland and Somaliland in the north, and the areas of Bay and Bakool. This includes through the provision of emergency shelter and aid items to thousands of people and through strengthened protection monitoring.

Some 1,000 aid kits are being sent to drought affected families in Mudug (Puntland), and preparations are under way to distribute 1,500 in Bari (Puntland), and truck water into areas of Somaliland. UNHCR is also providing help in shelter and distribution of aid items in Bari, Nugal (Puntland) and Sanaag (Somaliland) Galkayo and Garowe.

Drought is also pushing some to flee the country. Since the start of the year, more than 3,770 Somali new arrivals have been recorded at Melkadida in Ethiopia, and acute malnutrition has been reported in around 75 per cent of arriving child refugees. No substantial movement into Kenya has been reported so far.

The drought comes as UNHCR continues its voluntary repatriation programme for Somali refugees in Kenya’s Dadaab complex, which has brought home 49,985 people since December 2014. UNHCR is informing people in the camps about the drought, but so far this does not appear to have had a major effect on returns.

UNHCR and other humanitarian organizations are better prepared to respond than in 2011, but funding needs are urgent. For January–June, US$825 million is needed, but US$100 million has been pledged.

Farmers have grown far more this past year than all seven billion of us could possibly consume, so mountains of surplus foodstuffs are piling up in dozens of countries, including Canada. And the price of that food is falling fast.

Yet there is hunger. Not in many years have so many been at risk of starvation: For the first time since 2011, the United Nations is using the word ""famine"" to describe the looming situation in half a dozen countries. On Tuesday, the UN warned that a million people in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and parts of Nigeria are ""on the brink of famine"" and 20 million live in areas where harvests have failed and malnutrition is on the rise.

How can both these things be true? Somehow, the Reuters news wire service carried these two headlines on Tuesday, within hours of each other: ""Grains piled on runways, parking lots, fields amid global glut"" and ""Risk of mass starvation rising rapidly in Africa, Yemen.""

Starvation does not happen because of a shortage of food. And starvation does not happen because there are too many people. There is plenty enough food for all the world's people – in fact, with a little effort, we could double the amount produced. Governments are paying farmers to cut back their harvests, as we have run out of storage space.

Nor does starvation happen in 2017 because food is too expensive. That was the case 10 years ago, when soaring commodity prices sent food costs rising after four decades of declining to their lowest share of household budgets in history. In response to those high prices, investment flooded into agriculture, and land under cultivation expanded greatly. Now, those lands have produced an almost unprecedented three-year sequence of strong harvests, and the world is awash in food.

One consequence is that food prices have finally started falling back to historic lows. In March, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization announced that global food prices had fallen 2.8 per cent in a month: vegetable oils by 6.2 per cent, milk by 2.3 per cent (the only product experiencing a price rise was meat).

The world currently has a third more rice and wheat in storage than it is expected to consume, sell or turn into fuel in 2017. The combined world surplus of wheat, corn, rice and soya recently passed 670 million tonnes, or enough to feed all of China for a year.

Why didn't someone just ship some of that surplus food to Yemen, Somalia, Nigeria and South Sudan? That, after all, is what usually happens when drought or emergencies cause crops to fail. Sri Lanka, for example, is also experiencing a drought this year – its worst water shortage in four decades, one that has wiped out the entire year's rice crop. Yet nobody in rice-dependent Sri Lanka is starving: The government simply spent $350-million to import enough rice to make up to for the losses. This hurt the Sri Lankan currency, but the economy has kept growing and people are eating.

That is what happens when drought strikes countries that are at peace: They import more food. None of the African and Middle Eastern countries facing famine this year are at peace. And in many cases, the famine has nothing to do with drought or crop failure: In northeastern Nigeria, the war with Boko Haram has prevented farmers from cultivating crops; if the fighting causes them to miss the May-June planting season, seven million will be at risk of starvation.

In Somalia, the al-Shabab militant group continues to block food aid and the organizations that deliver it, and disrupts or sells food shipments for its own needs. In South Sudan, the government and security forces have blocked humanitarian aid, putting its horrendous civil war ahead of the lives of its people.

In 2017, only war and extremism prevent people from eating. It should be a priority for every developed-country government to break the barriers and give these people a share of our global food hoard to get through this crisis. They then need to develop the capacity to connect their countries back to agricultural markets.

African girl, 16, wins Google award - Africanews English",https://www.africanews.com/2016/09/29/fighting-drought-with-orange-peels-s-african-girl-16-wins-google-award/,"For her scientific innovation aimed at combating drought in her native South Africa, a 16-year old girl, Kiara Nirghin, has been adjudged winner of the Google Science Fair.

Her innovation is aimed at retaining soil water and combating the effects of drought on crops by retaining soil moisture, whilst still recycling waste products of the juice manufacturing industry.

What was her project about?

Her project was titled ‘Fighting drought with fruit.’

She used orange peels to develop a cheap super-absorbent material to help retain water in soil. At a time when southern Africa is suffering from the impact of the El Nino drought, Kiara’s invention will lessen the impact of dryness on crops.

‘‘After conducting three experiments that spanned over 45 days, that tested: the water absorption abilities, resulting soil moisture and growth of a produced plant, given off by Starch SAP (super-absorbent polymers), Pectin SAP, Acrylic SAP and various forms of orange peel variables, I accept my hypothesis.

‘‘The results of the water retention test showed that the ‘Orange peel mixture’ can absorb 76.1% of water, which is significantly greater than the acrylic SAP, starch SAP and pectin SAP.

‘‘My experiments support my hypothesis as the ‘Orange peel mixture’ when applied to soil maintained the greatest average soil moisture and the Ocimum Sanctum plant had the most flowers, the greatest height and healthiest appearance in the ‘orange peel mixture’ treated soil,’‘ she noted in the conclusion of her report.

She stated further that she hoped to apply her solution on fields in South Africa as a means of helping farmers to save money and also save their crops.

Her prize and the award ceremony?

Kiara won a $50,000 scholarship at an event held in California in the United States of America. The competition was open young people between the ages of 13 to 18. She beat peers from around the world to win the contest.

About Kiara Nirghin.

She is from city of Johannesburg and currently attends the St Martin’s High School.

‘‘I absolutely love the captivating subjects of chemistry and physics in school. I have always had a great love for chemistry since I was young.

I vividly remember at the age of 7 experimenting with vinegar and baking soda solutions in plastic cups.,’‘ she said about herself.

“My natural curiosity and questioning nature has sparked my everlasting love of science.

“I also house a great interest in food science and baking. I believe that food and chemistry are undoubtedly linked in the intertwined science web,’‘ she added.

Southern Africa’s drought headache.

South Africa like other countries in the region is presently experiencing one of the worst droughts in 45 years, with the lowest ever rainfall since 1904. In 2015, South Africa received only an average of 403 mm, which is merely 66% of the annual average rainfall.

This situation led to severe strain on crop production with household food security being a major concern. With their advanced economy, the country has been able to withstand the drought.

Other countries in the region particularly Zimbabwe has had to depend on food aid from international organizations and other countries to be able to feed a section of citizens. Aside farm lands, animals have also been affected.","Thu, 29 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/345290/1024x538_345290.jpg?1475146889,"['african', 'sap', 'fighting', 'peel', 'google', 'award', 'water', 'orange', 'drought', 'soil', 'food', 'science', 'south', 'wins', 'girl', 'peels', 'africa', 's']",

Wildfires have burned more than 100,000 acres across seven states in the southern Appalachian Mountains since late October. Of the 44 ongoing blazes, the biggest struck northern Georgia and western North Carolina, where whole towns have fled as part of a slate of mass evacuations. All of which, scientists say, is pretty weird.

“It’s very rare to have this many fires burning this amount of area in the Southeast,” U.S. Forest Service ecologist James Vose. “It’s typically a wet climate, especially in that southern Appalachian region where these fires are occurring.”

This year, the situation changed. The Southeast has experienced a once in a generation drought, with the area seeing little to no rainfall at all since September. Columbia University bioclimatologist Park Williams said the epicenter of the drought — the spot between northern Georgia, eastern Tennessee and the western Carolinas — rivaled conditions typically witnessed in the American West. More than 47 million people live in these southern drought areas, which extend from Oklahoma to Virginia, according to the Associated Press.

“Those regions are definitely experiencing a one in 50 year event,” Williams said. This aridness arrived just as autumn trees across the region shed their colorful leaves — a highly flammable fuel for wildfires.

Yet climate change indicators suggest droughts of this magnitude are becoming the status quo, Vose said. Though Southeast climate leans toward abundant rainfall, the region is no stranger to drought. It cycles between stretches of dry and moist. But since the 1980s, droughts have become more frequent in the Southeast. Vose said these dry spells are also growing longer, meaning it’s drier for longer when it’s dry, and it’s wetter for longer when wet.

In the past, these dry periods would be interrupted by a rainstorm every couple of weeks, which stymied large fires, Vose said, but the new norm of extensive dry periods means that there is no rainfall to keep the fires in check.

“Consecutive dry periods are predicted to occur as a result of anthropogenic [man-made] climate change,” Vose said. “These trends make larger area burns and more fires perhaps more likely in the future.”

An onslaught of regular droughts will impose benefits and strains to southeastern wildlife. Many native water-loving pine trees will falter, but oak forests thrive in drought-stricken areas, especially those cleared by fire. The human toll may be harder to afford. More than 200 patients landed in the hospital last week in Chattanooga, Tennessee due to breathing difficulties related to wildfire smoke plumes. So far, the U.S. Forest Service has spent $45 million to firefighting expenses.

What triggered the latest wildfires remains unknown, but arson investigations are underway in Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Kentucky.","Tue, 22 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2016/11/20161114-southern-us_NASA-1024x632.jpg,"['fires', 'dry', 'big', 'vose', 'southeast', 'droughts', 'rainfall', 'forest', 'drought', 'climate', 'region', 'appalachia', 'tennessee', 'southern', 'normal']", 
73,73,Drought Sri Lanka,Rising Temperatures to Blame for Water Loss in Colorado River - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/colorado-river-drought-2288623714.html,"By Tim Radford

The Colorado River is dwindling, and climate change is officially to blame. In the first 14 years of this century, the flow declined to only four-fifths of the 20th century average, according to new research. The water lost would have been enough to supply two million people for a whole year.

Altogether, the river supplies water to seven U.S. states and two in Mexico, and 40 million people rely on it for their water. But the entire Colorado River basin has been experiencing sustained drought since 2000. And somewhere between one sixth and one half of this liquid loss can be put down to global warming, scientists said.

They publish their findings in the journal Water Resources Research. ""This paper is the first to show the large role that warming temperatures are playing in reducing the flows of the Colorado River,"" said Jonathan Overpeck, professor of geosciences and of hydrology and atmospheric sciences at the University of Arizona.

""We're the first to make the case that warming alone could cause Colorado River flow declines of 30 percent by mid-century and over 50 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.""

His co-author Bradley Udall, a climate scientist at Colorado State University, said, ""The future of the Colorado River is far less rosy than other recent assessments have portrayed. A clear message to water managers is that they need to plan for significantly lower river flows.""

The two scientists began by looking at the drought years of 2000-2014. The river starts with precipitation in the upper regions of its drainage basin, in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico.

They found that in the first decade and a half of this century, average temperatures in the region were 0.9°C higher than the average for the past 105 years. This is, very roughly, the temperature by which the globe has warmed on average over the last century, under a global warming regime driven by greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuel combustion.

But there is another factor to consider. The U.S. Southwest has a climate history characterized by intermittent megadroughts—periods of much lower rainfall over spans of 20 to 60 years.

Researchers have proposed that the risk of megadroughts is likely to increase in any climate change scenario. What actually will happen is uncertain, but the scientists are betting that as greenhouse gas emissions rise, so will the difficulties of water supply.

""Even if the precipitation does increase, our work indicates that there are likely to be drought periods as long as several decades when precipitation will still fall below normal,"" said Overpeck.

According to Udall, ""Current planning understates the challenge that climate change poses to the water supplies in the American Southwest. My goal is to help water managers incorporate this information into their long-term planning efforts.""

74,74,Drought Sri Lanka,"With No Water and Many Loans, Farmers' Deaths Are Rising in Tamil Nadu - The Wire",https://thewire.in/agriculture/drought-tamil-nadu-farmers-deaths,"From the banks of the Kollidam river, S. Selvaraju’s farm is barely a mile away.

The huge river, actually a tributary of the Cauvery that drains its surplus water into the sea, runs along the village of Anaikudy, 40 km from Thanjavur in the heart of Tamil Nadu’s Cauvery delta.

For centuries, people here have cultivated three crops every year – paddy, millets, then paddy again. Over the last few years, though, several farmers have switched to cultivating sugarcane for a state-run sugar mill nearby. Some have raised banana plantations too. New cash crops partially replaced the old paddy system.

Water – even if the rains weren’t good that year – never seemed to be a problem. Until suddenly it was.

Selvaraju took his own life, hanging himself from a tree on his farm, after his old borewell ran dry after serving him for two decades. The new one that he commissioned just a month earlier also bore no water.

The 65-year-old, who owned a seven-acre farm, committed suicide on May 5, leaving behind unpaid debts and a family – a wife and three sons – with many questions. Could he not have waited for a few more months for the rains? What was the need to kill himself?

Water, says Selvaraju’s son Karti, has suddenly become a luxury in and around the village.

As his family struggles to come to terms with his father’s suicide, Karti says, “I had heard of farmers committing suicides in different parts of the country, but never thought this will happen to us.”

In Kadamankudy village of Nagapattinam district, at the far-eastern tip of the Cauvery delta, a similar story unfolds.

He wasn’t the right age to suffer a heart attack. Veermani was 35 when he passed away on December 30, 2016.

“We were on the field; he just collapsed and died,” his widow Kavitha tells us at her small thatched hut, wondering how her husband could die at such a young age. He was fit and fine, she says, but under a lot of stress. Nothing was left on the farm – it wore a forlorn look, she says. The couple went to their farm – a 1.25-acre plot that this landless Dalit family leased for the first time from a fellow villager – to tend to the crop, or whatever was left of it. Around 4 pm, from some distance, she saw him falling.

“When I rushed to check what the matter was, he was not responding,” she says. She called for help and took him to the nearby cottage hospital in an ambulance. He was no more, the doctors told her.

It was, doctors told Kavitha, a shock death – something she hasn’t been able to fathom even today.

“It did not rain this year; it was our bad luck,” she says. “It was the first year we decided to lease land and it turned out to be the worst year for farming.”

A sudden spike in rural deaths

There is no comprehensive data on farmer deaths in Tamil Nadu in the 2016-17 farming season, but newspaper reports and independent inquiries by groups like the People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) and the Tamil Nadu Federation of Women Farmers Rights suggest that over 200 farmers died of heart attacks or committed suicide in December 2016 and January 2017. The sudden spike in death rates comes mainly from the delta region and sparked protests across the state, with some groups holding dramatic protests in Delhi. As many as 106 farmers were reported to have committed suicide in December, according to a notice issued by the National Human Rights Commission to the state government on January 5, 2017.

Veermani was not the only tenant farmer to have died of shock.

About 25 km from Kavitha’s village is Adhichapooram, in Thiruvarur district. There, Arokyamary narrates a similar tale. No one in the family thought that T. Azhagesan, her husband, would die of a heart attack. He was only 36 years old. On November 4, his widow says, he went to his farm in the afternoon and died of a sudden shock in the middle of his wilting crops. Azhagesan, a landless Scheduled Tribe farmer, had also leased two acres of farmland.

His sudden demise has thrown his family into a financial and emotional quagmire. Azhagesan’s elderly mother, Amruthavalli, is now the only working member of the family – she works as a sweeper in a nearby school for Rs 3,000 a month.

These shock deaths are a consequence of emotional stress and economic troubles, says Dr Bharati Selvan, a practicing cardiologist and social worker in Mannargudi town of Thiruvarur district, once a prosperous paddy bowl in the Delta region. Selvan was part of a fact-finding team comprising farmers, social activists, students, doctors and concerned citizens who enquired into the reasons for deaths in the region.

“That was in early January; we split into three teams and studied some 50 cases of sudden shock deaths and suicides in addition to the prevailing situation in three districts of the delta – Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur and Thanjavur,” Selvan says. “The crisis is worsening and the government’s apathy is telling.”

The Delta has never seen farm suicides or shock deaths before. Most of those who have died had no history of cardiac ailments; several of them were very young.

“Though the government does not accept it, we have reasons to believe that a sudden emotional stress and economic turmoil could have caused these deaths,” he says.

A shock for Tamil Nadu

This is not like the dry and barren Marathwada or Bundelkhand or deserts of western Rajasthan – this is the highly productive Cauvery delta, a region that epitomises one of the oldest civilisations in the world, where the farmers until very recently grew three crops every year to meet local needs and send the surplus to feed the deficit in other regions. This is also not Vidarbha, where cotton farmers’ suicides aren’t abating. This is South India’s paddy bowl – the land of prosperity.

When the monsoon failed, farmers this reporter spoke to in village after village in the delta region talked about failed crops, mounting debts and the lack of work. There are four months to go before the monsoon arrives in October.

Selvaraju had about Rs 7 lakh in unpaid debts – crop loans from banks and loans from the informal sources that he borrowed to meet domestic exigencies.

He spent at least Rs 5 lakh on two surgeries that his wife Rasati underwent for the removal of a brain tumour over the last two years. This meant recurring heath expenses. Karti says the last two years drained the family financially.

Added to this were his falling assets. He sold a pair of his bullocks last year. All the family’s gold has been pawned to a jeweller in Thanjavur, Karti says. Bank savings are gone. The only possession they have now is the home he built.

Selvaraju’s situation is symbolic of the average Anaikudy farmer. The drought has begun to bite.

Tamil Nadu is not known for farmers’ suicides. The 2015 report on accidental deaths and suicides in India from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) says that while Maharashtra (3,030), Telangana (1,358), Karnataka (1,197), Andhra (516), Madhya Pradesh (581) and Chhattisgarh (854) were the top states in terms of farmers’ suicides, Tamil Nadu that year counted only two farmers suicides, a fact contested by activists on the ground. The state however recorded 604 farm labourers’ suicides the same year, the NCRB data shows, while 1,261 farm labourers in Maharashtra and 709 in Madhya Pradesh took their own lives. A closer analysis shows these may actually be suicides by tenant farmers.

The PUCL inquiry says most of these deaths are the fallout of crop losses and mounting debts. The Tamil Nadu government says these deaths have no correlation with the prevailing agrarian distress – even though 21 of 32 districts in the state have been declared drought affected and there’s no other reason for a sudden wave of shock deaths in such a short period of time.

A crisis that’s not going away

The delta is in crisis – and it’s not going away soon, says S. Ranganathan, the octogenarian farmer leader from Mannargudi town in Thiruvarur who first moved a petition before the Supreme Court three decades ago pleading for a settlement of the dispute with Karnataka on Cauvery water sharing. “This is the worst year in my memory – a three-crop region not able to plant crops for even one season.”

The usual northeast or receding monsoon, which sweeps across Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, south Karnataka and Kerala between October and December, failed in 2016-17. The state registered an overall deficit of 60% in the south-west and northeast monsoon.

Tamil Nadu reported a drop in the winter sowing of rice by well over 30% and production by more than 60%, according to the estimates. About 35 lakh hectares of land suffered from drought in the state, according to the Integrated Drought Severity Index that is developed by the International Water Management Institute, Sri Lanka.

The delta, until two decades ago, was a three-crop region – mostly irrigated by its fantastic network of surface water canals branching out of the Cauvery and her umpteen tributaries. In 20 years, water shortage brought the region down to two crops and pushed the borewell frenzy.

By the state government’s estimates, including data on subsidised power pumps, the delta today has close to two million borewells, sinking deeper and deeper to reach groundwater.

The year gone by was the first time in a century that the delta farmers could not handle even one crop, due to failed monsoons and the non-release of Tamil Nadu’s share of Cauvery waters by Karnataka owing to a drought in the upper catchment areas and a gradient drop in the groundwater table, says Ranganathan, who heads the Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association. As one travels across the region in the simmering heat, the signs of distress are obvious. Work is hard to come by and migration has increased.

Karti finished his mechanical engineering from a private college in Coimbatore – he is able to speak broken English and went to Singapore very recently to work for a private company as a maintenance engineer. “I could not find any job here, so when this opportunity came I took it up.”

The last five years, Selvaraju spent a lot of money on Karti’s engineering education. “My two brothers did not study much, so he would nudge me to study,” he says.

The eldest son Kavaskar, 35, is married and has taken to farming; the youngest Illayaraja, 19, is a school dropout and works for daily wages when he’s not helping on the farm.

Karti says he earns a salary of Rs 20,000 in Singapore – which is just about sufficient to pay his bills in that country. He lives with ten other employees in a room.

Last year, Selvaraju had to support Karti with a couple of lakh rupees to get a job and fly to Singapore. Where did the money come from? “He borrowed,” the son says nervously, his voice choking.

From paddy, which needs a lot of water but does not give huge returns, Selvaraju switched to sugarcane in 2012, since a lot of other farmers with irrigation facilities were shifting to that crop, Karti says. The problem that they didn’t see coming, though, stemmed from mismanagement at the sugar mill.

The sugar mill, run by the Tamil Nadu Sugar Corporation, has been facing financial problems, which led to delays and non-payment of cane dues to many farmers.

For two successive years, Selvaraju sold his sugarcane to the mill but got no money against it. The total money due to be paid to him by the mill is around Rs 8 lakh – non-payment to cane growers is now a big political issue in this part. It was their money and yet they could not access it, his son laments. “He would go with other farmers regularly to the mill to enquire about their payments and would return disillusioned,” Karti says.

No respite in groundwater

This year, when the rains failed, Selvaraju dived into his groundwater resources. Kollidam was dry as a desert; this was the first time in many years that it did not see water released from the upstream for even a day, Anaikudy villagers say.

Apparently the groundwater table too receded by several metres in this part and has now been labeled “critical” by the state’s groundwater development agency. There’s a reason for that.

For years, the staggered release of water from the upstream Karnataka into the Cauvery has badly affected the delta, the tail end of the basin. It has affected the drinking water supplies of the towns and severely hit the canal irrigation network.

Usually, the groundwater would be recharged automatically in this part as the Kollidam waters brought the Cauvery surplus and the north-east monsoon brought a good amount of rains.

But now that cycle was broken. When Selvaraju tried to access groundwater and his old borewell ran dry, he decided to gamble on a new one, like many others did.

The new one, his son says, didn’t yield any water even at 400 feet, forcing him to call off the digging. The reason is obvious: the state’s public works department has dug deep borewells right in the middle of rivers all over the delta, including the Kollidam, to siphon out water from beneath the riverbed and supply it to the big towns and cities, including Thanjavur. The villages are left dry.

Today’s Selvaraju’s farm has standing sugarcane crop on half his land. Given the lack of water, it’s not doing well. The rains are still four months away.

“My father sounded anxious and tired when I last spoke to him, just a day before his death,” Karti says.

Selvaraju would not be convinced, his son says, that things will be alright. “He kept telling me that the borewell on our farm had no water and that it was not a good sign that the river had fallen silent.”

75,75,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought Kills Crops but won't Impact Milk Output - Opinion - Daily Mirror,http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Drought-Kills-Crops-but-won-t-Impact-Milk-Output-126472.html,"You may not believe me; I have news about the drought: Good news, better news, best news and the bonus.Did you know that the income from selling milk compensated the farmer’s losses incurred from crop failures during this period? That’s the good news as the farmer with dairy cows received 46.1% higher income this Maha season. The drought had a beneficial effect on milk production, increasing it by 77% during this period. That’s the better news. The cost of production of a litre of milk in the Dry Zone is between Rs.10 to 15 and the sale price is between Rs.65 to 80. Hence, the turnover is between 300 to 700%. Now that is the best news. In addition to these, there is an overall increase of 13.3% income per cow.

Can any agricultural enterprise match this?

Furthermore, consuming milk from Dry zone cattle is ecologically sensible, as these cows are part of an integrated agricultural system that raises crops primarily for human consumption. No dedicated crops were grown for them and their diets are mainly human food crop residue and naturally

growing grasses.

This news implies that Sri Lanka should capitalize in the Livestock sector sub-sector. Why? The effects of climate change and drought can be minimized by crop farmers rearing livestock. This is a fact. Such livestock enterprises can be considered as a facilitator for the sustainable growth of human food of crop origin. Here I am referring to an integrated farming system, which consists of around 95% of the ruminant (cattle, buffalo and goat) population of Sri Lanka. The prevailing drought condition severely affected paddy and highland food cultivation. Farmers usually start land preparation and planting paddy and highland crops from the beginning of September to October and November. It is safe to say that this expenditure is around Rs.40,000 per acre in both paddy and highland cropping and will be recovered after the sale of the harvest at the end of season. It was not to be, this time, as the prevailing drought destroyed their crops. However, farmers with dairy cattle recovered this amount within 21/2 months See table below.

With the advent of the Maha season, farmers are busy with land preparation, followed by crop cultivation and will have less time to attend to livestock activities. In this period, cattle and other ruminants are restricted to prevent any crop damage and easy management. They will not be provided with adequate amounts of food and water, no grazing and sometimes no milking, which will result in the loss of 2 million litres per year. The consequence of this restriction results in a low feed intake- and very little milk is collected during the Maha season when compared to the Yala season. However, due to the drought conditions in the 2016/17 Maha season, this has changed. This season, paddy land and highlands have been mostly abandoned and look bare but there is a luscious growth of grass, remnants of the failed crop and a few wet patches due to intermittent rains. Grazing herds are visible in these abandoned

crop fields.

This situation has allowed the milking herd to consume sufficient herbage to provide nutrients required for their body and milk production. However, unlike in a normal year, these animals were able to maintain a healthy condition and a nutrient reserve throughout the year that may have indirect results such as increased milk production, prolonged lactation period, increasing fat percentage and increase in the number of calves who would initiate milk production. This added income through these direct and indirect benefits will support the total farm activities in this crop-livestock mixed farming system. The following chart 1 shows an increase in milk production by 43.8%, 76.6%, 98.3% and 103.7% in the months of November, December, January and February respectively. This is contrary to what we usually witness in the regular Maha season (from 2007/08 to 2015/16) with normal rainfall.

Poor nutrition in the Maha season can cause severe problems in the cattle population. Indigenous cattle breeds were less affected but crossbreeding with European and Indian breeds showed poor growth, a shorter lactation period and longer calving intervals. A poor body condition is apparent through visible hips and pin bones, the outline of 3 to 5 ribs and the outline of the spine. Some of these features can be observed in the image 1 below.



Yet, after the Maha harvest, an ample amount of feeding will allow these cattle to recover and increase milk production. However, during the 2016/17 Maha season there is a sufficient amount of feed to maintain a favourable body score. This will reflect in increased lactation periods by about 30 days and reduced calving interval by about 2 months. Ruminant milk and meat production is predominantly a grazing farming system. This grazing farming system has failed to produce milk consistently throughout the year and supply milk to meet the demand. This is due to the quality of herbage available for grazing and owing to the lack of feed at critical times. In the past they were allowed to graze in forest and marginal pasture lands, in addition to uncultivated land in the Yala season (dry period) where irrigated water is provided only to cultivate around 30 - 40% land. Later, government regulations were legally enacted to prevent ruminant grazing in forest and marginal pasture land. The effect of this is the drastic reduction of ruminant population during the past two decades. In addition, the new paddy harvesting practice, through heavy machinery prevents the use of rice straw. However, there will be a fresh problem in the Dry Zone farming system with the new irrigation projects being able to provide sufficient irrigated water to cultivate the rest of the land during the Yala season (dry period) for only human food.

This will have a major consequence on the growth of the ruminant population, as this farming system will be completely cut off from the land. Hence, there is a need to transform this grazing milk production system to a stall feeding system in the dry zone. This is not possible unless an intervention to the feeding system is introduced.

Key lessons learned:

Modes of interventions not focused to the real problem for a paradigm shift.

Annual Loss of 2.2 million litres in the Anuradhapura and Trincomalee areas.

Continuation of the practice of grazing management (free grazing) system in Dry Zone.

Demand for replacement stock higher than the current supply.

Seasonality of availability of feed- no measures to increase shelf-life of crop-residue and grass.

Starvation and water deprivation effects physiology of cattle

Difficulties of women-headed families rearing cattle – Unable to take animals for grazing to distant places.

Impact needs to be generated:

Increasing crossbred population through artificial insemination (AI) and organized natural breeding system. Currently, crossbred pregnant heifer costs Rs.120,000. Half the population is of the indigenous types yielding 2 – 3 litres per day. Hence, to do any intervention that will result in a paradigm shift, there is a need to increase the crossbred population that will yield 10 to 15 litres per day.

The AI program has the capacity to supply around 40% of the required replacement and the rest either takes a long time to conceive or breed using a nondescript male unsuited to produce calves that can produce more milk. Milk marketing organizations will benefit from every calving, as it results in the inception of milk production. Hence, it will be advantageous to have a national programme for Natural Breeding managed by Milco through using good quality Jersey males from the National Livestock Development Board (NLDB). They should position one such stud unit per milk collecting centre. A member of this milk collecting centre will be responsible for maintaining this stud centre, where he economically benefits through the compensatation for the use of the stud bull for natural breeding.","Thu, 30 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://static.dailymirror.lk/assets/uploads/advr_5d3f39d574.jpg,"['kills', 'impact', 'milk', 'land', 'opinion', 'grazing', 'wont', 'cattle', 'output', 'drought', 'crops', 'maha', 'population', 'period', 'production', 'season', 'system']", 
76,76,Drought Sri Lanka,How farmers in South Asia are coping (and struggling) with climate change - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/821704/how-farmers-in-south-asia-are-coping-and-struggling-with-climate-change,"Saffron is not only the heritage crop of Kashmir but has also been a lucrative agricultural activity in the region for decades. It is considered the world’s costliest spice, and Kashmiri varieties fetch around $3,000 per kg, although prices have dropped in recent years.

In 2011, the fame of Kashmiri saffron was used as an anti-narcotics candidate for weaning Afghanistan’s farmers away from poppy when farmers’ delegations from that country were invited to Kashmir for learning the skills of growing saffron from Kashmiri farmers and agricultural experts.

The mountainous Kashmir valley has always had a monopoly in saffron production in India and the production of this high-value crop had reached its peak in the 1990s in the Kashmir region with an annual average of around 15.5 metric tonnes over 5,700 hectares.

Output hit

But both saffron land and crop production have declined in recent years. According to Kashmir’s agriculture department, saffron land has got reduced from 5,700 hectares in 1990s to 3,715 hectares in 2016, while per- hectare production has come down to 1.88 kilograms.

The declining production in recent years, according to the farmers, is forcing them to shift to other crops. For example, Imtiyaz Ahmad Bhat, a farmer in Lethpora-Pulwama, has converted half an acre land out of his 2.50-acre saffron land into an orchard and one-third of an acre into a vegetable farm.

“I am planning to convert another kanal (one-eighth of an acre) of saffron land into garlic cultivation because garlic now fetches good money in the market,” Bhat said. He and his fellow farmers said that a number of others have done so while some others find it more profitable to sell saffron land to builders or carry out constructions themselves on it despite the Saffron Act , under which changing saffron land for any other use is banned.

The farmers said that a few spells of rain, from the month of August to October, play a crucial role in flowering of the saffron crop. “But, in most of the years since late 1990s, we have been witnessing that these months pass off without any rainfall,” said Dilawar Reshi, a farmer in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, where 90 per cent of Kashmir’s saffron is grown.

Firdous Nahvi of Kashmir’s Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, who has carried out extensive research on saffron and has been helping farmers rejuvenate the saffron crop though a $60 million federal farm ministry project, said that the issue of irrigation is the actual reason why saffron yield is on decline.

“Creating sprinkle irrigation facility was the critical part of the project because we have observed in recent years that it doesn’t rain when the crop needs the moisture,” Nahvi said. “In any part of the world, farming is unthinkable without water.” He added that other help for farmers like providing fertilisers and corms (seeds) to them (as part of the project) is useless unless their crop gets sprinkle irrigation. The government project, launched in 2010, was supposed to create the irrigation facility four years back, but is yet to do so.

Agriculture and climate change

According to the 5th IPCC assessment report, on a global level, climate change could affect food security by the mid-21st century and that most of the food insecure would continue to be in South Asia, where there are currently roughly 300 million undernourished people.

“Climate-related declines in food productivity will impact livelihoods and exports, increasing poverty levels. For instance, in Bangladesh, these factors would cause a net increase in poverty of 15% by 2030,” the report said.

A report prepared by Climate Action Network South Asia and Asia Pacific Adaptation Network says that agriculture is the mainstay of several countries in South Asia and is also one of the largest sources of employment continuing to be the single largest contributor to the GDP in the region. As three-ﬁfth of the cropped area is rain-fed, the economy of South Asia, says the report, hinges critically on the annual success of the monsoons, indicative of the well-being of millions. “In the event of a failure, the worst affected are the landless and the poor whose sole source of income is from agriculture and its allied activities,” it said.

Farmers’ response

Farmers in South Asia are already struggling with the climate-related changes and have started responding to them. “The common perception of farmers towards the impacts of climate change at least in four states of India – Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka – where I carried out my survey, was rising temperatures, decreasing precipitation and prolonged dry spells,” said Ravi Shankar, Principal Scientist at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture in Hyderabad. “The common adaptation measures by farmers towards these changes are buying insurance, change in planting dates and cropping pattern, and planting different crops.”

For example, Shankar says, staggered sowings, change in planting dates, requiring of drought-resistant crops, and construction of water-harvesting structures are the major adaptation measures followed by farmers toward climate change in Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh.

“Also, the farmers in Mahbubnagar are used to observe the pattern of rainy season,” said Shankar, the lead author of Climate Change and Agricultural Adaptation in South Asia. If the pattern sustains itself, they continue farming, otherwise, they migrate and work as construction labourers at Gangavati, Hyderabad, and Bangalore.”

A study carried out in 2015 in three districts of Punjab province of Pakistan has identified a number of climate-related risks perceived by farm households such as extreme temperature events, insect attacks, animal diseases and crop pests. “Limited water availability, high levels of poverty and a weak role of local government in providing proper infrastructure were the factors that make farmers more sensitive to climate-related risks,” the study said.

“Due to these constraints, adaptation in agricultural is self-initiated and varies [in] different socio-economic settings such as level of education, land holdings, tenancy status, access to institutional resources and farm location,” said one of the authors of the study, Muhammad Abid of Centre for Earth System Research and Sustainability, University of Hamburg. “Small farmers, less educated and tenants mainly prefer to adopt short term or low cost adaptation measures such as changing cropping varieties, crop types or planting sowing dates. On the other hand, the adoption of long term or advanced adaptation measures such as crop diversification, soil and water conservation is only considered by either highly educated or large farmers.”

Adaptive capacity

According to Abid, to enhance the adaptive capacity of farmers and adaptation in the agriculture sector, serious efforts are required in the functioning of local agricultural institutions and their scope. Further, he says, policies need to be designed based on field based research and should be area specific considering local issues and needs. “New adaptation measures need to be developed through research and informed to farmers accordingly through extension.”

Using data from a household survey of 2,660 farm families in Bihar state of Eastern India, Terai of Nepal and coastal Bangladesh, a study in Current Science in April 2016 says that late or early planting, adopting new crops or varieties, introducing legumes in rotations, and planting improved, disease- and pest-tolerant varieties are the most frequently cited changes being made to farming practices in these surveyed areas.

“While we did not attempt to isolate climate-resilient practices per se, it does appear that these shifts are related to rainfall and water-related constraints. Other studies show that in certain parts of Nepal’s Terai and India, many households have shifted to rice varieties that require less water and/or that can be sown at a later date to adapt to rainfall variability,” the study has found. The study says that strategies such as adjusting planting dates and new varieties have been found to contribute to climate change adaptation.

Drought tolerant

According to International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, or ICRISAT, farmers in Sri Lanka are shifting from annual crops to perennial drought tolerant plantations like cashew, particularly in rain-fed areas where the potential for irrigation is not available. This move is mainly driven by the urge to avoid the risk of crop failure.

It saod that farmers are also moving towards the use of short duration varieties, hybrids and drought tolerant varieties wherever seed is available. Another important adaptation strategy is diversification of the means of livelihood by marginal and smallholder farmers.

Farmers in Sri Lanka, according to the ICRISAT, experience difficulty in accessing inputs and this is probably an impediment to effective adaptation of any improved management practice. It further says that farmers have diversified their incomes into nonfarm sectors and business. “Outward migration and earnings from service are the major sources of diversification. In recent times, income diversification has reduced the risk of rainfall variability through reduced dependence on agricultural incomes.”

About Bangladesh, ICRISAT said that the farmers perceive that more efficient and increased irrigation potential through surface and groundwater sources will improve their production sustainability and productivity. “Farmers feel that crop insurance will help them cover the risks, but the present scheme of Crop Insurance is with private players and the farmers perceive that it is not universal in its coverage. A universal Crop Insurance scheme that covers all crops will be of great help to the farmers.”

A megadrought in the American Southwest would impose unprecedented stress on the limited water resources of the area, making it critical to evaluate future risks not only under different climate change mitigation scenarios but also for different aspects of regional hydroclimate. We find that changes in the mean hydroclimate state, rather than its variability, determine megadrought risk in the American Southwest. Estimates of megadrought probabilities based on precipitation alone tend to underestimate risk. Furthermore, business-as-usual emissions of greenhouse gases will drive regional warming and drying, regardless of large precipitation uncertainties. We find that regional temperature increases alone push megadrought risk above 70, 90, or 99% by the end of the century, even if precipitation increases moderately, does not change, or decreases, respectively. Although each possibility is supported by some climate model simulations, the latter is the most common outcome for the American Southwest in Coupled Model Intercomparison 5 generation models. An aggressive reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions cuts megadrought risks nearly in half.

INTRODUCTION Megadroughts are periods of aridity as severe as the worst multiyear droughts of the 20th century and persist for decades. These droughts are known to have occurred in the American Southwest (1, 2) and other parts of the world (3, 4) during the past millennium, and they have been linked to the demise of several preindustrial civilizations (3, 5, 6). A megadrought occurring again in the Southwest in the coming decades would impose unprecedented stresses on water resources of the region, and recent studies have shown that they are far more likely to occur this century because of climate change compared to past centuries (7, 8). Estimating the probability of a megadrought under different climate change scenarios is critical for effectively evaluating risk and managing water resources, but recent studies have disagreed on the relative odds of these events. For example, on the basis of precipitation projections and paleoclimate data, Ault et al. (8) argued that the risk of multidecadal megadrought in the American Southwest would increase at least twofold from 5 to 15% over the last millennium to between 20 and 50% this century; Cook et al. (7) estimated those risks to be much higher in an analysis of a wider range of soil moisture indicators of varying levels of complexity. Further complicating this picture is that certain regions (for example, much of the American West) are expected to become drier, on average, even with a predicted increase in precipitation because of the increased demand for moisture by the atmosphere and consequent increases in evapotranspiration (9, 10). It is therefore critical to clarify the relative contributions of precipitation and temperature to future megadrought risk. Here, we focus on characterizing megadrought risk as a function of variables that govern the balance of moisture at the land surface during climate change. At decadal and longer time scales, these variables are primarily precipitation, which supplies moisture, and temperature and vegetation, which modulate evapotranspiration (9, 11). Although climate change projections of higher temperatures are robust and broadly consistent across different model simulations, projections of precipitation change are subject to considerably more uncertainty. Moreover, megadroughts are extreme events that unfold over decades, implying that even state-of-the-art multimodel ensembles used for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will have only a handful of realizations of these intervals at best. This small sample size inherently makes estimating the probability of a megadrought challenging because any empirical probability density function (PDF) of its occurrence will be finite and incomplete. For example, imagine two simulations run with a model that predicts overall drying: In the first realization, there is a megadrought, and in the second, there is none. The model-predicted probability would appear to be 50% regardless of the true megadrought PDF. As an alternative, we characterize the megadrought PDF by asking the following: (i) What are the changes in regional hydroclimate that elevate (or lower) megadrought risk? (ii) How do state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) simulate the variables that govern megadrought risk? We adopt a probabilistic framework for quantifying the risk of future events under a broad range of possible climate outcomes and then compare GCMs against these possibilities. Although there are a number of objective methods for identifying periods of megadrought in a hydroclimate time series (12–16), here we define a megadrought as a multidecadal (35-year) period of aridity as bad as, if not worse than, the worst droughts of the 20th century (−0.5 of an SD on average; Materials and Methods). By megadrought “risk,” we refer to the probability of an event occurring this century, acknowledging that the statistics of regional hydroclimate in the future will likely be different from past statistics. This notion of risk accommodates the possibility that an event might not unfold even if megadroughts are generally more likely to occur (for example, a few fortuitous wet years in a drier climate with higher megadrought risk could prevent an event from fully unfolding). Quantifying megadrought risk over a wide range of plausible climate change outcomes allows us to assess how deterministic GCMs, forced with rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, simulate changes in temperature and precipitation associated with different levels of risk (see Materials and Methods). We apply this framework to characterize the chances of a megadrought defined by precipitation and multiple soil moisture metrics in output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multimodel ensemble (17), as well as a single-model [Community Earth System Model (CESM)] “large” ensemble (18). Although structural uncertainty and internal variability are conflated in the CMIP5 ensemble, diagnosis of a single-model ensemble allows us to delineate the role of internal variability alone in shaping future megadrought risk.

RESULTS We express megadrought risk as a two-dimensional (2D) PDF of both changes in mean hydroclimate state (denoted Δμ, Materials and Methods) and changes in hydroclimate variability (δσ) relative to the historical period (1951–2000). This framework reveals that risks are dominated by changes in the mean state of a given hydroclimate variable (Δμ), although there are some exceptions, as seen in the shading of Fig. 1 and fig. S1. For example, decreases in the mean (Δμ < 0) can be compensated by decreases in variance (δσ > 1), maintaining low megadrought risk in the light-colored triangle-shaped region of negative Δμ (between the dark shading and the dashed line on all panels of Fig. 1). Likewise, increases in hydroclimate mean values (Δμ > 0) do not necessarily correspond to lower megadrought risk if those changes are accompanied by increases in variance (dark gray shading to the right of the dashed line on all panels in Fig. 1). Herein, we will adopt the language of the IPCC to characterize probabilities (19): The black region of the 2D PDF in Fig. 1 identifies areas where megadroughts are “virtually certain” (>99% probability of occurrence), whereas the white region shows combinations of mean state and variability changes that would make these events “exceptionally unlikely” (<1% probability). Note that the regions shaded in black depict probabilities in excess of 99.9% and hence would correspond to a climate that is drier, on average, than the worst droughts of the past 1000 years (7). For reference, megadroughts in the preindustrial era only occurred once or twice per millennium on average (2, 8, 20); thus, without climate change, these events would be “very unlikely” (0 to 10% probability) (8). Fig. 1 Megadrought risk estimates for the American Southwest shown with model-projected changes in mean hydroclimate. (A to C) Megadrought risk estimates for the American Southwest (shading) shown with model-projected changes in mean hydroclimate under the RCP 8.5 (high emissions) scenario for (A) annual precipitation and JJA soil moisture (PDSI, 30-cm soil moisture, and 2-m soil moisture) in the CESM LENS, (B) annual precipitation from all CMIP5 models, and (C) JJA soil moisture indicators derived from a 17-model subset of CMIP5 for which all variables needed to compute these quantities were available (7). In all panels, the interquartile range of the ensemble is shown (the full range is shown in the Supplementary Materials). Model-based variables are normalized to unit variance over a historical reference period (1951–2000) and compared with midcentury changes (2051–2080). The shading shows the 2D PDF of megadrought risk for combinations of changes in the mean (Δμ) and variability (δσ) of a normalized drought indicator time series [z′(t)]. Although some studies have relied on precipitation alone to identify prolonged drought or megadrought conditions (13, 21, 22), our results show that this approach tends to underestimate risk in a changing climate (Fig. 1). On each panel, changes in normalized drought indicators [annually averaged precipitation, June-July-August (JJA) soil moisture at 2 m and 30 cm, and JJA Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)] are overlaid on the 2D PDF of megadrought risk, expressed again as a function of δσ and Δμ. We focus on JJA for soil moisture and PDSI because it is the driest, hottest part of the year in much of the Southwest and also for compatibility with paleoclimate reconstructions of JJA aridity (7, 12). By midcentury (2051–2080), under a business-as-usual emissions scenario, the “large ensemble” (LENS) from one model (CESM) simulates increases in annual precipitation, which decreases megadrought risk according to estimates solely based on this variable (Fig. 1A, blue circles). The CMIP5 multimodel ensemble shows a similar pattern, although (on average) regional annual precipitation decreases, slightly increasing megadrought risk (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, models within the CMIP5 archive also support decreases in average normalized annual precipitation of nearly one full SD and increases of more than 1 SD (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). These projected changes encompass megadrought probabilities that range from virtually certain (>99.9%) to exceptionally unlikely (<0.1%) if precipitation alone is used to assess its risk. In contrast to precipitation, indicators of JJA soil moisture depict a more consistent picture of drying (Δμ < 0) and correspondingly higher megadrought risks (orange symbols in Fig. 1, A and C). Most simulations in both the CESM and CMIP5 ensembles plot into a region of the megadrought risk PDF where events are virtually certain (>99.9% probability) by midcentury (Fig. 1C and figs. S1 and S2). Note that Cook et al. (7) estimated regional risks to be closer to 80% because that study derived risks from the CMIP5 ensemble itself (which includes models that simulate both low and high risks), whereas here we are plotting where each ensemble member falls in the 2D megadrought PDF. The contrasting estimates of risk between precipitation and soil moisture hint at the role that temperature might play in elevating megadrought probabilities by altering the mean regional moisture balance during climate change. They further imply that this tendency is generally independent of the particular soil moisture metric targeted for analysis, as also shown in earlier studies (7, 23). Not all variables from all models plot into the portion of the 2D PDF shown here (fig. S2). For example, one model (CanESM2) simulates average 2-m soil moisture conditions (Δμ) that are approximately 3σ wetter by midcentury than over the historical period (1951–2000). We therefore cannot completely rule out the possibility that moisture will increase in deeper soil layers despite warming temperatures (22), but this possibility is inconsistent with near-surface conditions in most of the models, some of which support mean conditions far worse than the worst years of drought during the historical period. Moreover, variables from four models (MIROC-ESM-CHEM 2-m soil moisture, MIROC-ESM 2-m soil moisture, NorESM1-M 30-cm soil moisture, and GFDL-CM3 2-m soil moisture) fall to levels below −3σ (much drier), three of which are associated with the deep soil layer. Nonetheless, these uncertainties motivate a closer look at the relative contributions of mean temperature and precipitation change to regional megadrought risk. Because changes in the mean state largely determine megadrought risk (Fig. 1), the second 2D PDF that we consider (Fig. 2) is generated using the JJA PDSI calculated from resampled and rescaled observational and reanalysis data over a wide range of plausible changes in mean precipitation and temperature (Materials and Methods). These values are “plausible” in the sense that they are supported by the range of estimates derived from the CMIP5 ensemble (Materials and Methods). This PDF shows a strong risk dependence on both variables, with decreasing precipitation and/or increasing temperature linked to a higher probability of megadrought (Fig. 2). At a constant temperature relative to the 1951–2000 baseline (ΔT = 0), reductions in precipitation are associated with increases in risk. Likewise, increases in temperature elevate risk if precipitation is held constant (for example, ΔP = 0%). This effect is stronger for higher regional temperature change, such that even without any reduction in precipitation, the probability of megadrought is close to 100% if Southwest temperatures rise by 5°C or more, a possibility encompassed by the CMIP5 multimodel distribution under business-as-usual forcing (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the general characteristics of this 2D PDF, including its strong dependence on temperature, are robust even if temperature and precipitation only change during certain seasonal windows (fig. S3). Fig. 2 Megadrought risk expressed as a function of both mean precipitation and temperature for the American Southwest compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation. (A) Megadrought risk expressed as a function of both mean precipitation and temperature for the American Southwest (shading) compared with projected changes in temperature and precipitation (symbols) for two scenarios: RCP 2.6 (low emissions, blue triangles) and RCP 8.5 (high emissions, red circles). CMIP5 estimates of change are expressed as the difference between the historical reference period (1951–2000) and the midcentury average (2051–2080). The megadrought risk surface (shading) is the average of all 2D PDFs calculated at each grid point in the Southwest for each combination of temperature and precipitation change. JJA PDSI is used as the reference normalized drought indicator time series [z′(t)]. The vertical dashed line marks no change in precipitation. (B) Marginal distribution of precipitation change in CMIP5 models, binned at 5% intervals from −30 to +30% of historical climatology. (C) Marginal distribution of temperature changes, binned at 0.5°C intervals from zero to six. Model-based projections of mean Southwest temperature and precipitation change are plotted as symbols in Fig. 2A (model IDs are provided in fig. S1). Because megadrought risk largely depends on these mean changes, we evaluate the effect of climate mitigation on megadrought risk. We consider the two experiments that bracket a large number of possible mitigation outcomes from the “low-emission” Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP 2.6) (blue triangles) to the “high-emission” RCP 8.5 (orange circles) scenarios. Marginal distributions of mean precipitation and temperature change from the CMIP5 archive are also shown in Fig. 2 (B and C, respectively). There is clearly more ambiguity about the direction and magnitude of precipitation change in the Southwest as compared to temperature: The distribution of RCP 2.6 precipitation is nearly unchanged from the historical period (median precipitation change of +0.7%), whereas the RCP 8.5 scenario is only moderately drier (median of −3%), albeit with greater spread (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to precipitation, the temperature distributions are universally of the same sign (positive), but the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are distinct from one another (Fig. 2C). It is clear that the combined projections of ΔT and ΔP from the two scenarios do not overlap appreciably because RCP 8.5 projects a higher regional temperature change than RCP 2.6. These warmer temperatures shift the entire RCP 8.5 distribution into a region of the 2D PDF where megadrought risks are much higher. Even in the case where one model (CanESM2; fig. S2) predicts a 30% increase in precipitation, this amount is insufficient to overcome the effects of higher temperature—the projection still plots into a region of elevated megadrought risk (30 to 40%) despite the precipitation increase. On the other hand, some RCP 2.6 simulations project a net increase of precipitation (blue triangles to the lower right of the gray shading in Fig. 2A), and these simulations map onto a region of megadrought risk that is either similar to (5 to 10%) or lower than (<1%) the preindustrial period (8). This reduction in risk occurs largely because increases in precipitation are accompanied by only modest temperature shifts that stay below 2°C. In Figs. 3 and 4, we further highlight the role that temperature plays in “loading the dice” to make megadroughts more probable through its effect on the moisture balance of the region. In Fig. 3, megadrought risks estimated for fixed values of mean precipitation change are shown with the median temperature increases simulated by RCP 2.6 (1.9°C) and RCP 8.5 (4.5°C) over the period 2051–2100 compared to 1951–2000. Here, we focus on the second half of the 21st century to emphasize the outcomes of mitigation on mean regional temperature. Two features of Fig. 3 are important to note. First, unless mean precipitation increases, megadroughts are likely (>66% probability) to occur for a regional temperature change above 2°C (dashed line). Second, median regional warming simulated for RCP 8.5 (4.5°C; dotted line) would make megadroughts very likely (>90% probability) by the end of the century if average precipitation does not increase. This risk remains above 50% unless precipitation increases by 10 to 20%, which is not typical of models in the CMIP5 archive. These estimates of risk would be even higher, and the required increases in precipitation would be even greater, if regional warming exceeds 4.5°C, which itself is a possibility supported by many of the individual model simulations (Fig. 2C). Fig. 3 Megadrought risk estimates for fixed mean precipitation changes, shown as a function of mean annual temperature and compared with CMIP5 projections of mean warming from 2051 to 2100 compared to 1951 to 2000. Contours show risks for constant levels of mean precipitation change (ΔP), derived from the 2D PDF in Fig. 2. The dashed lines denote the median warming (again comparing 2051–2100 to 1951–2000) from RCP 2.6 (1.9°C) and RCP 8.5 (4.5°C) and their corresponding risks assuming no change in precipitation (ΔP = 0%). Fig. 4 Maps of megadrought risk for the American Southwest under different levels of warming, and the required increase in precipitation to compensate for that warming. (A to C) Maps of megadrought risk for the entire American Southwest domain at constant (historical) precipitation climatology (ΔP = 0%) and various levels of warming. These estimates are based on the Monte Carlo procedure of observational and reanalysis data, not on CMIP5 (see Materials and Methods). (D to F) Increases in precipitation (blue shading) needed to maintain megadrought risks below 50% for different levels of regional warming. Contours map the projected changes in precipitation derived from the multimodel CMIP5 mean and are shown for reference at each level of temperature change. Whereas the estimates above are based on the average 2D PDFs of megadrought risk for the entire American Southwest, our approach allows us to make similar estimates for each grid point in the domain (Fig. 4, A to C). These estimates are not based on CMIP5 output but instead are derived from probabilistic modeling of megadrought risk as a function of rescaled historical temperature and precipitation climatologies. Our results clarify the effects of these two variables on PDSI throughout the region. For temperature change below 1° and no change in precipitation, most of the domain is exposed to levels of risk below 20% (yellow regions in Fig. 4, A to C). As temperatures reach 2°C and above, increasing fractions of the domain see megadrought risks above 90%, with nearly the entire domain doing so at 6°C of warming. For each warming threshold in Fig. 4 (A to C), we have also calculated the amount by which precipitation would need to increase to keep megadrought risks below 50% (Fig. 4, D to F, blue shading). For levels of warming below 2°C, most of the region would only need modest (<10%) increases in precipitation to keep megadrought risk levels under this threshold. As warming reaches 4°C, increases of 10 to 30% are needed throughout Nevada and the four-corner region, and at 6°C, these required increases reach 40 to 50%. For reference, the changes in precipitation projected by the RCP 8.5 CMIP5 multimodel ensemble mean at each level of warming (for example, 2°, 4°, and 6°C) are shown in contours on Fig. 4 (D to F). These projected precipitation changes are negative (dashed contours) for much of the domain, with the CMIP5 ensemble average predicting a 5 to 15% reduction in precipitation in the southernmost areas considered here for levels of warming between 2° and 6°C. Furthermore, projected precipitation change is close to zero, on average, in regions where a 40 to 50% increase is needed to keep risks below 50% by the end of the century when warming levels approach 6°C.

DISCUSSION Our findings have important implications for both mitigation and adaptation. With regard to mitigation, the dependence of megadrought risk on mean temperature highlights a relative advantage of keeping GHG emissions low. In a business-as-usual world (RCP 8.5), rising temperatures alone are sufficient to drive megadrought risks to unprecedented levels. On the other hand, if regional warming remains below 2°C, megadrought risks will correspondingly remain below 66% for a wide range of precipitation changes [for example, below the IPCC-defined threshold for likely (19)]. Further emission reductions, and hence smaller temperature increases, would have even greater benefits in reducing megadrought risks, thus highlighting the fact that global efforts aimed at mitigating climate change through GHG emission reductions will also help minimize prolonged drought probabilities (24). Our results also provide insight into how much additional moisture supply is needed in the Southwest on average to keep megadrought levels below certain thresholds. In our case, we again focus on the 50% threshold, though, in principle, this could be lowered. We find that even for this fairly high tolerance of risk, most of the region would need to see at least a 40 to 50% increase in precipitation (Fig. 4, D to F, shading), which, according to the CMIP5 projections, is unlikely for the area (Fig. 4, D to F, contours) (8, 25). A constellation of adaptation policies, such as demand reduction and increased efficiency strategies, interbasin water transfers, shifts to groundwater reliance, increased surface irrigation, and other management measures, could serve to offset some of this increased moisture requirement. However, the feasibility, sustainability, and implementation of these measures and the extent to which they could reduce megadrought risk remain critical open questions. Both structural differences between GCMs and natural variability introduce uncertainty into projected changes in precipitation (Fig. 1). These uncertainties in precipitation play out in terms of both the mean state and the variability of the Southwest, although most models simulate drying in general (Fig. 1B) (8, 25, 26). Our analysis of a LENS of one model (CESM) suggests that the role of natural variability in generating precipitation uncertainty is relatively small compared to structural differences between models, which simulate regional responses to warming between −1 and more than 1 full SD. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, higher temperatures shift the moisture balance toward conditions that are drier on average, as evidenced by multiple soil moisture metrics (Fig. 1C) (7). This shift consequently makes megadrought conditions much more likely than they are today, even if precipitation increases. Consideration of soil moisture therefore reduces the uncertainty in megadrought risk estimates stemming from natural variability and model differences because it integrates the effects of moisture supply, storage, and atmospheric demand under higher temperatures. Several features of our approach make it easily extensible to other drought indicators, other parts of the world, and other global climate model data sets. For example, land surface model (LSM) components of GCMs could be forced with similar ranges of temperature and precipitation change to generate LSM-based 2D PDFs of risk, as we have done for PDSI. This would facilitate sensitivity tests of LSM components under a wide range of future possible climates, akin to “stress tests” in engineering (27), and could even be extended to include the relative impacts of CO 2 “fertilization” on megadrought risk (11). Additionally, the 2D PDFs developed here are particularly useful in the context of IPCC climate model assessments because a new generation of simulations is released for analysis every few years. Although the details of regional hydroclimate in these simulations might change, the PDFs we generate as a function of mean state and variability (Fig. 1), or temperature and precipitation (Fig. 2), will not change, because they are generated from the observed climatology. Further work could also extend risk estimates to other aspects of hydroclimate beyond soil moisture (for example, reservoir levels, snowpack, and streamflow) and other parts of the world. Finally, the dependence of megadrought risk on temperature makes the probability of these events in the future very distinct from such intervals in the past. Historically, megadroughts were extremely rare phenomena occurring only once or twice per millennium, possibly from internal variability (28) or weak external forcing (29). According to our analysis of modeled responses to increased GHGs, these events could become commonplace if climate change goes unabated. This appears to arise not because of any particular change in the dynamic circulation of the atmosphere but because the projected increase in atmospheric demand for moisture from the land surface will shift the baseline of soil moisture balance, making megadroughts far more likely than they have been for at least the last millennium (7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Drought indicators, including precipitation, surface (30-cm) soil moisture, full column–integrated soil moisture (2 m), and the PDSI, were obtained or calculated from the following sources: (1) Output from a recent LENS experiment (18) conducted using a single model (CESM) to address the relative importance of internal climate variability as opposed to its combination with structural differences between models. Annual precipitation, JJA 30-cm soil moisture, JJA 2-m soil moisture, and JJA PDSI were either obtained or computed from the “historical” (1920–2005) and RCP 8.5 (2005–2080) experiments in the LENS data set. (2) GCM data from two RCPs included in the CMIP5 archive: RCP 2.6, which assumes aggressive cuts in emissions for the coming decades, generally preventing global mean temperatures from exceeding 2°C of total warming (17, 30); and RCP 8.5, which assumes that anthropogenic emissions of GHGs will continue to increase and contribute 8.5 W/m2 of average net radiative forcing by the year 2100. As in the study by Cook et al. (7), we computed PDSI from a 17-model subset of the CMIP5 archive for which all fields were available to calculate the Penman-Monteith estimates of evapotranspiration, and for which soil moisture fields were also available. Annual precipitation averages were used as the normalized drought indicators in Fig. 1, whereas JJA averages of soil moisture (30 cm and 2 m) and PDSI were used from the 17-model subset for consistency with earlier studies (7, 12) and to focus on the hottest, driest part of the year in the Southwest. In contrast to the earlier study (7), we also included the remaining GCMs in our analysis of risk arising from changes in precipitation and temperature (Fig. 2), although PDSI and soil moisture were not always available from these products. In this case, annual temperature and precipitation were used. (3) Observational temperature and precipitation fields, used in the Monte Carlo procedure described below, originated from the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit’s “TS2.1” data product (31). These fields are produced at 0.5° native resolution but were linearly interpolated to 1° for the megadrought risk estimates computed here. Net radiation, relative humidity, and surface pressure fields used for calculating PDSI with the Penman-Monteith method for estimating evapotranspiration are from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data (32). Climatological values of these fields were all averaged for the Southwest domain (125°W to 105°W; 32°N to 41°N) and used to compute both historical and future estimates of JJA PDSI with bootstrap resampling procedures described below. The use of climatological values for all fields other than temperature and precipitation was motivated by the goal of isolating the effects of temperature and precipitation alone on future JJA PDSI values; changes in megadrought risk were therefore constrained to arise solely from changes in either of these two variables. Precipitation and soil moisture are physical quantities, whereas the PDSI is a normalized index of aridity (though its local SD is not necessarily unity). Negative and positive PDSI values correspond to drought or wet conditions, respectively (33, 34). PDSI can be computed “offline” from model output and presents an internally consistent measure of drought across space, through time, and among models with different land surface schemes. There are a number of plausible objective methods for identifying periods of megadrought in hydroclimate time series (12–16), but we adopted a simple and relatively transparent definition recently used by Cook et al. (7) and Ault et al. (8). Namely, for a given time series (y t ), we are interested in finding intervals when the running mean (of length w) falls below a certain threshold (q). This definition has recently been shown to reliably identify decadal droughts in the historical record (with w = 11 and q = −0.5) and multidecadal megadroughts in the paleoclimate record (with w = 35 and q = −0.5) (8). These definitions were also applied to characterize 21st-century prolonged drought risk arising primarily from climate change (7, 8). We adopt the latter definition to assess multidecadal (35-year) megadrought risk in the projections. Identifying megadroughts across a wide range of hydroclimatic time series that might include precipitation, soil moisture, drought indices, and paleoclimate records required us to normalize data in ways that would allow objective comparisons across results. We therefore considered a “modified z score” (z t ′) defined as where y t is the original variable and μ ref and σ ref are the mean and SD, respectively, of that variable over a reference time period (in our case, 1951–2000). The modified z score is then smoothed using a moving average of length w to produce a new time series [X w (t)] Fundamentally, we were interested in the probability that any element of X w (t) falls below the threshold q for different combinations of shifts in the mean values of z t ′ (Δμ) and changes in the SD (δσ = σ new /σ ref ). The parameters Δμ and δσ were interpreted as being estimates of the influence of climate change on the mean and SD of some particular drought indicator (y t ). The quantity of interest was the 2D PDF of megadrought: Pr{X w ≤ q | δσ,Δμ}, which depends on both changes in the mean (Δμ) and the SD (δσ) of the modified z score (z t ′). The 2D PDF of megadrought risk (Pr{X w ≤ q | δσ,Δμ}) was estimated using a Monte Carlo procedure as in Ault et al. (8) and Cook et al. (7) and checked analytically (see figs. S4 and S5). Because we were interested in relative changes in megadrought risk as a function of shifts in the mean and different variance ratios, we would assume that the reference time series (z t ′) has zero mean and unit variance over the reference period. This assumption is analogous to the approach used by Ault et al. (8) and Cook et al. (7), which looked at modified z scores computed from precipitation and soil moisture indicators, respectively. The difference herein is that we prescribed changes in Δμ and δσ directly, rather than computing these parameters from GCM output. We generated random (Monte Carlo) realizations ( ) from a Gaussian (temporally white) distribution of changes in Δμ mean and δσ SD to represent changes in megadrought risk as a function of these two parameters (Fig. 1). Note that using Monte Carlo realizations with built-in sources of temporal persistence elevated risks in the “gray area” (values between 0.1 and 0.8) in Fig. 1 (see fig. S6). Accordingly, the PDF shown in Fig. 1 is “conservative” in the sense that true risks for certain types of drought indicators with interannual autocorrelation might be even higher than those depicted. CMIP5-based estimates of Δμ and δσ were computed from annual precipitation, JJA soil moisture (at 30 cm and 2 m), and JJA PDSI by normalizing each of these indices over the historical period (1951–2000) and computing their normalized means and SDs at midcentury (2051–2080). These model-based estimates were then overlaid on the 2D PDF in Fig. 1. We estimated the 2D PDF of megadrought risk as a function of changes in both temperature and precipitation (Fig. 2) using PDSI as a proxy for the surface moisture balance. To do so, the following four steps were repeated 100 times for each grid point in the American Southwest. First, the joint distribution of precipitation and temperature was generated for each month from observations. Second, temperature and precipitation values were drawn from this distribution (with replacement) to generate 100 “bootstrap” years (1200 months). Third, changes in temperature (ΔT) were then added to each month of these realizations, and precipitation was likewise scaled between −30 and +30% of climatology [that is, the range encompassed by the GCMs; see the studies by Cook et al. (7), Ault et al. (8), and Diffenbaugh and Giorgi (25)]. Fourth, these bootstrap realizations were used to compute PDSI for each unique combination of change in precipitation and change in temperature. Climatological values were used for all other variables (surface pressure, net radiation, and humidity) required by the Penman-Monteith model of evapotranspiration. As in the study by Cook et al. (7), the 1931–1990 period was used for calibrating the PDSI, and JJA average values were used to identify megadroughts. The process above generated bootstrap realizations of PDSI with different combinations of change in temperature (ΔT) and precipitation imposed on the historical period. We estimated a 2D PDF of megadrought risk for JJA PDSI at each grid point by normalizing each realization by the mean and SD of the 1951–2000 period, applying a 35-year averaging window, and identifying periods where this running mean dropped below −0.5σ. This step yielded one 2D PDF per grid point. PDFs from all grid points were averaged together for the American Southwest to produce a “master” PDF of megadrought risk, against which changes in temperature and precipitation from the entire CMIP5 multimodel ensemble were compared [for example, even from members that did not have sufficient data for computing the soil moisture quantities or PDSI in the study by Cook et al. (7)]. This 2D PDF is shown in Fig. 2. Last, in Fig. 2, CMIP5-based estimates of changes in temperature and precipitation were computed as the difference (ΔT), or ratio (%), between midcentury (2051–2080) and historical (1951–2000) periods. These differences were calculated independently from each run; thus, the symbols in Fig. 2 represent internally consistent (with respect to each simulation) estimates (as opposed to comparisons of model simulations to historical values).

Most of the islands are less than two kilometers wide and have an average height of 1.8 meters (6 feet) above sea level, making the country one of the most vulnerable in the world to climate change and sea level rise.

King tides can wash over entire islands, causing flooding for days and contaminating drinking water supplies for weeks and even months. Prolonged droughts, particularly during La Nina, can cause extreme water shortage, affecting agriculture and peoples’ general wellbeing.

With the entire population and the majority of the infrastructure located on the coast, damage and coastal erosion from high tides, storm surges and strong winds is increasingly an issue.

Ruteta, a mother of three living in Tabonibara village, North Tarawa, knows all too well the problems that contaminated well water can bring.

“A few years ago our well water got really smelly. We worried about our children, because they had diarrhea after drinking the water we boiled from the affected well,” said Ruteta.

North Tarawa, while still part of the main island of Kiribati, is only accessible by boat and remains largely subsistence-based, with residents gathering most of their food and water from their surroundings. Until recently, communities used ground water from wells for all their cooking, drinking and farming needs. While usually satisfactory after boiling, ground water can become contaminated by seawater during floods and king tides, making people – especially children – sick. Prolonged periods of drought, usually during La Nina years, often meant heavy rationing of water, impacting general wellbeing and agriculture.

Infant mortality in Kiribati is the highest in the Pacific Islands, at 43 deaths per thousand live births and infantile diarrhea contributes to this high number.

Through the Kiribati Adaptation Program, which is now in its third phase, rainwater harvesting systems have now been installed in Ruteta’s community, as well as in five other communities nearby.

“Now that we have rainwater tanks our children have fallen ill much less so that makes us very happy. There’s a big difference in the quality of rainwater compared to well-water,” said Ruteta","Tue, 21 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['islands', 'drop', 'kiribati', 'changehit', 'tides', 'tabonibara', 'drinking', 'water', 'children', 'climate', 'rainwater', 'adapting', 'life', 'usually', 'tarawa', 'drink']",

Samsung BioLogics, the drug-manufacturing unit of Samsung Group, is gearing up for its IPO on the Korea Exchange's KOSPI market in November, aiming to raise at least 1.9 trillion won. It will market its shares at 113,000-136,000 apiece on Nov. 2-3, with pricing set for Nov. 3.

Samsung Electronics, which currently owns 47.8% in Samsung BioLogics, is planning to sell 10% of the company, or 5.5 million shares, in the deal. Samsung BioLogics will also issue 11 million new shares in the IPO. The company plans to use IPO funds to expand its production lines in Incheon and to cut debt.

Doosan Bobcat, a manufacturer of excavators and loaders, is also set to raise a minimum of 2 trillion won by listing the company on the main bourse in October. It will offer 49 million shares at 41,000--50,000 won each over Oct. 12-13.

""Samsung BioLogics and Doosan Bobcat are the two largest IPO deals this year,"" said Kang Byung-kook, a manager at the Korea Exchange. ""No big deals have been made yet in the first three quarters.""

According to data from the Korea Exchange, only nine companies successfully filed for IPOs on the KOSPI so far this year. The deals raised a combined 909 billion won, with the biggest offering at 281 billion in July from Korea Asset In Trust, a real estate investment trust.

By contrast, 50 companies raised a combined 132.4 billion Hong Kong dollars ($17 billion) in the same period on Hong Kong's main board, the Hang Seng Index, according to a report released by consultancy PwC. Though that amount was 14% lower from a year ago, it was still about 20 times more than that of Seoul.

Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at IBK Securities, said that Doosan Infracore will benefit from the Doosan Bobcat deal as it plans to use the IPO proceeds to cut down debt of 1 trillion won. Doosan Infracore is the largest shareholder in Doosan Bobcat with a 66.5% stake.","Wed, 05 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F3%252F5%252F6%252F5%252F7635653-1-eng-GB%252F20151126_Samsung-group.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['won', 'bobcat', 'samsung', 'end', 'korea', 'trillion', 'billion', 'drought', 'biologics', 'ipo', 'seoul', 'doosan', 'shares']",

In the next Yala minor season, there is expected to be normal rainfall in the Wet zone in the Dry and Intermediate zones rainfall will be low as usual, the Agro-climatology & Climate Change Division of Sri Lanka's Department of Agriculture said.





Due to the lagging effect of last year's drought, irrigation tanks are low in water and it was unlikely that they will get enough water to reach capacity in the next two months.

""Therefore, it is highly advisable to grow short-age crops and varieties during Yala 2017 season in the Dry and Intermediate zones,"" the Department of Agriculture said in a weather update.

""In paddy fields, priority should be given to 2.5-months paddy varieties.""

In field that tend to dry up quickly other field crops like green gram, black gram cow-pea, sesame and vegetables should be grown, the department said.

In Sri Lanka's Wet zone covering the South Western area, rice could be grown widely.

""It is likely that Wet zone of the country will continue to receive substantial amount of rains from mid-March onwards and therefore, every possible actions should be taken to bring a maximum possible extent of paddy lands to cultivation from this climatic zone,"" the statement said.

On average it takes about 1,400 liters of rice to produce a kilogram of rice, especially in East Asia.

But depending on the yield and the condition of the field which soak up water it may take up to 3500 to 4000 liters of water to produce a kilo of rice. Unlike other crops, rice is grown in flooded conditions.

The warning is coming as the main Maha cultivation season is ending, with up to 137,000 hectares of paddy fields hit by drought.

The Department of Agriculture tried to discourage farmers in areas where water shortages were forecasted last year, so that they could earn some income from an alternative crop.

But officials said many farmers did not heed their advice, partly due to a faith that rains would eventually come, and partly because they wanted the security of having a store of rice.

Rice production in Sri Lanka's main Maha cultivation season is expected to be sharply down in 2017, with lower output also in the Yala season despite normal rainfall being predicted, for this year.

With 17 big rivers and 99 small rivers, the State which had suffered the worst drought in 2016-17, could be water self-sufficient if its resources are managed properly.

Raising the point at a meeting organised by the Tamil Nadu Rivers Retrieval Movement here on Wednesday, ‘waterman of India’ and Ramon Magsaysay awardee Rajendra Singh, retired Supreme Court judge V. Gopala Gowda, and several farmers had put forth their ideas on how a people’s movement could be built on the ground to pull the State out of its current water crisis.

The movement had taken the initiative to revive five major rivers in the State: Thamirabharani, Vaigai, Cauvery, Paalar and Pennaiyaar, through community engagement.

Emphasising that water was a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution Justice Gowda said that destroying the ecological flow of rivers through encroachments on riverbeds, indiscriminate sand mining, and allowing deforestation around catchment areas in order to promote extractive industries, constituted a violation of citizen’s fundamental rights.

Known for his pro-farmer judgement in the Singur land acquisition case in West Bengal, the former judge wanted to help Tamil Nadu solve its water crisis despite hailing from Karnataka. Retired High Court judges and experts in the fields of environment and water should be appointed in the people’s commission of inquiry for river retrieval, Justice Gowda said adding that the commission would be formed on July 18.

People’s participation

Stressing that the drought in the State was predominantly man-made, Mr. Rajendra Singh urged the people to unitedly oppose the destruction of natural resources and work to revive the dying rivers and water bodies in their neighbourhood.

“When I saw the dry river bed of Cauvery a month ago during my tour, I was reminded of the Rajasthan desert back where I work,” he recalled with sorrow. “What we need right now is community ownership of waterbodies.”

In a presentation put together by A. Veerappan, chief coordinator of TN PWD Senior Engineer’s Association, information on the State’s enormous water resources was shared, which showed that if only these were maintained properly, the State would not have to look elsewhere to meet its water requirements.

The data showed how 259 tmcft [thousand million cubic feet] of flood water was wasted by draining into the sea annually.

Madras Institute of Development Studies Professor S. Janakarajan spoke about how government programmes for water conservation funded by foreign development banks such as World Bank and Asian Development Bank were only helping to push the growth figures upwards while no real work had happened on the ground to restore the water bodies. Mr. Janakarajan cited the example of the 6000 crore ‘IAMWARM’water management project.

“Despite spending crores of money why are the lakes in Tamil Nadu disappearing,” he asked, adding that these costly projects only aimed at greening of national accounts while achieving nothing on the ground.

He also ruled out the need for desalination projects in Tamil Nadu since there was sufficient rainwater, which if tapped efficiently could meet the water requirements.

“The government is only interested in demanding relief money every time there is drought or flood. But it should link floods and droughts and manage water in a manner that flood water is stored to meet the deficiency during drought.”

Farmers hailing from the districts where the five rivers chosen for rejuvenation flowed, spoke about the need to build check dams to harness rainwater for agriculture and undertake river water conservation through community efforts.","Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/article19143742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Drought-debt-aGF61VOPMB5jpgjpg,"['tamil', 'river', 'state', 'need', 'rivers', 'water', 'movement', 'resources', 'drought', 'nadu', 'work', 'manmade']",

“Farmers of the district showed greater enthusiasm in paddy cultivation. However,the scarcity of water, severe drought,subsequent floods when the crops were ripening and damage caused by wild elephants hindered the paddy yield,” sources added.

Meanwhile, paddy harvesting in Addalaichenai and the surrounding areas is in progress while rice mill owners and middle men are busy in purchasing paddy from farmers.

At the very start, the price of a bag of paddy (65 Kilograms) was sold at Rs:3,300. But, at present the price of a bag of paddy has come down to Rs:2800. Most of the farmers have cultivated red rice dry this season.

""I have just read the relevant information. I suggest you raise it with the defence ministry for more details,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked whether China has expressed dissatisfaction to Sri Lanka for refusing to let its submarines to dock in Colombo port.

The remarks came as China gets ready to host Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wicikramasinghe for the high-profile silk road summit on May 14-15.

""What I can tell you is that China and Sri Lanka enjoy traditional friendship. The two sides maintain sound cooperation in the fields of politics, economy, culture and military to military exchanges,"" Geng said.

China has made about $8 billion investments in Sri Lanka in the last few years, specially in port projects like Hambantota and Colombo ports.

It continues to pressure the island nation for docking its submarines despite assertion by Sirisena government that it will not permit them due to concerns from India.

India has expressed concern over the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa's government for permitting a Chinese submarine in Colombo harbour in 2014.

China's request to dock its submarines coincided with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Colombo.

China says it wants docking facilities for its submarines to take part in the anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden.

In February this year, Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Karunasena Kodituwakku told the media here that Colombo will not permit any military activity by China in any of its ports including Hambantota where a Chinese firm plans to acquire 80 percent in view of India's concerns.

However, China is happy that Wickaramansinghe has consented to take part in its Belt&Road Forum.

Significantly, Wickaramansinghe and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif are the only two top leaders from South Asia to attend the conference in which India is yet to confirm its participation owing to its objections to the USD 46 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

The other South Asian countries would be represented by either ministerial and official level delegation. China is yet to release the list of delegates participating in the event.

During his visit, Wickramasinge is expected to finalise the Hambantota Port deal as well as a Chinese free trade zone in the area which were stalled by public protests.

Saddled with heavy Chinese loans, Sri Lanka offered to lease 80 per cent of the loss making Hambantota port for 99 years lease. The two sides are also expected to finalise Free Trade Agreement.","Fri, 12 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2015-12/31/full/1451557891-6754.jpg,"['chinese', 'visit', 'china', 'port', 'lanka', 'sri', 'prime', 'colombo', 'refuses', 'submarines', 'hambantota', 'keeps', 'submarine', 'mum', 'dock']",

But getting people to actually do something about it may be the next phase in the battle to prevent catastrophic warming.

Over the course of the last year, I’ve spoken with people in different communities around the world who are trying to do what they can to make a difference, even if they can’t see the effects.

In a small village in the English countryside, residents have been working for 10 years to make their community carbon neutral — they’ve insulated their homes, hung laundry out to dry and installed solar panels. Part of their success has been in their approach: This should be fun, and it should involve all of us, because all of us stand to benefit from staving off the worst effects of climate change.

They have tried to connect the global problem of climate change to normal life, because it’s not always about the melting polar ice caps or apocalyptic drought. Yes, climate change is about those things, but it is also about the ways that life in the 21st century makes most people, especially those in the developed world, part of the problem.

How are your own habits connected to larger environmental problems? How much power are you still using even when you’ve switched off your devices? How many plastic bottles of water do you drink every week, and how does that affect the environment and other people around you?

The 31-year-old fast bowler has played 20 T20 matches for South Africa and six one-day internationals but is no longer eligible to play for his country after penning a three year deal with Sussex.

Wiese had been expected to feature in South Africa's T20 squad to play Sri Lanka in a series of matches.

The move follows the shock move by South Africa Test quick Kyle Abbott to walk away from his international career for a Kolpak deal with Hamphsire.

Quick Single: Abbott, Rossouw part with Proteas

One-day specialist Rilee Rossouw followed the same path, and a string of lower-profile South Africans have followed in their footsteps in recent months.

Following Abbott and Rossouw's revelations, Cricket South Africa moved to immediately cancel their contracts.

The contracts are named after a Slovak handball player who won a ruling that gives anyone with a work permit from a country which has an associate trading agreement with the European Union the same rights as an EU worker.

South Africa have named a squad devoid of any of the players who featured in the Test series victory against Sri Lanka – a move similar to what Australia is expected to do for their own T20 series with Sri Lanka later this summer.

While South Africa have been weakened by the Kolpak defections and have opted to rest key players, Australia's hand is forced by scheduling issues after the BCCI scheduled the first Test to begin the day after the third and final T20 in Adelaide.

South Africa's T20 team will be now be led by allrounder Farhaan Behardien, and feature five players uncapped at international level, as well as allrounder Andile Phehlukwayo who has played ODIs but is uncapped in T20 internationals.

Star batter AB de Villiers, who has not played since June last year because of an elbow injury, and fast bowler Morne Morkel, recovering from a back injury, are due to play in a domestic one-day game on January 22 and may be considered for the third and final T20 international, in Cape Town on January 25.

88,88,Drought Sri Lanka,How Sri Lanka won the malaria war - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/How-Sri-Lanka-won-the-malaria-war/article16756463.ece,"On September 5 this year, Sri Lanka was declared malaria-free at the 69th Session of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Committee for South-East Asia held in Colombo. This is another milestone in Sri Lanka’s outstanding achievements in public health, also reflected in standard health indicators such as life expectancy, infant mortality and average family size.

The only other country to have achieved malaria eradication in the WHO’s South-East Asian region consisting of 11 countries is the Maldives. It is no accident that these two countries have a long history of effective public health interventions and a well-developed health infrastructure. While these malaria-free countries do provide an important breakthrough for the South Asia region as a whole, it is important to note that the long-term viability of malaria-free status in countries that have already achieved this status depends on gradual advances in malaria control and eradication in the region as a whole. This is because malarial parasites can be easily reintroduced from malaria-endemic countries to malaria-free countries through human migration across national boundaries; these can be in the form of flows of tourists, pilgrims, workers, investors and refugees. This should caution us about being unduly optimistic about consolidating malaria eradication in selected countries without containing malaria in the region as a whole. Moreover, it is essential that the WHO regional office works closely with other donors and national governments to fight the remaining malaria outposts in the region.

Sri Lanka’s battle

Sri Lanka’s struggle against malaria has been a long and arduous one. The use of DDT as a vector control measure started in British Ceylon in the 1940s; the introduction of western antimalarials began in the 1930s. As pointed out by Fernando and Warusavithana in ‘100 Years of Malaria Control Efforts in Sri Lanka, 1911 to 2011’, the story of malaria control in Sri Lanka has been characterised by periods of spectacular advances and, equally, setbacks. Sri Lanka experienced one of the worst malaria epidemics ever recorded (1934-1935) after a triple disaster — a severe drought, food shortages and a malarial outbreak in the densely populated wet zone regions which are generally malaria-free.

The development of a comprehensive welfare state in Sri Lanka, inclusive of free education, free health care and subsidised food rations provided by the state to all citizens with effect from the 1940s, was in part a response to this massive epidemic that broke out a few years after universal franchise was introduced to the country in 1931. Confirming Amartya Sen’s view that famines rarely occur in functioning democracies, the elected political leaders in the affected areas highlighted the misery of malaria victims and pushed for health care and welfare reforms. Many in the first generation of political leadership in independent Ceylon saw the devastation caused by the 1934-35 malaria epidemic, and had directly participated in the relief work provided to populations affected by the epidemic. Therefore, they were determined to campaign for expanding health services and making them accessible to the population at large at state expense. Regular DDT spraying in malaria endemic regions began in 1945 and the number of malaria cases reported dropped from 2.7 million in 1946 to 17 in 1963 —a spectacular success in containing the spread of malaria. At that time the health authorities in Sri Lanka were optimistic about achieving malaria eradication in the near future.

However, optimism was short-lived as a full-scale malaria epidemic broke out again in 1968. Vector resistance to DDT and parasitic resistance to antimalarials were first reported in the 1970s, posing a serious threat to Sri Lanka’s progress. along with the malaria eradication strategy. New development projects such as the Accelerated Mahaweli Development Programme (1977) further complicated the task of malaria control due to development-induced population movements from the malaria-free wet zone to the malaria-endemic dry zone as well as due to enhanced vector breeding following environmental changes triggered by development schemes. By the 1980s, malaria infections were back to the levels seen in the pre-DDT era. An increase in P. falciparum malaria was the new challenge even though malaria mortality had declined due to improved health services in the country by this time.

The Anti-Malaria Campaign (AMC)responded to these challenges by switching from DDT to malathion, changing the drug regime administered to malaria patients, changing the approach from malaria eradication to control, and integration of malaria control with other health services in the country. Health volunteers were deployed to educate the public about the disease, its treatment and prevention. A variety of measures such as insecticide-impregnated bed nets and mosquito repellents were introduced in a multi-pronged attack on malaria vectors and parasites. By the early 1990s, there were signs that the interventions being used at the time had the effect of containing the disease and were limiting it to certain pockets where increased surveillance was necessary.

The struggle against malaria in Sri Lanka experienced a major setback due to the civil war between the Sri Lankan security forces and the LTTE, with Vanni, the primary theatre of war, being a malaria-endemic region and a large civilian population in the Northern Province being displaced into this region. An epidemic broke out in Vanni from 1998 to 2002, affecting civilians, LTTE cadres and Sri Lankan security forces. Despite the raging hostilities between the security forces and the LTTE since 1983, there is no evidence of any manipulation of malaria interventions for military purposes either by the state or the LTTE. On the contrary, the two warring parties opted to stop fighting when anti-malaria work was being carried out by the AMC, perhaps realising that malaria was a common enemy for combatants and civilians on both sides of the ethnic divide. The peace accord signed between the government and the LTTE under Norwegian mediation also facilitated the gradual containment of the war-induced malaria epidemic in the affected regions. Even though successful malaria containment in Sri Lanka was achieved prior to the last phase of the war, it is significant that Sri Lanka achieved malaria-free status in the aftermath of the war when the dust had settled and the resettlement of war-displaced population had been largely accomplished.

The future

Malaria is by and large under control in much of South Asia. The remaining hotbeds of malaria transmission in the region are in conflict-affected and frontier regions in Afghanistan, northeast India and Myanmar and require a long-term focal attention in the form of surveillance of the vector, parasite and human behaviour conducive to malaria transmission, a multi-pronged approach inclusive of increased community participation in malaria control activities, livelihood development and poverty reduction, conflict prevention and reconciliation among rival parties. If we are to ensure that the disease burden is to not become an obstacle to future developments in the South Asia region, efforts must be made to rollback these diseases as we seek to roll-out broad-based development in the region as a whole. As elaborated in my recent book, ‘Decolonisation, Development and Disease: A Social History of Malaria in Sri Lanka’ (2014), successful eradication of malaria calls for a shift from a narrow biomedical to a human-centric approach.

89,89,Drought Sri Lanka,Colombo guilty of 40% water waste - Ceylon Daily News,http://www.dailynews.lk/2017/01/20/local/105257/colombo-guilty-40-water-waste,"Close to 30 percent of water supplied to households in the country is wasted with Colombo guilty of wasting almost 40 percent of the water supplied, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary Nimal Hettiarachchi said yesterday.

Old plumbing, together with inefficient and wasteful use of water by the people were blamed for the staggering numbers. The world average for water waste stood at 18-20 percent. Hettiarachchi who is one of the three Secretaries appointed to the Presidential Task Force to tackle issues regarding the drought appealed to the public to use water more efficiently given the stresses placed on the supply during the drought. “We will do our best to ensure there is no water shortage.

At present, the situation is not dire but we are trying our best to prepare for the worst.

If the drought continues, we will have to pay more attention to protecting our water sources.

We ask the people therefore not to pollute the water, as this tends to happen more during the drought”, said Hettiarachchi as he addressed a media briefing together with the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary and the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry Secretary.

The Water Board which presently operates 75 bowsers is expected to purchase an additional 25 to supply water to all areas.

In addition, they plan to build 480 temporary water tanks in drought stricken areas to offer relief to the people. “Only 47 percent of the people in the country have access to pipe borne water. The rest rely on private sources such as wells but during drought,wells dry up, so we will have to supply more people with water,” Hettiarachchi said.

Ensuring a continuous supply of drinking water, according to the Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Udaya Seneviratne has become the greatest challenge of the Presidential Task Force, “The water levels in the Mahaweli reservoirs are at less than 50 percent.

Only 45 percent of our total agricultural lands have been planted (35 percent of paddy and 10 percent others).

The main priority thus is to direct water for drinking, then to protect the crops that have been planted and then the remainder will be given for power supply,” Seneviratne said.

Seneviratne also pointed out that the current drought made it a necessity for climate mitigation actions to be put in place,

“Sri Lanka has signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 and thus we prepared a plan of action in 15 identified areas, along with the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all areas”, explained the Mahaweli Secretary and added,

“This drought can be used as a good opportunity to introduce new water management systems, agricultural methods and technology that would use our resources wisely”.","Fri, 20 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",http://www.dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/styles/node-detail/public/news/2017/01/19/z_p01-colombo.jpg?itok=2233Iu61,"['task', 'guilty', 'supply', 'ministry', 'supplied', 'water', '40', 'colombo', 'drought', 'hettiarachchi', 'waste', 'areas', 'mahaweli', 'secretary']", 
90,90,Drought Sri Lanka,SL on top despite Cremer's maiden ton | cricket.com.au - cricket.com.au,https://www.cricket.com.au/news/match-report/day-three-zimbabwe-sri-lanka-first-test-harare-match-report/2016-11-01,"Graeme the Cremer of the crop in Harare

Graeme Cremer begun the day without a Test fifty and a batting average of 10.75 but the Zimbabwe captain struck an unlikely maiden century to keep Sri Lanka at bay in the first Test in Harare.

But Cremer’s gritty knock could not prevent his side from going to stumps on day three with a heavy deficit.

The leg-spinner, who arrived at the crease in Harare with Zimbabwe 6-139 in reply to Sri Lanka’s 537 and facing the prospect of following on, hit 102 not out to drag the home side to 373 all out.

Quick Single: Ten-year drought ends as Sri Lanka take control

By the close of play on Monday, Sri Lanka had reached 0-5 in their second innings to lead by 169.

Cremer’s previous highest score in Test cricket was 43, but he showed his batsmen what was possible with a bit of application as he batted for over four hours.

Zimbabwe’s collapse in the morning had owed more to a series of rash strokes than trying conditions or outstanding bowling.

They resumed on a promising 1-88, but soon saw opener Tino Mawoyo pull a short ball from Suranga Lakmal straight to deep midwicket to depart for 45, and two overs later Hamilton Masakadza prodded forward to edge Lakmal to slip for 33.

Sean Williams then picked out the man in the deep with a careless sweep, before Craig Ervine and Malcolm Waller were trapped lbw by Dilruwan Perera.

Day one: Perera posts ton as SL dominate

At 6-139, Zimbabwe were in danger of being shot out and being forced to bat again but Peter Moor’s counter-attacking knock changed the momentum of the innings.

His two early sixes forced the field back, while Cremer was content to provide dogged support from the other end.

""I think we bat quite well together because PJ plays some big shots and keeps the scoreboard ticking, and I know that I can block out a maiden if I need to and just get off strike,” said Cremer.

“So that helps me a lot, knowing there’s someone on the other end scoring.”

Moor went on to score a career-best 79 in a 132-run stand with Cremer which only ended when Lahiru Kumara produced a fearsome bouncer that Moor fended to slip.

Kumara went on to knock Cremer’s helmet off his head and rattle the Zimbabwe skipper, who was then fortunate to see a hook sht off Kumara dropped at deep backward square-leg with his score on 58.

Cremer went on to add 92 for the eighth wicket with Donald Tiripano as Zimbabwe’s tail continued to wag, but nearly ran out of partners on 99 when the ninth wicket went down.

Zimbabwe’s final batsman Chris Mpofu managed to hold off Rangana Herath to give Cremer his chance, and the 30-year-old duly went to three figures to cap an impressive feat for a batsman whose Test average was only just in double digits prior to the Test.

First-ball heartbreak for Mumba

“I hadn’t got 50 before in Test cricket and I don’t even have a five-for yet, so it was quite special,” said Cremer.

“When I got to 75, I started thinking, ‘There’s a chance here.’ Then I thought I might run out of partners.

“It was an awesome feeling to get that one run to get to a hundred.”","Tue, 01 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.cricket.com.au/~/-/media/News/2016/11/01Cremer.ashx?w=1600,"['ton', 'lanka', 'sri', 'maiden', 'went', 'cremer', 'despite', 'sl', 'test', 'score', 'knock', 'deep', 'cremers', 'wicket', 'zimbabwe']",

96,96,Drought Sri Lanka,Drought doesn't cause famine. People do. - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-27/drought-doesnt-cause-famine-people-do,"A woman waits to be registered prior to a food distribution by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Thonyor, Leer state, South Sudan.

The United Nations announced this month that more than 20 million people in four countries are teetering on the edge of famine, calling the situation “the worst humanitarian crisis” since the end of World War II.

The key for avoiding the worst outcomes? Political will, experts say.

Modern famines are different from those the world faced 60 to 70 years ago. In the past, with less warning and less international support, more people died from hunger. In the early and mid-20th century, famines killed millions in Europe and Asia, in areas with much larger populations than areas which suffer from food insecurity today.

According to estimates from the World Peace Foundation, the deadliest famine in recorded history actually did take place after World War II. During China’s Great Leap Forward, about 30 million people died from hunger between 1958 and 1962.

What explains the UN's statement, then? They may be counting famines by decade, which would have split the Great Leap Forward crisis between the 1950s and the 1960s:

These days, famines cause death by the thousands, and are mostly confined to the Horn of Africa. Improvements in transportation and communications infrastructure have been successful in eliminating large-scale famines in virtually all other parts of the world.

But the current situations in Somalia, Yemen, Nigeria and South Sudan are undeniably harsh.

“Those people will suffer, their children will be malnourished, they will likely be displaced, lose their livelihoods, and some people will no doubt die as a result of this crisis,” says Dan Maxwell, a food security professor and director of the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University.

Maxwell exphasizes that modern-day famines are rarely caused by a lack of food. “There has never been a case that agricultural production causes famine alone,” he says. “It only causes a famine if someone lets it cause a famine.”

And that's where data become especially important. Measuring early indicators is crucial for averting famine, as is early investment. In its March announcement, the UN asked for $4.4 billion in emergency funding for intervention, and released $22 million in an emergency loan to Somalia on March 21.

“If we get to the point where a famine is declared, it’s essentially indicating a failure on the part of the international community,” explains Chris Hillbruner of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, or FEWS NET.

So, how do we measure the warning signs?

FEWS NET uses the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) 5-point rating system, which rates areas around the world to signal how serious food insecurity is there. The ratings go from ""minimal"" to ""stressed, crisis, emergency and famine.""

The scale, developed in 2006 and updated in 2012, is in use in 25 countries and gives a consistent measure for food insecurity.

“There should be a response at phase 3 and phase 4,” Hillbruner said. “Phase 4 is where people start dying because of food insecurity. If one waits until famine and then starts responding, inevitably it will be too late.”

To declare a famine, at least 20 percent of households surveyed in an area must face lack of food, and more than 30 percent of children in an area have to have a weight that is recorded as dangerously low. If you don’t have data that says that, you can’t declare famine even if people are starving.

The situation in Yemen is the largest food insecurity emergency in the world right now, according to FEWS NET. Seven governorates there are classified as phase 4. An estimated 17 million people, or 60 percent of the population, are food insecure.

In South Sudan, about 4.9 million are estimated to be food insecure and that number will climb to 5.5 million by July. Five counties are classified at 4 and 5 and will worsen.

FEWS NET officials struggle to access parts of Nigeria, and reported in December that a famine likely occurred in Bama and Banki towns and the surrounding rural areas in 2016.

In Somalia, 400,000 people are in IPC phase 4 and face starvation; 5.2 million others are in phases 2 and 3. It is facing its third famine in the past 25 years, including one in 2011 which left 260,000 people dead.

Hunger is a political issue

Maxwell says there’s a common misconception among the public that overpopulation and lack of resources are the main drivers behind food insecurity. (It’s a theory that was put forth by Thomas Malthus nearly two centuries ago.) In other words, that people starve because there's not enough food.

But Emily Farr, Emergency Food Security and Vulnerable Livelihoods team leader at Oxfam, says that's not the underlying problem. “We are talking about situations that are caused by human behavior,” she says.

The Horn of Africa region, where hunger is worst, is also prone to drought — but the impacts of climate change alone are not enough to create famine, experts say, so long as they are managed.

Farr emphasizes that fast-acting humanitarian response is important for mitigating famines, although the data can be hard to come by.

“There have been cases in the past where we haven’t been able to declare food insecurity as much as it was because we simply didn’t have the data,” Farr says.

Conflict especially can limit access. In South Sudan, for example, violence has claimed the lives of at least 12 aid workers this year and as many as 79 since 2013.

Innovations in technology, such as the World Food Program’s Mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping project, which uses cellphones to survey food security, can help fill in missing numbers. FEWS NET employs high resolution satellite imagery to estimate crop production and population displacement patterns.

Fundamentally, Hillbruner of FEWS NET describes famine as a humanitarian and political issue.

“I think there are times when it’s overstated that there are places we can’t get any information,” he said. “But when the political will is there, everyone suddenly has access.”

Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect the difference between populations in famine (IPC stage 4) and those facing severe food insecurity (IPC phases 2 and 3).

97,97,Drought Sri Lanka,Somaliland's hunger crisis: ‘The world doesn't respond until children are dying' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/may/24/somaliland-hunger-crisis-world-doesnt-respond-until-children-are-dying-foreign-minister-saad-ali-shire,"Somaliland’s foreign minister has said that the international community’s refusal to recognise the republic 26 years after it declared independence means aid is taking far longer to reach people on the brink of famine.

Though Somaliland, on the Gulf of Aden, has 4.4 million inhabitants and its own currency, army and parliament, in the eyes of the world it is part of war-torn Somalia. More than 1.5 million people have been affected by the drought afflicting the state, and most of its livestock has been wiped out. In recent days, the drought has been compounded by an outbreak of cholera in the east.

Saad Ali Shire, Somaliland’s foreign minister, said: “Lack of recognition is proving a major problem. We do not receive bilateral aid. All aid goes to the third parties via the UN. The UN has very professional people, but the bureaucracy that goes with these many channels is huge, and there is a high administrative cost. If we were recognised, we could receive aid bilaterally, and attract international investors – so creating a more resilient economy that is less dependent on livestock.

“I don’t think people took our warnings of famine seriously until the start of the year. It seems the international community does not seem to respond until there are emaciated and dying children on their TV screens.

“The assistance now through the UN is very slow and bureaucratic. There is no lack of will, but it often takes months for aid to reach the country as it has to go through so many levels.”

Somaliland, a former British colony, declared independence from Somalia in 1991 and has been praised for its relative political stability and lack of conflict.

Now, the country’s leaders are reopening a battle for diplomatic recognition, believing that if they can persuade one swing state in the African Union, such as Ghana, to recognise the country, the rest of the international community will follow. The drought, and crisis in neighbouring Somalia, have added to the urgency.

“We have always had droughts, but they used to be once every 10 years. Now they are once every two years due to climate change,” said Shire. “This year, we have had the worst drought in living memory across east Africa.

“The drought has destroyed 80% of the country’s cattle and we are a pastoral economy. The bureaucracy has been so slow that in large parts of the country little or no aid has arrived.”

Others estimate that about half of the country’s 18 million livestock have died.

Shire claimed the Somali government in Mogadishu was increasingly assertive in trying to appropriate a disproportionate amount of international aid sent to the region.

The UK and the US are by far the two largest donors to the UN famine appeal and have been at the forefront of efforts to rouse the international community to improve security inside Somalia.

Insisting that its claim for legal recognition would not worsen Somalia’s existing problems, Shire said: “We have stood the test of time. We have lasted 26 years. We are a mature democracy and country, and we believe in democracy.”

The UN has expressed concern that presidential elections in Somaliland would not be held until November, but Shire said they had been delayed due to drought and promised they would go ahead.

“From 1991 to 1997, we had conflict, civil wars and upheavals, but we have managed to resolve these issues – unlike Somalia – through reconciliation, demobilisation and better governance,” he said.

Shire said the international community was spending $2bn (£1.5m) a year to improve security in Somalia and questioned the point of giving it new weapons. “We suffer from the syndrome of being the good child. Naughty children get all the attention. The international community seems to be willing to reward failure, and penalise success.



“Somalia would benefit from our independence. We would be be able to share our experience with them on how to achieve reconciliation and prosperity. We want nothing from Somalia. We do not want land or money from them. We want our independence.”

He also urged the international community to rebuff Somalia’s recent call for a lifting of the arms embargo to defeat Islamic militants al-Shabaab. “The place is already awash with weapons. What they need to do is gain the confidence of the people. The government does not need new arms. It needs to collect the weapons that are already there.”","Wed, 24 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f3fd37059548bd101b04370662850d3cfdbe1c0/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ae09f731749c0ba7ba8239c75fe7cb49,"['international', 'world', 'country', 'children', 'hunger', 'dying', 'drought', 'somalia', 'shire', 'community', 'crisis', 'doesnt', 'aid', 'somaliland', 'foreign', 'respond', 'weapons', 'somalilands']",

99,99,Drought Sri Lanka,An end to desertification - Sunday Observer,https://sundayobserver.lk/2017/06/18/end-desertification,"Most parts of Sri Lanka have just emerged out of a long drought, which was followed by a massive flood. However, there are several areas which have still not received a substantial amount of rain. Some areas of the country are so parched that they could turn out to be deserts a few decades, if not years, down the road.

Drought is in fact one of the biggest causes of desertification (dictionary definition: the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas) worldwide, but it is not the only one. Desertification is caused primarily by human activities and climatic variations. (Desertification does not refer to the expansion of existing deserts per se, though that is also happening).

Desertification is not a new phenomenon. There is new evidence to suggest that man’s actions may have given birth to deserts such as the Sahara.

The desertification of the Sahara, which began 10,000 years ago, may have been at least partially caused by humans, according to a new study. Most studies suggest the formation of the Sahara Desert, the world’s largest hot desert, was brought about by changes in regional vegetation patterns and a shift in Earth’s orbit. But some scientists now argue human activities may have encouraged the Sahara’s formation.

Desertification occurred because dry land ecosystems, which cover over one third of the world’s land area, are extremely vulnerable to over exploitation and inappropriate land use.

There are many direct and indirect causes that lead to desertification, such as poverty, political instability, deforestation, overgrazing and bad irrigation practices.

A little more than 24 percent of the Earth’s surface is made up of desertified lands.

According to the United Nations, over 250 million people are directly affected by desertification, and about one billion people in over one hundred countries are at risk. These people include many of the world‘s poorest, most marginalized and politically voiceless citizens.

The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought which fell yesterday (June 17) is observed every year to promote public awareness of international efforts to combat desertification.

This year’s theme is “Land degradation and migration” which examines the important link between land degradation and migration. Among others, environmental degradation, food insecurity and poverty are causes of migration and development challenges.

This day should remind everyone of land’s important role in producing food and generating local employment, as well as its ability to add to the sustainability, stability and security of desertification-affected places.

This year’s key events are being held at Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, organized by the Ministry of Environment, Green Economy and Climate Change. (Incidentally, Burkina Faso is one of the few countries having a separate Climate Change Ministry).

Migration poses a big challenge to host countries, many of which are poor themselves, because they have to feed additional mouths using the same extent of arable land. In just 15 years, the number of international migrants worldwide has risen from 173 million in 2000 to 244 million in 2015.

The UN has taken the issue of land degradation into account in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) program. “We are determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations,” the UN says. Specifically, SDG Goal Number 15 states the world’s resolve to halt and reverse land degradation.

Another alarming consequence of land degradation is water scarcity. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will experience absolute water scarcity, and two thirds of the world will be living under water-stressed conditions. Experts fear that the advancing drought and deserts, growing water scarcity and decreasing food security may provoke a huge ‘tsunami” of climate refugees and migrants.

This is why a major United Nations Convention calls drought ‘one of the “four horsemen of the apocalypse.’ The statistics are really alarming - 12 million hectares of productive land become barren every year due to desertification and drought alone, which is a lost opportunity to produce 20 million tons of grain.

This cannot go on, when the world is expected to increase food production by 70 per cent by 2050 to feed the entire world population which will reach nine billion by that year. Sustainable intensification of food production that avoids further deforestation should be a priority for action for policy makers worldwide.

Desertification is sometimes irreversible and sometimes reversible, depending on one’s location. Reforestation is often the best answer.

A recent report from Mongolia published in China’s Global Times says Inner Mongolian farmers who planted trees in the arid area for 20 years are now seeing the retreating desert. There is a grand plan to plant trees from Senegal to Djibouti to halt desertification in its tracks.

The Great Green Wall would be a nine-mile wide band of trees and shrubbery across the southern border of Sahara’s southern Sahel desert, stretching 4,400 miles through 11 countries from the Senegalese capital of Dakar in the west to Djibouti on the Indian Ocean coast.

Elvis Paul Tangam, the African Union Commissioner in charge of the plan, says 15 per cent of the trees were planted already, largely in Senegal and Burkina Faso. Senegal has reclaimed more than four million hectares of land along the Great Green Wall.

In 1978, the Chinese government implemented the Three-North Shelterbelt Project, a national ecological engineering effort that called for the planting of millions of trees along the 2,800-mile border of northern China’s encroaching desert, while increasing the world’s forest by 10 percent. Also known as the “Great Green Wall,” the project’s end date isn’t until 2050; so far, more than 66 billion trees have been planted.

Such international cooperation and national-level action is vital to see an end to further desertification. Most countries have already ratified the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and are taking steps to prevent further erosion of land.

Sri Lanka too has an ambitious tree planting and reforestation campaign that should put a halt to any chances of desertification. It is essential to prevent desertification everywhere if we do not want to face a rather bleak future.","Sun, 18 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.sundayobserver.lk/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/news/2017/06/16/z_p37-An-end.jpg?itok=xkUBM--I,"['million', 'land', 'end', 'countries', 'desertification', 'worlds', 'drought', 'food', 'desert', 'degradation', 'trees']",
