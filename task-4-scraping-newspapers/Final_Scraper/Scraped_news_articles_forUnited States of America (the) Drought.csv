After an extremely dry 2020 and a spring heatwave, fires are blazing across the south-west. Lake Mead, the country’s largest reservoir, hit its lowest-ever water level on June 9th. Utah’s governor recently invited his constituents to “pray for rain”. Drought and wildfire are perennial characteristics of the American West, but in the past year conditions have worsened dramatically. Is the region experiencing a megadrought?

The definition of megadrought varies, but it is usually understood to be a multi-decade period of intense aridity. Jason Smerdon, a paleoclimatologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, says the defining feature of a megadrought is its length. Because the current drought can be traced back to 2000, Mr Smerdon suggests it is an “emerging megadrought.” But that is not to understate its severity. A paper published in Science last year found that 2000-2018 was the second-driest 19-year period for the south-west in the past 1,200 years, exceeded only by a megadrought in the late 1500s.

There are two main reasons things look so dire. The first concerns natural weather patterns. La Niña events, when cooler surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean push the polar jet stream north, tend to coincide with drought in the American south-west. Successive La Niña events are largely to blame for previous megadroughts, says Mr Smerdon. But it’s not just the south-west that is suffering. Hot and dry conditions have plagued the Pacific Northwest for the past year as well affecting states such as Oregon and Washington. Indeed, the most striking feature of the current drought may be its geographic spread. Whereas the drought in the 1500s was mostly concentrated in the Four Corners region—where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah meet—today’s drought encompasses most of the area west of the continental divide, most of which runs along the Rockies. The United States Drought Monitor estimates that as of June 10th 97% of the region was at least “abnormally dry”, and 55% was experiencing “extreme” or “exceptional” drought (see map).

Climate change is also to blame. The water that fills the country’s biggest reservoirs comes from melting snowpack, which is delivered to Lake Mead, for example, via the Colorado River. But average snowpack across the West has been decreasing for decades as rising carbon-dioxide emissions have led to warmer winters. Dan McEvoy, a climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Centre in Reno, Nevada, observed record melt rates in the first two weeks of April throughout the West. Snowpack in California was at 0% of normal as of June 1st—it had all melted four to five weeks ahead of time.

The effects of such a climate cocktail can be wide-ranging. Severe drought can decrease streamflows and increase river temperatures. This can harm local species, deprive forests and soils of nutrients, and heighten the risk and severity of wildfires. Officials across the region fret that a long and dangerous fire season looms. Some states and counties are already imposing water restrictions.

Questions about water scarcity have long been central to the region. When white settlers were lured west in the 19th century it was, in part, by promises of irrigable farmland—though the land they would attempt to tame was mountainous and arid. Writing in 1980, Wallace Stegner, a novelist, warned that “the history of the West until recently has been a history of the importation of humid-land habits...into a dry land that will not tolerate them”. Climate change has only upped the stakes. The amount of water available to westerners may be shrinking, but eight of the ten fastest-growing states in the last decade are west of the Mississippi River.",English

“It’s an alarming picture,” said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies how global warming affects extreme weather events.

Across the region, reservoir levels are near record lows and mountain snowpack, which slowly releases water in the spring and summer, is largely depleted. In California, water restrictions are already in effect, with more widespread cuts expected. Dry soil conditions are already increasing fire risk.

The West is no stranger to drought, but climate change is making it worse. Severe dryness covered California and Nevada just five years ago, from 2012 to 2016, and the Southwest has been in drought for much of the past two decades, punctuated by rare wet years. Experts say this year is unusual because extreme drought conditions are so widespread and have intensified quickly. They are likely to grow even worse this summer.

The situation is especially dire in California and the Southwest.

Winter rain and snowfall usually bring most of California’s moisture for the year, but this winter was drier than usual, with warm temperatures arriving early this spring. The state is now in its dry season and is unlikely to see significant rainfall again until October.

“There’s a 100 percent chance that it gets worse before it gets better,” Dr. Swain said. “We have the whole long, dry summer to get through.”

In the Southwest, a late summer monsoon that usually provides about half of the region’s annual rainfall could bring some respite — if it materializes. Last year, the monsoon was more of a “nonsoon,” bringing only traces of rain.

Low Rains, High Temperatures

Large swaths of the West saw record-low precipitation over the past year, matched by significantly higher-than-usual temperatures.

David Simeral, a climate scientist at the Desert Research Institute and an author for the U.S. Drought Monitor, said conditions over the last 12 months had contributed to the rapid intensification of the current drought. Brutal heat lashed much of the region last summer, the Southwest monsoon failed to deliver substantial rainfall that year, and many western states got less precipitation than usual this winter, too.

While the West has long experienced boom and bust years for precipitation, climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing volatility: It makes dry years drier and wet years wetter.

Higher temperatures have also directly contributed to the drought conditions and water shortages in recent decades. Warmer winters bring more precipitation in the form of rain rather than snow, decreasing snowpack, and more intense spring heat has caused the snow to melt earlier. Higher-than-usual temperatures also dry out vegetation and soil and can increase evaporation from reservoirs, putting added strain on the crucial Western water supplies.

Low Reservoirs, Depleted Snowpack

Natural Resources Conservation Service · For reservoirs in California, recent levels reflect readings on June 8, 2021, compared with average levels for 1966-2015. For all other reservoirs, recent levels are from the end of May 2021 and are relative to the average for the data period of record. For snowpack, available measurements are shown. Recent snowpack levels are compared with the average for the period of record.

Lake Mead, the largest human-made reservoir in the United States, recently hit its lowest level since 1937, following years of decline. The lake, which sits on the border between Nevada and Arizona, is under growing pressure from the prolonged drought, climate change and growing population in the Southwest.

Across the region, reservoirs are struggling this year, especially in California.

Usually, melting mountain snowpack helps to replenish reservoirs, rivers and soils throughout the spring and summer. (You can think of snowpack as a sort of natural reservoir system that releases water over time.)

But in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California and other parts of the lower West, snowpack melted early this year because of higher spring temperatures and other unfavorable conditions. Much of the runoff didn’t make it to reservoirs and streams at all because already-parched soils sucked up the water.

The agricultural sector in California has been particularly affected by water shortages, with federal and state allotments drastically cut. Farmers have had to destroy some water-intensive crops in hopes of saving others. At the California-Oregon border, the drought has pitted farmers against fish once more.

In some parts of the state, local officials have asked residents and businesses to start conserving water. Big cities aren’t likely to see major water shortages this summer, but running out of water is a real possibility for some rural areas, especially those that depend on wells.

Jeanine Jones, the interstate resources manager for the California Department of Water Resources, said the current crisis exposes the need for drought forecasting and planning to consider the effects of climate change.

“We’ve now had two dry years,” she said, but “this is all occurring in the context of a longer period, a couple of decades, of generally dry and much warmer conditions.”

Fire Outlook: ‘As Bad as It Can Be’

Last year, the West Coast saw its worst fire season on record, with megafires burning in Washington, Oregon and California. Dry conditions have set the stage for another bad fire year in 2021.

High temperatures and low precipitation have dried out grasses, shrubs and other greenery, and soils are extremely dry for this time of year.

Already, twice as many acres have burned in California as during the same period last year. The state’s fire season has expanded in recent decades, starting earlier and ending later than it used to.

“Not everything is predictable,” said Dr. Swain of U.C.L.A., referring to events like the dry lightning strikes that ignited many major fires in 2020. “But of the predictable elements — how dry is the soil? And will it get better in the next months? — those are as bad as it can be.”

“Most of the west is at increased risk of large severe fires this year,” he said. “That may sound like a broken record, but maybe that’s the point.”",English

The crisis has also extended into Canada, with temperatures in British Columbia soaring to 118F (46.6C) on Monday, shattering records for the area where few are set up for such intense heat.

Experts and officials fear that the catastrophic conditions, fueled by the climate crisis, will only get worse through the coming months.

This week an unprecedented and dangerous heatwave scorched the Pacific north-west, obliterating records set just the day before.

Seattle hit 108F (42C) by evening – well above Sunday’s all-time high of 104F (40C). Portland, Oregon, reached 115F (46C) after hitting new records of 108F (42C) on Saturday and 112F (44C) on Sunday.

“This is the beginning of a permanent emergency,” said Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, during an interview on MSNBC. “We have to tackle the source of this problem, which is climate change.”

The heatwave, caused by what meteorologists described as a dome of high pressure, extends from California up through areas in Canada’s Arctic territories and was worsened by the human-caused climate crisis.

Zeke Hausfather, a scientist at the climate-data non-profit Berkeley Earth, said the Pacific north-west had warmed by about 3F (1.7C) in the past half-century. Noting that this would still have been an extreme heatwave without the additional warming, he said: “This is worse than the same event would have been 50 years ago.”

The blistering heat hinted at the greater costs of climate breakdown to come. Blackouts were reported throughout the region as people trying to keep cool with fans and air conditioners strained the power grid.

The heat forced schools and businesses to close to protect workers and guests, including places such as outdoor pools and ice-cream shops where people seek relief from the heat. Covid-19 testing sites and mobile vaccination units were out of service.

In Portland, light rail and street car service was suspended as power cables melted and electricity demand surged. Heat-related expansion caused road pavement to buckle or pop loose in many areas, including on I5 in Seattle. Workers in tanker trucks in Seattle were hosing down drawbridges with water at least twice a day to prevent the steel from expanding in the heat and interfering with their opening and closing mechanisms.

The Democratic senator Maria Cantwell said the heat illustrated an urgent need for the federal infrastructure package to promote clean energy, cut greenhouse gas emissions and protect people from extreme heat.

“Washington state was not built for triple-digit temperatures,” she said.

To the north in Canada, officials in the city of Burnaby just east of Vancouver, reported that more than two dozen people succumbed to the heat in just 24 hours. Heat warnings have been issued across the region, cautioning the most vulnerable – especially seniors, young children, pregnant women, and those with illnesses – to stay hydrated and indoors. Many people don’t have air conditioning and residents are reportedly flooding department stores trying to purchase fans and cooling systems that are already in short supply.

“This heatwave poses a significant threat to British Columbians, particularly seniors, children and the most vulnerable members of society. Climate change is a public health emergency and we need to treat it like one,” Sonia Furstenau, the leader of the Green party of British Columbia, tweeted on Monday.

Extreme heat, which was also felt across California and states in the south-west in recent weeks, has accelerated already devastating drought conditions, baking moisture out of the parched environment and intensifying the risks of wildfires.

More than 58.4 million people live in areas affected by the drought, according to the US Drought Monitor, and a record 49.7% of the west is now in the highest categories of “extreme” and “exceptional” drought levels.

For the third straight week, Extreme (D3)/Exceptional (D4) Drought in the West has set a #DroughtMonitor record.

“The drought situation in the western United States continued to worsen after another mostly hot and dry week,” the agency said in its most recent update, released last week. “Wildfires and increasing wildfire danger, water restrictions, and damage to agriculture are very common across the west region.”

Large fires are already burning, exhausting resources across the region much earlier than in previous years. Forty-eight large fires have burned more than 661,400 acres across 12 states, as “wildland fire personnel continue to deal with extreme temperatures and very dry fuels across the western states”, the National Interagency Fire Center reports. In Arizona alone, 17 fires are still uncontained.

In California, the fire season is outpacing last year, when the state set a new record of roughly 4.1m acres burned. Firefighters are facing hot, dry, conditions and battling three large fires in Kern, Siskiyou, and San Bernardino counties.

The Lava Fire, the largest burning in California, started by lightning in the Shasta-Trinity national forest, exploded overnight and by Tuesday morning had torched more than 13,300 acres. It is 20% contained, and evacuation orders have been issued for thousands of residents who live and work in communities near Weed, California, close to the Oregon border. The National Weather Service has issued red flag warnings for the area, as officials brace for gusty winds and low humidity that could complicate containment efforts.

Forest service officials told reporters in a briefing on Monday night that air tankers and helicopters had to be grounded through the afternoon due to the powerful winds.

“We had a rough four or five hours there not being able to fly,” said Steve Watkins, incident commander.

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, secured support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to help with costs to suppress the fire on Tuesday. Officials said the fire was expected to spread.

“The wind is beginning to pick up again and it’s going to be another hot day,” said the public information officer for the incident, Jim Mackensen, noting that the temperatures were still in the hundreds. Mackensen added that there was a high probability that the fire would be active on Tuesday afternoon, fueled in part by what officials call an “unstable atmosphere” when the smoke and winds create conditions that act almost like a thunderstorm.

“The winds are just a fact of life around here,” he said, but added: “This is a lot hotter than what it normally gets around here. This is all part of the historic heatwave from Seattle on down.”
