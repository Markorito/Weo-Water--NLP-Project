As many as 107,487 people died due to heavy rains and floods across India over 64 years between 1953 and 2017, according to Central Water Commission data presented to the Rajya Sabha (Parliament’s upper house) on March 19, 2018. Damage to crops, houses and public utilities was reported to be Rs 365,860 crore--or as much as 3% of India’s current gross domestic product--the data show.

“The main reasons of floods have been assessed as high intensity rainfall in short duration, poor or inadequate drainage capacity, unplanned reservoir regulation and failure of flood control structures,” according to the reply to the Rajya Sabha.

With heavy rains sweeping western India, many cities such as Mangaluru, Mumbai and Junagarh have flooded during the 2018 monsoon season. Over 30 people died in floods that inundated 58 villages, The Times of India reported on July 7, 2018.

Climate change will exacerbate flooding

""Temperatures have been rising across the [South Asia] region, and are projected to continue increasing for the next several decades under all plausible climate scenarios,"" the World Bank study, published on June 28, 2018, said.

These changes will result in more frequent flooding, greater water demand and increased heat-related medical issues.

South Asian cities such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Dhaka and Karachi--that are home to over 50 million people--face a substantial risk of flood-related damage over the next century, the report said.

India is one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change. It has increased the frequency of downpours as well as the gaps between rainy days during the monsoon, as IndiaSpend reported in January 2018 and February 2018.

As India’s climate warms, extreme weather, such as intense rain and floods, is predicted to worsen.

The new World Bank study mentioned above said the worst affected states by 2050 would be Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Seven of the 10 most affected districts will belong to Vidarbha, Maharashtra.

India could see a six-fold increase in population exposed to the risk of severe floods by 2040--to 25 million people from 3.7 million facing this risk between 1971 and 2004, IndiaSpend reported in February 2018, based on a study published in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed journal.

“India is highly vulnerable to floods,” according to the National Disaster Management Authority, a government body. “Out of the total geographical area of 329 million hectares (mha), more than 40 mha is flood prone.”

Most deaths (11,316) due to floods/heavy rains in India were reported in 1977, while the least were recorded in 1953 (37).

Over 1,600 people die every year due to floods, affecting nearly 32 million people. More than 92,000 cattles are lost every year, seven million hectares of land is affected, and damage is over Rs 5,600 crore.

“High losses from floods reflect India’s inadequacy to cope with the current variability in climate, let alone future climate change,” Ashvani Kumar Gosain, professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, told IndiaSpend in February 2018.

States that are flood-prone include West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

“Intense rains during the monsoon season cause rivers like Brahmaputra, Ganga and Yamuna to swell their banks, which in turn floods the adjacent areas,” according to this reply to the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) on April 4, 2018.

There are 226 flood forecasting stations across 20 states, two union territories and 19 river basins to monitor floods in the country. The government plans to expand the network to 325 stations by March 2020.

Since India has been home to natural disasters, it’s not the first or the last time the country is facing such loss. Credit: Meeta Ahlawat

Floods have caused considerable damage across India this season. So much that 91 districts in 12 Indian states have been affected by floods since the beginning of this monsoon. A total of 511 people have lost their lives and 176 people have been injured. Floods have damaged around 55,000 houses with the greatest number being Manipur’s (17,846). People have also lost their means to livelihood as 1,37,008 animals have been affected and crops in an area of 81,147 ha all over the country have been damaged by flood waters.

According to data from the Central Water Commission (CWC), one fifth of global flood related deaths take place in India. In the 64 years from 1953 to 2017, more than one lakh people have died due to floods and damage to crops. Also, infrastructure and housing has been pegged at Rs 3,65,860 crore, which is 3 percent of the country’s current Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This was part of the reply presented to the Rajya Sabha on the loss and damage caused by floods in India. The reply also says, “The main reasons behind floods have been assessed as high intensity rainfall in short duration, poor or inadequate drainage capacity of river, unplanned reservoir regulation and failure of flood control structures.”

Since India has been home to natural disasters, it’s not the first or the last time the country is facing such loss. The year 1977 saw the greatest loss of human lives due to floods with over 11,000 people dying. This is 10.5 per cent of the total loss of lives in 64 years.

The worst affected state in terms of loss of lives has been Karnataka with 128 deaths, while in Maharashtra floods killed 123 people. On the other hand, Assam has seen a huge loss to its animal population with more than 1,30,000 animals being affected by floods, which is 95 per cent of the total across the country. In terms of damage to crops, West Bengal has suffered the most with more than 47,000 ha of its cropping area being inundated by water.

Though states like Bihar and Rajasthan have also seen floods, state officials say that no loss and damage has been reported.

Many states across India, especially ones in the North East, are witnessing a dangerous trend. This monsoon season (June 1-July 16), many of them have received less rainfall than normal and yet have experienced floods.

Number of lives lost and other damages in various states in India due to floods this season June 1 to July 16:

For example, till July 16, 21 districts across Assam had experienced floods this season, according to the National Disaster Management Authority’s flood situation report. Out of these, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has rainfall data on 16 districts and 14 of these have had less than normal rainfall this season. The highest deficit of rainfall was recorded in Dhemaji district at 90 per cent. Only Jorhat and Chirang have had excess rainfall of 7 per cent and 42 per cent. The major reason for this scenario is the increase in extreme rainfall events and decrease in long-term rainfall in the region. There is a pattern to this now. For elongated periods of time there is none to very less rainfall creating a deficit and then suddenly there is a series of extreme rain events bringing in torrents of rain causing floods. A recent Down to Earth analysis showed that between July 5 and July 11 there was a 25%-69% jump in excess rainfall in at least 28 districts across the country.

The highest increase (69 per cent) was seen in Bageshwar, Uttarakhand where heavy rain made the Saryu River overflow, causing extensive damage to roads and buildings. In the week from June 28 to July 4, the district had a deficit in rainfall of 61 per cent. In the week following that (July 5 to July 11), it received 236.7 mm rainfall which is 276 per cent of the normal rainfall for that week. This was a swing of 337 per cent week over week.

4,4,"For Kerala’s flood disaster, we have ourselves to blame - Hindustan Times","Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['flood', 'keralas', 'states', 'study', 'rain', 'monsoon', 'ghats', 'blame', 'disaster', 'kerala', 'rainfall', 'region', 'lowpressure', 'western']",news_article,Flood,India,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-behind-the-kerala-monsoon-fury/story-2NxvHfTDAmS10k9hHofiiO.html,"Kerala is among the states that receive the highest monsoon rainfall, but sustained low-pressure conditions over India’s western coast this year have caused the flooding in the state, India Meteorological Department officials said. Different studies, however, have found that climate change and deforestation were the main causes of an increase in rainfall.

Environmental scientist Dr VS Vijayan, a member of the expert panel on the Western Ghats, said Kerala was going through a man-made disaster. He said the impact should have been limited if the Gadgil committee report, aimed at protecting ecologically-fragile mountain ranges, was implemented.

He attributed the floods to human incursions and unscientific developmental activities in ecologically-sensitive areas.

“This was waiting to happen. Insensible use of land, soil and rocks led to this deluge. Landslips and flash floods happened in areas that witnessed widespread human incursions. I hope everyone will learn a lesson from this. Due to climate change, such tragedies are bound to increase. Nobody can stop rains or control floods. But we can take measures to lower the intensity of such impacts,” he said.

A 2014 Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology study based on rainfall data since 1900 had said that intensity of the monsoon rains was increasing and one of the factors for it was global warming. Another 2017 IIT Bombay study held deforestation mainly responsible for the phenomenon.

In 2010, the Centre set up an expert panel under Gadgil following widespread concern that the Western Ghats, which plays a key role in breaking rain clouds over the subcontinent, was shrinking due to human incursions.

When all six states falling under the Ghat region (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat) opposed the recommendations , another committee was constituted under former ISRO chief Kasturirangan.

Kasturirangan had made some changes in the zonal classification and reduced ecologically sensitive areas to 37% from 64%. But still many states opposed it saying people living in the fringe areas of Ghats will be thrown out of their habitat if the report was implemented.

IMD’s senior scientist Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said the lowpressure situation of different levels was persisting over the Kerala-Karnataka coast for the last fortnight. “The low pressure in the Arabian Sea attracts the southwesterly winds from the high-pressure Bay of Bengal, gets concentrated over the region due to high moisture in the air and causes rain once it hits the Western Ghats,” he said.

Mohapatra said the two major low-pressure situations happened on August 7 and 13, causing heavy downpour in the region, apart from several other small similar situations since July last week. The region -- Kerala, coastal Karnataka and KonkanGoa -- has received 7,158 mm of rainfall, which was about 46% of the total rainfall received in rest of India during this monsoon .

The IMD on Thursday said a low pressure system persisted off the Kerala coast over the Lakshadweep Islands, causing an eddying of the water vapour currents at different levels of the atmosphere leading to precipitation. More rain is predicted in the coming days.

An Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay, study in May 2018 showed that evapotranspiration from the vegetation over the Western Ghats accounts for half of the total rainfall in southern peninsular India during monsoon months. “The years there is less moisture in the Western Ghats, the region sees deficient rainfall,” the study said.",English
5,5,India to give flash flood warning to Asian nations - The Hindu,"Sat, 28 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['india', 'flood', 'dr', 'nations', 'model', 'warning', 'asian', 'flash', 'levels', 'water', 'warn', 'system', 'floods', 'rajeevan']",news_article,Flood,India,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-give-flash-flood-warning-to-asian-nations/article24535525.ece,"Test version is being tried out by the Meteorological Dept.

India has been designated as a nodal centre for preparing flash-flood forecasts by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

That means India will have to develop a customised model that can issue advance warning of floods in Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand, according to Dr. Madhavan Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences.

On the sidelines of the Earth Sciences Foundation Day, Dr. Rajeevan said the IMD would be working to customise a weather model, developed by the United States and donated to the WMO, to warn of flash floods at least six hours in advance.

Six hours before

A test version of this, according to Dr. Rajeevan, was being tried out by the IMD, and that was able to give a flood warning about an hour in advance. Using a combination of satellite mapping and ground-based observation, this system — called the Flash Flood Guidance System — aims to provide forecasts six hours in advance.

Like India, several southeast Asian countries depend on the monsoon and are prone to its vagaries. The proposed model would provide forecasts by computing the likelihood of rainfall and the soil moisture levels to warn of possible floods, he said. Though Pakistan was among the list of countries that would benefit from the forecast, it had refused to participate in the scheme, Dr. Rajeevan added.

While the science to warn of floods could be developed, India was yet to work out how exactly it would warn countries of potential inundation. India currently has a warning system for tsunamis that also doubles up a warning system for several Asian countries.

The Central Water Commission, which monitors India’s dams, warns of rising water levels in the reservoirs, which are usually taken to be signs of imminent floods. The organisation has recently tied up with Google to develop a software application to visualise rising water levels during heavy rains.

The WMO says flash floods account for 85% of flooding incidents across the world, causing some 5,000 deaths each year.",English
6,6,New flash-flood warning system in India could be life-saving - Mongabay.com,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['india', 'rains', 'lifesaving', 'warning', 'ffgs', 'flash', 'flashflood', 'state', 'soil', 'system', 'rainfall', 'ladakh', 'floods']",news_article,Flood,India,https://news.mongabay.com/2018/07/new-flash-flood-warning-system-in-india-could-be-life-saving/,"To improve preparedness for flash floods, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is working on a guidance system that will predict the possibility of flash floods up to six hours in advance and alert disaster relief forces as well as residents.

The Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) will use existing satellites and on-ground equipment to track real-time rainfall in any part of the country.

Since the soil’s ability to absorb rainwater influences the probability of flash floods, the early-warning system will use data like soil moisture, temperature, saturation, and the topography of the land, to assess the likelihood of flash floods ahead of time.

With each bout of persistent and intense rainfall in Ladakh, a cold desert region in India’s northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, the locals begin to worry. It brings back images of the 2010 flash floods that damaged more than 70 towns and villages, and affected thousands of people in the area. This year, several low-lying areas in Ladakh were inundated following heavy rains, triggering rescue operations by the local administration.

To improve preparedness for flash floods, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is working on a Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) that will predict the possibility of flash floods up to six hours in advance and alert disaster relief forces as well as residents.

Given how flash floods can inundate vast areas within a few hours, compared to general floods that take days or even weeks to develop, the FFGS could be a significant tool in disaster risk reduction by providing early warning to both residents of the affected areas and to relief teams preparing for the oncoming deluge.

India among top disaster-prone countries

According to the World Meteorological Organization, flash floods account for 85 percent of flooding cases across the world, resulting in the loss of lives of some 5,000 people each year.

The IMD’s upcoming system is of significance, especially for India, where nearly 12 percent of the landmass is prone to floods and river erosion. India is among the 10 most disaster-prone countries in the world, according to a report by the government of India and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Just this year, several people have died in India since the arrival of the southwest monsoon, which accounts for the majority of the country’s annual rainfall.

Floods in the northeastern states of Assam, Tripura and Manipur, for example, have claimed 23 lives and displaced nearly a million people from their homes, according to local media. In the southern state of Kerala, 54 people have died since the onset of the monsoon on May 29, three days earlier than expected.

According to the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, 107,487 people and 6.02 million cattle have died in floods and heavy rains across India during the period from 1953 to 2017.

Since 2017, cyclonic storms, heavy rains, floods and landslides resulted in the deaths of 2,231 people and 50,638 head of cattle. They also led to damage to more than 1.19 million houses and 38,500 square kilometers (14,900 square miles) of crop area.

Technology to save lives

The IMD’s Flash Flood Guidance System will use existing satellites and on-ground equipment to track real-time rainfall in any part of the country. Since the soil’s ability to absorb rainwater influences the probability of flash floods, the early-warning system will use data like soil moisture, soil temperature, levels of soil saturation, and the topography of the land, to predict flash floods up to six hours in advance.

“Some moisture is retained by the soil [when it rains],” K.J. Ramesh, the IMD’s director general, told Mongabay-India. “Once the soil gets saturated, the runoff — outflow from the soil — starts. Until then, whatever rain has come will be absorbed by the soil. Local hydrology will be computed on daily basis [under the new system]. We are trying to subdivide the whole of India into about 27,000 to 28,000 micro watersheds, each about 50 to 70 square kilometers in size. At that scale, the soil hydrology model will be run on a daily basis by which you can clearly assess the runoff potential of the soil of an area.”

Ramesh said that with the FFGS, they would be able to ascertain how temperature, soil and rainfall were interacting and “when incremental runoff starts” from the soil. Whether the runoff will lead to flash floods is something that the intensity of rainfall will determine.

“But it will give some guidance that there is an evolving scenario towards possible flooding … and then authorities have to take action,” he said.

In states like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where the soil is more absorbent, even 100 to 200 millimeters (4 to 8 inches) of rainfall may not cause floods. But circumstances differ for other terrains. In regions like Ladakh, where the terrain consists mostly of loose soil, flash floods can occur with less rainfall.

“Combined sloped terrain, raging waters from the river and torrential rain can easily run off and cause flash floods,” Sonam Lotus, director of the meteorological department in Jammu and Kashmir, told Mongabay-India.

Ramesh said the FFGS was being tested and, once completed, would be operational across the country.

“The system will allow the state and central administration to prepare and reach the affected area for evacuation and rescue,” B.P. Yadav, a senior scientist and deputy director at the IMD. “Our staff is undergoing training to understand the system better. We plan to use it in full scale by next year.”

Relief in sight

In August 2010, Ladakh experienced one of the worst natural disasters in its history. The desert district received 350 millimeters (13.8 inches) of rain in just two days — three and a half times its annual average. As per reports, 234 people died and more than 800 went missing due to the floods.

In September 2014, Kashmir saw one of its worst natural disasters in 50 years. Torrential rains from the southwest monsoon had gathered pace, causing the Chenab and Jhelum rivers to breach their embankments. Over the following days, nearly 2,600 villages in the state were affected, 390 of them completely submerged. Some 280 people died and half a million people were trapped in their homes for nearly three weeks, with the city of Srinagar drowning under nearly 5.5 meters (18 feet) of water.

“Our relationship with nature changed after that. We do not look at rains the same way after these floods,” said Moses Kunzang, additional deputy commissioner for the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC).

Lotus, from the IMD, said the FFGS was a significant step ahead in technology and the forecasting prowess of the meteorological agency.

“The FFGS is really required for a district like Ladakh,” he said. “IMD, at the moment, forecasts on rainfall. Based on local knowledge of geographical parameters, we can somewhat predict floods. But the new system makes it all the more accurate. The 2010 floods were beyond anyone’s imagination. No one thought Ladakh would experience something like this. But the next time it happens, we will be better prepared.”

While flash floods are fairly recent in Ladakh, in places like Bihar, India’s most flood-prone state, about 76 percent of the population in the north of the state lives under the threat of flood devastation, according to Bihar’s Water Resources Department.

More than 73 percent of the state, or about 68,800 square kilometers (26,600 square miles), is flood affected. Bihar faced major floods in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Last year, flooding killed 514 people there and affected 3 million families.

Using conventional methods to predict flash floods is extremely difficult, not just in Bihar but across the country, according to scientists. However, a system like the FFGS can herald a new era.

“We do not have rain gauges or flood forecasting stations in remote areas as they are not logistically possible to maintain. Besides, rains are not the only factor that can cause flash floods,” said IMD scientist Yadav.

Cyclones can also cause flash floods during the northeast monsoon in southeast coastal regions of the country, while the southwest monsoon can wreak havoc in other regions.

“The pilot phase is showing good results,” Yadav said of the FFGS. “We were able to accurately predict the floods in Mangalore this year. If things go well, we can roll out the system for the next year’s monsoon.”

As many as 52 people lost their lives in Gujarat, 45 in Assam and eight in Nagaland.A total of 27 people were also missing in Kerala (22) and West Bengal (5), while 245 others received injuries in rain-related incidents in the states.The deluge and rains have hit 26 districts in Maharashtra, 23 in Assam, 22 in West Bengal, 14 in Kerala, 12 in Uttar Pradesh, 11 Nagaland and 10 in Gujarat.In Assam, 11.45 lakh people have borne the brunt of the rains and floods, which also hit crops in 27,552 hectres of land.Altogether 15 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are engaged in rescue and relief operations in Assam, the NERC said.A team of the NDRF comprises 45 personnel.Eight NDRF teams were deployed in Uttar Pradesh, eight in West Bengal, seven in Gujarat, four each in Kerala and Maharashtra and one in Nagaland.The MeT department has issued alerts for 16 states, including Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.The situation remained grave in Kerala even as the rains relented on Sunday. As per the latest report, the water level in the Idukki dam, recorded at 5 am today, was 2397.94 feet. (The Full Reservoir Level of the dam is 2403 feet.)So far at least 39 people have been killed and thousands of people have been accommodated in relief camps set up in different areas.The weather department has issued a 'Red alert', asking people to be cautious as there was a possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall in most places in Idukki, Wayanad, Kannur, Ernakulam, Palakkad and Malappuram districts.Rajnath Singh told the media that the state has witnessed the worst ever situation since 1924 and there has been all round damage caused to crops, homes, properties besides tourism activities and the lives of one lakh people have been affected.The minister said that considering the grave situation, ""I have made an immediate release of Rs 100 crore"" and a new central team would be sent soon for the assessment of the damages. Singh also met a delegation of the Congress-led opposition besides leaders from his party also.Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had on Sunday submitted a memorandum to the visiting Union home minister Rajnath Singh seeking Rs 8,316 crore as a special package for dealing with the situation.After heavy overnight rains, most of the roads in the interiors of Himachal Pradesh remained closed to traffic on Monday, stranding hundreds of travellers and commuters.Reports said five persons were buried under a landslide in Kandaghat area in Solan district. One of them reportedly died as rescue work was still on at the time of writing this report.An official said the road network in the higher reaches of Kinnaur, Shimla, Chamba, Mandi, Kullu and Sirmaur districts was the worst affected and efforts were being made to reopen it.The Chandigarh-Manali National Highway-21 has been closed for vehicles near Mandi town. Likewise, the Chandigarh-Shimla National Highway-5 was hampered near Jabli town in Solan district.As a precautionary measure, all schools and educational institutes in Shimla and Mandi district have been closed for the day.According to the MeT office here, moderate to heavy showers have occurred in most parts of the state since Sunday.The weather office has forecast heavy rains across the state till Tuesday.The Badrinath National Highway in Uttarakhand is also closed since last night at Lambgarh after heavy rains brought down debris onto the road. The road clearing operation by the local administration is underway.As per the forecast, the state will experience heavy to very heavy rainfall in its various districts in the coming few days.With the Cauvery in spate following heavy discharge from Mettur dam, the Tamil Nadu government on Monday said district administrations concerned were taking all safety measures in the wake of the alert issued by CWC.Official sources said heavy inflow of 1.34 lakh cusecs from two Karnataka reservoirs resulted in Mettur dam crossing its full level of 120 feet this morning.A flood alert has been issued to Salem, Erode, Namakkal, Karur Tiruchi, Thanjavore, Pudukkottai, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Thiruvarur, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam.Evacuation of people from low-lying areas among other steps are being taken up by respective district officials, the minister said adding that revenue, disaster management and district officials are on high alert.",English

According to experts, the disaster’s impacts were exacerbated by unabated illegal construction on river floodplains and the government’s relentless pursuit of hydropower projects.

Five years since the floods, the state is continuing to push for hydropower projects, which has residents and experts worried.

Mongabay-India staff writer Mayank Aggarwal and video editor Kartik Chandramouli traveled to Uttarakhand to see how the state has dealt with the disaster’s aftermath.

UTTARAKHAND, India — H.P. Upreti, an ex-serviceman, vividly recalls the day, five years ago, when one of the worst natural disasters struck his hometown of Srinagar in India’s Uttarakhand state.

“The water came rushing in. It was everywhere. It’s a scene I will never forget,” he said.

Srinagar was one of the worst-hit areas during the devastating June 2013 floods. Low-lying areas of the town, such as Shakti Vihar where Upreti lives, were inundated, and houses were filled with debris from construction projects, rocks, boulders and soil — muck deposited by overflowing rivers.

“Nearly the whole colony was underwater,” Upreti told Mongabay-India. “The whole area was filled with muck brought in by floods. All houses were filled with muck and in some cases, the water had completely covered the ground floor of the house. I suffered heavy damage and everything was destroyed.”

Upreti said he only received the equivalent of $1,460 in compensation — “and that too after a lot of haggling.” He said he didn’t want to move from the area, so since 2013 he spent more than $20,000 restoring his house. He is now fighting a case for more compensation.

More than 1,800 days have passed since the floods that brought widespread tragedy to Uttarakhand. But its scars remain fresh.

The disaster that shook the hill state

The rain-driven flooding in Uttarakhand, already a highly vulnerable state, was one of the biggest natural disasters in independent India’s history. An estimated 6,000 people were killed, went missing or were presumed dead. More than 4,000 villages were affected, 9,200 head of cattle and other livestock were lost, and 3,320 houses were completely damaged during the floods.

Of the 13 districts in the state, five — Bageshwar, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi — were the worst hit, according to a report by the New Delhi-based National Institute of Disaster Management. The disaster coincided with the peak tourist and pilgrimage season in the state, which contributed to the high number of casualties and damage.

Since then, extensive relief and rehabilitation work has been carried out across the state, but the scars of the tragedy are hard to get past.

H.P. Upreti suffered heavy losses due to floods and continues to fight the government for compensation.

Experts from both private and government-funded institutions unequivocally agree that the magnitude of the disaster caused by the June 2013 floods was increased manifold by the unabated illegal construction on river floodplains and the government’s relentless pursuit of hydropower projects.

Currently, the state plans to develop hundreds of these projects, as it seeks to harness up to 27 gigawatts of power.",English
10,10,Responding to India's Worst Flooding in a Century - India - ReliefWeb,"Sun, 26 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['worst', 'india', 'dr', 'angels', 'rev', 'indias', 'flooding', 'century', 'water', 'help', 'kerala', 'responding', 'relief', 'tomi', 'lost']",news_article,Flood,India,https://reliefweb.int/report/india/responding-india-s-worst-flooding-century,"One million people displaced, entire families missing, 400 confirmed deaths

Kerala, India – often referred to as God’s Own Country – a place known for its tranquil beauty and picturesque beaches, sits in ruins after a series of severe downpours has left the state under water.

A region that anticipates monsoon season every year from June to September, Kerala has found itself in a state of disaster with one million people displaced and a death toll that now surpasses four hundred, though many think the number is likely to be much higher.

“People were caught unaware. No one expected this could happen. No one. And then, for many, it was just too late.” – Rev. Dr. Tomi

The flooding that began in late July became deadly following an unforgiving monsoon that swept through the region on August 8. Buildings, bridges, homes, and people have been swept away. Cars, crops, and livestock have been submerged in what is being called the worst flooding India has experienced in nearly a century.

It is estimated that this year’s monsoon season has brought 40 percent more rainfall than normal leaving all 44 of Kerala’s rivers flooded and requiring all 39 dams to be opened.

In addition to the flooding, Kerala has also experienced a series of landslides that led to the disappearance of countless people. Hundreds are missing and hospitals are teeming with the injured, sick, and stranded. Many churches and schools have become shelters to those who had to evacuate their homes. Many people whose homes were not affected by the floods opened their doors to offer a place to neighbors and strangers – to those who lost everything.

“Communities are built on wants not in affluence.” – Rev. Dr. Tomi

Rescue efforts continue as an estimated 10,000 people remain stranded without food or water. Over one million people have taken shelter in the 4,000 relief camps spread across Kerala. Although waters have begun to recede, residents and relief workers are standing by, as more rainfall is predicted across the region through Monday. One of the major concerns now is the risk of waterborne illnesses.

Testimonies From Victims of the Flood

“My relatives stayed in the house. They didn’t understand the severity of the situation. As the water levels rose, they didn’t know what to do. By the time help arrived, they were dead.” —Krishna, Kerala resident

“My entire family, my parents, brother, sister-in-law, and their two children under six years of age, have suffered a crippling loss. They are all displaced by the floods in Kerala. They are currently in a relief camp. My parents are ill, suffering from hypertension and diabetes. The only breadwinner is my brother, Jose, who is a painter. The two-bedroom house is completely submerged in water. Jose said his family of six has no home, and no hope of returning to normalcy, as they had so little from the outset.” —Sister Viji, originally from Kerala, currently located in Springfield, Illinois.

Vincent who lost his business due to the floods in Kerala, India“My business was critically damaged – it is completely submerged in water. I am heartbroken. I recently borrowed a significant amount of money from the bank to help rebuild my business, and now it is all gone. I don’t know that I will ever recover.” —Vincent, business man from Vadasherrykara of Pathanamthitta District.

Chitanya lost her mother and father in the floods of Kerala, India“I lost my house. My parents lost their house. My brother and my sister both lost their houses. Everything is gone. We relied on agriculture and the land is all under water and so too is our livelihood. Who can we turn to for help? —Chaitanya, Kerala resident

Partnering for Relief

CMMB is partnering with Reverend Dr. Tomi and his organization Healing Hands for India to respond to the crisis. They are actively involved in relief efforts on the ground, helping to provide people with shelter, food, water, and medical care. But they need our support.

“These people are resilient. They are fighters. The young are out on the front line of the rescue and relief efforts. They are coming together to take care of each other. Like the local fisherman, who rescued over 85,000 people who were stranded using their fishing boats. This is what community looks like.” – Rev. Dr. Tomi

Rev. Dr. Tomi also quoted a saying he said he’d learned during his studies, “Communities are built in wants not affluence.” He continued, “communities grow when people need each other. In India, communities matter. This is a saving grace for the people because you never feel totally alone.”

Recovery

For most, returning home is not an option, as their houses are submerged in water. The road to recovery is a long one. While news about the flooding fades from the media, the people of Kerala face some of the biggest challenges of their lives.

It is important to know that India has refused to accept any aid from foreign governments, based on a policy of self-reliance that followed the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This means that non-government organizations and private donors are critical for rescue and relief efforts.

Rev. Dr. Tomi talked about one man, who upon returning home and seeing the level of devastation, took his own life. “For some, the thought of trying to rebuild a life is just too much. Our help has never been more needed.” He also spoke of the children – about their vulnerability. “We don’t often think about children’s emotional state during an emergency or crisis. Most schools in the area are closed – many destroyed. They have lost so many childhood treasures.”

Recently, Shashi Taroor, the former Under Secretary General for communication at the UN responded to various social media comments with the following:

“This is my answer. Angels are everywhere. Some are in the form of school children breaking open their piggy banks to buy supplies for the relief camps. Some of them are fishermen bringing their boats to haul strangers from flooded bungalows while their own children might be starving. Some angels from the KSEB wear yellow helmets and can be found high up in electrical posts repairing connections in torrential downpour. Some angels speak a different language and are in a different place gathering supplies for a state they’ve never visited. Some of them wear uniforms – of the police, fire force, armed forces or white coats of doctors and nurses. Some are Bihari/Bengali/UP migrant street vendors you wouldn’t give a second glance, who donate their entire stock of bed sheets and blankets to relief camps. Some angels are Government officials who have not gone home in days. Some angels are manning laptops in different corners of the world coordinating search and rescue without taking a break. In Kerala these days, you meet angels without wings everywhere….digging into their own pockets to buy food, water, bed sheets and toiletries for their brothers and sisters. I tell you, in Kerala, angels are everywhere.”

We are dedicated to join Rev. Dr. Tomi, his team, and all the angels to help children and families start to rebuild their lives. But, we can’t do it alone.

In the month of August (1-20), the state received 771 mm of rainfall, 179 per cent more than usual. The incessant rain meant that 78 of the state's 80 dams, including the ones at Mullaperiyar and Idukki on the Western Ghats, were filled to the brim and hence forced to open their sluice gates. This sudden onrush of water led to the flooding of Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Thrissur districts downstream. Kerala is India's most densely populated state with an average of 860 persons per square kilometre (the national average is 450.42 persons). Over 40,000 hectares of farmland was submerged and 26,000 houses severely damaged and one of the state's three international airports at Kochi inundated by floodwaters. It's the first time in the history of the state that its highland, cities and lower plains were all hit by floods.

For 10 days, the state witnessed a heroic rescue operation. The air force, navy and coast guard pilots flew their helicopters in perilous conditions to rescue survivors while on the ground nearly 5,000 fishermen joined in with over 450 boats. Now, as the water recedes from flood-affected regions, rail and road traffic limps back to normal and flights operate from the Kochi naval airbase, the state gets down to the difficult task of reconstruction. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan estimates it will take over Rs 20,000 crore to nurse Kerala back to normalcy. This is more than half the state's entire Rs 37,248 crore plan outlay for this year and twice what it spends each year on roads and bridges.

""It (flood relief) will adversely affect the state's development plan,"" Vijayan admits. Government officials predict a two-year period for the state to recover from the catastrophe. Every sector of its economy -- tourism, health, water resources, roads, agriculture, traditional industries, power transmission -- has been hit. So much so that the impact of other recent scares like Cyclone Okchi last November (which killed 174 people) and the Nipah virus outbreak (it took 17 lives) seem like pinpricks. The only other catastrophe of such magnitude in living memory was in 1924 when the Periyar river breached its banks, inundating several districts and leaving over 1,000 people dead.

Operation Clean-Up

Among the health department's first priorities as the waters receded and people started to return to their homes was to direct hospitals to stock up on anti-venom. Health advisories asking people to beware of snakes -- fleeing, like people, to higher ground -- abounded on social media. Angamaly, a suburb north of Kochi, alone reported 50 snake bite cases on a single day, August 20. Meanwhile, the immediate task before state agencies is to scoop up the thousands of tonnes of garbage and mud brought in by the floodwaters and deposited on roads, bridge and public places. Thousands of volunteers and cleaning staff of local self-government bodies headed by local health inspectors have started the clean-up. ""We are now going to focus on cleaning operations and waste management. We need manpower for cleaning operations across the state. I appeal to everyone to join the operations,"" Vijayan told India Today. The first priority, he says, is to ensure safe drinking water and medical care for the victims. The health department's top concern is to prevent any outbreak of communicable diseases, such as typhoid, dysentery or hepatitis, usually associated with floods. The department has already opened special medical assistance control rooms in flood-affected areas and relief camps.

""Every sector of the state has been ruined. It will take a minimum of two years to recover from this,"" says Dr B. Ikbal, State Planning Board member and an expert on public health. Around 3,000 volunteers have joined cleaning operations in Chengannur, one of the worst-affected areas in Alappuzha district. Similar operations are going on in Chalakudy and Aluva in central Kerala. Providing safe drinking water will be a big challenge as the wells, ponds and pumping stations will all have to be cleaned and serviced. Most people living on the riverbanks depended on wells -- which in all likelihood have been contaminated -- for their drinking water. The government has advised local self-governments to use all available resources for testing and auditing of water resources. Hundreds of tonnes of bleaching powder will be needed to sterilise the inundated areas.

Housing and Infrastructure

With thousands of kilometres of broken roads, damaged bridges and submerged transformers, repairing the state's shattered infrastructure will be another enormous task. Nearly three-fourths of the Rs 20,000 crore projected by the state will go towards repairing over 97,000 kilometres of flood-damaged roads. The Kerala State Electricity Board says it has been able to restore electricity supply to around 2.6 million houses across the state. Only a few parts of Kuttanad, Kumarakom and Aluva taluks in central Kerala remain without electricity.

Economists and strategic planners warn of tough times ahead. Kerala utilises 78 per cent of its revenues to pay salaries and pensions. It has little to spare for the reconstruction budget which explains the state's request for financial assistance from the Centre and why it is mulling resource mobilisation drives like a 10 per cent cess on GST and a special lottery. In the immediate future, the colossal damage to roads, power transmission lines and personal belongings will further destabilise the state.

Before the calamity, the Pinarayi government had prioritised widening of the national highways in the state and initiated land acquisitions of 690 hectares to build coastal highways connecting 11 districts and 'hillways' connecting nine districts. These projects are likely to suffer a setback now. The government has been investing in two key sectors -- developing infrastructure in public education and hospitals in a phased manner, and has spent Rs 680 crore on public education and Rs 900 crore on the health sector annually. Fund allocations to these sectors may be reduced now. Even the ambitious plan to build 450,000 houses for the poor could be affected.

""The government was planning mega investments in infrastructure and trying to source funds through non-conventional modes like the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board. Now the entire attention has to be turned to rehabilitation and rebuilding of flood-affected regions. For a state like Kerala with limited resources, this task will affect development projects,"" says S.M. Vijayanand, former state chief secretary.

Just fixing the 26,000-plus seriously damaged houses in 11 districts will cost the government over Rs 2,000 crore. The top priority, as chief secretary Tom Jose says, is to provide relief to the victims displaced in the flood. ""We have set up a high-level committee to monitor and support the rehabilitation process.""

An agrarian crisis

The floods have wreaked havoc in what was a leading agrarian state, the largest producer of several cash crops -- rubber, pepper, cardamom, cinnamon and cloves. ""It's as if Kerala has become impoverished overnight,"" says state planning board member Dr K.N. Harilal. ""The floods may have damaged the rural economy to such an extent that it may lead to an agrarian crisis."" This is because the worst affected are the poor and agricultural labourers who have lost their livelihood and belongings. Around 12,000 hectares of paddy fields belonging to marginal farmers have been submerged. Crops in over 40,000 hectares of land, covering a little over 3 per cent of the state's entire arable area, have been lost. Over 46,000 milch animals have been killed. Farm workers have lost more than 40 labour man-days between July and August.

The State Level Bankers' Committee has declared a moratorium for a year on agricultural loans and restructured loans for five years. The government has also announced compensation for crop losses. ""Wayanad and Idukki, the worst hit in the floods, were facing a crisis due to fall in price of spices. Now the floods have completely uprooted the farm sector. It may take three or more years to tide over the losses,"" says George J. Mathew, a planter in Kanjirappally, Kottayam district.

Last year, Kerala earned Rs 33,383.68 crore from the close to one million tourists. This was 10 per cent more than the previous year. But this year, tourist magnets like Thekkady, Munnar and Cheruthoni in the state's hilly Idukki district were marooned and are now covered in the red soil that washed down from the mountains. Munnar attracts around 60,000 foreign and half a million domestic tourists during the Onam festival. But this year will be bleak. ""Munnar is in shock. There are no tourists and most resorts are empty,"" says Prasad Jacob, a local businessman.

Kuttanad and Kumarakom, hubs of the booming houseboat industry, are still under water. The state's chambers of commerce and merchant's associations are yet to estimate the loss, but initial assessments put it at thousands of crores. Traders who stocked large quantities of foodgrains and essential commodities in view of the Onam mega sales ended up with flooded godowns.

Chief minister Vijayan, though, seems confident. ""It is the responsibility of the state now. We have to rebuild Kerala with a new vision and support the victims,"" he says. Around two million migrant labourers were employed as daily wagers in small scale industries like plywood, quarries and brick kilns. Settled in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, they have been the worst hit in the floods. Most have lost their livelihoods and savings and see no way but to return to their native states.

A Hydrological solution

Man-made factors worsened Kerala's Black August. Dam operators did not release water gradually when the reservoirs were filling up but when they had no other option. The sudden onrush of waters in the rivers only worsened the situation in an already flooded state. The Kerala State Disaster Management Plan 2016 had warned that over 14 per cent of the state, or 6,789 sq. km, is prone to flooding and the 'frequency and magnitude of floods seems to be on the rise. The factors contributing to it are reclamation of wetlands and water bodies, increase in impermeable built-up area, increase in roads with impervious surfaces and deforestation in the upper catchments'.

AGAINST ALL ODDS: Stranded residents get drinking water in Chengannur, Alappuzha district. (Photo: Aijaz Rahi/AP)

The risk of heavy flooding was deepened by poor land, river and forest management about which the Madhav Gadgil and K. Kasturirangan reports on the Western Ghats had forewarned. Ignoring their recommendations, successive state governments permitted mining, quarrying and heavy constructions along what were once verdant hill slopes, and encouraged rampant urbanisation. Deforestation and change in land use patterns too have aggravated the flooding. Idukki and Wayanad districts, reckoned as highly forested, have lost forest cover between 2011 and 2017 -- from 3,930 sq. km to 3,139 sq. km in Idukki (down by 20.13 percentage points) and 1,775 sq. km to 1,580 sq. km in Wayanad (a drop of 11 percentage points), heightening the risk of flash floods.

Forecasts of high-speed winds causing rains were not taken seriously. The indifference to the ecology and flood zoning of the state over the decades to protect the tailend slopes of the Western Ghats, the wrangle between Tamil Nadu and Kerala over releasing water from the Mullaperiyar dam in Kerala (which Tamil Nadu controls) and lack of a disaster management strategy added to the catastrophe.

A more judicious release and use of impounded water in the dams could have ensured a balanced flow from the start of the monsoon season. At the Idukki hydroelectric power station, more power could have been generated when so much water was available. Instead it has added to the misery. One of the six 130 MW units is shut since August 1, 2017, for modernisation, and another 130 MW unit remains shut since June 26 this year for annual maintenance, when this could well have been done earlier in the dry season.

Successive state governments are to blame for the lack of preparedness despite being warned of such an eventuality. ""Vulnerability has risen sharply. Apart from gushing flood waters wreaking havoc, the water stagnating for long periods of time and showing no signs of receding quickly deepened the devastation,"" an official involved in disaster management said on condition of anonymity.

The National Crisis Management Committee has deputed personnel in larger numbers this year than following any natural disaster. The state government had no mechanism in place to predict the floods, nor did it ask for any forecasts from the Central Water Commission (CWC). The CWC, an attached office of the Union ministry for water resources, monitors the levels of all interstate water bodies in the country for flood control, irrigation, navigation, drinking water supply and water power development. The CWC has no water level forecasting sites in Kerala, only flood monitoring sites.

Even as rescue operations were under way in the state, a resident of Idukki approached the Supreme Court to issue directions on water management at Mullaperiyar to prevent the flood situation from worsening. If Kerala is to prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy, it needs to work on a war footing. It needs to put in place flood forecasting stations as well as an effective disaster management strategy. It needs to ensure that the real estate and infrastructure booms in the state do not come at the cost of disregard for urban planning guidelines. Gods Own Country could do with a lot more human intervention in disaster mitigation.",English

After more than two weeks of relentless rain, Kerala, a state at the southern tip of India, known internationally for its scenic green landscapes, touristic spots, and backwaters, is left with over 1 million people in relief camps, and close to 400 reported dead—the number is expected to be much higher as many areas remain inaccessible.

In the mountainous Coorg or Kodagu district in the neighbouring state of Karnataka, thousands of people have been marooned because of torrential rains. Exacerbated by landslides in hilly terrain, flooding has led to the destruction of homes, bridges, road networks, and industries.

Far from being a surprise, the possibility of such devastation was highlighted several years ago.

The need to change our development approach

In 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, chaired by the internationally renowned ecologist Madhav Gadgil, submitted a report to the Indian ministry of environment and forests. The report warned that an ill-thought focus on development was impacting the sustainability of the Western Ghats hill chain, one of the world’s most biodiverse areas that runs along the west coast of India. The expert report urged a number of states, including Karnataka and Kerala, to adopt an approach of thoughtful conservation, limiting activities such as quarrying, dams, and construction near protected forests in hilly areas. The report was rejected by the Ministry as well as by both states.

With the experience of hindsight, it is clear that the worst flood damage took place in those regions where the Gadgil committee recommended protection.

In Kodagu, for instance, tens to hundreds of thousands of large trees were felled in 2015 to construct a high-tension electric wire line. Uncontrolled sand mining has constrained river flows, while the rapid spread of high-rise buildings on unstable hill slopes has weakened the soil. This unplanned development has left the area susceptible to flash floods and landslides, caused by a combination of tree-felling on steep hillslopes and heavy rainfall.

Airports built on water bodies

The flooding of the Kochi airport is another example of poor planning leading to disastrous outcomes. The airport was built on the paddy fields and wetlands adjacent to the Periyar river, and extends up to the banks of the river on one side.

The longest river in Kerala, it has a number of dams—some of which had to be opened to release water during the rains. The airport was badly hit, with estimated economic costs of at least Rs500 crore ($71.4 million) because of its forced closure for several days.

The Periyar river is not the only one that has been dammed. The state of Kerala has 44 rivers with a total of 61 dams. Many had to be opened across Kerala as they were dangerously full—a step that, while essential during a time of emergency, contributed to the heavy flooding. A 2017 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India warned that not a single one of these dams had an emergency action plan in place for disaster management. Pre- and post-monsoon safety inspections had not been carried out for any of these dams either.

Given how likely it is that coastal and riverine cities will experience flooding in coming years, you would think we know better than to build airports near bodies of water. Yet Kochi airport is not an exception. The runways of the Mumbai airport have been built over the Mithi river, and the airport is located on a reclaimed pond. One of the runways of the Chennai airport extends over the Adyar river, affecting its long-term safety and stability.

It is no surprise that these airports, which are among the busiest in India, frequently flood when the rains are heavy—leading to large-scale economic losses. Yet the new Navi Mumbai airport is coming up in an equally unsuitable location on coastal wetlands.

Reversing the trend

In the era of climate change we have just entered, extreme rainfall events are going to become increasingly common. Uncontrolled growth at the expense of the environment will severely exacerbate the impacts of climate change. Our cities are simply not prepared for extreme weather events. The recent collapse of a bridge in Genoa, killing at least 43 people, is linked to poor maintenance, but also to heavy rainfall.

Certain types of infrastructure may be less suitable to some contexts in a changing climate scenario. Wildfires in California cause extensive damage to private property because many cities are extending their boundaries into forest areas. As local climate becomes hotter and drier, with fires becoming more likely, new homes are being built in areas that are highly susceptible to fire instead of less exposed locations.

Some cities are seeking to reverse this trajectory of unplanned construction. Nairobi is in the midst of an extensive demolition drive, uprooting thousands of buildings built on riparian land that choke the flow of water and contribute to severe annual floods.

In Seoul, between 2002-2005, the city municipality tore up an elevated highway that had been built over the Cheonggyecheon stream. This internationally famous urban-renewal project reduced traffic, reduced air pollution and cut the urban heat-island effect. In Yonkers, New York, an ongoing project aims to restore the buried Saw Mill river.

Similar urban river daylighting projects are gaining traction in cities around the world. Zurich has been an early pioneer, developing the Bachkonzept (stream concept) to create, restore and uncover a number of streams and springs. London, which built over a number of famous rivers, has now uncovered and restored a number of these waterways, while Sheffield, having experimented with daylighting, is now considering uncovering sections of the local Sheaf river.

The demonstrated ecological and environmental benefits are clear—as are the social and economic returns. For example, Seoul’s iconic Cheonggyecheon stream restoration led to a more than six-fold increase in biodiversity, a 35% decrease in air pollution, and a growth in property prices that is double of that in other parts of the city.

The restored stream attracts tens of thousands of visitors daily who contribute significantly to local economy. Such ideas of restoration need to become more widespread, and embedded in routine climate change and disaster management planning. The investment made is amply repaid many times over in economic security and growth, biodiversity, local health and quality of life, and resilience against future disasters.

Once the emergency relief is attended to, Kochi and Kodagu would do well to use their recent experience as a warning of future disasters to come in a world of increasingly uncertain climate.



The focus must be on long-term restoration projects that can reverse some of the environmental and ecological damage that has led to the current situation. But such learning need not be confined to the areas that have experienced the worst. The rest of the world has much to learn as well.

13,13,What caused the Kerala floods? Could we have done anything to prevent it? - Firstpost,"Sun, 19 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['rains', 'prevent', 'firstpost', 'technology', 'states', 'report', 'state', 'water', 'caused', 'weather', 'kerala', 'rainfall', 'climate', 'floods']",news_article,Flood,India,https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/what-caused-the-kerala-floods-4993041.html,"Kavya Narayanan

Rains.

Lots of rain.

That's all it took for the state of Kerala to flood in neck-deep water, for massive landslides to lay waste to roads and homes and for hundreds to lose their lives.

The floods didn’t discriminate between people and property.

At last count, 357 people lost their lives, and the floods destroyed roughly 906,400 hectares worth of crops. The cost to the state and its people stands at a staggering Rs 19,512 crore.

For the state's oldest living generation, this was take two.

The last rival to a flood of this scale and severity in Kerala was in 1924, where monsoons pelted the hapless state with 3,368 mm of rain. At the time, over 1,000 people are said to have lost their lives, not to mention an enormous toll on livestock.

The 2,086 mm of rainfall this year is nowhere near as bad, but still 30 percent above the annual average. And the monsoon is far from over.

Going beyond the weather

Leading experts suggest a heavy, artificial hand in this latest deluge.

The state was forced to throw open the gates of 35 of its 39 dams, knowing full-well what was to come. Residents were forced to flee, on important roads that happened to be engulfed in floodwater and landslides.

And things only got worse from there.

The intensity of the rains meant that two dozen more dams in states nearby were forced to follow suit. The dam gates were opened and a torrent of hell was unleashed on God's own country.

Reading the signs

Kerala was one of four other districts in the country with rains more severe than predicted in 2018. The rains saw a steady increase since 2015, culminating in the 'large excess' seen this year.

Records from the India Meteorological Department from the start of the torrential rains in Kerala – between 9 August and 15 August – show a 255 percent departure from the norm in the state's hotspots.

“Heavy rainfall used to occur in Kerala, but not with such continuity,” Dr D S Pai, Climate Change scientist and analyst at Indian Meteorological Department said to Livemint. “This time, there has been widespread rain continually for a long time, which has not been seen in recent years.”

Did we see this coming?

Back in 2011, the Gadgil Committee put together a bunch of recommendations to the central government about ecologically-fragile regions in the Western Ghats. They found the highest number of vulnerable zones in Kerala and cited several reasons for them being classified as such.

Some reasons for its vulnerability were geographical, a challenge posed by its position amidst the Ghats. Many other causes – quarrying, mining, illegal repurposing of forests, and high-rise building constructions – were man-made, controllable factors that the state chose to brush aside.

“The flooding has definitely brought to light the existence of illegal stone quarries or a large number of unauthorised constructions on river beds,” Professor Madhav Gadgil said to PTI. ""In this sense, it is definitely a man-made calamity where intense rainfall and human intervention have made it a serious disaster.""

The quarrying Prof Gadgil refers to, along with deforestation in the region, has intensified the horrific landslides the state is witnessing.

Were there early signs?

One of the most severely affected areas is Ernakulum in Kochi, along the Periyar river, into which excess water from the Idamalayar dam was drained.

Dam-safety expert N Sasidharan claimed that authorities waited till the water level in the Idamalayar reservoir reached its capacity of 169 feet, and had it been opened sooner, would likely have spared the massive evacuation efforts in the vicinity.

MC Joseph of Kuttikkatt village near Eloor said that the authorities made a mistake by opening all four gates of the dam at once, flooding the underlying regions at a much faster rate than expected.

“This is the result of poor planning by the disaster management authority,” Sasidharan added.

""Sitting at Geneva, I had on 14 June cautioned that the reservoirs will be filled by July. I had made the prediction based on the experience in Thailand and Pakistan,"" Murali Thummarukudy, Chief of Disaster Risk Reduction in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said to Malayala Manorama, a Kerala daily.

“Unfortunately, our engineers did not foresee this,” he added.

Can't weather predictions warn us?



Time and again, data and statistics on weather events have been used to fuel many arguments linking freak weather events, like the floods in Kerala, and climate change.

Leading experts are wary about drawing the same conclusions; they state that weather data is complex, and particularly so in a tropical country like India.

A climate study spanning 1950-2015 looks at extreme rain events in central India, which the researchers say happens three time as frequently in recent times as it did in 1950.

The paper explains that these have also intensified, because westerly winds that move over an increasingly-warmer Arabian Sea carry surges in moisture with them as they move into the subcontinent during monsoons.

Researchers add that predicting such events can be done two-to-three weeks ahead, at best.

#TheInconvenientTruth

“As a layperson, you can call it ‘unreliability’, or ‘ambiguity’. Whereas, to a scientist, the best term is really ‘uncertainty’,” says Dr Raghu Murtugudde, a prominent climate scientist at the University of Maryland.

“You end up with ‘certain uncertainty’,” Murtugudde continues. “With a (weather) instability coming up, if it doesn’t build.. sometimes instead of building over Maharashtra, it builds a couple of hundred kilometres south, or a couple of hundred kilometres north.”

Tropical countries like India evolve differently than countries in the West, which have larger land area and time periods over which to observe and predict a given weather event, Murtugudde explains.

In a recent report by the World Bank Group, average temperatures throughout Southeast Asia were seen rising , and rainfall growing more erratic, particularly in India. The report predicts that these weather changes will continue to shadow us over coming decades.

Cities such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Dhaka and Karachi – home to nearly 50 million – are at a substantial risk of flood-related damage in the century to follow, the World Bank report warns.

What now?



Floods during monsoons are as common in the centre of our country as much as they are in coastal states. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are prone to bad monsoons and saw the worst of it in the catastrophic floods last year that affected an estimated 40 million people, according to a UN report.

“The main reasons for floods have been assessed high-intensity rainfall in short duration, poor or inadequate drainage capacity, unplanned reservoir regulation and failure of flood control structures,” a report filed in March this year by the Ministry of Water Resources to the Rajya Sabha.

The tools used by met officials to assess climate change are long term, area-wise monsoon predictions – which are, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology concedes – far from easy to make.

In the meanwhile, water levels in Kerala have slowly begun to recede. Unfortunately, the end of monsoon is still weeks away.

Once the floods and fury recede, there are evidently many lessons for authorities to take away from this disaster.

The next time such a disaster occurs, we have no excuse for not being better prepared.",English

A fresh wave of flooding in the north east Indian state of Assam began on 02 August, 2018. This follows an earlier wave of flooding that began in June which left over 30 people dead and 200,000 displaced.

Around 90,000 people have been affected in 9 districts since 02 August, with 3 people dead and around 25,000 displaced. The Dhansiri river in Golaghat district has exceeded its previous highest ever flood level by almost 30 cm.

As of 03 August, flooding was reported in Golaghat, Sivasagar, Barpeta, Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Darrang and Charaideo. Flooding affected Biswanath and Udalguri districts on 02 August but has since subsided.

By far the worst hit district is Golaghat, where flooding has affected 67,724 people in 99 villages. Four hundred homes have been damaged or destroyed by flooding in the district.

As of 03 August almost 24,000 people had left their homes to stay in 99 relief camps set up by the authorities in Golaghat. Nine relief camps have also been set up in Sivasagar district to accommodate over 200 evacuees.

According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), fatalities were reported on 02 August in Dhemaji, Udalguri and Golaghat districts. Forty-one people have now died in flooding in Assam since the start of this year’s monsoon.

Rescues

India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescued around 400 people in Golaghat after flooding from the overflowing Dhansiri river. On 03 August NDRF said that further evacuation operations are still in progress. Around 100 people were also rescued in Shivsagar district.

Rivers

ASDMA said Brahmaputra at Nematighat in Jorhat district, Dikhow river in Sivsagar, Dhansiri river at Numaligarh in Golaghat and the Jia Bharali river in Sonitpur were flowing above danger level, as of 03 August.

India’s Central Water Commission said that, as of 03 August, the Dhansiri river at Numaligarh in Golaghat district was flowing at 80.14 metres, which is 0.27 metres above its previous ‘Highest Flood Level’ of 79.87 metres.

Rainfall

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) in a 24 hour period to 02 August, Goalpara recorded 130.7mm of rain, Jorhat 53.2mm, Kokrajhar 69.2mm and Lakhimpur 60.8mm.",English

Kerala is currently experiencing its worst floods since 1924 due to an overactive South West Monsoon season, says chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He said this in an official memorandum to the Union home minister Rajnath Singh. The seasonal rainfall percentage in the state has jumped by 4 per cent only because of the rain in the last two days. Excess rainfall in the state was 15 per cent on August 8, which increased to 19 per cent, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).

There have been 211 incidents of landslides and flash floods in the state between August 8 and 12 and 39 people have been killed in these incidents. Vijayan has already declared the flood situation to be ‘grim’. The total number of people killed in rain and flood related incidents since June 1 is 186.

The initial estimate of the losses due to the floods in this monsoon season is Rs 8316 crore. In his memorandum Vijayan requested Singh for Rs 1,220 crore worth of funds to be released from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) for relief and rehabilitation. Vijayan also noted that a detailed report on the loss and damages due to the floods will be submitted later. Singh later announced a Rs 100-crore initial package for Kerala.

For the first time in 37 years, all the five shutters of the Idukki dam were opened. The last two times (1981 and 1992) the shutters had been opened was during the northeast monsoon season. This was the first time that they were opened during the southwest monsoon season.

Due to incessant rains and the opening of 27 major and minor dams in the state, the State Disaster Management Authority of Kerala has warned people of possible flash floods and landslides in the areas adjoining the dam and further downstream.

Idukki and Wayanad districts have been put on top alert levels as they are most prone to flash floods because of their location in the Western Ghats.

Although the state has received 20 percent more than normal rainfall since June 1, for the past two days rain had taken a welcome break, allowing the state to get back to its feet. The water levels in the Idukki and Idamalayar dams also fell below danger levels.

On August 9, these two districts had received the highest absolute rain at 167.2 mm and 170.9 mm, respectively which are 840 per cent and 759 per cent more than normal. In fact, Idukki has received 50 per cent more than normal rainfall this season. But is it just the heavy rain and the release of water from the dams that is causing unprecedented fear of flash floods in these districts?

The flood situation could still aggravate in the next two days. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has further predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall and issued a red alert for the flood affected districts of Idukki, Ernakulam, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Kannur on August 13 and 14.

Deforestation is so high in the state

Yes, deforestation and change in land use patterns appear to have played a role. Idukki and Wayanad districts are considered among the most heavily forested regions in the state. However, both the districts have seen a gradual decline in their forest cover between 2011 and 2017. The total forest cover in Idukki came down from 3,930 sq km to 3,139 sq km, a decrease of 20.13 per cent. In Wayanad, the forests have shrunk from 1,775 sq km to 1,580 sq km, a decrease of 11 per cent. This could be a reason why Idukki and Wayanad are now highly vulnerable to flash flooding.

In other flood-hit districts, even though there is an overall increase in forest area, it is mainly due to widespread rubber and areca nut plantations rather than natural growth of vegetation. The Forest Survey of India reports also agree to the fact that the increase in forest cover in Kerala is mainly due to commercial plantations.

For example, in Kannur, the forest cover increased from 641 sq km in 2011 to 1,561 sq km in 2017 – a jump of almost 144 per cent. Similarly, in Kozhikode, the forest saw of jump of 151 per cent during these years.

Flood forecasting system non-existent

On top of that, the Central Water Commission (CWC), India’s only flood forecasting agency, was also caught unawares about the flood situation in Kerala. Despite the fact that heavy rain and flooding is not uncommon in Kerala, surprisingly, CWC does not have any flood forecasting system in Kerala. This deprives the local of any scope for preparing better. Though CWC has flood monitoring sites in Kerala, at least one of these is currently non-functional.

Question raised on the timing of releasing water from the dams

Experts are questioning as to why the dam water was not released earlier and the authorities waited for the situation to turn intense, especially when districts of Idukki, Malappuram, Wayanad, Ernakulam, Kannur, Palakkad and Kozhikode have already seen rain-related deaths, mostly from landslides and flash floods.

To avoid turning an extreme weather event into a calamity, the state needs to augment its forecasting capacity and manage its forests better.",English

The agreement allows CWC to make use of Google’s artificial intelligence, machine learning and geospatial mapping expertise for effective water management and flood forecasting. The agreement will also help CWC to better disseminate flood related information through different platforms developed by Google.

Under this Agreement, CWC and Google will share technical expertise in different fields related to flood management, including geospatial flood mapping and analysis of hydrological observation data. The agreement also facilitates collaboration on improving flood prediction systems, which will help provide location-targeted, actionable flood warnings; a high priority research project utilizing Google Earth Engine to help visualize and improve flood management; and a cultural project to build online exhibitions on the Rivers of India.

Floods often cause widespread devastation in India, especially during the monsoon season. In 2017, floods caused by torrential downpours from the monsoon killed more than 1,200 people across India, Bangladesh and Nepal and a further 40 million were affected. The collaboration aims to improve the flood disaster management in the country and ultimately reduce the impact of flooding on the people’s lives and properties.

The initiative on flood forecasting is likely to help lessen the impact of floods on communities. The collaborative agreement commits Google to use their expertise in the realm of artificial intelligence as well as using their high resolution Digital Elevation Model and vast computing resources to generate flood inundations with the level forecast input data provided by CWC. These maps can be used for disaster risk management and emergency response efforts by enabling the Government and disaster management organisations to effectively identify the locations and population that are at risk from floods and require warnings and information. This collaborative initiative is expected to be a milestone in flood management and in mitigating the flood losses in India.

The collaboration is the latest in flood management initiatives developed by the CWC. The CWC, as India’s apex technical organization in the field of Water Resources, launched an ambitious programme ‘National Hydrology Project’ (NHP) during the years 2016-17. This project was implemented to improve reliability and accuracy of Hydrology and Ground Water data throughout India and to improve access to this information. The mission’s was also to establish an effective and sound hydrologic database and Hydrological Information System (HIS), together with the development of consistent and scientifically-based tools and design aids to assist in the effective water resources planning and management.",English

The northeastern part of India is suffering from a poor monsoon. According to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) latest monsoon report, northeastern India has had a deficit rainfall of 27 per cent. This is the worst deficit among the four regions of India. The past one week has been grim with the region reeling under a 49 per cent rainfall deficit.

The North East is divided into four sub-divisions—Arunachal Pradesh; Assam and Meghalaya; Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura; Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim. All of these sub-divisions have had deficit rainfall, with Assam and Meghalaya being the worst at 30 per cent and Arunachal Pradesh the second worst at 26 per cent. According to recent reports, Arunachal is already staring at a massive water shortage with the state environment minister, Nabam Rebia, recently declaring that 200 rivers and streams have dried up in the state due to depleted forest cover and climate change. If deficit monsoon continues, the situation will further exacerbate in a state which was once touted to become India’s hydroelectric powerhouse.

Among the northeastern states, Manipur has received 195 mm rainfall between June 1 and July 12 as against the normal of 567 mm—which is a deficit of 66 per cent. The state has still suffered from flooding in this season. Even Meghalaya, which is known for some of the wettest places on the planet like Mawsynram and Cherrapunji , has received 40 per cent less rainfall than normal this season.

Pre- and Post-monsoon rainfall deficits in the past few years Year Pre-monsoon deficit Post-monsoon deficit Increase in deficit 2013 6 -22 -28 2014 27 69 42 2015 2 59 57 2017 -6 24 30

In spite of the deficit rainfall in the region, floods wreaked havoc for much of the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. On June 12, Mizoram received 107.7 mm of rainfall, which is 643 per cent more than the normal rainfall for that day. Manipur, on the other hand, received 32.9 mm rainfall, which is 68 per cent more than the normal. This was when the monsoon had not even been officially declared in the region. Ten people died in both the states due to floods caused mainly by landslides and bridge collapses.

The floods in Assam had killed 32 people till July 2. This was despite the state having an overall rainfall deficit of 25 per cent this season. In fact, a state-wise analysis by scientists shows that in the future the magnitude of floods is likely to increase by about 25 per cent in Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, parts of Meghalaya and Nagaland.

This is a trend not restricted to the current season alone. For the last five years, the North East has received less than normal rainfall during the monsoon with deficits ranging from 4 per cent in 2017 to 27 per cent in 2013.

The post-monsoon rainfall scenarios in the region are a cause for concern as 69 per cent, 59 per cent and 24 per rainfall deficit was recorded in 2014, 2015 and 2017, respectively. There has also been a massive increase in deficit when the pre-monsoon scenario is compared to the post-monsoon scenario. For example, in 2015, the deficit increased from 2 per cent to 59 per cent, a jump of 57 per cent.

Although the variability of rainfall, or the degree to which rainfall varies through time, has been historically low in the northeastern states, it is now changing because of climate change and thus affecting agriculture and water availability in the region, said a research paper published in the International Journal of Climatology in May 2012.

“The high relative variability and inter-annual variability of rainfall have created increased occurrence of droughts and floods in the recent times, leading to uncertainty in yield and increased agricultural vulnerability,” said a research paper on the climate change vulnerability of North East India published in Current Science in August 2011.

But the heavy rainfall only contributed to the much larger cause of this disaster, according to Auroop Ganguly, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Northeastern who studies extreme weather trends.

Ganguly, director of Northeastern’s Sustainability and Data Sciences Laboratory, said the severe flooding can be attributed to human error and man-made changes to the local environment.

Flooding is worst in the coastal state of Kerala, where poorly-managed dams exaggerated the effects of the heavy rainfall, he said.

Large flood events since 1985 Each circle represents a large flood event since 1985. Circles are scaled relative to the total land area affected by the flood, in square kilometers. “ Dartmouth Flood Observatory, University of Colorado. Data visualization by Lia Petronio/Northeastern University. Data Source: G.R.Brakenridge, Global Active Archive of Large Flood Events ,” Dartmouth Flood Observatory, University of Colorado. Data visualization by Lia Petronio/Northeastern University.

“Kerala has actually been in a drought, so [the state] was unsure when to release the water in the dams because there was a chance the monsoon rains wouldn’t bring that much water,” said Ganguly, who led students to Kerala to study climate change and environmental policy in 2014 and 2015.

“We need to preserve critical ecological areas if we want to save lives. Natural disasters are not acts of god. They are acts of mankind.” Auroop Ganguly civil and environmental engineering professor

Ganguly said unreliable forecasting led to the misuse of the dams. “It’s a gamble deciding when to release the water,” he said. “You need to be able to trust the forecast, and if you can’t, it’s useless.”

But questionable forecasting isn’t the only factor contributing to these floods, he said. According to Ganguly, reckless environmental practices in Kerala also allowed this catastrophe to unravel.

“There is uncontrolled development and a complete disregard for the ecology,” Ganguly said. “They have destroyed parts of the environment that naturally mitigate floods, like forests.”

Forests help prevent floods because tree roots absorb water and keep soil intact, which reduces the the likelihood of a landslide. According to one study, there is a direct correlation between forest density and flooding in India.

Ganguly cited ecologist Madhav Gadgil, who said that construction projects in Kerala made the landscape especially susceptible to flooding.

“The flooding has definitely brought to light the existence of illegal stone quarries and a large number of unauthorised constructions on river beds,” said Gadgil, who founded the Centre for Ecological Sciences in India. “In this sense it is definitely a man-made calamity where intense rainfall and human intervention have made it a serious disaster.”

Ganguly said the population of Kerala is one of the wealthiest and most educated in India, proving that natural disasters don’t discriminate by affluence.

“Kerala has one of the highest literacy rates in the country, and it’s one of the richest states, but somehow this doesn’t percolate when it comes to protecting the ecology,” he said. “Money is spent to fix something after it happens, but not to create the infrastructure to prevent it.”

Ganguly said forecast technology, such as satellites, needs to be improved to help communities better prepare for extreme weather and avoid future environmental disasters.

“We need to preserve critical ecological areas if we want to save lives,” he said. “Natural disasters are not acts of god. They are acts of mankind.”",English

Several risk behaviours were identified in these affected areas which can have severe implications on the health of the community. Of the existing latrines in the villages, there are no handwashing facilities available nearby, and therefore only 50% of the surveyed population wash their hands after defecation. These latrines are not suitable for the elderly, people living with disabilities and even children.

According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, something as simple as washing hands with soap can reduce diarrheal illness in people with weakened immune systems by 58%. Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the top two killers of children below the age of 5 across the globe. Thus, inculcation of good handwashing early in life may aid in the improvement of child development in some settings. Nearly 67% of the surveyed population reported that they only wash their hands when visibly dirty, therefore they are unaware of disease-causing bacteria that may be present on their hands as they are not visible to the naked eye. Thus, putting them at even higher risk of diseases which are transmitted through the faeco-oral route. 83% of the surveyed population does not use soap to wash their hands. Washing hands with water alone is not enough to get rid of microscopic bacteria. This puts more than half the population in the surveyed areas at risk of diarrheal diseases.

83% of girls and boys under the age of 5 are currently suffering from Diarrhoeal diseases in the affected areas of Karimganj in Assam. This is a clear indicator of poor hygiene and sanitation, which has been compromised as a result of the floods. Another shocking revelation from the survey was that 83% of the surveyed population do not treat water at the household level and therefore are highly susceptible to waterborne diseases as most of the water sources in the villages are either damaged or have been contaminated.

Caritas India is currently responding to the flood-affected population in Karimganj and Hailakandi districts in Assam, with WaSH support through the distribution of hygiene kits. These kits contain bucket, mug, antiseptic liquid soap, handwashing soap, detergent, markin cloth and chlorine tablets. The KAP survey is a part of the WaSH response and was conducted for the purpose of understanding the behaviour, knowledge and attitude of the community on WaSH related issues. These findings will guide the hygiene promotion process and also inform future programme planning in these areas.

KAP survey is a tool that uses standardised questionnaires that give both quantitative and qualitative information, which is used to understand any kind of misunderstanding or misconception that may hinder the activities of a programme that aims at behaviour change and also guide the activities aimed at behaviour change. The KAP survey can be done at different time periods like at the beginning of the programme or at the end.",English

The deluge finally let up on Sunday, giving some respite for thousands of marooned families, while authorities feared an outbreak of disease among two million people crammed into relief camps.

Using boats and helicopters, India's military has led rescue efforts to reach people in communities cut off for days by the floods, with many trapped on roof tops and the upper floors of their homes, and in desperate need of food and water.

At least two trains carrying about 1.5 million liters of water were moving to the flooded areas from the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, Indian railway official Milind Deouskar said, according to the Press Trust of India news agency.

One train arrived on Sunday, said P.H. Kurian, a top disaster management official in Kerala. However, he said the officials had largely restored the state's water supply systems.

""What we need right now is bottled water, which is easy to transport to remote and isolated places, where some people are still stranded,"" Kurian said.

Officials have called it the worst flooding in Kerala in a century, with rainfall in some areas well over double that of a typical monsoon season.

Thousands of rescuers were continuing efforts to reach out to stranded people and get relief supplies to isolated areas by hundreds of boats and nearly two dozen helicopters, Kurian said. He said weather conditions had improved considerably and expected the nearly 10,000 people still stranded to be rescued by Monday.

An estimated 800,000 people have taken shelter in some 4,000 relief camps across Kerala, Kurian said.

Weather officials have predicted more rains across the state through Monday morning.

The downpours that started August 8 have triggered floods and landslides and caused homes and bridges to collapse across Kerala, a picturesque state known for its quiet tropical backwaters and beautiful beaches.

Officials estimate that more than 6,200 miles of roads have been damaged. One of the state's major airports, in the city of Kochi, was closed this past Tuesday due to the flooding. It is scheduled to remain closed until August 26.

The Indian government said a naval air base in Kochi will be opened for commercial flights starting Monday morning.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inspected the flooded landscape from a helicopter on Saturday and met with the state's top officials, promising more than $70 million in aid. While the central government has dispatched multiple military units to Kerala, state officials are pleading for additional help.

Officials have put initial storm damage estimates at nearly $3 billion.

The Odisha government on Monday put the collectors of six districts (Cuttack, Kendrapara,

Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Khurda and Puri) on high alert in the delta region as 7,30,877 cusecs of water flowed through Mundali gauge station near Cuttack by Monday evening., with the water level in Mahanadi and Baitarani rivers swelling due to depression-induced heavy rainfall, even as the death toll rose to 12. The government apprehended a ""low to medium"" flood in Mahanadi and Baitarani and asked district collectors in the delta region to remain prepared for all emergency situations. The line departments and districts concerned have been asked to keep field functionaries ready and draw up an emergency plan to meet any eventually.

As of 23rd July 2018, the severe rainfall and flood has affected 14 districts, 62 Blocks,1082 Villages, 3.14 lakh (3,14,682) population of Odisha and around 5360 houses also have been damaged. The districts which have been affected in the floods are Angul, Boudh, Bargarh, Deogarh, Jajpur, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Khurda, Koraput, Nayagarh, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Subarnapur and Puri.

Other Updates-

• The state has received heavy rainfall during the last three days, necessitating evacuation of some people and provision of temporary shelter have been madade and all affected district authorities will start damage estimation very soon.

• SRC had informed that over 300 mm rainfall was recorded in 23 blocks while 200 mm rainfall was registered in 46 blocks during the last three days’ heavy downpour triggered by the low pressure in the Bay.

24,24,Early warning system for flash floods can save thousands of lives at risk - Mongabay-India,"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['india', 'early', 'flood', 'save', 'lives', 'warning', 'flash', 'state', 'soil', 'system', 'risk', 'predict', 'ladakh', 'floods', 'thousands']",news_article,Flood,India,https://india.mongabay.com/2018/07/early-warning-system-for-flash-floods-can-save-thousands-of-lives-at-risk/,"The India Meteorological Department is developing a Flash Flood Guidance System to predict the threat of a flash flood. It will alert citizens and disaster relief forces in advance, preventing loss of lives and damages worth billions of rupees.

The early warning system, which is based on the concept of monitoring the capacity of the soil to absorb water, is currently being tested.

It can be a significant tool in disaster risk reduction in a country like India where every year thousands of people and cattle lose lives in floods and flash floods.

Every time there is persistent and intense rainfall in Ladakh, the cold desert region of India’s northern state Jammu and Kashmir, the locals begin to worry. It brings back images of the 2010 flash floods that affected thousands of people in the region. This year, several low lying areas in the region were inundated following the rains, triggering rescue operations by the local administration.

With an aim to prevent loss of life and extensive damage due to flash floods, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) is working on a Flash Flood Guidance System (FFGS) that will predict the possibility of flash floods up to six hours in advance and alert disaster relief forces as well as local residents.

Floods, specifically flash floods, are among the leading causes of deaths due to natural disasters. While general floods take days or even weeks to develop, flash floods can inundate vast areas within a few hours. Given this, the FFGS could be a significant tool in disaster risk reduction as it will provide alerts in advance that will help residents of the affected areas and relief teams prepare for the oncoming flash floods.

India among top disaster-prone countries in the world

According to the World Meteorological Organisation, some 5,000 people lose their lives each year, across the world, to flash floods, accounting for 85 percent of all kinds of floods (like riverine and coastal). India is also among the 10 most disaster-prone countries in the world, according to a report by the government of India and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

IMD’s upcoming system is of significance, especially for India, where nearly 12 percent of the landmass is prone to floods and river erosion.

In 2018 itself, several lives have already been lost across India since the arrival of the south-west monsoon which accounts for the majority of India’s annual rainfall.

So far, floods in Assam, Tripura and Manipur have claimed 23 lives and displaced nearly a million (eight lakh) people from their homes in these states as the water level in the Brahmaputra rose beyond its embankment, according to this report. The southern state of Kerala has already lost 54 lives since the onset of monsoon on May 29 − three days ahead of its normal date of onset.

According to Indian government’s Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, 107,487 human lives and 6.02 million cattle have been lost to floods and heavy rains across India during a period of almost 65 years, from 1953 to 2017.

In 2017-18, cyclonic storms, heavy rains, floods and landslides claimed 2,231 human lives and 50,638 cattle deaths. They also resulted in damage to over 1.19 million houses and 38,500 square kilometres of crop area.

Technology that will save lives at risk

Under the FFGS, using existing satellites and on-ground equipment, the IMD hopes to gather not just more accurate data but also predict the onset of flash floods in remote areas of the country.

The system will be able to track real-time rainfall in any part of the country. Along with other data points like soil moisture, soil temperature, level of soil saturation and the topography of the land, the system will help the meteorological department officials predict flash floods up to six hours in advance.

It is the soil’s ability to absorb rainwater that greatly determines the probability of flash floods.

Explaining the system, IMD’s Director General K. J. Ramesh said, “There is something called local soil hydrology. Some moisture is retained by the soil (when it rains).”

“Once the soil gets saturated, the runoff − outflow from the soil − starts. Until then, whatever rain has come will be absorbed by the soil. Local hydrology will be computed on daily basis (under the new system). We are trying to sub-divide the whole of India into about 27,000-28,000 micro watersheds, each about 50-70 sq km in size. At that scale, the soil hydrology model will be run on a daily basis by which you can clearly assess the run-off potential of the soil of an area,” Ramesh told Mongabay-India.

Ramesh stressed that with FFGS they will be able to ascertain how temperature, soil and rainfall are interacting and “when incremental run-off starts” from the soil.

According to the system, whether the run-off from the soil will lead to flash floods is something that the intensity of rainfall will decide.

“But it will give some guidance that there is an evolving scenario towards possible flooding … and then authorities have to take action,” added Ramesh.

In areas like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where the soil is more absorbent, even 10 to 20 centimetres of rainfall may not cause floods, but it can be different for other terrains. In regions like Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, where the terrain consists of mostly loose soil, flash floods can happen with lesser rainfall.

“Combined sloped terrain, raging waters from the river and torrential rain can easily run-off and cause flash floods,” Sonam Lotus, director of the meteorological department in Jammu and Kashmir, told Mongabay-India.

IMD’s director general Ramesh, also informed that the system is being tested and will be operational across the country once completed.

“The system will allow the state and central administration to prepare and reach the affected area for evacuation and rescue. Our staff is undergoing training to understand the system better. We plan to use it in full scale by next year,” said B.P Yadav, a senior scientist at IMD and the deputy director general of meteorology (Hydro-Meteorology).

Relief for flood prone states in sight

In August 2010, Ladakh experienced one of its worst natural disasters in its history. The cold desert district received 350 mm of rain in just two days − three and half times its annual average. As per reports, 234 people died and more than 800 went missing due to the floods.

In September 2014, Kashmir too saw one of its worst natural disasters in 50 years. Torrential rains from the South-West monsoon had gathered pace causing Chenab and Jhelum rivers to breach their embankments. Over the following days, nearly 2,600 villages in the state were affected, 390 of which were completely submerged. Some 280 people had died and half a million people were trapped in their homes for nearly three weeks, with the city of Srinagar drowning under nearly 18 feet of water.

“Our relationship with nature changed after that. We do not look at rains the same way after these floods,” said additional deputy commissioner for the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC) Moses Kunzang.

For Sonam Lotus, FFGS is a significant step ahead in technology and the forecasting prowess of IMD.

“The FFGS is really required for a district like Ladakh. IMD, at the moment, forecasts on rainfall. Based on local knowledge of geographical parameters, we can somewhat predict floods. But the new system makes it all the more accurate. The 2010 floods were beyond anyone’s imagination. No one thought Ladakh would experience something like this. But the next time it happens, we will be better prepared,” said Lotus who heads the local meteorological department.

While flash floods are fairly recent in Ladakh, in places like Bihar, India’s most flood-prone state, about 76 percent of the population in the north of the state lives under the threat of flood devastation, according to the state’s Water Resources Department.

A little more than 73 percent or about 68,800 sq km out of the state’s total geographical area of 94163 sq km is flood affected. The state faced major floods in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2017. Last year, the floods took away the lives of 514 people and affected 3 million families.

Using conventional methods to predict flash floods is extremely difficult, not just in Bihar but across the country, according to scientists. However, a system like FFGS can herald a new era.

“We do not have rain-gauges or flood forecasting stations in remote areas as they are not logistically possible to maintain. Besides, rains are not the only factor that can cause flash floods,” said IMD scientist Yadav.

Cyclones can also cause flash floods during the north-east monsoon in south-east coastal regions of the country, while the south-west monsoon can wreak havoc in other parts.

“The pilot phase is showing good results. We were able to accurately predict the floods in Mangalore this year. If things go well, we can roll out the system for the next year’s monsoon,” Yadav added.",English

India could see a six-fold increase in population exposed to the risk of severe floods by 2040 to 25 million people.

news Floods

India accounts for one-fifth of global deaths due to floods, according to government data that lends perspective to a new World Bank study that says climate change will lower the standards of living of nearly half of the countrys population by 2050.

As many as 107,487 people died due to heavy rains and floods across India over 64 years between 1953 and 2017, according to Central Water Commission data presented to the Rajya Sabha on March 19. Damage to crops, houses and public utilities was reported to be Rs 365,860 crore -- or as much as three per cent of the country's current GDP -- the data shows.

""The main reasons of floods have been assessed as high intensity rainfall in short duration, poor or inadequate drainage capacity, unplanned reservoir regulation and failure of flood control structures,"" according to a reply to the Rajya Sabha.

With heavy rains sweeping western India, many cities such as Mangaluru, Mumbai and Junagarh have flooded during the 2018 monsoon season. Over 30 people died in floods that inundated 58 villages.

""Temperatures have been rising across the [South Asia] region, and are projected to continue increasing for the next several decades under all plausible climate scenarios,"" the World Bank study, published on June 28, said.

These changes will result in more frequent flooding, greater water demand and increased heat-related medical issues.

South Asian cities such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Dhaka and Karachi -- that are home to over 50 million people -- face a substantial risk of flood-related damage over the next century, the report said.

India is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to climate change. It has increased the frequency of downpours as well as the gaps between rainy days during the monsoon, as IndiaSpend reported earlier.

As India's climate warms, extreme weather, such as intense rain and floods, is predicted to worsen.

The new World Bank study mentioned above said the worst affected states by 2050 would be Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Seven of the 10 most affected districts will belong to Vidarbha, Maharashtra.

India could see a six-fold increase in population exposed to the risk of severe floods by 2040 -- to 25 million people from 3.7 million facing this risk between 1971 and 2004, based on a study published in Science Advances, a peer-reviewed journal.

""India is highly vulnerable to floods,"" according to the National Disaster Management Authority, a government body. ""Out of the total geographical area of 329 million hectares (mha), more than 40 mha is flood prone.""

Over 1,600 people die every year due to floods, affecting nearly 32 million people. More than 92,000 cattles are lost every year, seven million hectares of land is affected, and damage is over Rs 5,600 crore.

""High losses from floods reflect India's inadequacy to cope with the current variability in climate, let alone future climate change,"" Ashvani Kumar Gosain, professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, told IndiaSpend earlier.

States that are flood-prone include West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

""Intense rains during the monsoon season cause rivers like Brahmaputra, Ganga and Yamuna to swell their banks, which in turn floods the adjacent areas,"" according to this reply to the Lok Sabha on April 4.

There are 226 flood forecasting stations across 20 states, two Union territories and 19 river basins to monitor floods in the country. The government plans to expand the network to 325 stations by March 2020.

With rains during the ongoing monsoon season have led to flood-like situation in several places across India, state governments and Central Water Commission have been issuing alerts. Currently, river Brahmaputra at Nimatighat in Jorhat, Dikhow at Sizasagar town, Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur are flowing above the danger mark. The water level in the Yamuna river rose to over 206 metre yesterday. On Monday, the Kerala government had issued an orange alert” in three districts as the water in Idukki reservoir came close to full storage level. It has sad that it would issue a “red alert” if the water-level reached a certain level, according to Indian Express report.

Generally three types of colours are used for issuing alert- “Orange”, “red” and “yellow alert”. The Central Water Commission uses this colour-coded system to alert local people in case of emergency. There are over 700 flood forecasting stations located across the country and a defined “warning level”, “danger level” and “highest flood level” for the river on which it is situated, the report says. The “warning and danger levels” are generally kept fixed for a river. However, highest flood level keeps changing and alteration is done based on the prevuious year’s record.

The colour-coded system works on the basis of the amount of water that flows in a river at a particular time. When the water in a river is “above normal flood” level, or between the warning and danger levels, a yellow alert is issued. When the river is in “severe flood”, or the level is between the danger and highest flood levels, authorities concerned issue “orange alert”. Authorities issue a red alert when the waters breach the highest flood level, the IE report said.

In Delhi, Yamuna was flowing at over 206 metre on Tuesday noon with the danger mark being 204.83 metres, officials said. The highest water level recorded at Old Yamuna Bridge was 207.49 metres in 1978. It was 207.11 metres in 2010 and 207.32 metres in 2013, according to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.",English

The Malayalam year 1099 (ME), or what was 1924 in the Gregorian calendar, is often considered to be a landmark moment in Kerala’s history. That year the much endeared season of rains in the state transformed into a disaster of monstrous dimensions. The current state of deluge in Kerala is reminiscent of that monsoon, almost a century back, when ‘God’s own country’ transformed into a calamity zone. “It seemed as if the skies had been ripped apart as the waters burst out endlessly, transforming the bountiful scene into one of catastrophe,” writes historian Manu Pillai about the ‘great flood of 99’ in his book, ‘The Ivory throne’.

“The significance of the flood was such that many old people in Travancore used to anchor their memories in relation to the flood,” writes historian Meenu Jacob in her article ‘1924 flood of Travancore: A literary representation’. The disastrous nature of rains had its most severe impact on Travancore which was transformed into a massive swamp in the course of the few weeks when it kept pouring. Other areas of present day Kerala were also affected including Trichur, Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam and also the road leading up to Munnar. These are the same areas affected in this year’s floods.

Though the rainfall recorded in 1924 was far lesser in comparison to what Kerala has received this year, the impact of the deluge was no less. As opposed to the 2344 mm of rain that the state received this year, back during the great flood of 99, it had received approximately 650 mm of rain. Records show that thousands of people lost their lives and property, flora and fauna were destroyed and several parts of the Malabar region were submerged in water. “It was one of the greatest natural disasters to occur in South India,” writes Pillai, adding that “grandmothers would for long tell grim tales of the collective sufferings of 1099 ME”.

Several records of the flood provide a glimpse of the gruesome conditions in which people of Malabar were caught. “The current set up by the river overflowing its banks was so powerful that many boats engaged in rescue are reported to have capsized,�� wrote executive engineer K Thanu Pillai in his report on July 19, 1924. In the same report he mentioned that the flood reached its zenith on July 17, when water levels rose as high as 6 feet. In another report, the sub-divisional officer of Aluva wrote: “The uprooted trees, roofs of thatched houses and other articles and carcasses that came down by the river were innumerable.” The report of the Mannar Flood Relief Deputation noted that 500 houses, 200 coconut gardens, 1000 acres of land and 6,40,000 kilograms of grain had been lost in the vicinity of one village in Travancore alone.

One big loss was the Kundala Valley railway near Munnar, known to be the first monorail system in south India, was destroyed during the flood and never rebuilt.

The relief work

The Travancore government was swift to start relief work as soon as the crisis set in. A Flood Relief Committee was set up by the government. Devan T. Raghavaiah, a civil servant deputed by the Madras presidency, played an important role in the relief work, sending in large amounts of money to areas which were affected by the floods. “By early August, thousands of refugees and displaced families were being fed at different relief centres: 4000 at Ambalapuzha, 3000 at Alleppey, 5000 in Kottayam, 3000 in Changanassery, 8000 in Parur and so on,” writes Pillai. Representatives of the state travelled across to every affected locality as a means to boost public morale and did everything possible to ensure that starvation of people is minimum.

Further, upon taking account of the monumental loss incurred on agriculture, the government announced that in the worst affected regions, taxes would be remitted for that financial year. A sum of Rs 4 lakh was also set aside to provide agricultural loans. The forest department was issued orders to supply free bamboo and other housing material in order to provide provisional residential arrangements for the poor. The government also set aside a housing reconstruction fund and took a number of measures to ensure that food price stability was maintained.",English

Executive Summary

Kerala is experiencing the largest disaster of flood and land slide after 1924.The torrential rain since 10th May in sporadic place in Kerala and continuous rain since August first week accumulate huge rain water in several dams. Finally, 10th August 22 dams were open by the Kerala government. The state government informed, electronic media, print media and public address system to all the house door to door notice regarding release the water. The river basin areas and houses were submerged with released water from the dams.

But due to continuous rain mountains soil get lose and thus create a devastated landslide in any places in the hilltop areas. The people were not ready for the landslide. Many houses were fully damaged, many lives lost, even agricultural land were severely damaged due to landslide.

2. Background

This year the south west monsoon in Kerala started in the last week of May. Torrential rains continued in the state of Kerala since the third week of July 2018 which is still continuing. Most of the districts in coastal, middle and high ranges of the state experiencing serious issues due the heavy rain fall. 8 districts are now on red alert.",English

“We have decided to engage Balaji Rajagopalan, a hydrologist with the University of Colorado in the US, to develop a prototype flood forecasting model for the Indian rivers. This will be funded through the ongoing National Monsoon Mission,” Rajeevan told BusinessLine.

Kerala flood crisis

The move assumed some urgency with the deluge in Kerala just claiming around 300 lives and causing humongous economic loss. According to unconfirmed reports 83,000 km of roads and 221 bridges in Kerala were severely damaged by floods since the first week of August and as many as 771 villages were inundated.

Rajagopalan, recently elected as a Fellow of the prestigious American Geophysical Union, confirmed the development and said the project would develop a hydrologic system for Indian rivers.

“There is quite a bit of experimental forecasting being done by researchers in India (who will be on this proposal). Our idea is to evaluate the forecasting systems used here in the US and those in India to develop a skilful forecasting system,” Rajagopalan told BusinessLine in an email interview.

US experience

The India-born scientist, who has a basic B Tech degree in civil engineering from National Institute of Technology in Kurukshetra and M Tech from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, has been part of the team that was involved in developing a world-class model for managing the Colorado river basin in the US.

According to him, the original idea was to develop a flood forecasting system for the Narmada river, which has now been extended to include many Indian rivers, including the peninsular rivers.

“We are close to sending in our revised proposal following comments from the reviews.

This will then be reviewed by Indian experts before a final recommendation is made. We are hoping it will be in the affirmative,” he said.

The India Meteorological Department already has flood warning centres for many major rivers such as the Narmada, Tapto, Yamuna and the Ganga. But they focus mainly on forecasting floods in major urban areas on the banks of these rivers.

The Central Water Commission too has flood warning (and forecasting) systems in place for many Indian rivers, but, according to experts, the efficiency of these forecasts leaves much to be desired.",English
32,32,Kerala flood: How you can help and donate to India's flood victims - Quartz,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT","['india', 'bank', 'upi', 'website', 'state', 'heres', 'help', 'victims', 'water', 'kerala', 'relief', 'transferred', 'donations', 'floods']",news_article,Flood,India,https://qz.com/india/1364342/donate-for-kerala-flood-victims/,"The water level in flood-hit Kerala has started to recede, but rebuilding the southern Indian state could take years.

After all, the calamity, the worst Kerala has seen in a century, has displaced over a million people who are currently staying at relief camps.

As the rains ease, the focus will be on aiding those whose houses and livelihoods were destroyed, a scale of rebuilding which will require billions of dollars.

For those who want to contribute towards the cause but don’t know how, here’s a guide:

Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund

Monetary contributions can be transferred directly to the Kerala government’s bank account with the State Bank of India.

Account-holder name: Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund Bank: State Bank of India Account number: 67319948232 IFSC: SBIN0070028 Branch: City Branch, Trivandrum UPI: keralacmdrf@sbi

Donations can be made through cards, real-time mobile payments interface UPI, mobile wallets, internet banking, cheques, or demand drafts.

The Kerala government has also created an online donation channel (here) that accepts VISA, Mastercard, Rupay, and other international cards, besides net banking.

Another way to transfer money is via mobile-payments platform Paytm. The company has added a “donate” icon to the home screen of its app and website through which money can be transferred. Paytm has also said it will match the donations users make with an equal contribution from its side. On Aug. 18, the company said donations from its platform had crossed Rs10 crore ($1.4 million).

Contributions to the relief fund are exempt from taxation under India’s Income Tax Act.

Via e-commerce

Supplies can be provided via online retailers such as Amazon.in and BigBasket.

These portals allow shoppers to choose items to donate, pay for them, and place the order. The e-tailers do the rest free of cost.

Amazon India has tied up with relief organisations Habitat for Humanity, World Vision, Goonj, and Oxfam India. The website allows even people not residing in India to make donations. The grocery shopping app BigBasket has also tied up with Goonj.

To assist donors, the portals also have lists of products—such as sanitary napkins, soap, batteries, and water purifiers—desperately needed.

BigBasket is offering a 20% discount on next orders for shoppers who make a donation for the Kerala floods.

Relief groups

Donations can also be made directly to the relief organisations working in Kerala:

Local collection centres

In all major cities across India, individuals and groups are organising collection drives. These groups have been sending truckloads of supplies to Kerala.

While many of these are praiseworthy efforts, every initiative may not be authentic. So Quartz advises donors to verify things on their part before making contributions.",English
