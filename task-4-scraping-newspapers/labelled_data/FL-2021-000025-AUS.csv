Days of torrential rain have spawned massive flooding in eastern Australia, forcing the evacuation of some 40,000 people. In the country's arid central section, it has sent waterfalls down the side of the country's majestic Uluru rocks.

Barely a year after devastating bush fires burned through tens of millions of acres in Australia, the country is grappling with one of its worst floods after weather systems converged over Queensland and New South Wales, dumping more than 20 inches of rain in a single day in one area north of Brisbane.

Meanwhile, one area of New South Wales received nearly 40 inches in a week — which Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said had already exceeded the average autumn rainfall less than a month into the season.

The floods, which have submerged houses, stranded cattle and cut off towns, have inundated vast areas along the east coast from roughly Mackay, about 600 miles north of Brisbane in Queensland, to Bega in New South Wales, some 260 miles south of Sydney.

The premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, said Wednesday that residents in Sydney's western regions are under new evacuation orders.

""What we still have to be aware of is the fact that thousands and thousands of people are still on evacuation warnings, that the rivers will continue to swell, that catchments will continue to experience flows of water not seen in 50 years and in some places 100 years,"" she told reporters in Sydney, Reuters reported.

On Wednesday, the bodies of two men were recovered from flooded vehicles. One man, 25, died when his car was submerged in northwest Sydney. He reached an emergency operator and was on the line for 44 minutes until contact was lost, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Near Alice Springs in central Australia, tourists have flocked to Uluru, also known Ayers Rock, to catch a rare glimpse of cascading waterfalls at the reddish-orange rock formation. Park officials said 46 millimeters (1.8 inches) of rain fell there over the weekend – about a sixth of the average annual rainfall in the region. While the event isn't unprecedented, it is uncommon.

""Rainwater on the rock's surface causes it to change [color]. From dark burgundy to shining silver and even black, every side of Uluru takes a different shade, making this spectacle a photographer's delight. Following the rain, desert plants bloom and many animals emerge to mate and feed,"" staff at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park said on Facebook.

Although rivers were expected to crest on Wednesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that the flooding, which has been concentrated along the eastern seaboard, would not remain ""just a coastal event.""

The Warragamba Dam, on the western outskirts of Sydney, has been spilling the equivalent of the city's famous harbor in water each day. It's expected to continue its overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas, Morrison said. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" he said.

Darren Osmotherly, who owns the Paradise Café Pizzeria in Portland in North South Wales, west of Sydney, told Reuters that damage to his restaurant would likely top a half-million Australian dollars ($380,000).

""We've had bush fires and COVID and so many dramas this year. No one can go anywhere,"" he said, adding that the return of sunny skies on Wednesday didn't mean the danger was over.

""People get the illusion that it's stopped flooding, but you've got 17 hours of water to come,"" he told Reuters. ""The deluge of rain we had yesterday isn't here yet. ... Got to be careful.

1,1,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Parts of Australia declare natural disaster during 'once in 100 years' floods - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/21/australia/australia-flood-natural-disaster-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) The Australian government has declared a natural disaster in large swaths of New South Wales (NSW) as heavy rains batter the state and force thousands to evacuate .

Rains have been inundating communities since Thursday, but parts of the east coast tipped into crisis on Saturday as a major dam overflowed, adding to swollen rivers and causing flash flooding.

The NSW and federal government have signed 16 natural disaster declarations in areas spanning the central and mid-north coast, from Hunter Valley near Sydney to Coff's Harbour, said NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott in a news conference on Sunday.

There have been no deaths reported yet -- but, Elliott warned, ""we are moving closer and closer to the inevitable fatality.""

""We cannot say it enough: do not put yourself in danger, do not put the agencies that are there to assist you in the event of a flood rescue in danger,"" he said.

Some families were forced to evacuate in the middle of the night as rivers rose to dangerous levels, and 4,000 more people -- primarily in the Hawkesbury region -- may have to evacuate on Sunday, said state Premier Gladys Berejiklian at the news conference.

""This is nothing like we've seen since the 1960s,"" Berejiklian said. In parts of the state that have been hit harder, this is a once-a-century event; in other regions like the Hawkesbury area, it's a ""one-in-50-years"" event, she said.

Joshua Edge and his fiancée Sarah Soars lost the house they were renting Saturday on what was supposed to be their wedding day. They lost everything they owned, including pets, as flood waters powered through Mondrook, an area near the town of Taree in NSW, Edge's brother Lyle wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to help the couple.

The page has raised nearly $100,000 AUD (roughly $77,000 USD) from 1,779 people in one day. A video circulating on social media shows a house being carried by floods in the same area, but CNN could not independently verify whether it was the one Edge and Soars had been living in.

""We have just been blown away with people's generosity,"" said Lyle Edge in a Facebook post. ""We are all so grateful and can not [sic] thank everyone enough.""

Since Thursday, the State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to 7,000 calls for assistance and conducted more than 750 flood rescues. Thousands of emergency workers and volunteers are still on the ground, helping trapped residents.

Photos show backyards and homes half underwater and roads flooded to knee-high levels. In the mid-north town of Taree , residents rescued a cow struggling to stay afloat in rough waters; nearby, an enthire house was swept away by the raging floodwaters, according to CNN affiliate Seven News.

Residents look at the swollen Nepean river during heavy rain in western Sydney on March 20.

Berejiklian urged residents to follow local guidance, stay off the roads, and heed evacuation orders if needed -- even for those who live in flood-prone areas and may have experienced flooding before. ""This is different,"" she warned. ""What we're going through is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years. So please take it seriously.""

Authorities don't know yet how many homes or infrastructure have been lost, but ""the damage is substantial,"" she said.

The natural disaster declaration could be further extended up the coast if the damage increases, said Elliott. The declaration allows those affected to receive financial assistance, including recovering damage to homes, subsidies for affected livestock or agriculture, and low- or zero-interest loans.

Australia's federal government activated disaster relief for flood-affected NSW residents, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced in a Facebook post on Sunday.

Those who are significantly injured, lost homes or had their homes damaged will be entitled to $1,000 AUD (roughly $770 USD) for adults or $400 AUD (roughly $310 USD) for children.

""The terrible storms and floods that have been ravaging NSW for the past few days are taking a heavy toll,"" Morrison said in a video address accompanying the post, mentioning that he has been in regular contact with Berejiklian.

The Prime Minister praised emergency workers and volunteers in his comments, urging people in flood-hit regions to listen to their advice and warnings, saying ""for now, our message is very clear to keep yourself safe, to keep your family safe and those around you to follow the instructions of the very competent, professional agencies and bodies and the volunteers who support them.""

Heavy rains are expected to continue in the upcoming week, with a rain band forecast to move across the state from the west, bringing significant rainfall to he northern inland and northwestern slopes, said Agata Imielska of the Bureau of Meteorology. The worst-affected areas could see rain totals more than four times the March monthly average falling in just two days.

Flooding on the Hawkesbury River, which runs north and west of Sydney, is expected to be as bad as a similar event that occurred in 1961, according to a statement from the Bureau of Meteorology.

More than 130 schools in New South Wales will close on Monday, with some requiring ""maintenance and repair,"" according to a press release from local officials.

Wednesday will be the first day of some reprieve, with rains expected to lighten into showers.","Sun, 21 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210320235600-01-australia-floods-0320-super-tease.jpg,"['nsw', 'natural', 'residents', 'lost', 'floods', 'rains', 'declare', '100', 'sydney', 'event', 'australia', 'emergency', 'parts', 'flood', 'state', 'homes', 'disaster']",,flood

CANBERRA, Australia -- Two men trapped in vehicles hundreds of kilometers (miles) apart have become the first fatalities of record flooding on Australia's east coast.

A car got trapped in floodwater northwest of Sydney at dawn Wednesday and emergency services later recovered it with a body inside, officials said. The body, believed to be that of a 25-year-old Pakistani national, has yet to be formally identified.

An emergency crew later retrieved the body of David Hornman from an upturned pickup truck in a flooded creek 680 kilometers (420 miles) north near Gold Coast city in Queensland state, police said. The 38-year-old was last seen Monday.

While rain has eased across New South Wales and southern Queensland, flooding has persisted. Most rivers had peaked by Thursday, but 20,000 people were still evacuated from their homes, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

Emergency services have made hundreds of rescues since the flooding began last week. Parts of New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, have received one-in-50-year and one-in-100-year rainfall records in the past week.

Insurance companies expect the damage in New South Wales to exceed 1 billion Australian dollars ($760 million).

Before the Queensland death was reported, Prime Minister Scott Morrison expressed the Parliament’s condolences to the family of the man who died in the rural suburb of Sydney.

Morrison reflected on the state’s recent struggles — years of drought across most of the state culminated in catastrophic wildfires last summer. The fires were followed by the coronavirus pandemic and now record floods.

“We have seen so much over the course of the past year and more as this country has battled so many things — floods, fires, viruses, drought and now these floods again,” Morrison told Parliament.

In the Vatican, Pope Francis offered encouragement in the aftermath of the Australian flooding.

“In the past days, great floods have caused serious damage in New South Wales,” Francis said in his customary Wednesday remarks to the faithful.

“I stand close to the people and the families hit by this calamity, especially those who saw their houses destroyed. I encourage those who are helping to look for the dispersed and to bring their support,” he added.

A flotilla of boats was delivering crucial supplies to isolated communities on the flooded Hawkesbury River northwest of Sydney and ferrying stranded residents to safety.

Morrison took a flight over the river to survey the damage Wednesday.

“The expanse of water that went right across that region was quite devastating to see and to see the homes, only their roofs and those of out sheds,” Morrison said.

Cabinet Minister Peter Dutton said more than 700 defense personnel would soon be deployed as the floods recede to help people return to their homes and businesses as quickly as possible.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_c5260be5bcb145afaa99bce89177ab75_16x9_992.jpg,"['past', 'queensland', 'morrison', 'fatalities', 'australian', 'trapped', 'floods', 'record', 'drivers', 'wales', 'flooding', 'flood', 'south', 'state']",,flood

11,11,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Analysis: 'Wilful ignorance': Flood-hit Australia urged to rethink climate adaptation - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-floods-climate-adaptation-a-idUSKBN2BI00D,"(Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Australia, now battling its worst floods in more than half a century, has failed to adapt fast enough to the growing threats it faces from the impacts of climate change, with its people now suffering the effects of “wilful ignorance”, analysts warned.

Heavy rains hit several parts of the country this week, sweeping away houses, roads and livestock and cutting off entire towns in the east. Dangerous flash floods killed two people and more than 40,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

“They call Australia ‘disaster alley’ because we’ve got a bit of everything,” said Karl Mallon, CEO of Sydney-based Climate Valuation, which advises homeowners and buyers on climate and extreme weather risks.

As global warming accelerates, it is bringing fiercer storms, floods and heatwaves, more severe droughts and a growing risk of bushfires to Australia.

“It’s a shame on us that we haven’t tackled this already... We’ve got every incentive and the money to do it, it’s just that we’re not looking at it,” Mallon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Despite knowing about climate change since the 1980s, Australia continues to build homes in floodplains, he noted.

The problem is often rooted in “wilful ignorance”, he said, citing government reliance on land taxes, builders and developers putting profits before safety from climate threats, and homeowners seeking to minimise insurance payments.

Property buyers are given little information on flood risks, either by local government or banks and insurers, Mallon said.

“Sometimes the first time they find out is when they get hit - and they say ‘I didn’t know I was in a flood zone’,” he added.

Richie Merzian, climate and energy programme director at think-tank The Australia Institute, said so far the approach to adapting to climate change impacts has been disjointed between federal, state and council levels, curbing resilience.

“The federal government seems allergic to any mention of climate change which hampers smart policy responses,” he said.

‘SELF-COMBUSTING MANURE’

Last year’s bushfires - which Prime Minister Scott Morrison dubbed Australia’s “black summer” - killed more than 30 people, destroyed wildlife and razed over 24 million hectares (59 million acres).

When the crisis hit, Morrison’s deputy was reported to have partly blamed “self-combusting piles of manure”.

Meanwhile, the health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, the world’s most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem, is in a critical state and deteriorating as climate change heats up the waters where it lies, conservation groups say.

“The first thing is to acknowledge that climate impacts will get worse and that ‘one-in-100-years’ type events will become more common, and we need to plan for that reality,” said Cam Walker, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth Australia.

To deal with the risks, a region-based approach to adaptation should be crafted that allows for joined-up responses between different levels of government and communities, he said.

Mallon said government, mortgage lenders and insurers needed to offer homeowners incentives to upgrade and better protect their properties, ensuring roofs are stronger against storms and flood barriers built around high-risk buildings.

At a municipal level, increased drainage, better sea walls and modern fire-fighting equipment would help, he added.

To reduce damage from bushfires, he advised at-risk property owners to clear guttering of flammable materials, install sprinklers and shutters that keep out embers, and use fire-retardant paint.

NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN

Australia has sophisticated weather monitoring systems and has been able to issue flood warnings and evacuate those in harm’s way, potentially saving thousands of lives, said Merzian at The Australia Institute.

But despite the country’s vulnerability to climate impacts, the government has been slow to conduct a national climate assessment or prepare a National Adaptation Plan, he said.

In January, Australia’s environment minister committed to produce a new climate resilience and adaptation strategy this year, which it is due to publish before the COP26 U.N. climate talks in November.

As part of the initiative, Canberra said it would invest an initial A$12.9 million ($9.8 million) to prepare for disasters.

Protecting and restoring wetlands, mangroves and forests would help shield communities from floods and storms, while more trees in cities would also ease the effects of heat, green groups say.

Changing crops and tilling practices, and introducing livestock breeds that can tolerate drier conditions, are other options to combat droughts, said Will Steffen, a climate scientist at the Australian National University.

But conservative governments have been reluctant to change well-established practices in the agriculture and construction sectors, he said, adding that climate change has become “a partisan political issue”.

BAND-AIDS ON BULLET-HOLES

Environmentalists say Australia is its own worst enemy due to its continued reliance on coal-fired power, which makes it one of the world’s largest carbon-emitters per capita.

Green groups have long lobbied the government to ditch fossil fuels and set a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050 - so far with little success.

“The government’s failure to significantly cut emissions puts Australia and the Pacific region at risk of more fires, floods and cyclones,” said Martin Zavan, campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.

“When it comes to adaptation, you can’t put a band-aid on a bullet-hole and expect it to get better,” he added.

Friends of the Earth’s Walker noted that Australia had produced 240 reports on natural disasters since 1920, but citizens were still suffering the consequences.

“Adaptation without (emissions) mitigation means surrender on the issue of climate change,” he said.

12,12,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Australia Floods Disrupt COVID-19 Vaccinations - VOA Asia,https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/australia-floods-disrupt-covid-19-vaccinations,"SYDNEY - Widespread flooding is disrupting the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia as thousands of people are forced to leave their homes.

Emergency crews in eastern Australia have responded to thousands of calls for help. The rain in many areas has been unrelenting. For the first time in years, Sydney’s main reservoir is overflowing, putting suburbs at risk of flooding. Authorities are reporting once-in-a-century downpours north of Sydney, and thousands of people have been told to leave their homes.

Near the town of Taree, a house occupied by a young couple was washed away down a river by floodwaters on what was supposed to have been their wedding day.

The bride, Sarah Soars, told Australian television the property was swept away within minutes.

“I am lost for words. I do not know even what to say, like, everything that we owned, everything that we worked hard for (has) gone within ten minutes and it was out of our sight,” Soars said.

Campaign group Greenpeace has linked the severe storms in eastern Australia to climate change, and the burning of coal, oil and gas.

The wild weather is disrupting Australia’s mass coronavirus inoculation program.

More than six million Australians are now eligible for an injection in the next phase of the vaccination rollout.

Australia’s medical regulator has approved domestic production of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Federal health minister Greg Hunt says the drug is safe.

“This is a fundamental decision which locks in for Australia access to 50 million units of domestically produced vaccines. It means that the manufacturing process has been approved. It is safe, effective (and) meets all of the requirements from one of the toughest regulators in the world,” Hunt said.

Vaccines made by AstraZeneca and Pfizer are approved for use in Australia.

One of Australia’s most senior medical officials, Federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy, has said international travel into and out of Australia would be severely restricted for the rest of the year until global COVID-19 vaccinations are more widely administered.

Australia closed its international borders a year ago to foreign travelers because of the pandemic.

Murphy said life in Australia would get back to normal, but it would take time and patience was needed.

Insurance claims from the flooding are now estimated to have driven a loss of A$438 million, according to the latest figures from the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA).

The ICA’s tally of claims filed due to the flooding and severe weather catastrophe across parts of New South Wales and Queensland is now approaching 30,000 and this figure is expected to continue rising over the coming days.

Australia’s largest primary insurance carriers are expected to exceed their catastrophe budgets for the latest fiscal year, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley, with reinsurance recoveries expected through their quota shares and potentially their excess-of-loss towers.

As we explained Friday, IAG estimated the net cost of the floods and weather at approximately A$135 million after its quota share reinsurance, but A$200 million pre-quota share.

IAG’s net costs from the flood event will be capped at A$169 million, which is its maximum retention per-event, for a first event, under its 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program. So if the claims situation deteriorates IAG could certainly see a recovery under this tower.

In addition, the company said that it expects the heavy rain and flooding event will erode around $150 million of the $400 million deductible on this aggregate reinsurance tower.

Morgan Stanley’s analyst team believe that Suncorp is likely to similarly exceed its catastrophe budget for the period as a result of the flooding and rains, which could again mean the pair of insurers are required to increase these budgets for next year.

Australia’s insurers have steadily been increasing their catastrophe budgets and strengthening their reinsurance provisions in recent years, as weather and climate related catastrophe events have hit their businesses hard.

Favourable pricing on the inwards sides of their businesses will help to offset higher catastrophe budgets and costs somewhat, but there are also expected to be higher cost burdens on the other side, in their reinsurance purchases, Morgan Stanley’s analysts said.

The analysts report that feedback from reinsurance firms suggests these Australian insurers recent years of catastrophe losses and resulting loss-making are seen as an issue.

As a result, the cost of reinsurance protection is expected to rise further for them at the next renewals and increasingly, the Australian carriers are seen as sensitive to these higher costs.

However, lowering the volatility in their businesses is seen as key and of course reinsurance is one way to achieve that.

Both of these insurers catastrophe budgets are rising as a percentage of net earned premiums and have been on an upwards trajectory for well over a decade now.

It’s no surprise we’ve seen the introduction of stop-loss layers in their reinsurance programs, nor that aggregate reinsurance has proven so important to them and seen them sharing a large proportion of their losses with global reinsurers and also ILS funds in recent years.

Reinsurance capital is only going to become more important for these companies, as they deal with the rising costs of frequent and severe weather and catastrophe losses.

But they will pay more for access to it, which could make looking at how they can lock-in protection over multiple years increasingly attractive and may result in them looking to reinsurance from the capital markets, potentially even through catastrophe bonds.

15,15,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Increased urban development in Australia could make future floods worse - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/22/increased-urban-density-in-australia-could-make-future-floods-worse,"Around 70,000 people currently live on the Hawkesbury Nepean floodplain. The need to protect these residents and their properties is the reason why these floods require an emergency response.

If people were relocated from the floodplain, such floods would be witnessed as little more than the natural phenomena that have occurred here for millions of years. Floods replenish floodplains with nutrients and groundwater tables with water.

But it is not our plan to relocate people from the floodplain. Instead, the New South Wales government has plans to increase the floodplain population from around 70,000 to 200,000 people by 2050.

If we are intentionally putting people on a notorious floodplain, we will carry a burden of responsibility to protect them as much as we can. This means we must find ways to reduce the frequency of both minor and major flooding events.

Adding an extra 14 metres to the height of the Warragamba Dam wall is an option currently favoured by the NSW government. This would create an additional capacity of around 1,000 gigalitres volume, which could be used to capture large flood events and release them later, once it is safe to do so.

WaterNSW modelling suggests this current event could deliver 1,500GL to Warragamba Dam. In that case, 1,000 GL of storage would help delay a spill for a couple of days, but the inflows would still produce a spill of the last 500GL. Whether that would significantly reduce the peak flood heights on the Hawkesbury-Nepean would depend on whether the delayed spill coincides with peaks from other tributary inflows. It’s all about the timing.

Every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later ... is a flood mitigation success

WaterNSW estimates that only about half the water in the Hawkesbury Nepean system has come from the Warragamba spill. The remainder came from other tributaries, including the upper Nepean River and the Grose River. Effective flood mitigation requires that the timing of any Warragamba spill be such that it does not coincide with peak flows from these sources.

There is another important source of water to the river, which might easily be overlooked, and for which timing is also very important. This is the urban runoff from highly built-up areas such as Penrith. Like spills from Warragamba, the timing of urban runoff will determine the significance of these flows in contributing to flood peaks.

Areas with lots of impervious surfaces, such as roofs, roads and footpaths, convert rainfall into runoff very rapidly and efficiently. This runoff drains to urban stormwater systems, which deliver the water to local waterways. In western Sydney, these local waterways include the Hawkesbury Nepean River and other tributaries that run into it, such as South Creek and Eastern Creek.

Prior to urban development, undeveloped land is composed primarily of “pervious surfaces”, such as bushland and grassy fields. Being “pervious” means water drains down through the soil and into the groundwater table. Water moves underground and much of this groundwater might eventually make its way to Hawkesbury Nepean River. However, it will do so very slowly, arriving gradually and long after the flood peak has passed.

As urban density increases, the proportion of impervious surfaces also increases. This means stormwater will be more rapidly generated and quickly transferred to waterways. By increasing urban density in western Sydney, we could easily further exacerbate the flood risks for the region.

The good news is that there are steps we can take to design our urban environment in a way that minimises the impacts of impervious surfaces. This is often referred to as “water sensitive urban design” and the advantages can extend well beyond flood mitigation.

A city with good water-sensitive urban design is one that is designed for rainwater to be captured, slowed, reused and percolated into the ground. Plentiful pervious surfaces are essential, including back yards, gardens, verges and parklands. With new technologies, even footpaths and driveways can now be made from relatively pervious materials.

Runoff from impervious surfaces should be directed toward the available pervious surfaces to maximise infiltration opportunity. Since infiltration rates are limited, storage is required to hold water until more infiltration capacity becomes available. Storage can be provided by household rainwater tanks, as well as wetlands, lagoons and ponds.

In a large rainfall event, every drop of water that the urban environment can retain to reuse later or infiltrate to groundwater is a flood mitigation success. In this way, appropriate urban design can enable further urban development while not exacerbating already serious flood risks.

In times of drought, cities that incorporate water sensitive urban design contribute by maximising the beneficial use of rainwater, thus reducing demand on limited drinking water supplies. Furthermore, water-sensitive cities tend to be highly liveable cities, with plentiful green space and parkland for recreation.

Whatever the future has in store for western Sydney, the future residents will be better served by water-sensitive urban design than by the catastrophe of another impervious concrete jungle.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd617cfe6d16a29bb1fc55af31e33ca4aa56324/0_319_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=28439f2eef8c7933dd127f3922f79e16,"['future', 'khan', 'water', 'worse', 'spill', 'pervious', 'floods', 'design', 'river', 'nepean', 'australia', 'urban', 'warragamba', 'stuart', 'development', 'surfaces', 'increased', 'flood']",,flood
16,16,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"Australia endures droughts, fires, floods and marauding mice - ABC News",https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/australia-endures-droughts-fires-floods-marauding-mice-76697017,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Rob Costigan bought a rugged farm in rural Australia three years ago with the dream of building it into something he could leave to his kids.

One year later, he was needing to truck in water to battle an extreme drought. Then Australia's deadly wildfires raged perilously close in late 2019, forcing Costigan to spend day after day stamping out embers and running sprinklers on his roof to save his home, in an eerie atmosphere he likens to Armageddon.

Then last week, on the day his daughter Eva was supposed to be celebrating her 11th birthday, came the floods. Thankfully, the family had already left to stay at his brother's home.

The water roared through with such force it lifted both Costigan's farmhouse and a second home where his father-in-law lived from their foundations, destroying both. The family is still picking up toys and clothes strewn far and wide — they even found their gas barbecue bottle stuck in a tree.

“Just disbelief,” said Costigan. “It feels like the world's against us. You work your guts out and then to have it all just washed away in the blink of an eye.”

Costigan, 40, a road maintenance worker whose farm is in the Hollisdale community about a five-hour drive north of Sydney, said he's thankful that so far he's managed to avoid yet another disaster — the plague of mice that is affecting some farms in the region. Maybe, he hopes, the floods will help wash them away.

Australia has always been a land of harsh weather, where droughts and fires form part of the nation's psyche. But experts say that global warming is likely making recent weather events more extreme. The raging wildfires that burned through until early last year killed at least 33 people and destroyed more than 3,000 homes.

“These events are expected,” said Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales. “But climate change has put them on steroids.”

She explained that, paradoxically, a warming atmosphere can worsen both droughts and floods. The extra heat can suck more moisture from the ground during droughts. But warmer air can also hold more moisture, she said, so that when it does rain, it pours.

Some towns in New South Wales have set 50- or 100-year records for rainfall over the past week. The floods have killed two men in separate incidents, both of whom were trapped in their cars, and have forced more than 20,000 people from their homes.

Dale Ward this week was trying to clean out the rental apartment she owns, and where her daughter and their family live, in the town of Windsor. She said she was mopping up sludge after about 1 foot (30 centimeters) of water coursed through, destroying a box of photos and other memorabilia.

“It's like someone dropped three tons of dirt in your house, and then dropped a bucket of water over the top,” she said.

Ward estimates it will take at least a month to get the place habitable again, with plumbers and electricians needed to get everything fixed.

Elsewhere, people are still dealing with the plague of mice. Last year in eastern Australia, months of rain doused wildfires and ended a drought that had crippled the region for more than two years. That led to bumper crops on many farms, and an explosion in the mouse population.

Pompy Singh, the manager of the Spar supermarket in the town of Gulargambone, said they started to notice the number of mice increasing before Christmas. They used to set one or two traps a day, he said. They started buying much larger traps and setting many more of them until they had 20 set all the time.

Suddenly they were catching 100 or 200 mice each day. The critters began eating through everything, getting into the lettuce, the potato chips, the dog food, even the tobacco. Singh said they started storing everything in refrigerators or sealed containers.

Still, he said, the mice kept coming. Some days, they were catching up to 600. Even the fridges kept breaking down as the mice chewed through the wiring. Singh said the numbers of mice seem to have decreased somewhat since the floods hit, although they're still catching plenty.

And Australia's troubles may not yet be done. Some experts have been warning people to check their shoes and clothes for deadly spiders, as swarms of them seek refuge from the floodwaters by moving into residential homes.

Meanwhile, Costigan said he intends to rebuild. He’s spent too much time putting up fences on his farm — many of which survived the flooding — and making other improvements to give up now. He adds that he moved his small herd of cattle to higher ground before the floods hit and they all survived.

Costigan said he feels lucky his farmhouse is insured and is also thankful to family members and neighbors who have contributed to an online fund to help his family rebuild.

He said these kind of troubles all come with living in Australia, and even perhaps explain why the British initially treated the continent as a place to send their prisoners.

This has been shown during the recent flooding crisis of New South Wales, writes climate scientist Joelle Gergis.

The extreme weather can be mostly attributed to greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity, which disrupt the water cycle and increase atmospheric pressure.

More research needs to be done to improve climate risk assessment; the further analysis of historical weather data can increase understanding.

Over the past three years, I’ve been working on the forthcoming report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I’m a climate scientist who contributed to the chapter on global water cycle changes. It’s concerning to think some theoretical impacts described in this report may be coming to life – yet again – in Australia.

The recent flooding in New South Wales is consistent with what we might expect as climate change continues.

Australia’s natural rainfall patterns are highly variable. This means the influence climate change has on any single weather event is difficult to determine; the signal is buried in the background of a lot of climatic “noise”.

But as our planet warms, the water-holding capacity of the lower atmosphere increases by around 7% for every 1℃ of warming. This can cause heavier rainfall, which in turn increases flood risk.

The oceans are also warming, especially at the surface. This drives up both evaporation rates and the transport of moisture into weather systems. This makes wet seasons and wet events wetter than usual.

So while Australia has always experienced floods, disasters like the one unfolding in NSW are likely to become more frequent and intense as climate change continues.

Understanding the basics

To understand how a warming world is influencing the water cycle, it’s helpful to return to the theory.

From year to year, Australia’s climate is subject to natural variability generated by the surrounding Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans. The dominant drivers for a given year set up the background climate conditions that influence rainfall and temperature.

It is a combination of these natural climate drivers that makes Australia the land of drought and flooding rains.

However, Australia’s climate variability is no longer influenced by natural factors alone. Australia’s climate has warmed by 1.4℃ since national records began in 1910, with most of the warming occurring since 1970. Human-caused greenhouse emissions have influenced Australian temperatures in our region since 1950.

This warming trend influences the background conditions under which both extremes of the rainfall cycle will operate as the planet continues to warm. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture (higher water vapour content), which can lead to more extreme rainfall events.

Since the winter of 2020, Australia has been influenced by the La Niña phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Historically, sustained La Niña conditions, sometimes with the help of a warmer than average Indian Ocean, have set the scene for severe flooding in eastern Australia.

During these events, easterly winds intensify and oceans around Australia warm. This is associated with the Walker Circulation – a giant seesaw of atmospheric pressure that influences the distribution of warm ocean waters across the Pacific Ocean.

The ocean and atmospheric conditions associated with La Niña conditions. Image: Bureau of Meteorology

The last La Niña occurred in 2010–2012. It led to widespread flooding across eastern Australia, with particularly devastating effects in Queensland. The event caused the wettest two-year period in the Australian rainfall record, ending the 1997–2009 Millennium Drought.

Oceanographers from UNSW studied the exceptional event. They demonstrated how a warmer ocean increased the likelihood of extreme rain during that event, primarily through increased transport of moist air along the coast.

Their analysis highlighted how long‐term ocean warming can modify rain-producing systems, increasing the probability of extreme rainfall during La Niña events.

It is important to point out that changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are still not as well understood as fundamental changes in thermodynamics. However, because regional rainfall changes will be influenced by both factors, it will take researchers time to tease everything out.

NSW rainfall totals for the week ending March 22, 2021 Image: Bureau of Meteorology

What’s interesting about the 2020–2021 La Niña is that it was weak compared with historical events. The relationship between La Niña and rainfall is generally weaker in coastal NSW than further inland. However, it’s concerning that this weak La Niña caused flooding comparable to the iconic floods of the 1950s and 1970s.

The rainfall totals for the current floods are yet to be analysed. However, early figures reveal the enormity of the downpours. For example, over the week to March 23, the town of Comboyne, southwest of Port Macquarie, recorded an extraordinary 935mm of rainfall. This included three successive days with more than 200mm.

The NSW coast is no stranger to extreme rainfall – there have been five events in the past decade with daily totals exceeding 400mm. However, the current event is unusual because of its duration and geographic extent.

It’s also worth noting the current extreme rainfall in NSW was associated with a coastal trough, not an East Coast Low. Many of the region’s torrential rainfall events in the past have resulted from East Coast Lows, although their rainfall is normally more localised than has been the case in this widespread event.

Remember that as the air warms, its water-holding capacity increases, particularly over the oceans. Current ocean temperatures around eastern and northern Australia are about 1℃ warmer than the long-term average, and closer to 1.5℃ warmer than average off the NSW coast. These warmer conditions are likely to be fuelling the systems driving the extreme rainfall and associated flooding in NSW.

A nation exposed

Weather and climate are not the only influences on extreme flood events. Others factors include the shape and size of water catchments, the presence of hard surfaces in urban areas (which cant’t absorb water), and the density of human settlement in flood-prone areas.

The Hawkesbury–Nepean region in Western Sydney, currently experiencing major flooding, is a prime example. Five major tributaries, including the Warragamba and Nepean Rivers, flow into this extensively urbanised valley.

Improving our understanding of historical weather data may help improve future climate change risk assessment. For example, past floods in the Hawkesbury–Nepean have been a lot worse than the current disaster. In 1867, the Hawkesbury River at Windsor reached 19.7 metres above normal, and in 1961 peaked at 14.5 metres. This is worse than the 13.12 metres above normal recorded at Freemans Reach on March 23.

It’s sobering to think the Hawkesbury River once peaked 6 metres higher than what we’re seeing right now. Imagine the potential future flooding caused by an East Coast Low during strong La Niña conditions.","Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/PSHqY5NQqntMNQwxnj5hNfTqkhIrFVt7Yprgxyf8a4I.png,"['change', 'climate', 'conditions', 'water', 'niña', 'warmer', 'events', 'floods', 'rainfall', 'going', 'expert', 'la', 'australias', 'flooding', 'extreme']",,flood

NPR's Ailsa Chang speaks with reporter Laura Chung of the Sydney Morning Herald on how eastern Australia is coping with the worst flooding in decades less than two years after devastating bush fires.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Less than two years after bushfires blazed across Australia, the country's east coast is seeing its worst flooding in decades. Some areas accumulated over a yard of rainfall since downpours started last Thursday. Tens of thousands have been ordered to evacuate. On Sunday alone, 500 gigaliters of water, the same volume of water in Sydney Harbor - spilled out of Sydney's largest dam. Even as rain subsides, the floodwater will still pose trouble for weeks to come. We're joined now by Laura Chung, who has been reporting on all of this for the Sydney Morning Herald.

Welcome.

LAURA CHUNG: Thank you for having me.

CHANG: Thank you for being with us. So what are you hearing from people on the ground there? Can you talk about the scope of the damage that they've seen so far?

CHUNG: Of course. So unlike the bushfires, we don't actually have a clear image of how much has just been damaged and destroyed. We know it's a significant part of the state. But what we do know is there has been water everywhere. We've heard and seen houses just being picked up and floating down rivers that used to be farms and paddocks. We've heard of livestock just being completely washed away. There are videos of cows and horses just trying to make it through these really heavy floodwaters. And what used to be streets and paddocks are just now, yeah, completely flooded with water right up to where the power lines are.

CHANG: Wow.

CHUNG: So if you can imagine that, it is a very striking image.

CHANG: What about people who didn't or weren't able to evacuate and are now stranded? I mean, how are rescue operations going right now?

CHUNG: For a lot of people who live in these low-lying plains, floods aren't anything new to them. They've lived with them before. They know how to prepare for them. But there are a lot of people who were just not quite ready for how quickly the water would come up. So we've got thousands of volunteers from the State Emergency Service who are out there along with police and interstate help as well, who are rescuing people in boats. We've also seen helicopters being deployed to try and airlift people out of certain areas. And you know, not only are volunteers having to deal with the really intense flooding conditions. They're also having to deal with the wildlife that's coming their way as well. So there's this story of these volunteers who were rescuing this family, trekking over several kilometers to get to the family. And as they're returning, they got a message over the radio that they have to be aware of snakes. And they reported snakes kind of shimmying up the side of the boat and taking refuge with them just to...

CHANG: Oh, goodness.

CHUNG: ...Get out of that floodwater.

CHANG: Well, Laura, we spoke to you back in December 2019 when the bushfires were spreading across the area. And I'm curious - how do you think recovery from that disaster has affected recovery from this disaster? I mean, we're talking about communities that were just starting to rebuild, right?

CHUNG: Exactly. And they've gone through the bushfires and then - last year - and then immediately after that, there was a first round of floods, and then they were hit by the pandemic and now these floods again. So it's just been crisis after crisis and compounding their loss. Now, one farmer I spoke to had gone through, you know, all these crises. And he said, you know, what the fires didn't take, the floods have taken. And this sentiment has been repeated to me by so many people in that they've already suffered so many losses that this time around, they don't really have anything else to lose. There is this sense of, what next? You know, it's just hit us again and again and again.

CHANG: Well, I understand that much of the rain has dissipated now. Can I just ask you, what is it like to finally see some blue skies and some sunshine where you are right now?

CHUNG: It is a very welcome sight (laughter) - a very strange sight after about seven days of rain.

CHANG: Yeah.

CHUNG: But I think the message that we've constantly heard is the danger is not over. For many people, the flood and the cleanup has only just started. And many residents are saying, well, yes, while we've survived the floods, we've got months of trying to get our lives back on track.

CHANG: Laura Chung of the Sydney Morning Herald, thank you so much for your reporting. And stay safe.

CHUNG: Thank you for having me.

As I watched the rain pour down in my area on Sydney's northern beaches I considered changing my name to Noah - it seemed such a biblical event.

Then to visit some of the worst-hit areas closer to Sydney, an area called Windsor. It was the first small settlement outside old Sydney town to be populated by British settlers after the arrival of the first fleet.

It boasts the oldest pub in New South Wales, built in 1813 (although some would argue that). And it maintains the only true Memorial Square to settlement on the continent.

Yet all that history looked certain to be washed away in a deluge of water unprecedented in this area for 60 years.

Few people here remember the floods of 1961 - thought to be the worst of all time. That record was about to be smashed for all the wrong reasons.

Nestled on the Hawkesbury River about an hours drive northwest of Sydney, Windsor was literally smashed as the river rose 13 metres, more than 40 feet, not in days, in hours.

Paul Luckman moved with his family from Liverpool in England attracted by the sunny climate and small-town friendliness of Windsor. He bought a home on the banks of the Hawkesbury but far enough away to avoid flooding. Or so he thought.

In a matter of hours, Mr Luckman watched a surge of water rise towards his home, eating 20 yards off the backyard, before entering his house.

He was moving furniture as furiously as he could - but the water was winning the battle. Eventually, having done all he could, he left for dryer ground and prayed he'd survive the worst.

When he returned today to see the damage the water had reached his front gate. It was just 3ft from the street. He had never seen anything like this before, but was strangely sanguine about what had occurred.

It appears he's adopted some of that Aussie battler spirit with his move to Australia. After what's happened he'll need it.

The facts and figures from this deluge are quite startling. The crisis literally stretches from the Queensland border in the north to Victoria in the south. It goes from the east coast inland for more than 100 miles.

It has swollen every major river and catchment in that area, with all waterways spilling water in the lands nearby. The total flood area is twice the size of the UK.

They're sobering statistics even for someone like myself who has covered calamity and natural disasters for most of my adult life.

Tonight as I finished with my last live cross to Sky News the sun popped out, welcome but somehow a stranger after nine days being absent. It's a sign for locals, or so they believe, that the worst is somehow behind them.

Yet even with the sun shining, humidity rising with the temperature, so oddly are the water levels - an inch in just one hour before sunset tonight. As I write this fresh warnings have been issued in areas so far thought safe.

Water pouring from swollen rivers into their tributaries flooding fresh lands, threatening more homes, sandbags piling outside even more businesses.

In a country that has suffered drought, hellish bushfires, a pandemic, then this flood on a mass scale, many people are wondering when it is all going to stop.

21,21,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"Drought, fire and flood devastate Australians in the bush - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-weather-farmer-idUSKBN2BL0JZ,"HOLLISDALE, Australia (Reuters) - Robert Costigan thought the worst was behind him when he saved two family properties from bushfires a summer ago.

This year, they floated away.

The homes of the Australian cattle farmer and his father-in-law Brian Watt, who lives next door, were swept off their foundations this month when heavy rains caused rivers to reach their highest levels in half a century, submerging bridges and buildings. Watt’s house slammed into a telegraph pole.

“If it wasn’t for bad luck I’d probably have none at all,” Costigan told Reuters at his 100-acre property at Hollisdale, 400km (249 miles) north of Sydney.

Days after the floods, the property was strewn with upended farm equipment, trees and debris.

“I don’t know whether it’s just someone testing me or what, but it is what it is I guess. You get through it,” he added, fighting back tears.

Costigan’s ordeal is familiar to thousands living outside cities on Australia’s densely populated east coast.

After years of drought devastated crops and livestock, they battled the country’s worst wildfires in a generation in the Southern hemisphere summer of 2019-20, only to face flooding amid a La Nina wet weather event this year.

The same river system Costigan pumped water from to save his house from the bushfires has returned to destroy it with flood.

Water levels have subsided but insurers have written off the building, with structural timber torn loose, tin roofs crushed and everyday objects - a mattress, a fluffy child’s toy - reduced to a sodden mess.

When the fires hit, the family kept safe in town as Costigan remained at the property in an effort to protect it. Now they are all staying with neighbours, homeless and heartbroken.

Two days before the house was swept away, Costigan’s daughter Eva had to cancel her 11th birthday party due to the flood.

“She was upset about that and then we had to tell her that she lost her house Saturday morning. All the presents that she got Thursday are gone,” Costigan said.

Still, the 39-year-old farmer, who also works for the local council, vowed to rebuild.

“I’ve worked too hard to just walk away from it,” he said.","Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20210329&t=2&i=1556556273&r=LYNXMPEH2S0B4&w=800,"['costigan', 'worst', 'farmer', 'drought', 'swept', 'hollisdale', 'bush', 'house', 'levels', 'family', 'property', 'summer', 'australians', 'devastate', 'flood']",,flood_and_drought
22,22,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Low reinsurance retentions to help Australian insurers as flood claims rise - Artemis.bm,https://www.artemis.bm/news/low-reinsurance-retentions-to-help-australian-insurers-as-flood-claims-rise/,"Australia’s flooding catastrophe event continues and has spread, with the Insurance Council warning that its estimate of losses has already reached A$254 million as of early today, while its designation of the catastrophe event has expanded to include South East Queensland.



As of early today, the number of claims filed and recorded by the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) had passed 17,000.

Yesterday, the ICA highlighted the billion dollar loss potential of the flooding and related storms.

15% of the claims filed so far are from the Queensland area, hence the expansion of the designated catastrophe event to include parts of that state.

Previously, the ICA had declared a flood catastrophe event for large parts of New South Wales.

The main concerns continue to be around western Sydney, but with flood waters spreading the expectation is that claims will rise and perhaps significantly, as it remains early days for filing given the ongoing event.

The ICA has estimated an initial insurance and potentially reinsurance market loss of A$254.2 million, which is based on the average cost of claims from previous similar events, not the actual cost of claims filed.

IAG, which is Australia’s largest general insurer, said that as of this morning local time it had received 5,811 claims for damage to homes, properties, and vehicles.

That’s up significantly from the 2,100 claims IAG had reported as of Sunday.

The expectation continues that this will prove to be the latest reinsurance event after a catastrophe in Australia.

S&P Global Ratings highlighted that while the Australian flooding will drive an influx of claims for the country’s property and casualty (P&C) insurers, it is not expected to hurt their credit quality.

Supporting their credit quality is reinsurance capital and the major Australian P&C carriers have ample in-force for this kind of event.

“While the ultimate losses for individual insurers will vary–depending on their exposure to the hardest hit areas, the declared number of events, and the structure of their reinsurance arrangements–we expect these to be manageable,” S&P explained.

Adding, “We expect it will take weeks for many claims to be lodged. Nevertheless, we believe that Australia’s P/C insurers are well-placed to assess and meet claims that arise with reinsurance protection shielding the larger insurers from outsized losses.

“The three largest primary insurers have relatively low retentions, in the A$150 million to A$250 million range, before catastrophe reinsurance kicks in.”

Those low catastrophe retentions may prove vital for some insurers with these floods, enabling them to claim on occurrence towers.

There is also a chance of further aggregate tower deductible erosion and perhaps some aggregate reinsurance recoveries, depending on how high claims rise.

The Copernicus Emergency Management Service has published some very useful flood inundation maps, which you can access here.

Floodwaters continue to rise in some areas and the peak may still be a day away as waters surge down rivers. But rainfall levels have tapered off a little, suggesting the worst from this specific catastrophe event may soon be behind the affected region.

The setup up steering so much rain into New South Wales is getting a fresh blast of moisture from the north, ensuring heavy rains continue. What’s worse, the area of rainfall is expanding and areas previously spared from the worst of the wild weather will now be in the target. The Bureau of Meteorology is calling for inland locations to receive up to a month of rain over the next 48 hours.

The agency is warning residents living in these inland parts of New South Wales that shifting rainfall patterns could create “life-threatening” conditions. Areas along the border with Queensland to the north will also see up to 7.9 inches (200 millimeters) of rainfall, and the agency has issued rainfall warnings for that state as well as the state of Victoria.

And, because, again, Australia can’t catch a break, there are spiders. The Guardian reported that residents of New South Wales have spotted droves of spiders and other insects fleeing en masse from the rising floodwaters. In some slightly better news than huge swarms of spiders, the rain has also ground coal exports in the region to a halt.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/e1sandluaj4xygszjiqs.jpg","['residents', 'north', 'rain', 'onceinacentury', 'floods', 'rainfall', 'engulfed', 'inland', 'wales', 'australia', 'spiders', 'south', 'state']",,flood
24,24,FL-2021-000025-AUS,"IAG highlights agg erosion, as Australia flood claims pass A$385m - Artemis.bm",https://www.artemis.bm/news/iag-highlights-agg-erosion-as-australia-flood-claims-pass-a385m/,"The severe flooding and storms affecting parts of Australia have already been counted to have driven insurance claims amounting to A$385 million and this number will rise significantly.



The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) said this morning that it has counted 25,681 insurance claims to-date with an estimated loss of A$385m, due to the floods and severe weather catastrophe across parts of New South Wales and Queensland.

Flood waters are now beginning to subside and rainfall levels have dropped, but claims are expected to continue to be filed over the coming days and weeks.

Insurer IAG has reported that it has received roughly 8,000 claims, as of yesterday afternoon (March 25th), but expects the number to rise.

The claims are largely related to property damage, the insurer said, and based on its exposure and the claims received to-date IAG estimates the net cost of the floods and weather at approximately A$135 million.

That’s after IAG has shared a portion of the losses with its quota share reinsurance partners and the bill is estimated at A$200 million pre-quota share, the carrier said.

IAG said that its net costs from the flood event will be capped at A$169 million, which is its maximum retention per-event, for a first event, under its 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program.

IAG also explained that its net catastrophe claim costs for the eight months to 28 February 2021 were around A$375 million.

After this March flood event and based on an expectation of seasonally lower perils costs in Q2 of the calendar year, IAG estimates FY21 net natural perils claim costs of approximately $660 million to $700 million, which would take it just above its allowance of $658 million for this period.

This is based on an assumption of an estimated $150 million to $190 million of losses from additional catastrophe events in the months of March to June 2021.

IAG noted that it has its FY21 stop-loss reinsurance protection for retained natural perils claims, covering it for $100 million in excess of $1.1 billion ($68 million in excess of $743 million, post-quota share).

Finally, IAG also highlighted its aggregate reinsurance cover, saying that this provides provides $350 million of reinsurance in excess of $400 million (pre-quota share).

Individual events are capped at $200 million, in excess of $50 million from 1 January 2021 and as a result, IAG expects that the heavy rain and flooding event will erode around $150 million of the $400 million deductible on this aggregate reinsurance tower.

Insurer Suncorp also highlighted its claims this morning, saying that it has so far received over 5,400 claims across New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria, of which 80% are in New South Wales and more than 85% of total claims are related to property damage.

The insurer said that claims will continue to rise over the coming days. While Suncorp did not detail any potential reinsurance impact, its quota shares will respond and its low retentions may mean some reinsurance claims are also warranted, once the full bill is known.

Finally, insurance and reinsurance broker Aon said that, “The number of claims and resultant losses will further increase; perhaps significantly and approaching AUD1 billion (USD760 million) in New South Wales alone.”

With the flooding affecting Queensland and Victoria as well and claims coming in from these regions, it does seem likely the ultimate industry loss from this event will surpass A$1 billion.

Aon noted, “The overall economic loss, including damage to infrastructure and agribusiness, will be much higher than the eventual insurance industry impact. It is expected that the economic loss will well exceed USD1 billion. Flood events typically result in a higher protection gap given challenges around underinsurance and lack of proper take-up.”

* Severe floods have pummelled several parts of the country

* Climate change hiking threats fast, including from bushfires

* Government now working on new climate resilience plan

By Michael Taylor

March 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Australia, now battling its worst floods in more than half a century, has failed to adapt fast enough to the growing threats it faces from the impacts of climate change, with its people now suffering the effects of ""wilful ignorance"", analysts warned.

Heavy rains hit several parts of the country this week, sweeping away houses, roads and livestock and cutting off entire towns in the east. Dangerous flash floods killed two people and more than 40,000 people were forced to flee their homes.

""They call Australia 'disaster alley' because we've got a bit of everything,"" said Karl Mallon, CEO of Sydney-based Climate Valuation, which advises homeowners and buyers on climate and extreme weather risks.

As global warming accelerates, it is bringing fiercer storms, floods and heatwaves, more severe droughts and a growing risk of bushfires to Australia.

""It's a shame on us that we haven't tackled this already... We've got every incentive and the money to do it, it's just that we're not looking at it,"" Mallon told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Despite knowing about climate change since the 1980s, Australia continues to build homes in floodplains, he noted.

The problem is often rooted in ""wilful ignorance"", he said, citing government reliance on land taxes, builders and developers putting profits before safety from climate threats, and homeowners seeking to minimise insurance payments.

Property buyers are given little information on flood risks, either by local government or banks and insurers, Mallon said.

""Sometimes the first time they find out is when they get hit - and they say 'I didn't know I was in a flood zone',"" he added.

Richie Merzian, climate and energy programme director at think-tank The Australia Institute, said so far the approach to adapting to climate change impacts has been disjointed between federal, state and council levels, curbing resilience.

""The federal government seems allergic to any mention of climate change which hampers smart policy responses,"" he said.

'SELF-COMBUSTING MANURE'

Last year's bushfires - which Prime Minister Scott Morrison dubbed Australia's ""black summer"" - killed more than 30 people, destroyed wildlife and razed over 24 million hectares (59 million acres).

When the crisis hit, Morrison's deputy was reported to have partly blamed ""self-combusting piles of manure"".

Meanwhile, the health of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem, is in a critical state and deteriorating as climate change heats up the waters where it lies, conservation groups say.

""The first thing is to acknowledge that climate impacts will get worse and that 'one-in-100-years' type events will become more common, and we need to plan for that reality,"" said Cam Walker, campaigns coordinator at Friends of the Earth Australia.

To deal with the risks, a region-based approach to adaptation should be crafted that allows for joined-up responses between different levels of government and communities, he said.

Mallon said government, mortgage lenders and insurers needed to offer homeowners incentives to upgrade and better protect their properties, ensuring roofs are stronger against storms and flood barriers built around high-risk buildings.

At a municipal level, increased drainage, better sea walls and modern fire-fighting equipment would help, he added.

To reduce damage from bushfires, he advised at-risk property owners to clear guttering of flammable materials, install sprinklers and shutters that keep out embers, and use fire-retardant paint.

NATIONAL ADAPTATION PLAN

Australia has sophisticated weather monitoring systems and has been able to issue flood warnings and evacuate those in harm's way, potentially saving thousands of lives, said Merzian at The Australia Institute.

But despite the country's vulnerability to climate impacts, the government has been slow to conduct a national climate assessment or prepare a National Adaptation Plan, he said.

In January, Australia's environment minister committed to produce a new climate resilience and adaptation strategy this year, which it is due to publish before the COP26 U.N. climate talks in November.

As part of the initiative, Canberra said it would invest an initial A$12.9 million ($9.8 million) to prepare for disasters.

Protecting and restoring wetlands, mangroves and forests would help shield communities from floods and storms, while more trees in cities would also ease the effects of heat, green groups say.

Changing crops and tilling practices, and introducing livestock breeds that can tolerate drier conditions, are other options to combat droughts, said Will Steffen, a climate scientist at the Australian National University.

But conservative governments have been reluctant to change well-established practices in the agriculture and construction sectors, he said, adding that climate change has become ""a partisan political issue"".

BAND-AIDS ON BULLET-HOLES

Environmentalists say Australia is its own worst enemy due to its continued reliance on coal-fired power, which makes it one of the world's largest carbon-emitters per capita.

Green groups have long lobbied the government to ditch fossil fuels and set a goal to become carbon-neutral by 2050 - so far with little success.

""The government's failure to significantly cut emissions puts Australia and the Pacific region at risk of more fires, floods and cyclones,"" said Martin Zavan, campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific.

""When it comes to adaptation, you can't put a band-aid on a bullet-hole and expect it to get better,"" he added.

Friends of the Earth's Walker noted that Australia had produced 240 reports on natural disasters since 1920, but citizens were still suffering the consequences.

""Adaptation without (emissions) mitigation means surrender on the issue of climate change,"" he said.

Addressing parliament on Monday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that “Australia is being tested once again”.

“The east coast of Australia, predominantly New South Wales but also in southeast Queensland, has experienced an extraordinary deluge over recent days,” he said.

Rains are expected for at least the next 24 and 48 hours, Mr Morrison said. “Some parts of New South Wales are experiencing the worst flooding in 50 years, from Penrith to the north of Port Macquarie,” he said.

Jane Golding, an official at the bureau of meteorology, warned that heavy rains will hit large parts of the east coast from Monday “due to the combination of a tropical low over northern Western Australia and a coastal trough off New South Wales”.

Rains also caused dams and rivers to overflow around Sydney and southeast Queensland. Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, spilled over on Saturday, adding to swollen rivers.

Widespread destruction has been reported in the affected areas as floods damaged roads, swept away houses and disrupted power supply.

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said 38 regions have been declared disaster zones. “I don’t know any time in a state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,” she said.

Emergency services have received more than 8,000 calls for help since the rains began on Thursday and have rescued hundreds of people from floodwaters.

New South Wales State Emergency Service commander Michael Ward said several affected people don’t know what to do. “We have a number of concerns for welfare, so we’re working through those. What obviously happens is that everyone relies on the mobile phone. And when they haven’t had power for two days, they stop working,” he told ABC News.

34,34,FL-2021-000025-AUS,The world sees the climate crisis in Australia's floods. Do we? - The Interpreter,https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/world-sees-climate-crisis-australia-s-floods-do-we,"In the late 1980s, while I was a reporter covering one of the mega-cyclones to hit Bangladesh, a government official in Dhaka confided in me that he was fed up with seeing his nation only make the global headlines as a result of the disasters that befell it.

Australia is fast catching up in that regard.

In the past 18 months, the driest continent on the planet has made global news for unprecedented bushfires that left 33 people dead and more than 17 million hectares in ash. This was followed by the great floods of 2020, which left hundreds homeless and drenched the eastern part of the country with more than 700 millimetres of water in a week.

Come March of 2021 and Australia is in the global headlines yet again. The descriptions are as similar as they are familiar.

Worst floods in decades. One-in-a-hundred-year event. Greatest concern. News reporters and politicians appear to have run out of adjectives, recycling the same phrases used in previous disasters. Gone are the days when Australia was famous across the world for stories of cuddly koalas, boxing kangaroos or surfers versus sharks. Australia is now well and truly at the forefront of the climate crisis.

Compounding this challenge is a view of a government out of step with the world to act in response.

It was not always thus. Consider the case of the hole in the ozone layer, when after its discovery in 1985, Australia played an outstanding role in the creation of the Montreal Protocol, which became known as the “world's most successful environmental agreement”.

Notions of isolation and relative safety have long been a mainstay for global views of Australia. In 2021, it may well be the reverse.

That success only makes for a more striking contrast with Australia’s contemporary international reputation for the approach it has adopted to climate change, particularly under the Liberal-National Coalition government in power since 2013. People are regularly reminded that Prime Minister Scott Morrison once brandished a lump of coal in the country’s parliament, that the Coalition dismantled the carbon tax and struggled over a renewable energy target, and has consistently ignored the pleas of business groups, environmental organisations and climate scientists for firm action.

It’s not that Australia has been without recommendations. The Garnaut Climate Change Review, for example, commissioned in 2007 by then–Labor leader Kevin Rudd, argued that it was in Australia’s national interest to seek an international agreement for holding carbon dioxide equivalent concentrations at 450 parts per million (ppm) or lower, and for Australia to offer in advance to play its full proportionate part in such an agreement. The report also said the cost of action to the Australian economy of tackling climate change was far less than the cost of inaction. But today the Garnaut report is hardly mentioned and has all but disappeared from public discourse.

Instead Australia appears trapped in a turgid political contest where critics are dismissed as “woke inner-city greenies” and the attempts to discuss the cause of regular crises are deflected as “not the right time”.

All of this can’t help but be noted around the world as the country first burned and then drowned. Even former finance minister Mattias Cormann’s campaign to become chief of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development was dogged by criticism of Australia’s climate stance, and while this did not prevent him winning the gig, will such questions continue to mount and in future hold Australia back?

The author at the causeway on the road to home (Edmond Roy)

As I write this from home the rain has been steadily falling for the past week. So far, in the small hamlet of Marlee, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, we have received 820 millimetres of rain. The creeks around our property have inundated paddocks, created rivers out of streams and uprooted 30-metre-tall gum trees. The roads into our area have been wiped out, causeways and bridges destroyed. Landslides block access to many properties, livestock washed downstream and drowned, communication systems are down, electricity and water supplies cut.

Supplies are running low, and with every passing hour the ground is getting more sodden. The State Emergency Service and the Rural Fire Service, both voluntary organisations, have been run off their feet. Evacuation centres are swelling, roads are closed, and flood waters continue to rise.

We’ve been through all of this before. Australia is a land of extremes. We all know that. And we also know the national storylines of a people who are resilient and stoic and tough. But that reputation is at risk of being overwhelmed without the leadership to act.

In 1957, Nevil Shute wrote his nightmarish vision of waiting to die in a nuclear catastrophe, On the Beach. He set it in Australia, the last place on earth to receive the radioactive fallout that would wipe out life on earth. That notion of isolation and relative safety has long been a mainstay for global views of Australia. In 2021, it may well be the reverse. It’s in Australia where it all begins – the bellwether of inaction on climate change.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.lowyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/GettyImages-1308702459.jpg,"['change', 'climate', 'water', 'world', '2021', 'floods', 'global', 'sees', 'service', 'views', 'crisis', 'australia', 'australias']",,flood

The State Emergency Service said evacuated residents of Pitt Town North, Pitt Town Bottoms, Cornwallis, North Richmond, Agnes Banks, Gronos Point and Freemans Reach should not return until authorities give the all-clear.

“Even as flood waters recede, utilities will continue to be impacted and there will likely be extensive debris including hazardous materials and potentially unsafe roads,” the SES said in a statement on Sunday.

The SES warned flood water can contain sewage, debris and dead animals so locals must avoid entering it, playing in it or driving through it.

Evacuation orders on the NSW mid-north coast and near Moree have now lifted, with eight “all clear” return notices issued as river levels fall.

Rapid damage assessments were taking place through western and north-west Sydney in areas such as Penrith, The Hills and Hawkesbury. Some 3,500 assessments have been carried out to date.

“The teams out in the field are working closely with the community and local services to begin the recovery process,” Allison Flaxman of the SES said.

On Sunday, a major flood warning remained in place for the Barwon River in north-west NSW, as well as moderate flood warnings for the Bogan River in the state’s central west and the Macintyre and Weir Rivers near the Queensland border.

The SES has received more than 23,000 calls for help from the public, and volunteers have attended more than 13,000 jobs since the floods began.

Grants and bank loans will be made available to businesses in flood-affected areas to fund their recovery, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced.

Morrison said on Saturday that a loan scheme would be extended to flood-affected small and medium businesses.

He said the federal government would underwrite 80% of bank loans of up to $5m for small and medium businesses in the flood-affected areas, with repayments to start two years into the loan.

The measure is an extension of a support program available for Covid-affected firms.

“This is about backing the businesses and producers that are backing themselves to get back on their feet,” Morrison said.

The loans are on top of a recovery grants program jointly funded by the federal and NSW governments. Small businesses can get up to $50,000 and primary producers up to $75,000 if they’ve been affected by floods.

As tens of thousands of people across NSW returned to their homes over the weekend, an emergency services taskforce was tackling the cleanup, including Australian defence force personnel, the NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire and Rescue NSW.

The Australian Red Cross warned of a lack of access to mental health help, and urged people affected by the floods to take steps to protect their psychological wellbeing as well as their physical health.

Meanwhile, the search for an elderly woman continued after police pulled her empty car from the swollen Barrington River on Thursday.

Tourists urged to keep NSW Easter plans

Tourism operators hit by recent heavy rain are hoping the upcoming Easter break gives them a much-needed boost.

At the Discovery Park at Forster on the mid-north coast of NSW, which was inundated by this past week’s “rain bomb”, manager Jane Ticehurst said they are gearing up for the holiday.

Ticehurst said she was expecting a full house for the Easter break, which means accommodating about 1,000 guests.

All of this past week’s guests had to be cancelled and rebooked so staff could concentrate on cleaning up after flooding.

The property sits above the Wallamba River, and while some locals said the waterway was at its highest level in memory, the park’s infrastructure escaped relatively undamaged.

Despite some facilities like the boardwalk going under water, Ticehurst said she was feeling fortunate.

“Our team has been impacted in a whole number of ways, from a housekeeper who has lost everything in her property, to most of the team who were landlocked and couldn’t get to work,” Ticehurst said.

“We did have to cancel Easter for everyone last year because of Covid. We’re certainly hoping not to impact Easter this time round.

“The whole of this area has been impacted heavily in the last 18 months, fires followed by Covid and the flooding.

“I guess we can look forward to getting back up and running.”

The NSW Tourism Industry Council executive manager, Greg Binskin, said while some caravan parks along rivers had been hard hit, most operators were pushing ahead with Easter plans.

“[The floods] have been another setback in what’s been a pretty tough 24 months [but] a lot of them are confident they will get cleaned up and ready to be welcoming visitors again,” he said.

He said while the past two years have been tough for operators, domestic tourism has also prompted an uptake in visitors, with international borders still shut.

Binskin said with the jobkeeper wage subsidy ending, programs like the NSW government’s Dine and Discover hospitality voucher scheme – which gives patrons money towards meals and entertainment – would help businesses get back on their feet.

The tourism boss urged people to continue with their Easter plans.

“It’s always a great extended long weekend. We’d urge people to continue to head into regional areas and support your fellow Aussies,” he said.","Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ced13829603869c5c942b7f0306832ec07ee580/126_0_3906_2345/master/3906.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b0a40a8dc6ec77133ff2a3858e42533,"['water', 'nsw', 'residents', 'recedes', 'told', 'floods', 'river', 'stay', 'evacuated', 'sydney', 'easter', 'impacted', 'areas', 'ses', 'debris', 'businesses', 'flood', 'cleanup']",,flood

SACKVILLE, Australia (Reuters) - At Ken Anderson's orchard near the banks of the Hawkesbury River in the outer Sydney suburb of Sackville, another few inches of flood water could spell the end for much of this season's orange and mandarin harvest - and possibly the trees as well.

As torrential rains pummel Australia's east, causing the worst floods in half a century, those living near major river systems are suffering the most, with homes, roads and livestock being washed away.

The lower-lying areas are most at risk, Anderson told Reuters at his orchard, which he said had been in the family for 170 years.

""I'll lose a fair bit, because if the water stays on there too much, the fruit will just drop,"" said Anderson, who at 66 is the fourth generation of his family to run the property.

In parts of the orchard, only the top branches of the fruit trees were visible above the water.

""Down in the other section over there, it takes a while for the water to come off so I'll end up losing the fruit there and probably might lose the trees too,"" added Anderson stoically, holding a blue-and-yellow striped umbrella against the pouring rain.

In the state of New South Wales, where the flooding is most severe, a deluge is forecast overnight on Tuesday in some areas despite clearer weather in Sydney.

While damage to properties and livelihoods is widespread, there have been no recorded fatalities from the floods.

Anderson said it had been a difficult few days, working non-stop for the past couple of nights.

""I'm all over it now,"" said the farmer with a slight chuckle. ""I'm coming down with a cold, I think actually, I've been wet a few days.""

NSW's State Emergency Service has confirmed that major flooding of the Hawkesbury River – particularly at the nearby suburb of North Richmond – is likely to be higher than the historic 1961 flooding event.

“The Hawkesbury River at North Richmond (WPS) is currently at 13.16 metres and falling with major flooding. Renewed rises are possible with forecast rainfall,” the Bureau of Meteorology advised.

“The Hawkesbury River at Windsor (WPS) may peak near 13.00 metres Monday evening with major flooding. This level is similar to the April 1988 and July 1990 flood events.”

A severe weather warning remains for much of NSW's coast, with damaging winds, heavy rainfall, abnormally high tides and damaging surf forecast.

“A strong high pressure system over the southern Tasman Sea continues to drive widespread and persistent rain onto the New South Wales coast. This is expected to continue today, particularly about the Mid North Coast and Northern Rivers,” the Bureau advises.

“Meanwhile, a low pressure trough in the state's west is deepening, bringing rain areas to the northern inland today. In this area, heavy rain is possible from the morning, becoming more likely in the afternoon and evening, extending to areas of the southeast over Tuesday.

“On Tuesday, as the trough reaches the Tasman Sea, a low pressure system may form, bringing increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides to the east and south.""

The entire state is unlikely to experience a reprieve from the wet weather until late Wednesday.

Heavy rainfall and damaging winds are expected to hit Victoria on Tuesday as a nightmare weather system wreaking havoc in NSW dips further south.

A severe weather and flood warning has been issued by the weather bureau for parts of eastern and southern Victoria.

“A deepening low pressure system will move southeast across NSW (on Tuesday), reaching the southern NSW coast late tonight then becoming slow moving over eastern Bass Strait on Wednesday,” the bureau said.

“Peak gusts to 110km/h are possible about the southern Gippsland coast.”

Locations likely to be affected include Wonthaggi, Mallacoota, Cann River, Chandlers Creek, Combienbar and Bonang.

The bureau said heavy rainfall could lead to flash flooding during Tuesday afternoon and evening.

Senior meteorologist Richard Russell said the system would bring increasing rainfall across east Gippsland before spreading into southern Gippsland, particularly the Strzelecki Ranges, and the Otway Ranges.

“(On Tuesday) we‘re looking at this low pressure system rapidly intensifying across NSW and it will track quite quickly towards the south coast of NSW by late Tuesday afternoon and early evening,” he said.

“It will intensify further and then move over the East Gippsland coastal waters where it sit for most of Wednesday before finally moving away.”

He said from midday Tuesday through to Wednesday night, localised rainfall totals of 80-120mm were possible east of Orbost, with 150-200mm possible about the Strzelecki Ranges and Wilsons Promontory, and 100-150mm possible about the Otway Ranges.

“The heavy rainfall that we’re looking at could also lead to some localised flooding, so that’s rapid water rises not just involving rivers but gullies, creeks and areas that don’t generally get a flood warning associated with it,” Mr Russell said.

“We have some quite significant winds around that low pressure system that will intensify late (on Tuesday) with some potential for some damaging wind gusts across much of the Gippsland coast.”

He said Melbourne had “missed the worst of it” with just patchy showers through until Wednesday afternoon.

“If that low centre does unfortunately move west of the Prom, the impacts will be much higher in Melbourne, but having said that the expectation for rainfall in Melbourne is around 5-15mm,” he said.

Mr Russell reassured Victorians the impact in the state wouldn’t be anywhere near that of NSW and Queensland.

“The quite humid tropical air mass feeding across eastern Australia is more intense and feeding onto the NSW and Queensland ranges so the orientation of the Great Divide plays a big role,” he said.

“Also the position of the high pressure system for much of the week over the southern Tasman Sea has kept most of that activity further north from us.”

A flood watch has been issued for the Bemm, Cann, Genoa and Snowy River catchments, with a minor flood warning current for the Snowy River.

The State Emergency Service warned residents in affected areas to avoid dangerous hazards, such as floodwater, mud, debris, damaged roads and fallen trees and to stay inside away from windows if possible.

Horses and livestock were seen floating along rivers and washing up on beaches yesterday, as the mid-north coast faced a once-in-a-lifetime deluge. Hundreds of houses were damaged and thousands of residents evacuated as several dams spilled over (now the subject of “bitter dispute”). The downpour is expected to head inland today, and premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned thousands more people could be displaced in coming days. The state’s emergency service has said it will be working beyond Easter on the post-flood clean-up effort and restoration of key services; the as-yet-untallied bill looms on the horizon. “It’s devastating,” said one local in Raymond Terrace, north of Newcastle. “I’ve never ever seen anything like this.” Communities along the Hawkesbury River in NSW are bracing for once-in-a-generation flooding that could displace residents and disrupt utilities for months.

As Australia’s miners urge Europe to define nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture as “sustainable”, the Minerals Council of Australia has been accused of trying to export its “negative approach to climate policy”. The Royal Swedish Academy of Science has meanwhile warned that measures for a healthier, more resilient planet – including reducing fossil fuel emissions – are being jeopardised by fake news on social media about climate change and biodiversity loss. In Canada, the main Conservative party has voted not to recognise the climate crisis as real.

43,43,FL-2021-000025-AUS,How a Vet Hospital on Wheels Rescued Australian Wildlife During Floods - Atlas Obscura,https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/wildlife-rescue-australia-floods,"A providence petrel goes onto the X-ray machine. Some traumatized animals, including a tiny Gould’s long-eared microbat, are swaddled in towels. An echidna, or spiny anteater, has a tube attached to its long beaky nose. All these animals injured during the recent historic floods in New South Wales, Australia, and their care was in the hands of an expert veterinarian team at the Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital.



Days of relentless and heavy rains caused the worst flooding in decades on parts of Australia’s eastern coast. It has not only upended the lives of thousands of human residents, but non-human ones as well. “There are the clearly devastating problems for burrowing and ground-dwelling animals like wombats and echidnas that can quickly become trapped by flood waters,” Evan Quartermain, the Australian head of programs and disaster response for the Humane Society International, told The Guardian. “And aquatic animals such as platypus and turtles face major run-off issues and can easily be swept far from their territories.... The wild weather also creates havoc for birds that will struggle for shelter and have nests blown from trees.”

Creatures fleeing the rising waters to seek shelter can also be injured or killed in road accidents. The echidna with the tube “sustained horrific injuries” after being hit by a car along Broken Head Road in the Byron Bay region, according to the hospital’s social media account. Bree Talbot, the leading veterinarian at the mobile hospital at Byron Bay, used ultrasound to assess the condition of the creature, which sustained a wound under its porcupine-like spines.

Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital is not an ordinary vet office—it has a dedicated wildlife urgent care center on wheels. In fact, many wheels: The 22-wheel semi-trailer, more than 60 feet long, is Australia’s largest mobile wildlife hospital. Self-sufficient and furnished with state-of-the-art medical equipment, the trailer can be taken anywhere that Australia’s distinctive fauna need help.

The current crisis has it situated at Australia’s eastern-most point, where the veterinarian team are seeing increasing numbers of animals with injuries from the floods. “Treating injured and traumatized wildlife requires expert knowledge of their anatomy and physiology in order to triage and identify the problem, and provide appropriate treatment,” Talbot writes. “During a disaster like floods or bushfires, demand for services like ours is great, while the resources to source expensive medicines, supplies, and equipment needed to do our job is scarce.” Since the nonprofit hospital opened in October 2020, it has provided care, free of charge, for more than 500 creatures, and this flood will certainly increase that count, especially as clean-up and recovery from the disaster begins. Byron Bay Wildlife Hospital has been asked the public to be vigilant on the road and keep an eye out for injured or shaken wildlife, but “never drive through floodwater and never place yourself at risk or in danger attempting to reach wildlife in distress.” That could mean another rescue.

WINDSOR, Australia — Kelly Miller stood in her doorway Monday, watching the water rise to within a few inches of the century-old home where she runs an alternative medicine business. The bridge nearby had already gone under in some of Australia’s worst flooding in decades, along with an abandoned car in the parking lot.“It’s coming up really quickly,” she said.Two massive storms have converged over eastern Australia, dumping more than 3 feet of rain in just five days. In a country that suffered the worst wildfires in its recorded history just a year ago, the deluge has become another record-breaker — a once-in-50-years event, or possibly 100, depending on the rain that is expected to continue through Tuesday night.Nearly 20,000 Australians have been forced to evacuate, and more than 150 schools have been closed. The storms have swept away the home of a couple on their wedding day, prompted at least 500 rescues and drowned roads from Sydney up into the state of Queensland 500 miles north.Shane Fitzsimmons, the resilience commissioner for New South Wales — a new state position formed after last year’s fires — described the event as another compounding disaster. Last year, huge fires combined into history-making infernos that scorched an area larger than many European countries. This year, thunderstorms have fused and hovered, delivering enough water to push rivers like the Hawkesbury to their highest levels since the 1960s.Scientists note that both forms of catastrophe represent Australia’s new normal. The country is one of many seeing a pattern of intensification — more extreme hot days and heat waves, as well as more extreme rainfalls over short periods.It is all tied to a warming earth, caused by greenhouse gases. Because global temperatures have risen 1.1 degrees Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels, landscapes dry out more quickly, producing severe droughts, even as more water vapor rises into the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of extreme downpours.“There is a very strong link between global warming and that intensification in rainfall,” said Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales. “There’s good scientific evidence to say extreme rain is becoming more extreme due to global warming.”Australia’s conservative government — heavily resistant to aggressive action on climate change that might threaten the country’s fossil fuel industry — has yet to make that link.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to flee and several dozen areas have already been declared disaster zones.“It’s another testing time for our country,” he told a Sydney radio station, 2GB, on Monday.Windsor may become one of the places hardest hit. Over the weekend, the Hawkesbury rose rapidly by more than 30 feet, and it is expected to peak in the next day or so at 42 feet.With rain continuing to fall, emergency workers wearing bright orange went door to door on side streets with waist-deep puddles where the road dipped.In and around the historic downtown, many of the businesses close to the river stayed shut Monday, with a few putting sandbags by their doors. The central meeting place seemed to be at the foot of the Windsor Bridge, where television crews and crowds in rubber boots marveled at the view.The new Windsor Bridge, which opened just a few months ago as a “flood-proof” replacement for an older bridge, was completely underwater.It was built 10 feet higher than the bridge it replaced, but the river flowed over it as if it did not exist. A red flashing light on the top of a buried yellow excavator offered the only hint of the old bridge, or what had once been solid ground.Cameron Gooch, 46, a diesel mechanic from a town nearby, said he saw huge trees speeding downriver toward the coast a day earlier. The water seemed to have slowed down, he said, becoming a giant bathtub with water held in place and rising slowly from tributaries.“That’s the problem,” he said. “It’s just going to keep building up.”

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian said the downpours across the state, Australia's most populous with eight million people, were worse than initially expected, especially for low-lying areas in Sydney's northwest.

“Yesterday, we were hoping it will only be a one-in-20-year event, now it looks like a one-in-50-year event,” she said during a televised briefing.

People in parts of Sydney's northwest were ordered to flee their houses in the middle of the night as fast-moving waters caused widespread destruction.

Late on Sunday, about another 1,000 people were asked to evacuate, after Ms Berejiklian said some 4,000 people may be asked to leave their houses.

Television and social media footage showed fast-moving water unmooring houses, engulfing roads, breaking trees and damaging road infrastructure.

Emergency services have estimated the total number of damaged houses to be “in the hundreds”.

Several major roads have been closed across the state while many schools have called off classes for Monday.

Prime minister Scott Morrison in a Facebook post announced federal financial assistance for those affected.

The flooding comes in stark contrast with the devastating bushfires that struck Australia in late 2019 and early 2020, when nearly seven per cent of NSW land was scorched.

Flooding risk and evacuation warnings were in place for about 13 areas in NSW, including the Hunter, one of Australia's major wine regions.

Several dams, including Warragamba, Sydney’s main water supply, spilled over causing river levels to surge.

Meteorologists said the downpour is set to continue for several days.

Emergency crews have responded to about 6,000 calls for help since the start of the rains on Thursday, including nearly 700 direct pleas for rescue from floods.

53,53,FL-2021-000025-AUS,A flood-hit farmer's lament for his lost cows: 'It's the helplessness of hearing them bellowing' - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/23/a-flood-hit-farmers-lament-for-his-lost-cows-its-the-helplessness-of-hearing-them-bellowing,"It was the terrified bellows of his dairy cows as the flood waters rapidly rose around them that broke the Taree dairy farmer Rod Lattimore’s heart.

“It’s the helplessness of hearing them bellowing because they are obviously stressed, they are very panicked, and you cannot get to them to do anything for them,” Lattimore told Guardian Australia. “That’s the real heartbreaking thing. The loss is the loss, and as hard as that is to cope with it’s the helplessness and not being able to do anything.”

At half-past four on Friday morning, Rod waded out into boot-deep water to take his cows to higher ground. By the time he got them out of the paddock and on the way to the dairy, the water was up to his waist.

“I was whistling to them,” he said. “And there’s one block downstream from me – it’s only like a kilometre – and as I was whistling to my cows in the dark to get them out of the water they are in, the younger ones on the heifer block up the road could hear me whistling and all of them swam to me, which was pretty amazing against the flow.”

Lattimore, a third-generation farmer, managed to save all of his dairy cows but lost some 20 heifers. He has only managed to recover five of their bodies so far.

“I’ll get calls to say there is a heifer on this block in Taree, and you go to check on it and hope that it’s a live one and, you know, she might be distressed but we can get her home and save her,” he said. “And then you get there and you find that she’s drowned and she’s washed up there. And that’s sort of happened three times now, so it’s pretty heartbreaking.”

Further east along the Manning River, at Oxley Island, dead cattle lie twisted in trees, a snapshot of the violence that has savaged the area.

Three colliding weather systems have caused flooding chaos across swathes of New South Wales, leading to dozens of communities being declared disaster zones and forcing more than 18,000 people to evacuate their homes.

Quick Guide Is NSW flooding yet more evidence of climate change? Show Experts say it’s unusual to see so many places with such high rainfall across such a wide area. The extreme rainfall came after three weather systems combined, and fell on already saturated ground due to a wetter-than-average summer, thanks in part to the La Nina weather pattern. A warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture - about 7% for each degree of warming - so there's more available to fall as rain. If you do the maths, Australia has warmed by 1.4C, accounting for roughly 5-10% of the rain. But climate scientists say it's not that simple because of the many different factors that influence rainfall. Climate change could also be making weather patterns that deliver downpours more frequent, but again, more research is needed.

The floods have been devastating for farmers along the state’s mid-north coast, many of whom lost property, crops and precious livestock in a matter of hours.

A Facebook Group – Mid North Coast horse/ livestock flood recovery – has been set up to help farmers find lost animals and has so far gained more than 4,000 members.

Donald Hood, co-owner and veterinarian at Taree veterinary hospital, said he had watched helpless as cows were washed away.

“I live in Cundletown and I sat and watched cows flooding down the river, already dead,” he said. “And there is nothing you can do.”

Kempsey shire councillor Sue McGinn’s property: ‘We have just gotten through a drought, it zaps your spirits’

Of the animals that survived, Hood said he had been working around the clock to treat hypothermia, cuts and abscesses. Many horses and cattle are also suffering from damaged feet, having spent days stranded in water.

Hood’s colleague and vet hospital co-owner, Rob Brudar, has had better luck, rescuing a calf on Saturday and a cow yesterday morning who had been washed into the surf.

“The calf had been in the river for three days and had horrible pneumonia … We had no idea where it had come from,” he said. “It came out the entrance at Old Bar, the surf was wild, you wouldn’t have wanted to be out there.

“He survived and made it on to shore. The fact that he’s are alive on the beach is a miracle in its own right. He’s on a farm just out of Old Bar. We heard from the owner of the property and he said he is going really well.”

While the cow rescued on Monday ultimately didn’t survive, Brudar said it was heartwarming to see the community rally together to try and save its life.

“We had 10 guys trying to lift her, people trying to come around and help her and feed her, and it was just really good to see. The feat of getting a 700kg cow 500 metres up the beach and into a trailer; I don’t even know how we did it. But we did it because we all worked together and we weren’t going to give up on her.”

Others have found livestock washed up in residential back yards.

For some farmers, the floods are a breaking point.

The 2019 bushfires and unrelenting drought, which finally broke around a year ago, forced many, like Lattimore, into debt. Now, the floods threaten to undo months of toil and slow repayments, knocking back the recovery by at least two or three more years.

“I was 10 years old when we had the 1978 flood,” Lattimore said, his voice breaking. “But back then, farms were smaller, family farms … but now, you know, we’re going to milk twice as many cows for a fraction of the margin … Whether it’s droughts or floods that come along, we’ve got no reserves in the pricing system to keep farms operating. So this on top of the drought, it’s going to finish a lot of farms.

“There is no resilience in the agricultural system to recover from adversity.”

With the roads cut off, Brett McGinn pours fresh milk down the drain

A dairy farmer and Kempsey shire councillor, Sue McGinn, agreed that the floods needed to spark a bigger conversation about the price we are paying for fresh food and dairy products.

Her Macleay Valley property, east of Kempsey, flooded after water breached the Belmore River on Friday. While she and her husband, Brett, haven’t lost cattle, they fear dormant flood waters will starve their grass, destroying their cow’s main food source and preventing them from planting winter feed.

No feed means no milk, and no milk means no cashflow. Add to that road closures, which have prevented dairy collection trucks from reaching the farm and forced the couple to make the difficult call to pour fresh milk – their livelihood – down the drain.

“I’m certainly not asking for charity,” she said. “But any business that wears the financial impacts to put out a litre of milk needs to be paid well enough to continue to farm so that litre of milk still gets on the kitchen table.

“You can do all you can and … [make] what you do and efficient and productive, but I don’t think any business can sustain any big, large-scale whacks – even the best of us can’t sustain continual attacks. The scale of this and given we have just gotten through a drought, it zaps your spirits, but it certainly hurts your bank balance.”","Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b8855dfce275ad5339f5bd8a1720b0e9bdcef8/230_399_2649_1590/master/2649.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1db6476b43ee0c80e1b03c67e8ca7ecb,"['water', 'washed', 'helplessness', 'lost', 'bellowing', 'milk', 'floods', 'river', 'weather', 'floodhit', 'dairy', 'cows', 'property', 'farmers', 'lament', 'taree', 'hearing']",,none
54,54,FL-2021-000025-AUS,Australia floods: IAG updates 2021 natural perils claim costs - Insurance Business AU,https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/au/news/breaking-news/australia-floods-iag-updates-2021-natural-perils-claim-costs-250628.aspx,"Based on exposure, claims lodged to date, and experience with previous similar events, IAG expects the net cost of the extreme weather event to reach around $135 million ($200 million pre-quote share) – capped at $169 million, the Maximum Event Retention (MER) for a first event under the 2021 catastrophe reinsurance program.

Commenting on the Australia floods, IAG chief executive officer and managing director Nick Hawkins said: “We’re working hard providing support to customers and communities affected by flooding. Our teams are on the ground supporting customers in the worst impacted areas of the NSW

Mid North Coast, Western Sydney, and South East QLD, assessing the damage to our customers’ homes, ensuring their properties are safe, and arranging temporary accommodation for those who need it.

“Our dedicated major events team is managing claims from this event, and we have increased our call centre capacity to help affected customers lodge claims as soon as possible. All our NRMA

Insurance branches in the impacted areas are open to support customers, and we have deployed a claims team to the NRMA Port Macquarie branch to provide face-to-face support for those lodging claims.”

IAG’s net natural perils claim costs for the eight months to February 28, 2021, were around $375 million following relatively benign perils activity this financial year before the March event.

Following the March event, and taking into account seasonally lower perils costs that typically occur in the June quarter, IAG expects FY21 net natural perils claim costs to reach around $660 million to $700 million, which is marginally higher than the perils allowance of $658 million for this period. This assumes an estimated $150 million to $190 million for further peril events in March to June 2021.","Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/026/0292_637523709279197613.jpg,"['updates', 'net', 'costs', 'natural', '2021', 'support', 'events', 'floods', 'claim', 'perils', 'customers', 'claims', 'million', 'australia', 'iag', 'event']",,flood
