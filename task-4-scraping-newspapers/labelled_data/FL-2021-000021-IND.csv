0,0,FL-2021-000021-IND,How does a glacier burst? Flooding in India leaves at least 31 dead and 165 missing. - USA TODAY,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2021/02/08/uttarakhand-india-glacier-burst-what-to-know/4434591001/,"At least 31 people are dead and 165 are missing after a flood hit northern India on Sunday. The flood was caused when part of a Himalayan glacier broke off and sent a wall of water and debris down a mountain, sweeping away everything in its path.

Rescuers on Monday were trying to rescue 37 power plant workers who remained trapped in a tunnel.

More than 2,000 members of the military, paramilitary groups and police have been taking part in search-and-rescue operations in the northern state of Uttarakhand.

The flood was caused when a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier snapped off Sunday morning, releasing water trapped behind it.

“Everything was swept away, people, cattle and trees,” Sangram Singh Rawat, a former village council member of Raini, the site closest to the glacier, told local media, according to Reuters.

Here's what to know:

How are glaciers formed?

Glaciers begin to form when snow remains in the same area year-round, where enough snow accumulates to transform into ice, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said. Each year, new layers of snow bury and compress the previous layers.

Most of the world's glacial ice is found in Antarctica and Greenland, but glaciers are found on nearly every continent, even Africa.

A large cluster of glaciers is in the Himalayas, which are part of India’s long northern border. Sunday’s disaster occurred in the western part of the Himalayas.

How does a glacier burst?

Proglacial lakes, formed after glaciers retreat, are often bound by sediment and boulder formations. Additional water or pressure, or structural weakness, can cause both natural and man-made dams to burst, sending a mass of floodwater surging down the rivers and streams fed by the glacier.

In this case, National Snow and Ice Data Center scientist Bruce Raup told USA TODAY that the cause of this burst appears to be a landslide that collided with a steep glacier.

He said that steep mountain environments can be hazardous for a number of reasons, including the fact that snow and ice on steep slopes can be unstable and slide catastrophically. In addition, rock and soil slopes, which undergo freeze/thaw cycles, can be unstable and can release, particularly during thaw cycles, Raup said.

Is global warming involved?

Experts said the disaster could be linked to global warming, and a team of scientists was flown to the site Monday to investigate exactly what happened.

Geologist Dwarika Dobhal, from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, told the Guardian that ""climate change will make these events more common.""

High temperatures coupled with less snowfall can accelerate melting, which can cause water to rise to dangerous levels.

“Most mountain glaciers around the world were much larger in the past and have been melting and shrinking dramatically due to climate change and global warming,” said Sarah Das, an associate scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Some 3 million Olympic-size swimming pools full of water melt from glaciers in the Himalayas each year, a 2019 study said, and climate change is the primary cause.

Since the early 20th century, with few exceptions, glaciers around the world have been retreating at unprecedented rates, the National Snow and Ice Data Center said.

Can glacial floods be predicted?

Deadly or highly destructive glacial floods have occurred in Peru and Nepal. In Peru in 1941, 6,000 people died when a glacial lake burst through its dam, flooding the town of Huaraz below it.

A number of areas at risk of glacier bursts have been identified worldwide, including in the Himalayas and in the Andes in South America.

But while monitoring is possible, the remoteness of most glaciers presents challenges.

“There are many glaciers and glacial dammed lakes across the Himalayas, but most are unmonitored,” Das said. “Many of these lakes are upstream of steep river valleys and have the potential to cause extreme flooding when they break. Where these floods reach inhabited regions and sensitive infrastructure, things will be catastrophic.”

Last October, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which is headed by PM Narendra Modi, had issued detailed guidelines on how to reduce and deal with disasters caused by what is scientifically called Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).

What are GLOFs and how vulnerable are the Himalayas?

When glaciers melt, the water in glacial lakes accumulates behind loose, natural “glacial/moraine dams” made of ice, sand, pebbles and ice residue. A GLOF refers to the flooding that occurs when the water dammed by a glacier or a moraine is released suddenly.

Unlike earthen dams, the weak structure of the moraine dam leads to the abrupt failure of the dam on top of the glacial lake, which holds large volume of water. A failure of the dam has the potential of releasing millions of cubic metres of water in a short period, causing catastrophic flooding downstream. Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metre per second have been recorded in such events.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes, which are the major cause of GLOFs. Since glaciers in the Himalayas are in a retreating phase, glacial lakes are growing and pose a potentially large risk to downstream infrastructure and life.

An “Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes / Water Bodies in the Himalayan Region of Indian River Basins”, sponsored by Climate Change Directorate, Central Water Commission, and done by National Remote Sensing Centre during 2011-15, found that there are 352, 283 and 1,393 glacial lakes and water bodies in the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra basins respectively.

How can the risk be reduced?

The NDMA guidelines say that risk reduction has to begin with identifying and mapping such lakes, taking structural measures to prevent their sudden breach, and establishing mechanism to save lives and property in times of a breach.

According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes. According to NDMA, glacial retreat due to climate change occurring in most parts of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has given rise to the formation of numerous new glacial lakes.

Potentially dangerous lakes can be identified based on field observations, records of past events, geomorphologic and geotechnical characteristics of the lake/dam and surroundings, and other physical conditions.

NDMA has recommended use of Synthetic-Aperture Radar imagery to automatically detect changes in water bodies, including new lake formations, during the monsoon months. It has said methods and protocols could also be developed to allow remote monitoring of lake bodies from space.

To manage lakes structurally, the NDMA recommends reducing the volume of water with methods such as controlled breaching, pumping or siphoning out water, and making a tunnel through the moraine barrier or under an ice dam.

A landslide occurred along the Phuktal (tributary to Zanskar river) on December 31, 2014 in Kargil district of Ladakh, leading to a potential flood situation on May 7, 2015. The NDMA created an Expert Task Force which, along with the Army, used explosives to channel water from the river using controlled blasting and manual excavation of debris.

How well is India prepared?

While some work on identification of such lakes has been done by CWC, other aspects are still a work in progress: a robust early warning system, and a broad framework for infrastructure development, construction and excavation in vulnerable zones.

“In contrast to other countries, there are no uniform codes for excavation, construction and grading codes in India. Restricting constructions and development in GLOF/LLOF prone areas is a very efficient means to reduce risks at no cost,” the NDMA guidelines say.

The guidelines say construction of any habitation should be prohibited in the high hazard zone. “Existing buildings are to be relocated to a safer nearby region and all the resources for the relocation have to be managed by Central/State governments. New infrastructures in the medium hazard zone have to be accompanied by specific protection measures.”

The guidelines emphasise the importance of land use planning: “There are no widely accepted procedures or regulation in India for land use planning in the GLOF/LLOF prone areas. Such regulations need to be developed… There should be monitoring systems prior to, during, and after construction of infrastructure and settlements in the downstream area.”

Are there early warning systems in place?

The number of implemented and operational GLOF EWS is still very small, even at the global scale. In the Himalayan region, there are at three reported instances (two in Nepal and one in China) of implementation of sensor- and monitoring-based technical systems for GLOF early warning.

India, though, has a remarkable history of successful warnings in relation to Landslide Lake Outburst Floods (LLOFs), dating back to the 19th century. In 1894, a landslide in Gohna, Uttarakhand dammed the main river. On July 5 that year, the engineer in charge estimated the lake would overflow the dam in mid-August, which eventually happened.

Despite the devastating impact of the flood, including washing away of most buildings along the river and severe destruction in Srinagar, no victims were reported, thanks to the precise prediction and the early warning to the population. This was made possible by the installation of a telephone line between the lake and the downstream towns of Chamoli, Srinagar etc.

Rescue operations continued well into the night on Monday as personnel of the ITBP, NDRF and Army worked to locate around 170 people, mostly labourers working at two power projects, who are still reported missing. Rescue operations continued well into the night on Monday as personnel of the ITBP, NDRF and Army worked to locate around 170 people, mostly labourers working at two power projects, who are still reported missing.

What are the guidelines for rescue?

Apart from pressing specialised forces such as NDRF, ITBP and the Army, NDMA has emphasised the need for trained local manpower.

“Experience has shown that over 80 percent of search and rescue is carried out by the local community before the intervention of the state machinery and specialised search and rescue teams. Thus, trained and equipped teams consisting of local people must be set up in GLOF and LLOF prone areas,” NDMA has said. These local teams, it has said, will also assist in planning and setting up emergency shelters, distributing relief packages, identifying missing people, and addressing the needs for food, healthcare, water supply etc.

It has also called for a comprehensive alarm systems. “Besides classical alarming infrastructure consisting of acoustic alarms by sirens, modern communication technology using cell and smart phones can complement or even replace traditional alarming infrastructure,” NDMA has said.

It has asked for provision of heavy earthmoving and search and rescue equipment, as well as motor launches, country boats, inflatable rubber boats, life jackets etc. Acknowledging that a disaster spot in the Himalayas can at times be inaccessible to earthmovers, NDMA has recommended “innovative methods using locally available natural resources”. “It is important to innovate and design lighter machinery, which are more suitable to be carried in the mountains in a disassembled form,” it has said, suggesting these parts can be carried in a helicopter.

For emergency medical response, NDMA has called for Quick Reaction Medical Teams, mobile field hospitals, Accident Relief Medical Vans, and heli-ambulances in areas inaccessible by roads. The guidelines also call for psychological counselling of victims, apart from dissemination of accurate information through press conferences and mass media.","Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/02/explained-1.jpg,"['itbp', 'lakes', 'river', 'guidelines', 'explained', 'prepared', 'india', 'water', 'glacial', 'lake', 'tackle', 'burst', 'ndma', 'uttarakhand', 'rescue']", ,,none
3,3,FL-2021-000021-IND,Fact Check: Avalanche video from Nepal shared as Uttarakhand glacier burst - India Today,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/fact-check-avalanche-video-from-nepal-shared-as-uttarakhand-glacier-burst-1767146-2021-02-08,"A video of a huge mass of snow sliding down a mountain is being circulated on social media with the claim that it shows the glacier burst in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli on Sunday.

A portion of Nanda Devi glacier broke off on February 7 morning, triggering an avalanche and flooding that washed away hydroelectric stations and homes, leaving at least 15 people dead and over 100 missing till last reports. Two NTPC hydel power projects, Tapovan-Vishnugad and Rishi Ganga, were extensively damaged and scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the waters came gushing in.

The 30-second video is being shared with a caption in Hindi which translates to, “Video of glacier breaking off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli”. Onlookers can be heard hooting with excitement in the clip.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be misleading. This video is of an avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake in Nepal in January 2021. No lives were lost in the incident.

Some netizens also claimed that this is the first video captured of the Uttarakhand glacier burst. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here.

AFWA probe

With the help of InVID tool, we found that the video is from last month and it shows an avalanche in Nepal. It was uploaded on January 9, 2021, by an Instagram user naren32 with the caption, Deadliest avalanche.

On January 11, the user uploaded a longer version of the same video on his Instagram handle and YouTube channel, stating that it is an avalanche at Kapuche Lake in Nepal.

The description to the YouTube video says, “Huge Avalanche ( ) at Kapuche Lake Sikles. The Kapuche Glacier lake is located at an altitude of 2546 meters from sea level. It lies inside the small village Sikles of Kaski district in the Annapurna region. This lake has been declared as the lowest altitude glacier lake in the world. We had to spend overnight at lake in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off we were filming ourselves and all of sudden avalanche started, rest is history”.

Taking a cue from this, we did a keyword search on the Internet and found reports confirming that the video is from Kapuche Glacier Lake at Parche in Nepal’s Kaski district.

According to reports, a tourist named Shambhu Adhikari stumbled upon this view as he was recording himself playing a guitar.

We also found a report on the avalanche by The Weather Channel published on January 26, 2021. The report also says there were no casualties in the incident. Further, India Today’s Kathmandu correspondent confirmed to us that the video is from Nepal.

Hence, it is clear that the video in question is around a month old and of an avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake in Nepal.

4,4,FL-2021-000021-IND,Chamoli glacier burst: Himalayan blunders compounded - Down To Earth Magazine,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/climate-change/chamoli-glacier-burst-himalayan-blunders-compounded-75504,"The issue is about carrying capacity of the fragile region, which is even more at risk because of climate change

The flash flood in high Himalayas, which has claimed lives and wiped out two hydroelectric plants on the Ganga, should be a grim reminder of the mistakes we continue to make. There is no rocket science here about why this devastation happened. The Himalayas are the world’s youngest mountain ranges, prone to erosion and landslides and unstable because of high seismic activity.

This is compounded by the sheer madness — I will explain why I say this — of development, with hydropower projects being built back to back. On top of this, climate change and its resultant warming of glaciers and unseasonal snow and heat are exacerbating conditions in the already fragile ecosystem. On February 7, 2021, the people of Reni village — the birthplace of India’s environmental consciousness as this is where the women stopped the felling of trees — say they heard a loud bang.

Within minutes the muddy deluge gushed down damaging the 13.2 MW Rishiganga hydropower project and then washing away the under-construction 520 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project downstream. It is not clear (as yet) if the glacier melted; or there was unseasonal snow that melted; or that it was a combination.

What’s clear is that there was a landslide or avalanche that blocked the river and when the natural dam broke because of the force of water, it brought the power of kilolitres of water mixed with moraine, rock and silt. It is important to note is that this flash flood occurred in winter, when there is less water; so, destruction was limited. It should be a warning of the scale of devastation that can happen. There is no question that we are going to see more of this, not less, unless we change the way we do business with the environment.

But more importantly it will happen until we take better studied decisions on the projects and on mitigating their impacts. This is where we falter. Our systems for decision-making to assess the impacts of “development” projects were already weak and have become virtually non-existent by now. The processes of decision-making are firmly in the hands of faceless and nameless committees, where papers are shuffled around to get the desired results.

This is where the Himalayan saga must be understood. I saw it from the insides when I was briefly a member of an inter-ministerial group on issues related to the Ganga in 2013. What I found was appalling and, frankly, depressing. The water and power engineers had calculated the hydropower potential as 9,000 MW, which would be generated by 70-odd projects, small and big. As per their own admission these projects, mostly in the upper catchment of Uttarakhand Himalayas, would “affect” 80-90 per cent of the stretches of the river.

As these are mostly run-of-the-river projects where the water is diverted through tunnels or reservoirs and then released into the river, this meant that the river would not flow naturally, but would be re-constructed to 80-90 per cent of its length. The projects were designed to draw the last drop of water and during lean seasons, as per the project designers, the river would cease to flow naturally.

The inter-ministerial group was to assess this and provide guidance on the required ecological flows. The engineers argued 10 per cent ecological flow would be adequate and this is how they had designed the plethora of projects. The interest in building hydropower was obviously huge — it came from all sides; from energy industry and construction to political leaders who saw this as development opportunities for their region. But now that the list of the projects was on the table (over 6,000 MW had not been built yet), the question was how these could be justified.

I argued that the projects had to be re-worked — both the commissioned ones and those on the table — so that the ecological flow was 30 per cent of the high flood water season and 50 per cent of the low water season. I argued that projects would need to mimic the river and not the other way around. Based on extensive calculations my colleagues and I showed this re-design would not compromise on tariff or generation capacity of existing projects.

But it would mean that the number of projects would need to be drastically reduced. This was not acceptable. I wrote then how hydropower researchers at the premier Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Roorkee then manipulated data to justify that up to 25 per cent of ecological flow for 8 months and 30 per cent in lean water months would be adequate. Forget that it would dry up the river; make the mighty Ganga — which holds the collective consciousness of the country — nothing more than an engineered drain. It was okay.

My dissent was noted. And the report cleared business as usual. Since 2013, much more water has flowed down the Ganga and there has been much activism from courts and governments about the need to curtail these projects. But after all the big talk, not much has changed.

As of today, some 7,000 MW of hydroelectric projects are either operating or being constructed in this fragile region; back to back; with no respect for the river or its need to flow naturally. The issue is not about hydropower generation or the need for energy or development. It is about the carrying capacity of this fragile region, which is even more at risk because of climate change.

This needs to be assessed, but by keeping the river first and our needs next. Otherwise, the river will continue to teach us bitter lessons; it will be the revenge and rage of nature. Humans will be shown as the puny things we are.","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",,"['need', 'glacier', 'river', 'chamoli', 'himalayan', 'mw', 'water', 'ganga', 'flow', 'region', 'projects', 'blunders', 'burst', 'compounded', 'hydropower', 'cent']", ,,flood

What is glacial burst?

These rare instances occur when water dammed by a glacier or moraine is released. The glacier containing the body of water melts and overflows the glacier.

Why does a glacier break?

Glaciers break can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice.

It can also happen after a massive displacement of water in a glacial lake when a large portion of an adjacent glacier collapses into it.

The direct causes of glacial lake outbursts are earthquake, heavy rainfall/snowmelt, long-term dam degradation, etc.

Several feared missing

Over 150 people have lost their lives and over 150 are missing following the massive flood near the power project, officials said.

People stuck in those areas have been advised to call: Disaster Operations Center number 1070, 1905 or 9557444486.

Trivendra Singh Rawat said that 600 personnel from the Indian Army and ITBP are on standby for dealing with any emerging situation and all the rescue teams are doing their best to save lives of missing workers at NTPC (140 nos) and RishiGanga site (17 nos).

CM Rawat said that medical teams have been rushed to the affected site and a 30-bed hospital has been kept ready at Joshimath for dealing with this emergency.

""Hospitals in Srinagar, Rishikesh, Jollygrant, and Dehradun are on standby. We are doing our best to deal with this disaster.,"" CM said.

DEHRADUN: It's winter. February temperatures can drop to below zero in the hills of Uttarakhand's Chamoli and summer is a long way off. Why, then, did a glacier break off, with disastrous effect? Geologists who have been studying the region's glaciers said climate change is to blame.""This is an anomaly. In winter, glaciers remain firmly frozen. Even walls of glacial lakes are tightly bound. A flood of this sort in this season is usually caused by an avalanche or landslide. Neither seems to be the case here,"" Manish Mehta, senior scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, told TOI. He could not immediately recall a precedent.Mehta had led a study last year which found that the eight glaciers of the upper Rishiganga catchment - Uttari Nanda Devi, Changbang, Ramni Bank, Bethartoli, Trishul, Dakshni Nanda Devi, Dakshni Rishi Bank and Raunthi Bank - had lost over 10% of their mass in less than three decades. From 243 sq km in 1980, they had shrunk to 217 sq km in 2017, with Uttari Nanda Devi receding the most (7.7%). The upper Rishiganga catchment is where the glacier burst took place on Sunday.In the same period, the equilibrium line altitude (the zone on a glacier where its mass lost is balanced by its mass gained over a year) fluctuated a lot - between 5,200m above sea level and 5,700m. ""It does not change if climate conditions are consistent,"" MPS Bisht, director of the Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, which was also part of the study along with IIT-Kanpur and HNB Garhwal University, said.Himalayan glaciers have been retreating faster than anywhere else in the world. ""Yet, the state of glacier response (how much it retreats or advances) has not been studied extensively. So, we mapped the variations of extent and dynamics of the glaciers in the upper Rishiganga catchment, Nanda Devi region and found most glaciers have been shrinking,"" Mehta said.This has been pronounced since the 1990s. ""We found south-facing glaciers receded faster than north-facing ones, possibly because of longer exposure to insolation (solar radiation). How glaciers respond to climate is also dependent on its size and geometry.""Because the glaciers are of the ""winter accumulation type,"" a decrease in precipitation may have caused this, the study said. ""The equilibrium line altitude swing suggests glaciers in the region have responded to deprived precipitation conditions since 1980,"" Bisht said. And while temperatures have been increasing since the 1980s, the study said, the glaciers are more sensitive to changes in precipitation. The larger context, however, is that of increased global temperatures. Mehta said, ""Against the backdrop of warming since the mid-1990s, accelerated glacial reduction could be correlated with increased global temperature.""","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80740412,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-129544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['glacier', 'feb', 'cold', 'glaciers', 'flood', 'joshimath', 'chamoli', 'winter', 'ganga', 'river', 'district', 'month', 'break', 'burst', 'tunnel', 'uttarakhand']", ,,flood

New Delhi, February 8

The Uttarakhand tragedy has put a question mark on what actually led to the disaster. While some environmentalists are questioning claims of “a glacier burst”, others are pointing to long-standing struggle of locals against massive construction activities, including highways and hydropower projects such as Rishi Ganga, in eco-sensitive zones “without proper clearance”.

“Was it a glacial burst or an avalanche?” questioned Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People amid the revival of debate around infrastructure projects by those upset with the Centre and state clearances for massive infrastructure activities in fragile, eco-sensitive regions of the Himalayas.

A former member of the Narendra Modi Cabinet, Uma Bharti adds it’s something she had warned against as a minister and that the tragedy is both a matter of concern and warning. “When I was the minister, my ministry, in its affidavit about dams in Uttarakhand, had requested that it is a sensitive region. Therefore, power projects should not be built on the Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said. While Bharti said electricity shortfall could have been met by the national grid, Thakkar added that wind and solar were better ways to generate power in mountains.

There are around 98 dams in Uttarakhand. Besides, rapid infrastructure development of roads, highways, hotels is taking place in the state, leading to “virtual shake-up” of the “young” mountains. Activists have been cautioning about “weakening” of “young mountains” due to dynamite blasts and “manmade fires”.","Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2021/2/Desk/2021_2$largeimg_2101433721.jpg,"['glacier', 'state', 'thakkar', 'mountains', 'infrastructure', 'tragedy', 'projects', 'dams', 'power', 'burst', 'experts', 'uttarakhand', 'debate', 'avalanche', 'young']", ,,none

A roar, a haze, a split second of stunned silence. And then, chaos.It was an exceptionally bright Sunday morning when Mahatami Devi, 42, stepped out of her house in Uttarakhand’s Jugju village to fetch firewood and cattle fodder from the neighbouring Raini village. One of her three sons, 17-year-old Ankit, was home at the time. “I met her around 8am. I was going uphill with three men to carve a pagdandi (pathway) in Raini. She was headed downhill. She said a quick hello and moved ahead,” Sangram Singh Rawat, former gram panchayat member of Raini village, told TOI.“An hour later, there was a loud, thundering sound. When we looked up, the clear blue sky had turned grey. And then, we heard Ankit screaming, ‘Save my mother.’ A wall of water came surging through the hills, sweeping with it everything that came in its way — people, cattle, trees. We could do nothing.”Metres away, Anita Devi, 70, from Raini Chuksa village was grazing cattle when the debris-laden Dhauliganga raged through Raini. “She was with her grandson Golu and daughter-in-law Tanuja. The two of them ran for their lives when they heard the sound. Anita Devi was left behind. We saw the river swallow her as she stood there, helpless,” said Kundan Singh, 42, from Raini.While those in the higher reaches saw their loved ones swept away, those downhill darted in panic. “Bhaago (run),” people were screaming. But they could not keep going. “The air was thick, pungent. They could not breathe, could not run faster. They just buckled down and waited,” Sangram said.After about half an hour, the village elders in Raini said they should go looking for those who were missing. “What we saw was horrifying. Where we had seen people working hours ago — cutting wood, grazing cattle — there was a swamp of debris. Not one of our people could be spotted,”Sangram said. Kundan’s nephew is among them. “He had taken around 150 goats for grazing. He has gone missing,” Kundan said. With villages in the area cut off because bridges have been swept away, many labourers and their families are stranded. Kundan is hosting about 20 of them at his house.Kundan and Sangram have been protesting against hydropower projects in the geologically fragile region for years. Their petition had taken the state and Centre to court for the Rishiganga project . Kundan said, “What happened today was nature’s way of telling us things are horribly wrong.”","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80743370,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-506055,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['glacier', 'helplessly', 'away', 'flood', 'joshimath', 'ones', 'chamoli', 'ganga', 'village', 'washed', 'river', 'district', 'watched', 'burst', 'raini', 'uttarakhand', 'loved']", ,,flood
11,11,FL-2021-000021-IND,Glacier Outburst Flood: What Is It And How Does It Occur - NDTV,https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/glacial-outburst-floods-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-occur-2365224,"The incident in Uttarakhand happened Sunday morning when a glacier burst in the Tapovan area.

A glacier break in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district triggered huge flooding on Sunday followed by the evacuation of thousands - living near Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers - to safety. The flooding damaged nearby Rishiganga and NTPC power plants. Officials said over 100 labourers working in the power plant are feared dead.

Five NDRF teams - one from Dehradun and four from Delhi - have been mobilised for the rescue operation. The Army has committed six columns, each with 100 soldiers. In addition, one Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) and two Cheetah helicopters are also operating.

But what is a glacier outburst? What causes this disaster?

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) occur from an unstable natural dam formed from a glacial retreat.

Glaciers are large bodies of ice moving slowly. So, when a glacier retreats, it leaves behind a large impression in the ground, filling it with water and a lake is formed. This is known as a moraine, which can be impounded by precarious pile of debris and buried ice, according to the encyclopedia maintained by the Canada-based University of Calgary.

The moraine dammed lakes weaken as the water level rises and the glacier retreats. They might crumble under pressure from the swelling lake, leading to massive floods, it says.

Glacial lakes may vary in volume but may hold millions to hundreds of millions of cubic metre of water, say experts.

The outburst of water can also happen due to erosion, an avalanche of snow or rock, an earthquake or volcanic eruptions under the ice.

""In the Hindu Kush Himalaya, moraine-dammed glacial lakes are common and numerous GLOF events have been traced back to the failure of moraine dams. A moraine-dammed lake forms as a glacier retreats, and meltwater fills the space between the proglacial moraine (in front of the glacier) and the retreating glacier"", reads the description of GLOFS on the official website of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. ICIMOD is an intergovernmental knowledge and learning centre working on behalf of the people of the Hindu Kush Himalayas.

The glacial outbursts are also related to global warming. As the temperature soars during summers, the glaciers retreat, leaving behind water-filled, unstable moraine dammed lakes.

The incident in Uttarakhand happened Sunday morning when a glacier burst in the Tapovan area. The avalanche also brought with it muck and debris in the river.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/c86jg3b8_uttarakhand-glacier_625x300_07_February_21.jpg,"['working', 'glacier', 'flood', 'moraine', 'lakes', 'water', 'glacial', 'does', 'lake', 'occur', 'retreats', 'uttarakhand', 'outburst']", ,,flood
12,12,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand glacier burst: Experts cite impact of climate crisis - Hindustan Times,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-flood-experts-cite-impact-of-climate-crisis-101612730031647.html,"Massive inundation in Uttarakhand’s Rishi Ganga valley caused by a suspected glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) on a clear winter’s day has unnerved scientists. GLOFs and resulting disasters downstream during extreme rainfall events in glacial regions are commonly forecast by scientists. But this time scientists have seen it happen in winter, when such events are least expected.

The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation is stills investigating the matter and has not been able to zero in on the exact reason for the flooding as yet.

“Our team is there. We do not suspect an avalanche. There may be glacial lake formations, but we cannot say with certainty now. We are investigating the entire region,” said Jimmy Kansal, joint director at SASE.

The flood caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas, with 50-100 labourers working on the Rishi Ganga power project missing. Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent

It is difficult to say exactly what happened, said D P Dobhal, a former glaciologist at Dehradun-based Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.

“Locals have told me that water and debris were flowing at great speed for about 15 to 20 minutes this morning and then the flow reduced gradually. This indicates a lake outburst. It’s possible that water and debris accumulated in a lake in the glacial region of Rishi Ganga valley breached due to an avalanche. Its also possible that the avalanche took place earlier, like yesterday or very early in the morning today. The water filled up in the lake and breached. It may be very similar to what happened in 2013 with the Chorabari lake during the Kedarnath disaster. Only difference is that this time it’s in winter and that was during monsoons,” said Dobhal

In the early hours of June 17, 2013 a flash flood came down upon the overflowing banks of the Chorabari lake in Uttarakhand. Carrying huge amounts of silt and rocks, it killed at least 5,700 people, and left unprecedented damage and destruction.

Dobhal added that GLOFs will increase because of climate change. “Lakes have always formed in glaciers and some glaciers have retreated while some advanced. These are stages. But due to global warming, more glaciers are melting or retreating and there is less snow. This is very apparent in Nepal and Sikkim and not so much in Uttarakhand,” Dobhal added.

Prof Anil Kulkarni of Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, also suspected that the flooding may be linked to a GLOF.

“When glaciers retreat, glacial lakes are formed. These lakes are formed in the area vacated by the glacier. Several lakes have formed in the Rishi Ganga valley. We don’t know which one may have burst. In winter, the top layer of these lakes is frozen. During an ice avalanche or a landslide this top layer is breached and water can flow downstream, toppling the earthen dam. This is a common problem seen in glaciated terrain. We have seen this in Nepal but not in Uttarakhand so far. This is a classic case of climate change impact on the glacier. We have again and again highlighted that such disasters will become exceedingly common due to climate change as more and more glaciers retreat,” explained Kulkarni, a glaciologist and scientist at the Divecha Centre for Climate Change, IISc.

Kulkarni’s team has studied various aspects of such glacial lake discharge events. For example, last year the team modelled the impact of a GLOF on a hydroelectric project downstream of Satopanth glacial lake and found that a GLOF, combined with an extreme flood event, can cause extensive damage to the project. The study recommended regular monitoring of the Satopanth lake, especially during post-monsoon season, due to the potential risk it poses to the downstream region when combined with high-intensity rain events.

A large number of hydroelectric power plants (HEP) were damaged in the 2013 cloudburst and GLOF inKedarnath. The 400 MW Jaypee (JP) Vishnuprayag hydro-electric project (HEP), located 28 km downstream of the Satopanth lake, was one of the projects damaged by the 2013 cloudburst.

“Due to the fact that a number of glacial lakes exist within the limits of the Vishnuprayag HEP catchment, GLOF risk assessment for this hydropower station becomes very vital,” a study by Kulkarni’s team said.

Kulkarni’s team, in its science brief on GLOF, recommended long-term strategies to prevent GLOF disasters including identifying locations vulnerable to such events using computer simulations, monitoring lake expansion, determining structural strength of the moraine dam, maintaining safe water level in the lake through siphoning, and determining future glacier lake sites using remote sensing techniques.

On Sunday, there was an avalanche in Rishi Ganga valley 50 to 100 metres upstream of its confluence with Dhauliganga West. A small hydroelectric project of about 11 MW in the Rishi Ganga valley was totally destroyed. The barrage of the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project has also been damaged and water entered the intake tunnels. Around 50 workers were working at the plant at that time out of them 30 to 35 are feared to have been washed away.

Around 10 villagers who were out with cattle on the mountain slopes may have also been washed away, according to initial reports received by Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute and chairman of the Supreme Ccourt-constituted high powered committee monitoring the Char Dham road project in Uttarakhand.

“We cannot comment on this specific event because the ministry of earth sciences doesn’t monitor avalanches. We know that the 2013 Uttarakhand disaster was related to a glacial lake. However, from the climate change perspective we can definitely say that the glaciers to the western side of the Himalayas are retreating while many of those in the eastern side have also recorded advancement of glaciers. So glacial lake disasters are expected,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/02/07/1600x900/AFP_92F4NR_1612724653820_1612724684647_1612730336066.jpg,"['glacier', 'glaciers', 'lakes', 'impact', 'crisis', 'glof', 'water', 'glacial', 'lake', 'ganga', 'project', 'climate', 'cite', 'burst', 'experts', 'uttarakhand', 'rishi', 'avalanche']", ,,flood

""We are concerned over the way glaciers are melting and the tidal wave created in the mountains. The plutonium pack that was kept to monitor China's movement should also be investigated,"" he added.

Speaking about a lost plutonium pack in the region, the minister said: ""Orders were made to place plutonium pack to monitor China's movement at the borders. We request the government to investigate the pack too.""

In 1965 a plutonium pack was lost while installing a radar system on the summit of Nanda Devi mountain in Uttarakhand. Environmental experts worry that if glacier breaks in Chamoli cause any damage to this plutonium pack, it could lead to severe nuclear radiation pollution in the waters.

Maharaj further stated that the railway projects in the area are safe.

""As the water in the Srinagar dam was depleted, the debris flowing to the dam came to halt, keeping the railway projects safe,"" he said.

A few days ago, scientists who are investigating the flood said that the incident took place after a Himalayan glacier from a remote peak fell into the water.

""In the flash flood incident, scientists have observed a rockfall from a height of 5,600 meters. Since that support from the bottom had fallen, glacier fell down. The area has very steep slope into the mountain region,"" said the director of Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the incident had reached 58 with 11 more bodies being discovered from Tapovan tunnel in Joshimath of Chamoli district. As many as 146 people are yet to be found.

Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel along with National Disaster Response Force and other sister agencies have been conducting search and rescue operation in Chamoli district.

A glacier burst in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli District of Uttarakhand last week led to massive flooding in the Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.

He said that a complete ice sheet hanging on the mountain fell down, a lot of landmass came on the river valley and it moved towards downstream.

""The mass was so huge it made a dragon sort of thing with 20-25 metre head and the tail of three to four metres. It moved at a speed of 20 metres per second, as per initial findings,"" he said.

Sinha said it is possible that a crack had developed in the glacier in the last few weeks.

""I do not have complete data. If we continuously track the areas on a daily basis and working on the imprint of this disaster, then we can predict the development of such cracks and scientifically we can announce the vulnerability of the areas and be better prepared for the future. It may take a time to develop this technology,"" he added.

As many as 32 bodies have been recovered so far from different areas hit by the glacier burst in Chamoli district, while 197 people are still missing, Uttarakhand Police said.

A joint team of ITBP, NDRF, SDRF and other agencies conducting rescue operations used drone cameras to see feasibility to enter beyond cleared site inside Tapovan tunnel.

The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), under the chairmanship of cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, met on Sunday to review the Chamoli flooding disaster likely caused by a glacial lake outburst. The incident led to the rising of water levels in river Rishiganga, washing away the Rishiganga small hydro project of 13.2MW, according to a note shared by NCMC.

The floods also affected the downstream hydro project of NTPC at Tapovan on the river Dhauliganga, which is a tributary of River Alaknanda, according to people aware of the developments. The force of the water and boulders rolling down from the upper reaches near Raini village completely washed away the under-construction Rishiganga and the debris from there gushed into the Dhauli Ganga river, causing heavy damage to the 530 MW Dhauliganga hydel project, just 10km away.

“The river was flowing 10-15 metres above its normal level and took everything along. Only a few concrete structures on the banks remain of the Rishi Ganga hydel project,” said Dhan Singh Rawat, who rushed out of his house in Raini village after hearing a huge explosion.

Uttarkhand disaster relief force spokesperson Alok Raven said that the rescue teams initially recovered two bodies from the Dhauliganga hydel power project.

Vivek Pandey, a spokesperson for the paramilitary Indo Tibetan Border Police, confirmed that while the Rishiganga hydropower plant was destroyed, the Dhauliganga hydropower plant was damaged.

He said at least 42 workers got trapped inside two tunnels at the Dhauliganga plant. While 12 workers trapped inside one tunnel were rescued, at least 30 others were still stuck inside the other tunnel, he added. Another 170 workers at the two plants were missing, Pandey said.

About two years ago, residents of Raini village told the Uttarakhand high court that the construction of Rishiganga hydel project could cause damage to those living in the area. In the summer of 2019, villagers filed a public interest litigation in the court, which directed the district magistrate Chamoli and member secretary state pollution control board to constitute a joint team to inspect the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project site with regard to allegations about the impact on the environment and local people.","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/02/07/1600x900/PTI02_07_2021_000055B_1612727112448_1612727129790.jpg,"['glacier', 'workers', 'river', 'village', 'dhauliganga', 'rishiganga', 'heavy', 'hydel', 'projects', 'project', 'burst', 'plant', 'raini', 'uttarakhand', 'damage', 'epicentre', 'inside']", ,,flood

Damage to NTPC project may delay its commissioning, says Minister

The Uttarakhand glacier burst has caused an estimated loss of ₹1,500 crore at the NTPC's 480 mw Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and has put a question mark on its scheduled commissioning in 2023, Union Power Minister R K Singh said on Monday.

The minister visited Tapovan on Monday to assess the extent of damage at the project site, a day after the glacier burst in Chamoli district.

""The project was scheduled to be commissioned in 2023. But there is a question mark now on how long it will take to desilt it as lakhs of tonnes of silt is lying at the project site,"" Mr. Singh told reporters in Tapovan.

""As of now it is difficult to say when we will be able to resume work at the site and when the project will be commissioned,"" he said.

To a question, he said estimated losses caused to the project are worth around ₹1,500 crore.

However, the Union Minister ruled out any possibility of the project being scrapped.

Why did a part of the Nanda Devi glacier burst?

It's not yet known what caused part of the Nanda Devi glacier to snap off Sunday morning, sending floodwater surging downstream toward power plants and villages.

Seismic activity and a buildup of water pressure can cause glaciers to burst, but one particular concern is climate change. High temperatures coupled with less snowfall can accelerate melting, which causes water to rise to potentially dangerous levels.

“Most mountain glaciers around the world were much larger in the past and have been melting and shrinking dramatically due to climate change and global warming,” said Sarah Das, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. - AP

2019 study warned Himalayan glaciers melting at alarming speed

A study published in the journal Science Advances in June 2019 had warned that Himalayan glaciers have been melting twice as fast since the start of this century due to climate change.

The study, spanning 40 years of satellite observations across India, China, Nepal and Bhutan, indicated that climate change is eating the Himalayas’ glaciers, the researchers said.

It showed that glaciers have been losing the equivalent of more than a vertical foot and half of ice each year since 2000 — double the amount of melting that took place from 1975 to 2000.

Experts point to climate change impact

A deluge that resulted from a glacial melt on Nanda Devi flooded the Rishiganga river in Uttarakhand and washed away at least two hydroelectric power projects — the13.2 MW Rishiganga hydroelectric power project and the Tapovan project on the Dhauliganga river, a tributary of the Alakananda.

There were also concerns that the excess water would further travel downstream to the river Alaknanda and threaten villages as well as hydro projects on the river.

However the India Meteorological Department has said that no rains are forecast. Officials of the Central Water Commission meanwhile said the flooding from the glacial burst has been contained.

Tapovan hydel project entirely washed away, says ITBP Officer

Venudhar Nayak, Commanding Officer of the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) who led the rescue operation at the tunnel of the NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project, where 12 workers were rescued after a seven-hour operation on Sunday, said the project was completely washed away, and the few houses that remain undamaged on the site were covered in slush upto 20 feet deep.

Over hundred persons are missing after the flash flood, caused by the splintering of a glacier, washed away two hydel power projects — the Rishiganga small hydro project and National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) Tapovan project on the banks of the Dhauliganga river in north Uttarakhand.

Mr. Nayak, whose team of 250 personnel were the first to reach the Tapovan project said it took them seven hours to unblock the tunnel where 12 persons were struck.","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/daqqw/article33781430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rationjpeg,"['rescue', 'glacier', 'commissioning', 'disaster', 'ntpc', 'persons', 'project', 'missing', 'power', 'delay', 'singh', 'burst', 'tunnel', 'uttarakhand', 'rk', 'damage', 'tapovan']", ,,flood

Basharat Ahmad Zargar, a resident of Soura area of Srinagar and working as a private company civil engineer at the Rishi Ganga power project in Uttarakhand, went missing after the glacier burst on Sunday morning, the officials said.

Zargar is untraceable as his phone is switched off.

""We have taken up the issue with the government of Uttarakhand. We are in touch with disaster management authority there. The rescue operations are on,"" Jammu and Kashmir disaster management Director Aamir Ali said.

At least 171 people are still missing while 26 bodies have been recovered so far after a flash flood inundated a power project.

About 30 people are trapped inside a tunnel, and the operation to rescue them is underway.

During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level at Joshimath was 1,385.54m.

The water level of the Dhauliganga river at Joshimath flowed at a perilously high level, breaching all records, Central Water Commission officials said after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district leading to massive floods.

The glacial burst triggered an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations and trapped more than 100 labourers who are feared dead. The intensity of the river’s flow in a short span of time was such that it engulfed whatever came in its way.

This was a grim reminder of the Kedarnath deluge of 2013 which led to widespread devastation in the ecologically fragile Himalayan region.

“At 11 am, the water level recorded at Joshimath was 1,388m,” Saumitra Haldar, chairman, Central Water Commission told PTI. During the 2013 Uttarakhand flash floods, the highest flood level (HFL) at Joshimath was 1,385.54m, he added.

However, by 6 p.m. on February 7, the water level of the river had reached the normal levels recorded a day before, said Rajesh Kumar, the superintendent engineer (Upper and Middle Ganga division) of the Central Water Commission. He said water levels have started receding.

At Joshimath, which bore the fury of floods, the water level recorded at 1 p.m. on February 6 was 1,372.58m. At 6 p.m. on February 7, hours after the disaster, the water level was 1,375m.

In Nandprayag, at the lower stretches of the river, the water level at 6 p.m. was 840.40m. A day before, it was 848.30m at 1 p.m. Mr. Kumar said the situation was similar in Rudraprayag, Srinagar, Devprayag, Rishikesh and Devprayag.

The water level at the Srinagar Hydroelectric Project was also at the Mean Draw Down Level which helped accommodate excess flow from the upper stretches. This will be released slowly, Mr. Halder added.

The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauliganga, Rishiganga and Alaknanda rivers — all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga — triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.

Two power projects — NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and the Rishi Ganga Hydel Project — were extensively damaged with scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the waters came rushing in.

At least 12 men were rescued safely from a tunnel in the Tapovan project but at least 125 were still missing. As night fell in the ecologically fragile Himalayas and rescue work in the difficult to access areas became more difficult, there were fears they may be dead.

Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said seven bodies were recovered and at least 125 were missing.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v0855z/article33775722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DhauliGanga,"['glacier', 'joshimath', 'dhauligangas', 'records', 'river', 'ganga', 'water', 'project', 'say', 'recorded', 'commission', 'floods', 'central', 'uttarakhand', 'level']", ,,flood

Several houses were destroyed and the death toll rose to nearly 31 with over 150 people still missing.

A video is making rounds on social media claiming to show the recently occurred glacier break in Uttarakhand. The 30 seconds long video shows a massive mass of snow falling down a mountain.



It is being shared on Facebook with a caption in Hindi, ""First video of glacier breaking in Chamoli, Uttarakhand which happened this morning.""

The post has been archived here.

The same video was uploaded on YouTube claiming to show glacier break in Uttarakhand.



Claim:

This video shows the glacier burst that happened on February 7, 2021, in Uttarakhand, India.

Fact Check:

By breaking the video from the post into several keyframes and doing a reverse image search, we found out that the video was recorded in Nepal in early January 2021.

The longer version of the same video was uploaded on YouTube on January 12, 2021. The video was titled, ""Massive avalanche at Kapuche Glacier Lake, Nepal.""

Here is the comparison between the video from the viral post and the video uploaded prior to the Uttarakhand tragedy. The location is identified to be the same and confirms the location to be Nepal.

The first image (top) shows the screenshot of the viral video and the bottom one is from the video mentioning Nepal uploaded on January 12.

The original video was uploaded by a user named @naren32 on Instagram in January 2021 which received a lot of attention. Later, the same account posted an over 3-minute long video of the avalanche with a caption that says, ""Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake. Here comes a full video of a huge avalanche, had to spend overnight at Kapuche lake (Lowest altitude glacier lake in the world) in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off.""

The same video was also uploaded on Facebook by an account named Natural Beauty of Nepal on January 13, 2021.



On searching with a few relevant keywords, a news report published on January 16, 2021, also comes up where the same video has been mentioned. The report says, ""Tourists vacationing in the mountains of Nepal filmed a powerful avalanche that hit them, and caused admiration on the network. The group spent the night near Lake Capuche and the next morning captured an unusual phenomenon. The recording shows how a huge avalanche gradually descends from the mountains, raising clouds of snow into the air, and then crashing onto the reservoir.""



Hence, a video of an avalanche from Nepal was circulated with false claims of it being recent and from Uttarakhand.

CNN is acknowledging it was ""inappropriate"" for its anchor Chris Cuomo to advise his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), on how to handle his sexual harassment scandal. The CNN host took part in a series of strategy calls earlier this year focused on how to respond after the New York governor faced allegations of sexual harassment, The Washington Post revealed on Thursday. These calls reportedly included the governor's top aide, communications team, lawyers, and advisers, and the CNN anchor urged his brother not to resign while citing ""cancel culture,"" the Post says. Chris Cuomo hosts a nightly show on CNN, and he said in March he could ""obviously"" not cover his brother's scandal on the air, though CNN would continue to do so.

CNN in a statement to the Post confirmed that Cuomo, who ""often serves as a sounding board for his brother,"" participated in these calls and said doing so was ""inappropriate"" but that he won't be disciplined. ""It was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the governor's staff, which Chris acknowledges,"" CNN said. ""He will not participate in such conversations going forward."" CNN previously faced criticism for allowing Chris Cuomo to interview his brother numerous times on the air early on during the COVID-19 pandemic last year.

NAINITAL: The Rishiganga hydroelectric power project which was washed away after the glacier burst in Raini village and where several workers are still feared trapped had been red-flagged by local villagers as an ""impending disaster"".

In 2019, a village resident named Kundan Singh had filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) alleging unfair and environmentally hazardous practices by the private firm involved in the project. It was alleged that the firm was ""using explosives and blasting the mountains for mining"". The blasting, the petition said, had damaged the sensitive areas around the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve.

Singh had said that all the waste material from the project was being dumped into the Rishiganga river adding that despite complaints from the villagers, no action was taken. ""Moreover, it was also noticed that the blatant stone crushing activity was being carried out on the riverbed

""It flouted all norms that the government had laid down for stone crushing activity in this area.... Even though the villagers complained to the authorities about the violations, no credible action was taken,"" Singh said in the petition.

Based on the PIL, the court had observed that use of explosives may ""result in destruction of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and the Valley of Flowers"". Therefore, the court banned the use of explosives in the area, and in June 2019, directed the member secretary of the pollution control board and the district magistrate to constitute a joint inspection team and visit the site.

However, the report, a copy of which is available with TOI, exonerated the firm and said that it found no proof of illegal mining or blasting. ""During the inspection, there was no proof of any illegal mining being done on the spot and no evidence could be collected,"" read the report.

However, the court was informed that there still was some muck around the barrage and power house which was yet to be cleared. On July 26, the court had listed the case for further hearing in August. There hasn't been a single hearing after that and the case is still pending in the HC.

There was a hanging glacier that slipped with rock and ice falling from 5,600 metres altitude owing to gravitational pull and this caused disaster in Uttarakhand, as per preliminary observations of experts.

This explanation by scientists comes days after Home Minister Amit Shah told Parliament that initial inquiry has revealed that a landslide triggered a snow avalanche covering approximately 14 square km area and caused a flash flood in the Rishiganga river downstream in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district.

The scientists, however, say it is difficult to comment right now if climate change has been directly responsible for the February 7 catastrophic that washed away two upcoming hydropower stations, claiming at least 34 dead and 200 missing who are feared dead.

Explaining what caused the flash flood, Mohd. Farooq Azam, who is an Assistant Professor at IIT Indore, told IANS in an interview that the Nanda Devi glacier did not burst.

""There is no terminology in science like 'glacier burst'. But we believe that there was a hanging glacier which slipped with rock and ice falling from 5,600 metres altitude,"" he said.

""To understand if the incident was climate change-driven or not, we need to understand how glaciers grow. They have a pattern of snow and melt in winter and summer seasons respectively. This is a normal phenomenon. Now, this was a hanging glacier. It is possible that the glacier also collected mass and debris over a period of time.

""We cannot say with confidence right now if climate change had a role to play, but it is possible that the strength of the mass was weakened due to climate-driven factors,"" he explained.

Azam said a team of scientists are at the site in Chamoli district trying to understand what caused this disaster.

""It is early February so temperatures in the area are low and not much melting would be happening right now which could've led to this. ""So far the only explanation is that a hanging glacier cracked due to gravitational pull and the weight of the accumulated mass, which resulted in this avalanche.

""However, there is no doubt that global warming is impacting the local climate of the region. The Himalayas are experiencing warmer winters, erratic and extreme rain and snow, more than ever before. These changes are leaving their imprint on the region,"" said the glaciologist.

""But the mystery which scientists are looking for answers for is what is the source of the water we saw in videos on February 7. Some water will be generated from the heat energy of the fall, but that does not justify the quantum that hit Raini village.""

This disaster is a grim reminder of the 2013 flash floods and landslides in Uttarakhand that claimed the lives of thousands of people and animals. Of course, the effects of such an event can be mitigated by some early warning systems, Azam told IANS.

Advertisement ""When there is a glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF) or flash flood, the only solution is that is an early warning system which can warn communities and authorities to prepare to evacuate people living in these areas.

""Secondly, exposed glacier lakes have the potential to burst and lead to such disasters. But it is possible to pump out water from these lakes. This has been done in Peru and Nepal, where water levels in such glacier lakes are reduced to safe zones to mitigate disaster risks.""

On the need to review the policy on 'water grab' dams that put fragile Himalayan ecology in peril, he replied, ""Yes, although not 100 per cent sure how climate change effects are being taken into account when environmental impact assessments are done on these dams and other infrastructure projects.""

""Natural disasters or climate change-induced disasters can harm these infrastructures, so there needs to be better planning for such projects and a review of the present situation of all dams. This lesson should be learnt after this tragedy,"" he said.

Observing climate change is increasing, Mandira Shreshtha, programme coordinator, HI-RISK Initiative with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), said: ""It is evident that climate change is increasing the occurrence of extreme events in the region.""

""Hydrometeorological monitoring is very important. However, the network density in higher elevations in our Himalayan region is poor and much lower than those recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). To monitor the changes occurring, we need to strengthen our hydrometeorological networks.

""Satellite data and information in real-time provides some opportunities, however, it has its limitations. In addition to strengthening our monitoring networks there is a need for risk assessments and increasing awareness of the communities living downstream to minimise the adverse impacts of such disasters,"" said Shreshtha.

The science behind what is currently happening in the Himalayas was forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2019 report that said glaciers would retreat in the upcoming years, causing landslides and floods.

Himalayan glaciers play an important role in South Asia, providing drinking water and water resources for agriculture, hydropower and biodiversity. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are a crucial water supply for the 240 million people who live in the region, including 86 million Indians, roughly the equivalent of the country's five biggest cities combined.

Another comprehensive report two years ago, the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment, coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) notes that eastern Himalaya glaciers have tended to shrink faster than those in central and western Himalaya.

High resolution images available with NDTV indicate the clearest ever sequence of events leading up to the glacier burst in Uttarakhand's Chamoli on Sunday, which left 30 dead and over 170 missing.

Before and after images with fairly incredible clarity show the magnitude of the avalanche.

An image from February 6 shows an ice and snow covered ridge line, a part of the Trishala glacier. But after the avalanche, on February 8, an entire chunk of ice is missing.

Similar changes are seen in an area a few kilometres from where the avalanche was triggered. The area was snowed under but after the avalanche, the impact is visible. On the day of the quake, a massive chunk of ice and snow just disappeared.

The river near the Tapovan hydel plant, which was washed away, was a narrow stream of green-coloured water on February 6. On February 8, it became a broad river of brown mud.

A long shot of the entire area highlights the scale of the destruction.

On February 6, the day before the avalanche, the Tapovan hydel plant could be seen. That is where the avalanche would hit a day later. The path of the landslide and dust are clearly visible in the images. On February 8, after the dust clears up, it is all a field of debris.

Experts believe a block of rock, with some ice, dropped almost two kilometres before hitting the valley floor, generating a huge rock and ice avalanche, which raced down the glacier at a high speed.

The rock avalanche will have generated a huge amount of heat and will have induced fragmentation, experts say. The ice was likely crushed and melted, which caused the landslide to transition to a flow of debris.

Home Minister Amit Shah, in a statement on the tragedy in parliament, said: ""It is observed from the satellite data (Planet Lab) of 7th February, 2021 in catchment of Rishi Ganga river at the terminus of the glacier at an altitude of 5,600m, a landslide triggered a snow avalanche covering approximately 14 square km area and causing a flash flood in the downstream of Rishi Ganga River.""","Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/f5eqt168_gif-ukd_625x300_09_February_21.gif,"['images', 'glacier', 'river', 'satellite', 'avalanches', 'day', 'ice', 'high', 'resolution', 'path', 'destruction', 'click', 'snow', 'uttarakhand', 'avalanche']", ,,flood

A glacial burst that triggered a deadly flash flood in the Indian Himalayas at the weekend was a disaster waiting to happen, and one likely to be repeated in a region transformed by climate change and unchecked infrastructure development, experts warn. Asia is home to some of the world's biggest waterways, from the Ganges and the Indus in India to the Yangtze and Mekong originating in China, that snake for thousands of kilometres. They support the livelihoods of vast numbers of farmers and fishermen, and supply drinking water to billions of people, but have come under unprecedented pressure in recent years.

Higher temperatures are causing glaciers that feed the rivers to shrink, threatening water supplies and also increasing the chances of landslides and floods, while critics blame dam building and pollution for damaging fragile ecosystems.

""Rivers are really at risk from development projects, dumping of solid waste and liquid waste, sand mining and stone mining,"" Himanshu Thakkar, from the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, told AFP.

""Climate change is a longer-term process that has already set in. The impacts are already happening.

""So in every respect, rivers are under greater threat.""

The disaster in India was apparently triggered by a glacial burst, that unleashed a wall of water which barrelled down a valley in Uttarakhand state, destroying bridges and roads and hitting two hydroelectric power plants.

Dozens have been killed and more than 170 others are missing after the accident on the Dhauliganga river, which feeds into the Ganges.

Shrinking glaciers

It is not yet clear what damaged the glacier and triggered the accident, but there are suspicions that construction of hydro-power projects – in an area that is highly seismically active – may have contributed.

""This area is prone to vulnerability, it is not appropriate for this kind of bumper-to-bumper hydro-power development,"" Himanshu said. ""Proper planning, impact assessment, proper geological assessment – this has not happened here.""

Patricia Adams, executive director from Canada-based environmental NGO Probe International, said dam building in such an area was simply too dangerous, as it makes hillsides unstable and causes landslides.

Some have also pointed to rising temperatures as a contributing factor.

A major study in 2019 suggested Himalayan glaciers had melted twice as fast since the turn of the century as in the 25 preceding years.

""The impacts of climate change in the Himalayas are real,"" said Benjamin P. Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

As well as greater danger of accidents, glacier loss in the Himalayas deprives local communities of water to drink and for agriculture, he said.

There have been other flooding disasters in the region in recent years. In 2013, some 6,000 people died when flash floods and landslides swept away entire villages in Uttarakhand as rivers swollen by monsoon rains overflowed.

Record deluges

In neighbouring China, flooding has also worsened on major rivers.

Last year the Yangtze, Asia's longest waterway, suffered record deluges that killed hundreds of people and submerged thousands of homes, with environmentalists saying it indicated climate change impacts were growing.

China has also built a vast dam network, although authorities insist this infrastructure helps mitigate flooding rather than adding to the problem.

Like in India, this has proved controversial, with some blaming the structures for contributing to earthquakes and landslips.

Beijing's dam building has faced criticism outside the country particularly on the Mekong River, which begins on the Tibetan Plateau in China and winds through Southeast Asia.

Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam all battled severe drought in 2019, as the tide of the river fell to record lows.

While some pointed to climate change, there were also calls for China to be more transparent about its dam operations – Beijing has constructed 11 dams on its section of the river.

In downstream countries, dozens of hydro-power dams have been built or are planned – many funded by Chinese-backed companies – sparking concerns about environmental damage.

Some see sinister motives in Beijing's Mekong dam building.

The Chinese Communist Party ""now control some of the mightiest rivers in the world on which millions and millions of people in downstream neighbouring countries depend for their food, their agriculture, and shipping, and their security"", said Adams from Probe International.","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Chamoli-Glacier-Burst-Uttarakhand-7-February_PTI-Photo.jpg,"['waterways', 'highlights', 'triggered', 'climate', 'technology', 'uttarakhand', 'mekong', 'river', 'china', 'firstpost', 'dam', 'power', 'infra', 'glacier', 'change', 'unsustainable', 'water', 'india', 'pressure', 'rivers']", ,,flood_and_drought

Authorities deliberated mechanisms to prevent such disasters in the future.

Ranjit Rath, the director general of Geological Survey of India, said that while prima facie assessment suggested that the flooding was caused due to glacial calving at highest altitude in Rishiganga, Dhauliganga and their upper reaches, it was still “too early” to predict the exact cause of the incident, ANI reported. He said a committee will be formed to look into the matter.

The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, which is also looking into the incident, also indicated towards glacial formations, reported the Hindustan Times.

“We do not suspect an avalanche,” said Jimmy Kansal, joint director at SASE. “There may be glacial lake formations, but we cannot say with certainty now. We are investigating the entire region.”

Explaining the phenomenon of glacial lakes, Professor Anil Kulkarni of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, said that they are formed when glaciers retreat , leaving an area vacant.

“Several lakes have formed in the Rishi Ganga valley,” Kulkarni said, according to the Hindustan Times. “In winter, the top layer of these lakes is frozen. During an ice avalanche or a landslide this top layer is breached and water can flow downstream, toppling the earthen dam. This is a common problem seen in glaciated terrain.”

Kulkarni said that it was a “classic case of climate change” and that such incidents took place often in Nepal, but not in Uttarakhand.

Meanwhile, the construction of the Char Dham Pariyojana highway project and a couple of dams on Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers have also come under the scanner for causing damage to the ecological balance.

The natural disaster, which took place within eight years of a similar incident in Kedarnath, has also prompted the government to establish a multi-hazard early warning system for disaster-risk management, according to The Tribune. Currently, the Ministry of Earth Sciences can make predictions 24 hours before such events, which may not be adequate for sudden floods like the one that Uttarakhand suffered on Sunday.

As many as 19 bodies have been recovered so far, while more than 150 people are still missing, the state police said.

One body was recovered late on Thursday night from the banks of the Alaknanda at Helang between Joshimath and Pipalkoti, Chamoli district police said on Friday.

The body was found at a coffer barrage of the THDC, it said. With this recovery, the number of deaths in the February 7 disaster has risen to 62 while 142 people are still missing, they said.

The number of bodies recovered from the intake Adit tunnel of Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project where a massive search operation has been under way ever since the tragedy struck still stands at 13.

Besides, 28 human limbs have also been recovered from different places in the affected area out of which one has been identified. Thirty-three bodies out of the 62 recovered so far have also been identified, police said, adding the DNAs of unidentified bodies are being preserved.

The glacial burst over Rishiganga had triggered an avalanche which had demolished a 13.2 MW hydel project along the river besides causing extensive damage to the NTPC's Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project along Dhauliganga.

More than three dozen people remained trapped Monday in a tunnel filled with debris and mud after it was slammed by a wall of water unleashed when part of a glacier broke free in northern India.

The flood happened Sunday morning when part of the Nanda Devi glacier snapped off and released the water trapped behind it.

The tunnel is at one of two power plants damaged when the floodwaters roared down a mountain in the northern state of Uttarakhand and smashed through two dams and inundated villages.

At least 18 people were killed in the disaster and 165 are missing in the Chamoli district, according to the Associated Press.

In addition to the two hydroelectric plants, an unknown number of houses were destroyed and several bridges were washed away, the Indian Express reported.

About 13 villages have been cut off because of the destroyed bridges, the Times of India reported. Helicopters are flying supplies to them.

The teams, including members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the National Disaster Response Force, have cleared about 425 feet of debris and muddy slurry in the tunnel but still have two to three hours to go, the Times of India reported.

Teams also are searching for bodies downstream along the banks of the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers.

Experts said the disaster could be linked to global warming.

Melting can cause lakes to form on glaciers. Rising temperatures can speed up that melting and the trapped water can rise to potentially dangerous levels, AP reported.

The increasing water pressure or seismic activity can cause the glacier to burst and unleash the water.

“There are many glaciers and glacial dammed lakes across the Himalayas, but most are unmonitored,” Sarah Das, an associate scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, told AP. “Many of these lakes are upstream of steep river valleys and have the potential to cause extreme flooding when they break. Where these floods reach inhabited regions and sensitive infrastructure, things will be catastrophic.""

That may sound mystical but the stone quarrying, blasting of mountains and digging of tunnels in the base of the fragile mountain system for the two back-to-back under-construction dams on Rishi Ganga and Dhauli Ganga rivers, despite warning by experts and ecologists, had played havoc with the local ecology.

And, climate change, held responsible for faster glacial melting, could have aggravated the situation. A 2019 report by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development said that 36% of the volume of glaciers in Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region will be gone by the end of 2100 if the world manages to keep the temperature rise within 1.5 degrees Celsius as mandated by Paris Climate Agreement. Though the disaster region may not strictly fall in the HKH, its findings confirm what has been said in various studies on faster melting of glaciers feeding the perennial Ganga from the upper reaches of Uttarakhand and China.

The data from the Indian Space Research Organisation’s resource centre on Himalayan glaciers reveals that melting of the glaciers in Central Himalayan catchment area, where Chamoli falls, has increased in the first 20 years of this century. A research based on the study of 650 glaciers spanning 2,000 kms and published in journal, Science Advances, in June 2019 showed that glacial melting has doubled since 2000 as compared to 1975-2000. The faster melting of hundreds of Ganga glaciers would impact livelihood of close to 600 million people living in the Ganga river basin from Uttarakhand to Bangladesh, and India’s economy.

Glacial melting and bursts are well-documented but little attention has been paid to the damage caused to the local ecology and loss of forest cover in the upper reaches of Central Himalayas for building hydel dams and construction of wider roads (read Char Dham road project) keeping environmental norms at bay. Villagers of Raini in Chamoli, now the epicentre of the Sunday disaster, had petitioned the Uttarkhand high court in May 2019 against illegal stone quarrying on Rishi Ganga river bed, blasting of mountains and improper muck disposal by contractors engaged in construction of Rishi Ganga hydel project. The district magistrate of Chamoli , asked by the high court to submit a report, found some of the allegations true.

The fragile upper reaches of Uttarakhand, source for several small riverine systems feeding Ganga, already has 16 dams and another 13 are under construction. The state government has proposed another 54 dams to harness hydel energy potential of these rivers. On Dhauli Ganga river, 8 back-to-back new hydel projects are proposed in addition to National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project, which was badly damaged in Sunday’s flash floods. Geologists say that such heavy drilling of a young and under-studied mountain systems such as Himalayas and loss of massive green cover for these dams were causing an irreparable damage.

What should be an eye-opener for those pursuing the death of Himalayan ecology in the name of development is that rarely, anywhere in the world, two big disasters in a region have taken place in less than a decade. A similar flash flood caused by glacial lake burst ravaged the Kedarnath shrine at the peak of the pilgrimage season in June 2013, killing close to 3,000 people and leaving thousands missing. The death toll in Chamoli disaster is expected to be around 180.

There is enough data to suggest that severe flash floods due to glacial melt in Uttarkhand have increased post-2000 and if the present Himalayan destruction continues, it would rise further and would be more fierce. If we don’t stop this ecological catastrophe, the nature will strike back again, as it did in Kedarnath and Chamoli, and next time, it could be worse.

Uttarakhand glacier burst: what you need to know

The incident—a glacial lake outburst flood—took place on Sunday morning and most of the damage took place in the few hours thereafter. Authorities are not expecting any further impact from this incident.

The event has affected a small part of the very large state of Uttarakhand. The incident took place near Raini in Chamoli district, towards the edge of the Nanda Devi National Park.

Areas affected are 35km upstream from Joshimath. Access to Chamoli and Nanda Devi National Park has been hit though rescue teams are working at restoring the road links.

Dehradun , Rishikesh , Haridwar have not been affected by Sunday’s flash flood. Hotels and other facilities are open and functional. Roads in these regions are also unaffected by Sunday’s incident.

Rafting on the Ganga was temporarily suspended as a precaution. But water levels in the river at these places did not rise as feared. The situation around Shivpuri, Rishikesh, Haridwar remains normal.

Nainital, Mukteshwar, Almora, Ranikhet are not affected either. They are nowhere close to Raini or even the Alaknanda River, which bore the brunt.

The ski resort of Auli is also very far from the affected region. It remains accessible and operational.

Joshimath, Uttarakhand – On Sunday morning, Rishi Prasad, 57, ran as fast as he could to save his son but he could reach the tunnel where his son was, massive boulders, trees and mud had already blocked its entrance.

Abhishek Panth, 24, was working in an under-construction tunnel near Tapovan Dam, at the confluence of Dhauliganga and Rishiganga Rivers – in Chamoli district about 280km (173 miles) east of Dehradun, capital of the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.

Panth is among the dozens of people still trapped inside the 2km (1.24-mile) long tunnel, Aparna Kumar of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), which is a part of the rescue operations, told Al Jazeera on Tuesday.

The tunnel is part of the multimillion-dollar, 520-megawatt Tapovan hydroelectric project, one of the two dam projects destroyed on Sunday by a deadly flash flood triggered by a Himalayan glacial burst, which has claimed at least 31 lives so far while some 175 others are missing, according to the Uttarakhand State Disaster Response Fund.

The family of Abhishek Panth, who is trapped in a tunnel since Sunday, at their home in Tapovan [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] The distraught father, who saw his son leave their home shortly before the disaster, could not hold back his tears. His wife has not spoken since; she lies on a bed with relatives sitting around her, hoping those trapped inside the tunnel are alive.

“I don’t know whether my son is alive or dead,” Prasad told Al Jazeera. “It’s been more than 50 hours now, but the administration has not been able to clear the tunnel.”

Meanwhile, the Rishi Ganga hydel project near Raini village, almost six kilometres from Tapovan Dam, has been completely washed away by the floods caused by the glacier burst.

Officials say over 40 people, who were working at the power station, are either trapped under the debris or have been washed away by the waters. However, relatives of the victims say that the number could be as high as 50.

“The height of water at this location was around 100 meters and one can very well imagine the velocity and impact of that water,” said Ashu Singh Rathore, chief engineer with the Border Roads Organisation – which is carrying out the rescue operation at the site along with teams of NDRF and security forces.

Four bodies were recovered at the site earlier in the day.

‘Not seen such a scene in our lives’

Hundreds of rescue workers, including Indian army personnel, are scouring muck-filled ravines and valleys, looking for survivors at several sites, including the tunnel.

The sounds of choppers and military helicopters making rounds to assist the rescue efforts fill the air.

Balvir Singh Rawat, 32, who runs a shop in Tapovan village, told Al Jazeera that at about 10:30am (05:00 GMT) on Sunday, he heard a loud bang.

Balvir Singh Rawat runs a shop in Tapovan village [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] “We thought the whole mountain had broken down,” he said.

“After five minutes, we looked at the river. There was no water but big boulders, trees and mud moving and its level only rising and rising. We had not seen such a scene in our lives.”

Darshan Singh, 58, who runs a tea stall in the same village, adds: “We thought this is our end.”

Singh, who lives in the neighbouring village of Bangool on the other side of the Dhauliganga river, is trapped in Topavan as the bridge over the river has been washed away.

“I don’t know for how many days I will have to stay in Topavan but I’m happy that my family members are safe,” he said.

ITBP’s Kumar said 13 villages are cut off after the flood washed away their bridges.

The damaged Tapovan hydroelectric project [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] Narendra Lal, 46, worked as a mason at the dam for the past five years. His body was fished out from the river on Sunday night.

Lal is survived by his elderly mother, wife and four children; he was the family’s only breadwinner.

On Tuesday afternoon, dozens of villagers assembled at his modest house on a hill in Topavan to demand that the family be given not only a one-time compensation announced by the government but also a monthly fund to run the household.

Lal’s neighbour Mohan Bajwal asked why he was working on a Sunday when most offices were shut for the weekly holiday.

“Had the company not kept its office open on Sunday, so many people would have been alive today,” he told Al Jazeera.

‘Want this project closed once and for all’

Ram Kishan lost his wife Sarojni Devi and daughter Anjana Semwal, 18, after they were swept away while cutting grass near the river on Sunday. Their bodies have still not been found.

The 52-year-old blamed the hydroelectric projects for the glacier breaking. He told Al Jazeera that the blasting undertaken for the construction had damaged his house and has now taken away two members of his family.

“We are poor people and can’t fight these big corporations but I want this project to be closed once and for all. This is not for our betterment. This is our destruction” he said.

Kishan’s younger daughter Sanjana, 16, told Al Jazeera that she wants to see her mother and sister and for them to have a proper funeral.

“My only appeal to the government is to find my mother and sister.”

The Himalayan state of Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides. Sunday’s disaster has prompted calls by environmental groups for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains.

“In order to construct these hydropower projects, dams and roads, massive blasting was done in these mountains and this is what we see now,” said Om Prakash, 39, a local from Topavan.

Prakash told Al Jazeera the local residents had protested against the projects when they were announced. “But nobody listened to us. Now, here is the result,” he said.

“Our fears are now turning into a reality.”

Appeals to do more

Families of the victims at the Rishi Ganga hydel project allege that the authorities are not doing enough to find their loved ones.

“There are just three machines clearing the debris here and two out of them are primarily there for the road connectivity. The administration is not bothered that almost 50 people are trapped inside this debris,” said Shabir Ahmad Zargar, whose brother Basharat Ahmad was working at the power project and is missing since Sunday.

Ahmad, a resident of Srinagar in the Indian Administered Kashmir was working as General manager at the power project, according to his family.

Rathore of the Border Roads Organisation told Al Jazeera that his organisation’s primary job is to connect disconnected villages with the rest of the state after the flood water washed away the bridge near Raini village.

“We are basically here for connectivity purpose but at the same time on the request of the local administration, our one machine is working where the people are trapped that is why we have been able to recover four bodies today and we are going very slow because any kind of body if we recover, it has to be recovered safely,” he said.

48,48,FL-2021-000021-IND,U'khand glacier burst: River Alaknanda in Srinagar flowing below warning level - BW Businessworld,http://www.businessworld.in/article/U-khand-glacier-burst-River-Alaknanda-in-Srinagar-flowing-below-warning-level/07-02-2021-374840,"New Delhi [India], February 7 (ANI): Amid the concerns over the avalanche triggered after a glacial burst in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on Sunday, the Central Water Commission (CWC) informed that River Alaknanda at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal is flowing 'much below' the warning level.

""River Alaknanda at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal, Uttrakhand is flowing much below the warning level as the impact of Glacial Lake burst is felt only up to Joshimath,"" tweeted the CWC.

Amrendra Kumar Sengar, IG National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said: ""Since the flow of water was very fast initially, bodies are being recovered far away from the incident site. Some are trapped in deep areas and others in tunnels, so there is issue of access.""

The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has rescued all 16 people who were trapped in the tunnel near the Tapovan area following a glacier burst.

The ITBP was carrying out the rescue operation at the tunnel near Tapovan dam in Chamoli to rescue trapped people. At least nine bodies have been recovered from the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) site in the Tapovan area, informed SS Deswal, Director General, ITBP.

""It is suspected that around 100 workers were at the site out of which, 9-10 dead bodies have been recovered from the river,"" he said.

Meanwhile, seven Navy diving teams are on standby for the flash flood relief operations in the state, said the Navy officials.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of those who lost their lives due to the glacial burst.

Addressing a press conference, Trivendra Singh Rawat said, ""The state government will provide financial assistance of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of the deceased.""



As it was the last day of the week (Sunday), fortunately, many workers from Uttarakhand were on week off today, he added.



Nearly 180 sheep and goats were believed to have been swept away in the flash flood, said Rawat adding five locals including three shepherds and two women who were cutting grass had lost their lives in the disaster.



""We are assuming that around 125 people are missing. The number can be higher,"" Rawat said. He added that the government has all the needed assistance to handle the situation for now. (ANI)

49,49,FL-2021-000021-IND,13 of 486 Uttarakhand glacial lakes vulnerable: GSI - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/13-of-486-uttarakhand-glacial-lakes-vulnerable-gsi/article33782869.ece,"Team of experts will assess damage and trigger factor responsible for Sunday outburst, says official

The Geological Survey of India has through remote sensing and multispectral data found 13 of 486 glacial lakes in Uttarakhand to be vulnerable.

A glacial lake can breach causing outburst flood like the one in Chamoli on Sunday due to avalanche or landslip in its periphery, cloudburst in the catchment, a major quake and other geological factors, GSI’s Director-General Ranjit Rath said in New Delhi on Monday.

“The glaciers in the Himalayas are retreating under climate change scenario. This is a global phenomenon,” Dr. Rath said, adding that glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) can result in the discharge of a huge volume of water leading to severe damage downstream.

“With the passage of time, some of the glacial lakes near the terminus often coalesce and form large glacial lakes dammed by glacial moraines. The moraines comprising loose boulders, gravels and sand admixture often containing dead ice impart inherent weakness to these dams.”

These lakes are quite common on the debris-covered Himalayan glaciers with their lower part moving very slowly and at times remaining almost stationary. Sudden triggering mechanisms make them burst out, he said.

Dr. Rath said the GSI had during 2014-16 undertaken the compilation of an inventory of glacial lakes of the Uttarakhand Himalaya to identify high-risk areas for GLOF. This was done as a follow-up of the Kedarnath tragedy in June 2013.

“We identified 486 glacial lakes excluding the supra-glacial lakes and 13 of these were found to be vulnerable,” he said.

According to the GSI’s inventory, 71 lakes of different sizes and types are in the upper reaches of Rishiganga and Dhauliganga valley.

“The GSI is in the process of finding out the focal point of this unfortunate flash flood event. Right now, it is not clear whether the flood is a typical GLOF or some temporary damming due to a landslip and avalanche that might have blocked the mainstream to form a temporary lake which got burst.”

He said a team of experts will assess the damage and the trigger factor responsible for the outburst once the water level recedes.

“The floodwater and mudflow will lose steam and cause less harm to life and property in the lower reaches. However, people living close to the river should be properly alerted,” Dr. Rath said.","Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pniplv/article33782889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILEPHOTONAINITALLAKE4jpg,"['flood', 'lakes', 'glof', 'water', 'glacial', 'rath', 'lake', 'vulnerable', '486', 'gsi', 'uttarakhand', 'outburst', 'damage', '13']", ,,flood

Coimbatore: International geologists and glaciologists studying satellite imagery say the cause of the Chamoli flooding disaster in Uttarakhand appears to be a landslide and not a glacial outburst as widely believed.

The first identification was done by Dr Dan Shugar of University of Calgary, who specialises in high altitude glacial and geologic environments. Shugar used satellite images from Planet Labs, captured before and after the disaster, to deduce that a landslide triggered the catastrophic flash floods along the Alaknanda and Dhauliganga rivers, as also evidenced by a trail of dust visible in the satellite imagery.

Actrually, it looks like it may have been a landslide from just W of the glacier. See here. Possibly from the steep hanging glacier in the middle of the Google Earth image. pic.twitter.com/6ImcwI91d7 — Dr Dan Shugar (@WaterSHEDLab) February 7, 2021

Earlier reports stated that the flooding was caused by a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), which occurs when a natural lake is formed from a glacial ice melt and the lake is breached. However, available satellite images seemingly do not show the presence of a glacial lake before the flooding event.

No lakes of any size visible on the surface but unfortunately the satellite imagery doesn't show farther upvalley and so can't tell if it was from a large supraglacial landslide that might have broken up the glacier. — Dr Dan Shugar (@WaterSHEDLab) February 7, 2021

Instead, glaciologists and geologists identified a steeply hanging bit of a glacier which likely developed a crack and caused a landslide, triggering an avalanche and the subsequent flooding.

Images from Copernicus’s Sentinel 2 satellite also showed the formation or opening of a crack in the Nanda Devi glacier that is believed to have triggered the landslide.

What likely happened

In all likelihood, a steep, hanging portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off at Trishuli, in what is called a ‘rockslope detachment’. This potentially caused nearly 2,00,000 square metres of ice to drop 2 kilometres vertically, causing a landslide, impacting the valley floor and shattering instantly. This debris, rock, and ice then flowed downslope in the form of an avalanche, identified by the dust trail in the satellite imagery.

This avalanche flowed onto the glacier itself. Such intense flows of rock can cause tremendous heat generation, melting ice and causing transient, slushy lakes and/or water flows.

Additionally, there was likely more ice-cored moraine, or ice covered by sediment, as well as stagnant glacial ice downstream, as identified by Matt Westoby, a physical geography lecturer specialising in glacial analysis in Northumbria University.

These large volumes of ice, spanning nearly 3.5 km, would have further melted due to the heat generated by the landslide and avalanche, leading to the huge volumes of water that flooded the rivers.

It's late, and I'm squinting, but looks to be ~3.5km-worth of stagnant glacier/ice-cored moraine downstream of the point where the avalanche hit the valley floor. If so, there's your source of additional water for flow bulking. pic.twitter.com/cuGMRCxXGC — Matt Westoby (@MattWestoby) February 7, 2021

This theory was confirmed by landslide experts too. According to Dave Petley of University of Sheffield, the event is similar to the 2012 Seti river flooding in Nepal, which was also triggered by a rockslope failure.

Saurabh Vijay, assistant professor at IIT-Roorkee who studies glaciers, identified from satellite images large amounts of freshly fallen snow over the last week that likely contributed to both the avalanche and the volume of water.

Adding Feb 2 image to Feb 6 and 7 images indicates the role of freshly fallen snow cover in inducing massive landslide. Needs further investigation though. @GlacierResearch @BhambriRakesh @irrfank pic.twitter.com/XBEZAzPbrc — Saurabh Vijay (@saurabhvergia) February 7, 2021

While landslide-triggered flows could cause enough heat to form temporary, transient dams of water that get quickly washed away in a flooding event, the event is not a ‘glacial outburst’.

What is GLOF?

A GLOF event is where a naturally formed lake of glacial meltwater is breached, causing a catastrophic release of large volumes of water downstream.

Glaciers on mountain tops and the sides of mountains accumulate ice from snowfall. This ice melts in a process called ablation, adding water to downstream water bodies and rivers. The process is continuous and is a part of the Earth’s natural water cycle.

As a glacier retreats, i.e., reduces in size because of melting, it leaves sediments in the melted freshwater in the form of clay and sand as well as rocks, boulders, and gravel. These deposits often create natural dams called moraines that contain meltwater within.

These natural dams or glacial lakes can overflow or be punctured/breached, leading to flooding downstream.

Breaching of moraines can be triggered by avalanches, earthquakes or a natural collapse of moraines due to excessive pressure from water. Also contributing to GLOFs are anthropogenic (human-induced) activities such as deforestation and pollution, which change local climate. Pollution exacerbates the potential for disasters through the release of black soot particles, which can settle on ice, absorbing more heat and accelerating melting.

Fragmentation of glacial ice can also trigger a breach in terminal moraines or dam boundaries, either through direct impact or by displacement waves, which compromise the stability of the dam. This is what was originally suspected to have occurred in Chamoli.

It is as yet unclear what triggered the original landslide that led to this week’s disaster. Newer satellite imagery, survey data, and further investigations are expected to reveal more information over the next few days.

The Home Minister further informed that the Uttarakhand government has said that the floods no longer pose a threat to the low-lying areas and the water level is receding.

After his address, members of Rajya Sabha observed a moment of silence to pay tribute to the victims of the incident.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Tuesday conducted an aerial survey of areas affected due to the glacier burst and visited the ITBP hospital in Joshimath, Chamoli where injured people have been admitted.

The death toll in the incident has mounted to 28, the Chief Minister told ANI on Tuesday.

53,53,FL-2021-000021-IND,Uttarakhand glacier burst: Five reasons that triggered the tragedy - Zee News,https://zeenews.india.com/india/uttarakhand-glacier-burst-five-reasons-that-triggered-the-tragedy-2340454.html,"The rescue operations for the tragic glacier burst which killed 11 and triggered massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda Rivers causing grave damage to houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project is still underway. Reportedly, over 203 people went missing after the tragedy.

As per the latest reports, the rescue teams have been conducting non-stop operations and have rescued 15 people from the first tunnel using heavy machinery, near Tapovan in Chamoli, whereas rescue operations for the second tunnel is still going on.

While talking to Zee News, environmentalist Anil Joshi and Anand Arya explained what could possibly be the five reasons for this tragic disaster.

Eco-sensitiveness: The authorities have been executing numerous projects one after the other without properly assessing the impact on the Himalayan range.

“Any area has an eco-sensitiveness and we are exploiting its limit. This disaster was a triggered one. I believe that the current government hasn’t been showing enough sensitivity towards nature. The environmentalists, who have been voicing their concerns to the government against such large projects, have never been taken seriously,” Anand Arya, environmentalist.

Environmental assessment: Another reason behind such tragedy is not following environmental assessment properly. Environmentalist Anil Joshi raised an important question, Till when is our country going to rely upon such large dams to fulfill the upcoming needs.

There are other means to live as well but we are not properly assessing it, he stated. We are relying upon hydropower more than any other form of energy because of its cost efficiency and reliability. But we are missing out to evaluate the risk factor involved in the construction of dams this size, he added.

Critical Thinking: Environmentalist Anil Joshi pinpointed the gravest mistake of all. He pointed out that our authorities haven't been considering all the options before making a decision on such big projects.

He went on to explain that countries like Switzerland have been making smaller dams along with the natural grid which is much safer in approach. Moreover, creating smaller dams can generate more employment in the country as well.

Change in law: The authorities changed the existing law and divided it into numerous subparts, resulting in exploitation. The new law requires an environmental assessment of only projects which are larger than 100 km.

Many have been exploiting this loophole by constructing projects which are under 99 km. One needs to understand that the impact will be as grave as the 100 km one, explained Anand Arya.

Lesson from previous mistakes: This incident was similar to the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy. Even after the 2013 tragedy took such a huge toll on people’s lives, the authorities failed to look into the steadiness of the other dams. The glacier was a result of late snowfall in February and didn’t get enough time to freeze. So one can say another reason behind the tragedy was that the dam was too close to the glacier area, explained Anil Joshi.

“You disrespected nature and it had repercussions. Ecology and economy go hand in hand. We need to understand that,” said Anil Joshi.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lives due to the glacial burst. Additionally, the PMO has announced Rs 50,000 to those seriously injured.

54,54,FL-2021-000021-IND,Rescuers search for 171 missing people after Indian glacier causes devastating flood - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/rescuers-search-for-missing-dead-glacier-dam-india-north,"Twenty six bodies have been recovered in the Indian Himalayas and scores more people are still missing after a second day of rescue efforts after a glacier break that caused an avalanche of water and debris to engulf a river valley and demolish two dams.

A surge of water, thought to be triggered when a glacier broke off from Nanda Devi mountain in the state of Uttarakhand, left a trail of devastation when it hit on Sunday morning.

Authorities have said 171 people are still missing.

The force of the fast-moving flood waters obliterated two hydropower dams located along the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers, where hundreds of personnel had been working. Several bridges, roads, homes and hundreds of grazing sheep, cattle and goats were also swept away in the deluge and two other hydropower projects were damaged.

Hundreds of troops, paramilitary and rescue operatives were brought to Chamoli district to recover bodies from the muddy aftermath. Much of Monday’s rescue operation focused on a 1.5-mile (2.4km) tunnel beneath the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower dam, which suffered severe damage in the flash flood.

About 39 workers were believed to be trapped inside the 3-metre-high tunnel, which had become blocked with mud and rocks when the floods hit. Heavy machinery was brought in to try to dig out the entrance of the tunnel, working alongside rescuers digging manually with shovels. But as darkness fell, they had still not had any contact with those trapped in the runnel.

Vivek Pandey, spokesperson for the Indo-Tibetan border police, who are overseeing the rescue operation, said: “About 100 metres inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible, and it looks like about 100 metres of debris more will have to be cleared. This will take a few more hours.”

Earlier, 12 workers were rescued from a smaller tunnel beneath the Tapovan-Vishnugad dam. Lal Bahadur, one of the dam workers who was left trapped in the tunnel for almost eight hours, described the scenes when the flood water hit: “We heard people screaming at us to come out of the tunnel but before we could react, a sudden gush of water and heavy silt swamped upon us,” he said.

At least nine villages in the impacted Chamoli valley were cut off after several bridges were destroyed and supplies had to be dropped from the air.

Scientists and researchers were also airlifted to the site to determine the exact cause of the flash flood. LK Sinha of the Defence Research and Development Organisation told Indian media his team had done an aerial survey of the mountain area where the incident took place.

He said: “Prima facie it looks that a hanging glacier broke away from the main glacier and came down in the narrow valley. In the valley it formed a lake which burst later and caused the damage.”

Scientists said it was highly unusual for a glacier to break off during the winter months. But experts had previously said glacial melting because of global heating was expected to become a huge problem for the region in the next few years. A survey from 2019 found that glaciers in the Himalayas have been melting at double the speed since 2000, losing nearly a vertical 50cm of ice each year.

Dr AP Dimri, a professor at the School of Environmental Science at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said: “The Himalayas are a water tower. With increasing global warming, the upper reaches of the Himalayas are warming faster, leading to more rapid melting of the glaciers.”

On Monday, RK Singh, the minister for power and renewable energy, said a remote warning system would be set up to monitor glaciers in the region.

Activists and locals said the incident also demonstrated the risk being taken when building huge dam projects in the increasingly ecologically fragile Himalayan region. The state government is involved in a mammoth development push along Uttarakhand’s rivers to met the growing demand for hydropower in India, and there are more than 500 hydropower projects in the state.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party, was among those who said they had warned against the building of dams in this area.

Manju Menon, senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research, said: “One of the most unfortunate outcomes of the climate policy discourses globally has been a reacceptance of large dams by governments as a viable non-fossil fuel source of energy.”

She added.“This reacceptance is ironic because climate change has also made hydrological flows in the Himalayas erratic and unpredictable, in terms of the impacts on glaciers and monsoon patterns. Therefore, planning and implementing large engineering projects on himalayan rivers is fraught with great risks. Most scholars of Himalayan rivers have been warning about these risks for decades.”","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc09d022cbae8dc1a879c77c78dc8df510e11a44/0_458_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f90172545db94c04c872b048aecf1a90,"['causes', 'glacier', 'flood', 'rescuers', 'devastating', 'himalayas', 'water', 'indian', 'missing', 'dam', '171', 'rivers', 'search', 'hydropower', 'projects', 'tunnel', 'rescue', 'valley']", ,,flood

The staggering collapse of part of a glacier in Uttarakhand’s Nanda Devi mountain and the ensuing floods that have claimed many lives come as a deadly reminder that this fragile, geologically dynamic region can never be taken for granted. A significant slice of the glacier, dislodged by a landslide, according to some satellite images, produced roaring torrents in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers in Chamoli district, trapping unsuspecting workers at two hydro power project sites. Scores of people are still missing in the wave of water, silt and debris that swamped the rivers and filled tunnels in the Tapovan power project, although the immediate rescue of nearly 15 people by the ITBP, the Army and other agencies brings some cheer. The rescuers face a challenging environment as they try to locate more survivors and bring relief supplies to paralysed communities. These immediate measures are important, along with speedy compensation to affected families. But the Centre and the Uttarakhand government cannot ignore the larger context of the State’s increasing frailty in the face of environmental shocks. Once the crucible of environmentalism, epitomised by Sunderlal Bahuguna, Gaura Devi and the Chipko movement, the State’s deep gorges and canyons have attracted many hydroelectric projects and dams, with little concern for earthquake risk. Red flags have been raised repeatedly, particularly after the moderate quake in 1991 in the region where the Tehri dam was built and the 2013 floods that devastated Kedarnath, pointing to the threat from seismicity, dam-induced microseismicity, landslides and floods from a variety of causes, including unstable glacial lakes and climate change.

India is heavily invested in dam development and growth of hydropower, largely in the Himalaya region — especially to cut carbon emissions. By one estimate, if the national plan to construct dams in 28 river valleys in the hills is realised in a few decades, the Indian Himalayas will have one dam for every 32 km, among the world’s highest densities. Yet, as researchers say, this may be a miscalculation for reasons, including potential earthquake impacts, monsoonal aberrations that could repeat a Kedarnath-like flood, severe biodiversity loss and, importantly, extreme danger to communities downstream. There is also some evidence that the life of dams is often exaggerated, and siltation, which reduces it, is grossly underestimated: in the Bhakra dam in Himachal Pradesh, for instance, siltation was higher by 140% than calculated. The need is to rigorously study the impact of policy on the Himalayas and confine hydro projects to those with the least impact, while relying more on low impact run-of-the-river power projects that need no destructive large dams and reservoirs. Unlike what the NITI Aayog seems to think of environmental accounting, this would be a sound approach.","Tue, 09 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['glacier', 'impact', 'himalayas', 'disaster', 'mountains', 'troubled', 'region', 'dam', 'projects', 'dams', 'power', 'floods', 'uttarakhand']", ,,flood

The glacial burst of Raini village of Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on the morning of February 7 has resulted in massive flash flooding. According to reports, 32 bodies have so far been recovered and 206 people are still missing after the natural disaster. Rescue operations by the Indo Tibetan Border Police, Indian Army and NDRF are still on.



The caption of the viral post on Facebook shared by The Northeast Journal reads, ""Pray For Uttarakhand #UttrakhandDisaster #glacier #GlacierBurst"".

Fact Check

BOOM ran a reverse image search on the photograph and found the same image in the gallery of government website, National Science Foundation. The caption states that the image shows a melting glacier in Alaska, Mendenhall Glacier. It further states, ""This photo shows new forests above the shrinking Mendenhall Glacier. It's rare to see a developing forest above a glacier. This picture highlights how these landscapes are rapidly changing.""





Further, we found a blog by Live Science from March 5, 2010 which carried the same image claiming that it is a glacier stream in Alaska. This suggests that the image was clicked more than 10 years ago. BOOM could not independently verify the image, but was able to ascertain that it is not from the recent glacial burst in Uttarakhand.

According to a journal by a blog Adventure Journal, Alaskan glaciers in total lose ice at a rate of around 75 billion metric tons each year - states a 2015 study by the US Geological Survey and University of Alaska, Fairbanks. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), in 2016 summer, glaciers were melting 70 percent faster than the typical rate, due to warming temperatures.

58,58,FL-2021-000021-IND,Second warning: U'khand glacier burst - Telegraph India,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/second-warning-uttarakhand-glacier-burst/cid/1806318,"The full extent of the damage in Uttarakhand — flash floods washed away at least two hydroelectric power projects and killed many people — is yet to be ascertained. But the losses are expected to be extensive. The disaster has been attributed to several causes, including a landslide and a glacial lake burst. However, there is likely to be a general consensus regarding the role of climate change as a catalyst in an ecologically fragile zone. The latest assessment of the United Nations’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that glacier retreat and the thawing of permafrost are projected to decrease the stability of mountain slopes; the Global Climate Risk Index 2020 also found India to be the fifth most vulnerable country to the effects of climate change out of 181 nations.

But natural disasters are often the result of a complex amalgamation of factors. It would, therefore, be foolhardy to view climate change as the sole contributor to the tragedy in Chamoli which, ironically, was the seat of the Chipko movement. This destruction comes less than a decade after the Kedarnath flash flood of 2013, which claimed more than 5,000 lives. Where these two events intersect could well be unregulated construction, myopic promotion of tourism and intensive mining. Successive state governments have displayed a flagrant disregard for the delicate ecosystems of the Himalayas in their bid to sustain a lucrative, but ecologically damaging, tourism industry. In spite of the terrain being difficult and inaccessible, tourism figures neared 25 million in 2015 and are expected to touch 67 million by 2025. What has aggravated the threat is a faulty template of development. In 2015, a report by the environment ministry had unambiguously linked power projects to the 2013 deluge. The urgent need to rethink the current development model for the Himalayan region cannot be overstated. This should involve a serious scrutiny of such activities as the damming of Himalayan rivers, construction of hydel projects and other investments in infrastructure. But can this kind of contemplation be expected from elected governments whose disregard for the environment — reflected in industrial depredations on ecologically sensitive zones, the watering down of protective regulations and the pursuit of an anti-ecological model of progress — is well known? Not unless the environment and its destruction become electoral issues.","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2021/Feb/1612988086_2021_2img07_feb_2021_pti02_07_2021_000196b.jpg,"['tourism', 'glacier', 'change', 'second', 'model', 'warning', 'projects', 'expected', 'climate', 'power', 'burst', 'million', 'ecologically', 'uttarakhand', 'environment']", ,,Main responsibilities:

NEW DELHI - Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh Sunday issued directions asking all districts along the banks of the River Ganga in the state to be on a high alert.

The directions were issued hours after a glacier crashed into a dam and triggered a huge flood in the neighboring Uttarakhand state.

Around 150 people have been reported missing in the tragedy and 10 bodies have been recovered from the areas affected by the glacier burst.

""Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has instructed the concerned departments, officers and State Disaster Response Force to be on high alert in view of the circumstances arising out of the breach of the dam in Uttarakhand,"" a government spokesman said. ""The chief minister has also instructed the district collectors and superintendents of police of all the districts situated on the banks of the Ganges to remain vigilant.""

The disaster reportedly struck at around 10:00 hours (Indian Standard Time) on Sunday and gravely affected two power projects where around 120 workers were on duty.

Around 20 workers are still stuck inside a tunnel in one of the two power projects, and efforts are being made to rescue them, local media reports quoted a security officer as saying.

Earlier, Uttarakhand Chief Secretary Om Prakash had confirmed that around 150 people had gone missing as they were feared to have been swept away in flash floods following the glacier burst.

Most of the people missing are said to be laborers working at the Rishiganga power project in the state and local residents.

President of India Ram Nath Kovind expressed his worries at the glacier burst and prayed for the well-being and safety of the people.

Meanwhile, Rescue operation is underway. The Indian Navy and the Indian Army have been put on alert for carrying out the relief and rescue work in the affected areas.

The Director-General of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) S.N. Pradhan said that four rescue and relief teams of the NDRF are being flown to the area from Delhi.

""The teams will first land in Uttarakhand capital Dehradun, from where they will be further airlifted to the affected areas,"" he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also personally monitoring the situation. ""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone's safety there. Have been continuously speaking to senior authorities and getting updates on NDRF deployment, rescue work and relief operations,"" Modi tweeted.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202102/07/601fd7aaa31024adbdb36a6c.jpeg,"['glacier', 'crashes', 'state', 'ndrf', 'relief', 'uttarakhand', 'issued', 'dam', 'indian', 'pradesh', 'indias', 'power', 'missing', 'alert', 'high', 'uttar', 'rescue', 'affected']", ,,flood

Sunday’s landslide washed away a concrete bridge connecting the two villages, snapping road connectivity and forcing the government to press helicopters into service to deliver food supplies.

“This is Raini Chak Subhai and across the river is Raini Chak Lata,” Chander Singh, a local resident, told DH.

Besides the concrete bridge, four cable-stayed bridges – a common feature in these mountain ranges – were also damaged.

A Chinese expert refutes as nonsense suspicions implying that the glacial lake burst in India could be the result of remotely controlled explosions conducted by China. He argued that the main reason for such glacier break is that the Indian military construction has damaged the ecological environment in the region.Around 125 people were missing in northern India after a Himalayan glacier broke and swept away a small hydroelectric dam on February 7, according to Reuters.The devastating flood had left at least 32 people dead, according to ABC News.Such flash floods are not uncommon in the Himalayan region.

Without really naming China, it implied that ""glacial lakes can be breached through remote-controlled explosions, with an aim to hit India's infrastructure in the border areas.""""The glacier breaks in India last week could not have been caused by China sabotaging nearby infrastructure. Instead, the Indian military has built several military installations in the area, which has exacerbated the melting of the glacier,"" noted Hu, ""In contrast, before the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, China had carried out many permafrost tests and obtained a large number of first-hand data, which ensured the ecological safety along the railway.""""Indian government never reflects on its own destructive actions whenever there is a problem.

There is light at the end of the tunnel-- Vinod Singh and his 11 colleagues lived this reality on Sunday.

Singh (33), a welder, was the first one to be rescued from one of the two blocked tunnels. A video where he is seen wriggling out of the tunnel, overwhelmed, chanting slogans in ode to the famous Badrinath temple, has since gone viral. The video was shot by the ITBP (Indo Tibetan Border Police).

Mr. Singh, a resident of Joshimath recalled the seven gruelling hours he spent in the tunnel with his colleagues, till they were rescued by a team of ITBP personnel.

“The tunnel that is four-metre high was covered in a mix of debris and water for up to three metres. We managed to catch hold of the iron railing above and clung to it for our lives, we were exhausted. Sometimes we changed hands or tried to catch hold of the tunnel’s wall to remain alive,” he said on phone from the ITBP’s hospital in Joshimath.

Faint network on phone

Mr. Singh said it was a faint network on his phone that saved them.

“We managed to drag ourselves up to 350 metres to the end of the tunnel, where we saw some light. We decided to stay put there as we could get oxygen through that small hole. I noticed that my BSNL phone had network. I first called my office manager and then my brother. I told my brother to stay calm and send help,” he said.

An ITBP team, deployed 15 km away was rushed to the tunnel and they began the excavation work around 10.30 am. The tunnel was used to dispose waste water from the power project.

“It was a battle for life, the tunnel was full of wet debris and we could not possibly step down. We were cold and our clothes were soiled. There was no option before us but to hang on. The patience finally paid off. I was the first one to be rescued around 6 p.m.,” he said, adding that he had been working at the project for the past one and a half years. His joint family comprises his wife, son, mother and brother’s family.

He said there were no warning signs. “Suddenly there was a strange sound and slush started filling the tunnel….soon there was complete darkness. We got no time to react,” he recalled.

A whistle turned into a roar of water that trapped a dozen men in a Himalayan tunnel after a glacier burst in northern India but Rajesh Kumar lived to tell the tale.

Twenty-six people were confirmed dead but at least 170 others remained missing on Monday after the glacier broke off a mountainside, triggering a flash flood through a valley in Uttarakhand state.

On Sunday, floodwaters swamped a nearby hydroelectric power complex where Kumar and his colleagues were working 300 metres (nearly 1,000 feet) inside a tunnel.

Locals look on the damaged Dhauliganga hydropower project at Reni village in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India [Rajat Gupta/EPA] “We didn’t think we were going to make it,” the 28-year-old told the AFP news agency from his hospital bed.

“Suddenly there was a sound of whistling … there was shouting, people were telling us to come out. We thought it was a fire. We started running but the water gushed in. It was like a Hollywood movie.”

The men clung to scaffolding rods in the tunnel for four hours, keeping their heads above water and debris, trying to reassure each other.

“We just kept telling each other – come what may, we must not let go of the rods. Thank god our hands did not lose their grip,” said Kumar.

As the flood coursed down the valley, the water started to recede in the tunnel, leaving it filled with more than 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) of debris and mud.

“We climbed across the rock debris and forced our way to the mouth of the tunnel,” said Kumar.

There they found a small opening but they were not sure where it led.

“All we knew was that we could feel some air.”

Eventually, they saw some light coming through and one of the men got a phone signal and called for help.

There were emotional scenes as Kumar and his colleagues were pulled out of a tiny hole at the surface.

Some punched the air in joy as they saw daylight, some were put straight onto stretchers and carried away. One man put his arms in the air and then fell face-first into the mud.

Despite their hours-long ordeal, they miraculously managed to escape with just minor injuries.

Indian rescue team members carry a body recovered near Reni village in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, India [Rajat Gupta/EPA] Shopkeeper Ramesh Negi from Raini village was basking in the Sunday morning sun at his home overlooking the plant when he heard a loud roar and saw a huge wall of water smash into and sweep away a bridge that led to the Chinese border.

Dozens of workers building a concrete dam on the Dhouli Ganga river bed and shepherds leading their cattle along the mountain slopes disappeared beneath the sudden deluge, leaving behind a wasteland of grey and brown sludge.

“There was dust and screams all over,” the 36-year-old Negi told AFP.

“We tried to alert the grazers but they were blown away by the wind pressure before being consumed by the water and slush. We can only guess what happened.”

Mangra, another tunnel survivor, still cannot sleep.

On Sunday, he heard a loud, rumbling sound and the screams of other colleagues: “Run, run, run!”

The 28-year-old from Lakhimpur Kheri in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state scrambled out of the tunnel.

But six of his friends and neighbours from his village remain trapped, and Mangra cannot stop thinking and praying for them.

“The moment the water came close, it felt like the mountain was crashing and the earth was moving,” Mangra, who goes by one name, told AFP outside the tunnel, cuts and scrapes on his hands and legs.

“Once the deluge of water rushed past me, there was dust and fear left behind.”

The glacier broke away as the power complex was in full operation, leaving dozens of workers at two power plants missing. About three dozen were feared trapped in the U-shaped tunnel.

The footage shows a huge chunk of snow sliding down a mountain and falling into the river.

A glacier burst in Raini village of Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on the morning of February 7, resulted in flash flooding and put in danger lives of people living along the banks of river Dhauliganga. According to reports 171 people have been missing since the flash floods occurred and 26 have been declared dead so far in the glacier burst.

The viral video is being circulated with the caption, ""First video of glacier breaking in Chamoli, Uttarakhand this morning"" (Original text: ''आज सुबह उत्तराखंड के चमोली में ग्लेशियर टूटने का पहला वीडियो 7 feb 2021'')

BOOM broke the video into its key frames and ran a reverse image search on a few frames, and found a French website carrying the same video stating that the avalanche occurred in Nepal. The article published on January 17, 2021, included an Instagram video posted by an user called @naren32 who has uploaded the same video of snow sliding down a steep gorge.

We searched for the video on the Instagram profile of naren32 and found a number of videos uploaded in January from the incident- one shorter video of the Nepal avalanche and a longer footage of the same. The caption of the video says, ""Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake. Here comes full video of huge avalanche, had to spend overnight at Kapuche lake (Lowest altitude glacier lake in the world) in order to catch this moment and it eventually paid off"".

The same user had also uploaded the footage video on his Youtube Channel, Naren32 Rana on January 11, 2021 with the title ''Huge Avalanche at Kapuche Lake ( Lowest Altitude Glacier Lake In Nepal)''.

BOOM further found news reports on the Nepal avalanche incident and could ascertain that the video is from Kapuche Glacier Lake in Parche in Nepal.

The Weather Channel also reported on the incident. The report stated that there were no casualties but kayakers had to wrap up their activity because of the approaching avalanche.

Joshimath, Uttarakhand – Anger is growing among the families of 39 workers trapped in a tunnel after a deadly flash flood caused by the bursting of a Himalayan glacier destroyed two hydropower projects on Sunday.

Four days after tonnes of rocks and slush blocked the under construction tunnel at Tapovan Dam in Uttarakhand state, desperate families on Wednesday jostled with people in the village, expressing their anger with the administration over the handling of the rescue operation.

Swati Bhadouriya, the district magistrate of Chamoli, some 278km (173 miles) east of the main city of Dehradun, told Al Jazeera that one body was found on Wednesday morning, taking the death toll in the tragedy to 32 while over 170 people are missing.

Members of India’s National Disaster Response Force near Tapovan tunnel [Bilal Kuchay/Al Jazeera] The families of those missing allege not enough is being done by the authorities and time was running out for their loved ones trapped inside the 2-km (1.24-mile) tunnel. Officials said they have not been able to go beyond 120 metres.

But the workers’ families said the rescue team, which includes hundreds of paramilitary personnel and members of National Disaster Response Force, were taking “too much time” to clear the debris and have been giving “conflicting reports in the media” about the rescue mission.

“If anyone in the administration in the true sense believes the workers inside the tunnel are alive, then this operation shouldn’t take such a long time,” said Abdul Wajid, 30, from Saharanpur district of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state.

Wajid’s younger brother, Sadiq – a father of three – along with four others from the district had started working at the Tapovan tunnel last week.

They were supposed to finish their work by Sunday evening and return to their hometown on Monday, said Wajid, adding that destiny had something else in store for them.

Babu Ram’s brother Pramod Sen was also working inside the tunnel on Sunday.

“Four days have passed since the tunnel was blocked by the slush and still the rescue teams have not been able to find the people trapped inside,” he told Al Jazeera.

“We have lost every hope now. We don’t think our loved ones are still alive. We just want the administration to return the bodies of our loved ones safely.”

Piyoosh Rautela, a senior disaster relief official, told Al Jazeera they are working round-the-clock to find the workers and that the rescue operation was taking long because they cannot send too many machines inside.

“It was a tunnel and people were working inside. Debris came and choked the tunnel. We don’t know how far the debris has gone,” he said.

Rautela said he understood the agony of the families but they were “not aware of the practical realities which people face in the Himalayas”.

“These are fast flowing torrents. A person who is washed away in this may or may not be traced,” he said.

“Three days are not a long time, people do survive longer periods trapped at various places. There have been instances. We are hopeful that we will find them.”","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Rescuers-at-the-Tapovan-tunnel.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,"['working', 'glacier', 'workers', 'fades', 'india', 'told', 'tragedy', 'trapped', 'taking', 'hope', 'tunnel', 'angry', 'families', 'rescue', 'tapovan', 'inside']", ,,flood

The eighth battalion is based at Govindpuram in Ghaziabad and more teams have been asked to remain on standby.

A major relief and rescue effort is on in Chamoli where a massive flood was triggered in the river Dhauliganga after a glacial burst on Sunday morning. NDRF officials from the eighth battalion said that one of their teams, comprising 40 to 45 members and dog squad, was rushed initially from their regional response centre in Dehradun while the second team departed on Sunday afternoon from Ghaziabad.

“This team was sent by road while three teams were airlifted from the Hindon airbase. In all, five teams were pressed into service and more teams including from the other NDRF battalions have been asked to remain on standby,” said PK Tiwary, commandant of the eighth battalion.

The teams of NDRF are equipped with sophisticated equipment and dog squads which help in search and rescue.

“The teams are equipped with about 310 sophisticated equipment which are used during floods, building collapse and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear emergencies. Since it is a case of flash flood, we will also be using our team of divers and equipment like sonars and boats for detection and rescue. Our teams have also taken relief material for people affected by the incident,” Tiwary added.

The eighth battalion and other NDRF battalions were also a part of search and rescue operations during the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand.

Sunday’s flash flood has endangered the lives of thousands of people living along the riverbanks. There are fears of massive destruction. An alert has also been sounded by authorities in Uttarakhand in several districts including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Haridwar and Dehradun.

Teams of the Indo Tibetan Border Police were also rushed to the site near the Raini village.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath tweeted that the UP government is standing with the Uttarakhand government for any help or assistance.

“The situation of water level in areas along the river Ganga is being constantly monitored in the state. In case there is a rise in water levels, people near the banks will be shifted elsewhere as the situation demands. Directions have been issued for relief and rescue,” the chief minister’s office said in a tweet.

The UP police also tweeted, “We are in touch with our counterparts. Border distts. of Uttarakhand have been alerted. NDRF, SDRF & flood company of PAC have been instructed to be on highest alert. Evacuation of people shall be done wherever required.”

At first, it looked like a gigantic shadow in the sky. Before Bhawan Rana, the village head of Raini village in the northern Indian hill state of Uttarakhand, could understand what was happening, he saw heaps of dirt rolling down the hills.

“That was when I realised what had happened, and sounded an alert for evacuation,” Rana told VICE World News, recounting how he witnessed the Himalayan glacier burst on Sunday.

A chunk of the Himalayan Nanda Devi glacier broke off, triggering an avalanche and flash floods that destroyed two hydropower plants. At least 28 people have died and more than 200 are missing.

Rana and his family live in a village about 50 meters away from one of the projects. He is part of an indigenous community that had sounded an alarm over the project in 2019 by filing a public interest litigation. Their petition, a copy of which has been shared with VICE World News, highlighted the possible damage to the ecologically sensitive Nanda Devi biosphere park, and the potential impact the plant’s blasting and stone crushing activities would have on the environment.

“Our biggest fear came true,” said Rana. Many members of his community have retreated into the nearby forest, fearing the flood situation getting worse.

“Officials running the hydropower plant cut vast areas of trees and would dump the run-off mud into the river, instead of disposing it upstream as per environmental norms,” Sangram Singh, a contract worker from the community who was one of the petitioners, told VICE World News. Singh said locals were most worried about landslides and flash floods, following the 2013 Kedarnath disaster in the same area that killed 169 people. Roughly 4,000 are still missing and are presumed dead.

The court had asked local authorities to respond to the allegations raised in the litigation and investigate the effects of stone crushing activity on the environment, ultimately banning the use of explosives in the area.

“But despite our protests and alarms, they did not pay heed to us and allowed the company to operate,” said Singh, adding that blasting activities at the hydropower plant could have over time contributed to the melting glacier. Singh also speculated the presence of a radioactive weapon near the glacier that may have caused it to burst.

In July, 52 environmental organisations and activists across 12 Himalayan states of India, drafted a letter to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, highlighting how regulatory decisions and industrial projects could cause ecological damage in the world’s youngest mountain range. “The government has classified the Himalayan region under the climate vulnerability index. It means that any project in the region would exacerbate landslides, groundwater drying up, and glaciers melting,” Manshi Asher, an activist from Himdhara Environmental Research and Action Collective, and one of the 52 signatories to the letter, told VICE World News in September.

Meanwhile, experts speculate that the glacial burst is an effect of climate change. “We identified 26 lakes which had the potential to form flash floods in a 2019 study,” Anil Kulkarni, a glaciologist and professor from the Indian Institute of Science, told VICE World News. “When we ran our model on the Nanda Devi glacier following the disaster, we realised that a huge depression had formed near the glacier’s terminus (the point where it ends). Under appropriate pressure, this huge lake could have broken out and caused the massive floods.”

For communities from the Raini village, the only way forward from the destruction they have witnessed is through financial compensation and responsible development of the region that follows environmental norms. “We saw the apathy of nature, and lost many members of our community in the process,” said Singh. “We can’t let this happen again.”","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://video-images.vice.com/articles/60236a08d4a8ae0095a329fd/lede/1612938633061-uttarakhand-glacier-melt.jpeg?image-resize-opts=Y3JvcD0xeHc6MC44NDI1eGg7MHh3LDAuMTE1MXhoJnJlc2l6ZT0xMjAwOiomcmVzaXplPTEyMDA6Kg,"['raised', 'glacier', 'vice', 'near', 'village', 'himalayan', 'told', 'world', 'deadly', 'flash', 'following', 'burst', 'singh', 'ago', 'alarm', 'locals']", ,,flood

The satellite images indicate the block on the Rishi Ganga that is fed by the fast-flowing Ronti River. The Rishi Ganga subsequently flows in the direction of the Tapovan Hydel power plant, which was severely damaged by the flash flood and debris from the avalanche on February 7.

A part of a glacier broke off and crashed into the river, picking up boulders, debris and massive amounts of silt as it slid down the Rishi Ganga river sweeping away two hydel plants along its path.

A close-up from Wednesday shows the extent of the water build-up and the wall of debris. The worry is that the weight of the water can pierce the wall, which could lead to another flood.

""We have measured the width and the length of the lake, the wall of debris. That's all coming through, the parameters on which we can act,"" the NDRF chief said.

A Garhwal University Professor, YP Sundrial, who went to the spot to assess the aftermath of the disaster, said the lake formation was worrying.

""Right now I am standing at the confluence of the northeast stream and the Rishganga river. The flood started from the northeast stream. The landslide caused temporary damming and blocked the Rishganga river,"" Professor Sundrial said.

The lake can be breached anytime and can cause more floods, said the expert.

Several people are feared dead in the glacier burst.

An official release issued by the state information department stated, “Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had telephoned Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat and requested him to ensure immediate help and rescue of pilgrims from Gujarat stranded after the natural calamity.”

Rupani has also instructed state Chief Secretary Anil Mukim to coordinate with the Uttarakhand administration and initiate immediate action.

Gujarat Relief Commissioner Harshad Patel told The Indian Express that he has spoken with the local administration in Uttarakhand and sought details of residents from Gujarat who might be trapped there. Till late evening, there was no information with the state relief department of any person required to be rescued or reported missing.

“I have sought information from local administration but been communicated that it is the locals who are mostly affected due to the damage to the dams, tourist areas are not affected. There is no information of any resident from Gujarat who is trapped there yet,” Patel said.

Ahmedabad Additional Collector Harshad Vora in a tweet Sunday sought people to provide information on stranded pilgrims or tourists from Gujarat to the control room of the district disaster management department.

A pilgrim from Rajkot, Krishnaben Pancholi, told a Gujarati news channel over phone that a group of 50 pilgrims from the state was instructed to return to Dehradun from Haridwar, while they were on the way towards Tapovan in Uttarakhand when the calamity struck.

“We are safe. We were going towards Srinagar and Tapowan when we received instruction from the authorities that we should go back towards Dehradun, where we are headed, leaving some of our baggage in Haridwar. There is a high alert in Haridwar and Rishikesh,” she said.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Indian rescuers searched on Monday for more than 200 people missing after part of a remote Himalayan glacier broke away, sweeping away bridges, breaking dams and sending a torrent of water, rocks and construction debris down a mountain valley.

Sunday's disaster below Nanda Devi, India's second-highest peak, swept away the small Rishiganga hydro-electric project and damaged a bigger one further down the Dhauliganga river being built by state firm NTPC.

Eighteen bodies had been recovered so far, officials said.

Most of the missing were people working on the two projects, part of the many the government has been building deep in the mountains of Uttarakhand state as part of a development push.

""As of now, around 203 people are missing,"" state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said.

Mohd Farooq Azam, assistant professor, glaciology & hydrology at the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore, said a hanging glacier fractured.

""Our current hypothesis is that the water accumulated and locked in the debris-snow below the glacier was released when the glacier-rock mass fell,"" he said.

Videos on social media showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment and bringing down small bridges.

""Everything was swept away, people, cattle and trees,"" Sangram Singh Rawat, a former village council member of Raini, the site closest to the Rishiganga project, told media.

Experts said it had snowed heavily last week in the Nanda Devi area and it was possible that some of the snow had started melting and may have led to an avalanche.

Rescue squads were focused on drilling their way through a 2.5 km (1.5 miles) long tunnel at the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project site that NTPC was building 5 km (3 miles) downstream where about 30 workers were believed trapped.

""We are trying to break open the tunnel, it's a long one, about 2.5 km,"" said Ashok Kumar, the state police chief. He said rescuers had gone 150 metres (yards) into the tunnel but debris and slush were slowing progress.

Story continues

There had been no voice contact yet with anyone in the tunnel, another official said. Heavy equipment has been employed and a dog squad flown to the site.

On Sunday, 12 people were rescued from another much smaller tunnel.

Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides and the disaster prompted calls by environmentalists for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains. In June 2013, record monsoon rains there caused devastating floods that killed nearly 6,000 people.

Environmental groups have blamed construction activity in the mountains.

Himanshu Thakkar, co-ordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People, said that there were clear government recommendations against the use of explosives for construction purposes. ""There have been violations.""

The disaster also raises questions about the strength of the dams.

""The dams are supposed to withstand much greater force. This was not a monsoon flood, it was much smaller.""

Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat left for the spot to monitor the situation. Two dams including the under-construction Rishiganga and another named Dhauliganga have been damaged in the disaster.

(AP)

LUCKNOW: The glacier burst in Reni village of Chamoli in Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand on Sunday is unlikely to have any adverse impact on river water levels in Uttar Pradesh.

According to experts from the Geological Survey of India, Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences and other scientific institutes in the city, the effect of the outbreak will fizzle out by the time it reaches the plains, therefore, water levels of river Ganga in Allahabad, Varanasi, Kanpur and other UP cities are not expected to go above danger mark.

Glaciologist and former deputy director general & head of northern region, Geological Survey of India, Siddharth Swaroop said, “Prima facie, it appears that the glacier burst in Rishi Ganga catchment eventually resulted in reservoir collapse and consequential flash floods.”

He said Rishi Ganga was a tributary of river Dhauliganga, which has its confluence with river Alaknanda, near Joshimath.

“Downstream of its confluence with Bhagirathi river at Devprayag, it is called Ganga which flows through major UP cities like Kanpur, Allahabad and Varanasi. Check on the flow of Bhagirathi river and other adequate measures undertaken by SDRF and NDRF teams, the river with reduced flow and velocity is not expected to rise above danger mark in UP,” he added.

Director (Glaciology division) of the Geological Survey of India, Rakesh Mishra, said the water flow would lose force by the time it reaches the plains.

As per the inventory prepared by GSI on glacial lakes in Uttarakhand, at least 71 lakes of different size and types are there in the upper reaches of Rishiganga and Dhauliganga valley. GSI needs to find out the focal point of the flash flood, Mishra added.

“It is not clear if the flood is a typical Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) or some temporary damming due to a landslide and avalanche that might have blocked the mainstream to form a temporary lake which bursted. Once the water level recedes, a team of experts will assess the damage as well as the factor that triggered the disaster,” he said.

Former scientist at Remote Sensing Application Centre (RSAC), AK Tangri, who has been carrying out research in the field for last three decades, said: “The impact is likely to be observed in upper reaches and may even increase the water level to some extent at Rishikesh and Haridwar but would not leave much impact in Uttar Pradesh.”

Similar views were expressed by glacier expert and senior scientists at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleosciences, Anupam Sharma.

“The Ganga meanders as it enters the plains due to which the velocity of water goes down. Since there is no rain, there is no likelihood of any adverse impact in the state,” environmentalist Venkatesh Dutta said.

(Photo: PTI)

Indian Army's access to the contested Barahoti area at the Line of Actual Control in Uttarakhand has not been restricted even though some roads and bridges have been washed away in the recent floods.

An alternate route to the borders that often see transgressions in the Barahoti area has ensured the forward locations are not cut off for the army, sources said.

Barahoti is part of the central sector and is considered a sensitive area.

The flood has ravaged parts of the Chamoli district and some bridges have been swept sway. ""The bridges and roads will be restored quickly but access to Barahoti from an alternate route is there,"" said an official.

Barahoti is an 80 sq km contested area along the Line of Actual Control with China in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand. It is about 400 km from the state capital of Dehradun and 100 km from Joshimath, the location of a brigade headquatres.

In 1958, India and China listed Barahoti as a disputed area where neither side would send their troops. In the 1962 war, the PLA did not enter the 'middle sector' including parts of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh and were active focused in the western (Ladakh) and eastern (Arunachal Pradesh) sectors.

Officials said military infrastructure and installations have not been damaged in the floods.

The last big incident of hostility in Barahoti took place in 2017 during the Doklam standoff when Chinese troops transgressed into Indian territory forcing Indian shepherds out leading to some tensions.

The Army with the Indo Tibetan Border Police has been in action carrying out relief work while divers from the Indian Navy have also been pressed into action.

Two columns from the Army comprising 400 troops from Joshimath and Auli were deployed and another 200 are on standby.

Army's Engineering Task Force and medical teams are also on ground have also been on the ground.

While the Army has deployed two Cheetah helicopters the Indian Air Force has been carrying out sorties in to assist in rescue and relief operations.

Two bridges at entrance of Malari valley near Tapovan have also been washed away but the main road between Joshimath to Tapovan is intact.

RAINI: It was a tranquil winter morning in Raini village until the residents were jolted at around 10 AM on Sunday by a loud sound and the sight of huge torrents of water and sludge in the Rishi Ganga river hurtling towards them.

""Before we could make out what was happening, the raging muddy waters of Rishi Ganga had devastated the landscape,"" says 50-year-old Dharam Singh, a resident of the village.

The scenes brought back to the people horrifying memories of the 2013 Kedarnath deluge that killed thousands.

Many were feared swept away in the sudden floods on Sunday including those who were working near the river.

The officials said that the first C-130J has landed at the Jolly Grant airport near Dehradun and the second one would be landing soon.

According to officials, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat is monitoring military efforts for rescue operations. An Air Commodore-rank officer has been deployed at Jolly Grant by the Air Force as Task Force commander to coordinate the aerial effort for rescue operations in view of the floods, they said.

The Central government today told the Supreme Court that there was no connection between the massive ongoing Char Dham road-widening project and the glacier burst earlier this month that resulted in the death of a number of people in Uttarakhand.

Attorney General KK Venugopal, representing the Defence Ministry, today sought time to respond to an allegation by the chief of an expert committee appointed by the court drawing a link between the two.

""We received a letter from the Chairman of the High-Powered Panel saying there is a link between the road widening and the Uttarakhand disaster. But according to us, Defence Ministry, there is no such connection. We want to reply to the allegations and need time,"" he said.

A bench of Justices Rohinton Fali Nariman, Hemant Gupta, and BR Gavai today granted two weeks to the government to come up with a response.

A glacier burst in the upper Himalayas on February 7 led to massive flash floods in the Alakananda-Dhauliganga river systems in Uttarakhand, leading to the deaths of over 50 people, with around 150 still missing. Environmentalists have sought to connect this with the massive developmental projects going on in the ecologically sensitive region over the past few years.

Ravi Chopra, one such expert, heads the Supreme Court-appointed panel that is monitoring the 900 kilometre Char Dham highway project that aims to connect four Hindu holy towns of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath in Uttarakhand. Besides being a pet project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Rs 12,000 crore mission is also deemed strategically important.

In a letter dated February 13, Mr Chopra wrote to the court saying that an earlier report submitted by him and two other members of the panel had strongly argued that disaster resilience was more critical than simply wide highways.

""Several chronic landslide-prone locations and stretches, where the slope stability is precarious, exist on the three Char Dham highways identified by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as defence feeder roads,"" he wrote. ""The recent disaster in the Rishi Ganga valley is located in the region north...highly prone to landslides, flash floods and earthquake. A section of the defence road to the Indo-China border and a bridge across the Rishiganga river on that road have been swept away, lending credence to our argument for disaster resilience in the region.""

He emphasised against ignoring and overriding ""the profound and irreversible ecological damage to the Himalayas"" that will impact generations to come.

Planned as a 10-metre wide highway project, the Supreme Court last year ordered that it can only be 5.5 metres wide.

The Defence Ministry, citing security concerns, then petitioned the court to allow the widening of the road to 10 metres. Of the 26 members of the court-appointed panel, 21 are in favour of widening, which, the proponents say, will help in the movement of the armed forces along the Indo-China border and will ensure better amenities for the locals.

Mr Chopra, chief of the panel, has himself been against the widening of the roads. The Centre, meanwhile, wants the court to accept the report submitted by the panel.","Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-02/6ncpo2v4_iaf-chamoli-joshimath-uttarakhand-glacier-break-disaster-ndrf_625x300_15_February_21.jpg,"['glacier', 'court', 'widening', 'defence', 'disaster', 'panel', 'link', 'tragedy', 'project', 'burst', 'char', 'ministry', 'road', 'dham', 'centre']", ,,flood

Scientists, conservationists lash out at government - The New Indian Express",https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/feb/07/avalanche-orglacial-lake-burst-in-chamoli-scientists-conservationists-lash-outatgovernment-2260907.html,"Vineet Upadhyay By

Express News Service

DEHRADUN: Scientists, experts, conservationists and activists have pointed out the lacklustre attitude of the governments when it comes to maintaining balance in development activities and environment.

Ajay Gautam, a Delhi-based activist who has filed range of public interest litigations in Uttarakhand high court requesting strengthening of disaster management systems said, ""I had filed one PIL in year 2014 requesting the honorable court to order installation of warning systems including alarm systems.

""The court had ordered the same in year 2018 but no compliance was done by the state government. This is apathy on the part of government which prefers concretization and deforestation of the hills which invites such disasters.""

Ravi Chopra, chairman of Supreme Court appointed high powered committee (HPC) on the 900 kms Char Dham Pariyojana, commenting on the issue, said, ""In the year 2014 we had submitted a report warning about hydropower projects at altitude of over 2000 meters voting various vulnerabilities which could result in a major disaster. Out of then proposed 24 hydropower projects, we recommended cancellation of 23. Altitude above 2000 meters is known as para glacial region where such heavy construction should be avoided.""

Views are still divided as to what caused this disaster. The experts have pinned down on two causes- an avalanche or a glacial lake burst.

""An avalanche is a volume starts moving from high altitude and gathers momentum destroying everything in its path. While glacial lake burst is a result of rainfall and snow when it collapses breaking down everything in its path. If it's glacial lake burst then it is a big failure for our remote sensing agencies,"" said Chopra.

The experts also added that the cause of the disaster needs to be investigated but mostly such occurrences are a result of lake formation.

D P Dobhal, former glaciologist at Dehradun's Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, ""Lake formation must have happened for sure which eventually breached today and caused the floods. However, an extensive investigation is needed to confirm the reason which triggered this.""

Dobhal added that the heavy sediments in the flood waters indicate that an avalanche or glacial debris could have dammed the river waters resulting in the burst.

""It will take time to ascertain the reasons as happened with the 2013 disaster in Kedarnath. After investigation it was confirmed as glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF),"" said Dobhal.

Many expressed their shock at such an incident occurring in winters. They also added that contributing factors to the disaster can be increasing anthropological activities and construction in the hills.

Amit Kumar, a scientist from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology said, ""If this is a glacier break then it is shocking. The cause needs to be investigated thoroughly. Factors like global warming annd anthropological pressure are the reason for melting of glaciers worldwide.""

Interestingly, Uttarakhand high court in the year 2019 has ordered that the use of explosives to be prohibited in and around the Raini village, the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve and the Valley of Flowers, except with the prior written approval of the District Magistrate, Chamoli and on a license granted by a competent authority under the Explosives Act.

""The District Magistrate, Chamoli shall, forthwith, take necessary steps to prevent any form of illegal mining being carried on in the said area,"" stated the court order dated June 26, 2019 by division bench of chief justice Ramesh Ranganathan and justice Alok Kumar Verma.

The court also said that resort to explosives, that too for carrying on illegal mining operations, may well result in destruction of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, and the Valley of Flowers said to be located nearby.

""While the respondent-Power Company states that they have not resorted to any form of illegal activities, and are not using explosives, we consider it appropriate to direct the Member Secretary, Uttarakhand State Pollution Control Board and the District Magistrate, Chamoli to constitute a joint inspection team to cause a physical inspection of the area; assess the extent of environmental damage caused thereat; ascertain whether illegal mining operations are carried on, and whether explosives are being used for the said purpose; and submit a comprehensive report to this Court at the earliest,"" the court order had stated.

Akash Vashishtha, a conservationist based in Ghaziabad who has filed litigations related to issues in Uttarakhand in National Green Tribunal said, ""Today's tragical incident in Chamoli and the consequent loss of life and property is yet another outcome of unabated obstruction of rivers by hydropower dams and encroachments/constructions on the water courses and channels in the state.

Nothing has been learnt from the June 2013 flood disaster in Uttarakhand, November 2015 Jhelum River (Kashmir floods), August 2015 losses in Chennai or the September 2019 Patna inundation. Even five years after the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, its provisions are not implemented.

Strange still, the Central Government has even shown no interest in tabling the River Regulation Zone (RRZ) draft bill (which is almost ready) in the Parliament.""

He further added, ""No earnestness has been shown by the Centre and State to follow the recommendations of the Supreme Court-appointed Ravi Chopra Committee report (to look into the causes of 2013 UK floods).

The ecological sanctity of the rivers in the state has been critically compromised with all these stifling constructions and is still being negotiated. Foolproof measures and zero tolerance policy is required for the protection of water channels and river courses and consequent safety and security of the people.""","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2021/2/7/w600X390/Chamoli_Floods_PTI_Photo.jpg,"['court', 'river', 'state', 'order', 'lash', 'chamoli', 'disaster', 'explosives', 'glacial', 'lake', 'uttarakhand', 'indian', 'conservationists', 'burst', 'scientists', 'result', 'express', 'avalanche']", ,,flood

""The route to the lake via Pang village was washed out. We tried to reach it through another village Muraina but with no roads in sight we didn't know which way to approach the lake situated at around 2800 metres,"" said Inspector Sanjay Upreti who was part of the 12-member SDRF team led by Commandant Navneet Bhullar that went to the lake on foot.

They had to walk through forests and steep gorges with the help of ropes for 12-13 hours to reach the place where they set up a base camp. ""Steep gorges had replaced roads that had been washed out up to 500 metres here and there. On the basis of an idea formed about its possible route during an aerial recce undertaken earlier and help from a local guide we reached a place about an hour short of the lake where we set up a camp office before sunset.

""When we reached the lake we saw that the area near it had been hit by a compound avalanche.

96,96,FL-2021-000021-IND,"Deadly glacier break: Himalayan glaciers will collapse more frequently as climate warms, experts say - ABC News",https://abcnews.go.com/International/deadly-glacier-break-himalayan-glaciers-collapse-frequently-climate/story?id=75810404,"It's unclear what caused the deadly break, but scientists are predicting more.

Warming temperatures across the globe are changing landscapes and threatening local cities and communities.

A devastating break of a glacier in the Himalayas on Feb. 7 left dozens dead and more than 100 missing after it smashed into multiple dams, collecting debris and energy as it made its way down the flank before slamming into two hydroelectric plants in northern India.

While it's difficult to attribute the cause of the collapse on climate change alone, rising temperatures will undoubtedly create more of these types of events in the future, experts told ABC News.

""With the accelerated warming that is happening in the Himalayas, and the rapid response of glaciers across the Himalayas ... the probability for hazards does go up, Summer Rupper, a glaciologist at the University of Utah, told ABC News.

It is still unclear what caused the dam to break

Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly what caused the glacier to break on Feb. 7. At first, a glacial lake outburst was blamed. Although satellite imagery soon disproved that theory, there is potential for glacier outbursts to increase in number and time as temperatures increasingly cause them to thin and retreat, Joerg Schaefer, a climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, told ABC News.

Schaefer hypothesized that some kind of mechanism triggered a landslide and that the resulting water pressure eventually burst the dam, causing the mass to plunge down the ""extremely steep"" flank.

Schaefer described the mass as a ""water monster"" that made the event even more hazardous.

Hazards experts in the Himalayas have feared that these type of disastrous events would come to fruition. A calamitous glacier event has been a ""huge conversation"" within the hazards community, Rupper said, and experts have been warning the Indian government since 2014 of the potential of landslides and avalanches, The Associated Press reported.

There is concern that there wasn't adequate monitoring or early warning systems in the valley, especially with multiple hydropower plant projects that were all damaged, Rupper said. And the potential for another landslide is currently there, as a glacial lake is currently forming behind a landslide in the valley where the accident occurred, she added.

The melting of glaciers will cause catastrophe in more ways than one

Another type of glacial event that can occur as temperatures warm is the potential for the ice masses to drape across varied topography, including steep landscapes that result in hanging glaciers that are especially prone to breaking off and causing ice avalanches, Rupper added.

In addition, the melting of glaciers is a considerable contributor to sea level rise, on par with melting ice sheets, which can cause catastrophic events for coastal areas all over the world.

Glaciers across the Himalayas have experienced significant ice loss over the past 40 years, with the average rate of ice loss doubling in the 21st century compared to the end of the 20th century, according to a study published in Science Advances in 2019, which Rupper and Schaefer co-authored.

The Himalayan glaciers are retreating ""very homogeneously and accelerating their retreat,"" Schaefer said, adding that the ""single culprit"" is warming temperatures.

""It's a very disturbing finding because it means that if you're not asking what happens to the glacier tomorrow, but what happens with the glacier in 10, 15 years, it will follow the temperature curve, which keeps getting warmer,"" he said.

The shrinking of the Himalayan glaciers, which contribute to local water resources, poses several challenges for neighboring societies, researchers say. The glaciers also feed the hydro plants and they will stop providing meltwater as they shrink, Shaefer said.

""We know that temperatures are warming across the Himalayas. That's really well documented,"" Rupper said. ""And we know that the rate of mass loss of glaciers has accelerated over time. And so that affects everything from water resources to hazards across the Himalayan range.""

The melting will also mean the end of climbing in the region

For mountaineers who spend their lives dreaming of climbing the Himalayas and other sought-after destinations around the world, climate change means they may not get there in time.

Cory Richards, a National Geographic photographer who has been climbing for 35 years, told ABC News that he's seen ""massive observable shifts"" in the deflation and disruption in glaciers around the world.

""So what that means for us as an industry is yet to be seen,"" he said. ""Certainly, there are routes on specific mountains that will be altered as glaciers start to become less predictable.""

One of the places where this is most evident is on the Khumbu Icefall, a passage on the Nepalese side of Mount Everest where ice is constantly falling from the head of the Khumbu glacier, Richards said.

""As temperatures rise, the calving of big ice cliffs and the collapsing of ice features in the Khumbu Icefall will accelerate, there's no doubt about that,"" he added, describing it as a ""tumultuous piece of glacier.""

In addition, if the glacier dam that sits near the Khumbu Valley floods or breaks, it will flood the entire valley downstream, endangering the lives of the residents.

The warming also poses a risk for classic trade routes, such as on the south side of Mount Everest. It will be difficult for guided companies to ensure people will be able to climb safely, Richards said.

For at least 20 years, people in the climbing industry have said, ""I don't know how much longer this is gonna be climbable,"" according to Richards.

""Now, we seem to find ways to do those things, continually,"" he added. ""But that's not to say that it is safe or smart.""","Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/india-receding-glacier-gty-jt-210215_1613423628181_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,"['glacier', 'glaciers', 'himalayas', 'warms', 'himalayan', 'told', 'water', 'valley', 'ice', 'temperatures', 'deadly', 'say', 'rupper', 'climate', 'warming', 'experts', 'frequently', 'collapse']", ,,none

Two water treatment plants of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) were operating at a reduced capacity. Raghav Chadha, vice-chairperson of Delhi Jal Board, on Sunday, had advised citizens to use water judiciously as the supply will remain affected.

Delhi government officials said that Chadha will also visit Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plant on Monday to take stock of the situation and also check its preparedness to deal with the situation.

In a series of tweets on Sunday, Chadha said that turbidity in raw water collected from Delhi’s Upper Ganga Canal had increased to an “unprecedented level of 8,000 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) because of the recent Uttarakhand floods.”

“Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi water treatment plants are currently operating at reduced capacity due to the increased turbidity in water,” he said.

Turbidity is the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. Turbidity is measured in Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). High turbidity can be caused by debris, silt, mud, algae, plant pieces, melting glaciers, sawdust, wood ashes or chemicals in the water.

“The Delhi Jal Board urges citizens to use water judiciously. Water tankers inadequate numbers are being deployed and all possible efforts being made to reduce turbidity,” he tweeted.

Government officials said that as an interim measure, coagulants are being added in the water to help treat it. They said that the water quality should return to normal on Monday.

Coagulants are substances that help particles in liquid clump together and form clots which can then be filtered out easily.

Officials said that the two treatment plants were affected on Sunday night and water production capacity had to be reduced to 20% at Sonia Vihar Water Treatment Plant and 90% at Bhagirathi.

A glacier broke in the Tapovan-Reni area of Chamoli district last Sunday, which led to massive flooding in Dhauliganga and Alaknanda rivers and damaged houses and the nearby Rishiganga power project.

The rescue and search operations were briefly halted at NTPC’s Tapovan hydel project on Thursday afternoon after police in Uttarakhand issued an alert over rising water levels in the Alaknanda river and its tributary Dhauliganga, officials said. As rescue operations continued for the ninth day at Tapovan Tunnel in Chamoli’s Joshimath, so far 53 bodies have been retrieved, the State Disaster Response Force was quoted as saying by ANI.

The Uttarakhand Police has said the Alaknanda river at Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal is now flowing at a normal level and no alert has been issued by the district administration in this regard, according to ANI.
