Since 2010, some 50 weather observation stations have been built with these items by African universities in Benin, Ghana, Togo and eight other countries — with support from Germany.

Wouldn't it make more sense to use the money on planting trees to slow down global warming? No, said German Research Minister Anja Karliczek in an interview with DW. Karliczek was in the Ghanaian capital Accra, where she pledged €25 million ($27.6 million) in additional support to regional climate change project WASCAL (West Africa Science Service Center on Climate Change and Adapted Land).

How warm was it in Dassari?

""First of all, we need a database as a foundation on which we can base our research,"" said Karliczek. ""So far, we have had little data collection in these latitudes.""

This observation station in Ghana sends fully automated data

The WASCAL database helps researchers find out, for instance, how high the temperature was five years ago in northwestern Benin. Near the town of Dassari at 4 p.m., it was 32 degrees, with 60 percent humidity and a light wind of three meters per second. The intensity of solar radiation, the condition of the ground and many other parameters can also be measured.

Conditions becoming more extreme

It is only with this knowledge of exactly what climatic conditions prevail, that preparations can be made for extreme weather conditions, Karliczek said. ""The drier it gets here in West Africa, the more we have to use research to make new planting possible."" Among other things, WASCAL is working on more precise rain forecasts for farmers or on finding out how much more water will be needed when the climate warms up by two degrees.

Germany's Research Minister Anja Karliczek in Ghana

With their relatively weak economies, African countries hardly contribute to climate change. However, heat, drought, floods, in short the consequences of climate change, are likely to hit the continent particularly hard. Many African countries, especially in the Sahel region, already suffer from extreme climate conditions and are poorly prepared for the consequences of climate change.

Climate doctors in action

That is why the WASCAL project includes the training of young scientists. Ten doctoral programs and two master's programs have been introduced at several West African universities.

""We already have more than 250 graduates who are now experts in climate change and water supply, in adapted land use, or climate change and security,"" WASCAL spokesman Nii Commey told DW. These experts now work across West Africa to prepare political and economic players for climate change.

Training rather than migration

The WASCAL experts are highly regarded, says Research Minister Karliczek. ""The climate experts we train can bring a wealth of knowledge especially when working in public administrations."" In addition to promoting university education, Karliczek would also like to boost vocational training in the field of climate protection in West Africa in the future.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Farming — a way of life Climate change has a disproportionate impact on communities which depend on the natural environment for their day-to-day needs. In Eritrea, it's estimated about 80% of the population are subsistence farmers, mainly growing sorghum, maize and teff. Such subsistence farmers are especially vulnerable to shifting weather patterns that can devastate food production and livelihoods.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Forced to reap early During the past few years, Eritrea, like the rest of the Horn of Africa, has experienced fluctuating weather patterns exacerbated by the ocean warming trend, El Niño. Rains fell unexpectedly in Eritrea in October last year resulting in the government advising farmers to reap early.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Vulnerable food supply ""Had they not reacted, or reacted based on the traditional harvest, they would probably lose their harvest,"" says Peter Smerdon with the World Food Programme. While El Niño is a complex and naturally occurring event, scientific research suggests that global warming could be making this cyclical event occur more frequently and intensely.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Climate change consensus Most of the world’s scientific communities agree that long-term significant changes in the earth’s climate system have occurred and are occurring more rapidly than in the past. Continued emissions into the earth’s atmosphere are projected to cause further warming, impacting Africa in the form of increased temperatures and greater seasonal rainfall variability with more frequent extremes.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Economic ramifications for all ""People in wealthier countries should be worried about the effects of climate change in the Horn of Africa,"" says Challiss McDonough from the World Food Programme ""Climate change is one of the main drivers of global hunger, second only to conflict, so, for donor countries, investing in climate and disaster risk reduction makes economic sense.""

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Still standing Pictured on the local Eritrean 5-Nakfa banknote, the sycamore tree has significant symbolism in Eritrea. Elders used to gather under these huge, hundred-year-old trees to discuss important community issues and laws. Many trees were cut down during colonization and war. Those that remain now have to contend with the effects of climate change.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Beaches under threat ""One impact of climate change in a coastal region is rising sea levels that impact lives along the coast and increases the likelihood of flooding or flood-related disaster such as high tides that could wash out a crop,"" Smerdon says. ""Also, salt-water intrusion due to climate change can increase erosion and increase salinity of soils and thereby damage soil content and fertility of land.""

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Corroding coral Eritrea’s stunning coastline includes coral reefs, offering a potential boon for tourism – if they survive in their present state. ""Until a few years ago, this piece of sea was full of corals, but then last year they all died,” an Eritrean diver tells DW. ""The temperature of the sea was too high."" At the same time, local fisherman rely on the ocean's resources to trade in fish and shells.

Eritrea's farmers harvest early as climate change shifts crop patterns Trying to find a path The weather pattern changes in Eritrea are evident elsewhere. ""While working in Central America, East Africa, and the Middle East, I’ve always talked to elder people, especially those in agriculture, and the message from them is consistent,"" says Sam Wood with Save the Children in Ethiopia. ""Weather patterns are becoming less predictable and when rain comes, it is too much or too little.” Author: James Jeffrey, Milena Belloni



""The practical side must then come directly from industry, so that the young people are able to connect,"" said the minister. ""These are the things we have to push for, so that development in Africa speeds up and pressure is not created for a new wave of migration."" She calls for more aid for Africa overall for climate protection.

Fundamental criticism

Lisa Badum, climate policy spokeswoman for the Green Party in the German parliament, the Bundestag, can only agree with that. ""It is not enough to travel through the country with a green cloak; we really need to act now,"" Badum told DW. ""The drastic nature of the climate crisis has still not been understood by Germany's federal government.""

CO2 emissions from Germany are contributing to sub-Saharan Africa's drought and slower economic growth due to climate change, said Badum. ""That's why we first of all have to start cleaning up our own act and phase coal out now."" With that, according to Badum, Germany would really help the world in the fight against climate change.","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/49823678_6.jpg,"['crop', 'change', 'early', 'shifts', 'harvest', 'west', 'data', 'farmers', 'drought', 'climate', 'patterns', 'africa', 'using', 'prevent']", ,none
1,1,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana's pact with China to explore bauxite threatens a unique forest - The Conversation Africa,https://theconversation.com/ghanas-pact-with-china-to-explore-bauxite-threatens-a-unique-forest-120815,"Ghana’s Atewa forest is one of the most beautiful and scenic landscapes in the country. It is seen as the better of only two Upland Evergreen forests left intact in the country, forming part of the six dominant vegetation zones of Ghana based on different climates zones.

The Atewa forest is part of the Guinean Forests of West Africa which stretch from southern Guinea into eastern Sierra Leone and through Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana into western Togo. Deforestation has massively reduced the size of the forests and the Upper Guinea Forest is now restricted to a number of more or less disconnected reserves and a few national parks acting as man-made refuges for the region’s biodiversity.

The Atewa forest landscape is remote and pristine, providing the habitat for a major collection of Ghana’s biodiversity. It has been named as one of Ghana’s 30 globally significant biodiversity areas.

But the forest is under threat. Last year Ghana signed a memorandum with China to explore Ghana’s deposits of bauxite – the primary ore in aluminium. The deposits are found in two locations – Awaso with very high deposits in the moist semi-deciduous forest zone of western region of Ghana, and Atewa, with minimum deposits and located in the Upland Evergreen forests in the Eastern Region of Ghana.

Under the memorandum Ghana will cede 5% of its bauxite resources to the Chinese. In turn, Beijing will finance $2billion worth of infrastructure projects that include rails, roads and bridge networks. The Ghanaian Parliament has passed the Ghana Bauxite Integrated Aluminium Industry Act which would provide a legal framework to exploit country’s bauxite deposits.

Yet the government says it still has to validate the true worth of the bauxite deposit in the forest.

As a botanist I view the Atewa landscape as a scientific gold mine. A recent impact assessment by the US Forest Service corroborates the concerns of several conservation groups about the potential damage that mining would cause.

I believe strongly that Atewa is not for mining and that it must be preserved. Firstly, it needs to be preserved as a living natural history laboratory. Secondly, it should be protected because it provides a vital resource – water. Thirdly, it is a precious gift whose value cannot be quantified, but which must be lived, felt and appreciated. Finally it is a naturally bequeathed heritage that must be protected for future generations to enjoy.

The forest

An interesting characteristic of the Atewa forest is that the canopies of its trees are not easily visible as they merge with the surrounding clouds creating a beautiful cloud cover line. This is very rare in the Ghanaian landscape. This feature is described in local parlance as the phenomenon in which the trees are in direct communication with the firmament of the heavens and bring good tidings to the ground underneath.

Scientifically, the phenomenon is responsible for the daily condensation of water vapour which falls as precipitation. As a result the mountain top is kept permanently moist. This in turn explains the interesting hydrological networks beneath the soil surface. The water percolates down to create under ground water ways as well as water falls and many streams and tributaries that coalesce or combine to form Ghana’s famous three rivers. These are the Ayensu, Birim and Densu.

The three eventually drain their basins as they meander through the forests and farm fields providing essential water resources to over 5 million inhabitants. They also deposit suspended clay and silt materials as fertile alluvial for crop production during the rainy periods when they burst their banks and overflow.

The Atewa landscape provides rich forest cover for climate regulation, a show piece to illustrate climate adaptation to avoid drought, reduce poverty and enhance sustainable livelihoods and improve human well being in its catchment area.

The landscape has been the subject of research by geologists, hydrologists and geo-morphologists. A geologist studies studies the solid, liquid, and gaseous matter that constitute the Earth while a geo-morphologist studies the earth’s surface. A hydrologist is a scientist who researches the distribution, circulation, and physical properties of the earth’s underground and surface waters.

Studies of the fauna and flora of the area have brought up new scientific discoveries of species like the critically endangered white-naped mangabey Cercocebus lunulatus. This shows that the knowledge of the faunal and floristic diversity and to a large extent the microbial diversity is still at the exploratory stages.

I would strongly argue that the Atewa landscape is an important species discovery destination, awaiting extensive research and studies. It should, therefore, not be disrupted or destroyed by mining.","Sun, 18 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/287684/original/file-20190812-71926-1k2tu0o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['forest', 'bauxite', 'ghanas', 'water', 'china', 'deposits', 'forests', 'landscape', 'explore', 'unique', 'atewa', 'ghana', 'pact', 'studies', 'threatens']", ,none

The 25-year-old has sealed a transfer to the Swedish club after fine performances last season

Swedish club Trelleborgs have announced the acquisition of Asante Kotoko attacker Abdul Safiu Fatawu.

The 25-year-old Ghanaian joins the second-tier side for the remainder of the 2019 season with an option to extend the deal for a further two years.

The switch comes after a move to Swedish elite division fold Helsingborgs fell through due to the inability of the Porcupines and the Reds to reach an agreement over his transfer fee following a training stint with the club.

""We continue to strengthen on the attack side, now by the addition of 25-year-old forward Fatawu Safiu from Ghana,"" Trelleborg announced on their official website on Tuesday.

""The contract is valid for the 2019 season with an option for an additional two years.""

""Fatawu Safiu comes from the club Asante Kotoko in Ghana where he played the 2018-19 season.

""He has also previously represented Ghana's U20 national team.

""We warmly welcome Fatawu to Trelleborgs FF!""

Last season, Fatawu netted 10 times to help Kotoko win the Ghana Special Competition, finishing joint-top scorer in the championship.

The attacker also played an instrumental role as the Porcupines reached the group stage of the Caf Confederation Cup.

His good showing earned him a spot in Ghana's provisional squad for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt but he fell short of making the final 23-man roster.

""With Fatawu Safiu, we get an experienced and strong striker who can also play in all attack positions,"" Trelleborg boss Peter Swardh said.

""He is creative and should strengthen our offensive qualities.""

Fatawu's transfer situation saw him miss Kotoko's Caf Champions League opener against Nigeria's Kano Pillars on Saturday.

3,3,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,"In Ghana, a Bumper Crop of Opinions on Genetically Modified Cowpea - Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting",https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/ghana-bumper-crop-opinions-genetically-modified-cowpea,"UNDER THE noonday sun, Alimatu Alidu uses a stone to grind tomato, red pepper, and small crayfish into a red paste. Drops of sweat collect on her forehead, just below her black headscarf. She adds the paste along with other ingredients into a cooking pot balanced upon a make-shift stove, consisting of two uneven rocks with a small fire burning between them. Once her mixture is sufficiently heated, she adds the final element: boiled cowpea beans. Known as poor people’s meat, these faded yellow legumes with a big black dot along the curve are ubiquitous throughout West Africa, including here in Ghana.

The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it before work and don’t feel hungry until sundown.

Other days, Alidu prepares cowpea fritters, or koose, whipping ground cowpea and water into a batter, adding spices, then frying individually-rolled balls to be served for breakfast. She can make five different dishes from cowpea beans, which grow inside green pods up to 12 inches long.

Soon the spicy dish known as red-red is fully cooked and ready for Alidu’s 16-person family, which includes herself, her husband, their six children, and her husband’s second wife and their seven children. Together, they live in thatch huts that surround this open-air kitchen in the northern village of Zinindo.

Cowpea is a staple in Ghana and other parts of West Africa, where it is believed to have first been domesticated. The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it in the morning before leaving for work and don’t feel hungry until sundown. At her doctor’s request, Alidu increased her own consumption when she was pregnant, and she used the ground seeds to wean her children. Cowpea is a mainstay of school lunches in Ghana. And because the crop can be harvested within two months of sowing, it fills the “hunger gap” for poor families between May and August when other crops, such as maize, are still young in the field. And cowpea tolerates droughts, which are increasing across sub-Saharan Africa. Every woman in Zinindo keeps some cowpea in her home, says Alidu.

But cowpea has been under attack for years. A winged pest, Maruca vitrata, bores into the pods and nibbles away at the seeds, destroying anywhere between 20 and 80 percent of West Africa’s cowpea crops every year. In response, scientists have genetically modified cowpea plant lines to resist the pest, and advocates for the technology — which involves altering an organism’s DNA in ways that aren’t possible through traditional breeding — believe that genetically modified (GM) cowpea can help feed the fast-growing population on a warming planet. It can also help reduce the use of pesticides, they say, freeing up land for other uses, providing enough surplus for regional market opportunities, and giving farmers an additional choice about what to grow.

Ghana plans to release GM cowpea sometime this year or next, which would make it the third sub-Saharan African country after South Africa and Nigeria to approve local production and sale of GM food.

What worries some critics is that all of Africa’s genetic modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations. Licenses for the patented genes that African scientists use to modify cowpea crops, for example, were provided royalty-free by biotech companies such as Monsanto (since acquired by Bayer) — inviting questions about whether their goals are purely humanitarian. Further, social scientists warn that GM seeds are being pushed by international donors without fully taking into account the agriculture practices of poor farmers and the specific crop characteristics that they most want and need. While some African scientists are working tirelessly to reassure laypeople that GM foods are safe, it’s clear that safety concerns, however unfounded, are not the only challenge standing in the way of GM cowpea in Ghana.

Here in this rural village, Alidu and other poor farmers have not been following these controversies. But they say they are open to new approaches that would minimize pests, allowing them to grow enough cowpea to feed their families with a surplus to sell.

THE ROOTS of GM cowpea date back to the 1990s, when the Rockefeller Foundation, a New-York based philanthropy, entered into a series of conversations with companies that own many of the genes used to modify food, including Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta. Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation believed that biotechnology could help poor countries grow more food. But they understood the companies were unlikely to invest in genetically modifying so-called orphan crops such as cowpea, cooking banana, and cassava, which aren’t traded internationally and are often grown and eaten by farmers without the financial means to purchase expensive GM seeds.

“More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist.

Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation proposed that the companies donate the genes to research institutes in developing countries. Researchers at those institutes would then use the genes to develop seeds for orphan crops that could resist pests, tolerate drought and excess salt, and enhance nutrition. A humanitarian organization would be created specifically to facilitate a partnership between the companies, philanthropic and governmental organizations, and the local scientists.

The companies initially rejected the proposal, but ultimately accepted the plan after internal discussions about how the partnership could restore their public image. Across the globe, the anti-GM movement had accused the biotech industry of monopolizing the world’s seed supply. Amid this and other criticisms, the companies agreed to an alliance.



Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana’s coordinator for the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa, believes that training journalists and farming leaders about the science of GM food is the best way to dispel myths around it. Image by Ankur Paliwal. Ghana, 2019.

But they had conditions. The biotech companies wanted Asia and Latin America “off the table” because business was thriving in these regions. The companies also wanted strict licensing contracts that specified where, when, and to whom they would make the genes available royalty-free. These historical details were published in a paper by University of Minnesota sociologist Rachel Schurman, who had interviewed employees of the Rockefeller Foundation, biotech companies, and scientists in Africa.

The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to these terms and soon found an additional partner — the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at that time was also trying to bridge partnerships between U.S. universities, biotech companies, and research institutions in developing countries to increase the global acceptance of biotech products. USAID representatives say that their agency promotes biotechnology when conventional breeding is too slow or ineffective to improve a given crop.

Over time, other big donors such as UK Aid, and corporations such as PepsiCo, joined the coalition. These groups reached out to African scientists, many of whom believe that biotechnology can solve some of African agriculture’s problems. In 2004, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation was launched. This Nairobi-based nonprofit now coordinates many of the GM research projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Two years later, it formed the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB), an advocacy arm tasked with changing the public’s negative perception of GM products. Today, with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OFAB organizes meetings between scientists, farmers, and the media.

In Ghana, supporters of GM cowpea welcome Western support and believe the international partnerships serve the interests of local farmers. Anti-GM groups, however, don’t trust the companies or their technology. “There is no free lunch,” says Edwin Kweku Andoh Baffour, a spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, the most active anti-GM group in the country.

For now, OFAB appears to be making inroads. A number of Ghanian journalists said that after attending its workshops, they felt better equipped to address misconceptions. For example, doctored images of animal-shaped fruits — supposedly created by inserting animal genes into fruit seeds — had been making the rounds on social media.

“More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist who has attended GM workshops.

ONE DAY in January, Alidu joins a small group in a prayer led by an old man under a grass-thatched shed near her house. After the prayer is finished, the old man introduces Mohammed Adams Nashiru, head of a farmers’ group in the region. Ghanian scientists have improved cowpea to fight off one of its pests, explains Nashiru. This could benefit local farmers, some of whom see half their cowpea destroyed by field pests in a given year. With this new cowpea, farmers will be able to grow more using less insecticide.

“These [GM] technologies are being privileged at the expense of other potential interventions,” says Matthew Schnurr.

Alidu is skeptical. For one, she and some of Zinindo’s farmers already intercrop cowpea, which lessens pest infestation. Further, though the farmers’ group leader assures the group that the seeds will be available soon, he is one of many government officials, traders, and researchers who have visited the village with promises to improve farmers’ lives. According to Alidu, none of them have ever returned.



Former anti-GM activist Mohammed Adams Nashiru says he had a change of heart after he heard scientists speak about the science of GM food and learned that Americans have been eating GM food for decades without any harm. Image by Ankur Paliwal. Ghana, 2019.

In stark contrast to his work today, roughly three years ago, Nashiru was leading marches in northern Ghana against GM crops. He says he had a change of heart in 2014 at an OFAB workshop where Walter Sandow Alhassan — former head of Ghana’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research — told an audience of farmers and journalists that GM food has been rigorously tested and is safe to eat. People in the United States, he noted, have been eating genetically modified food for many years. “He said that nothing happened to them,” says Nashiru. “There is no need to worry.”

Two years later, a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is “no substantiated evidence” that GM crops are less safe than non-GM crops.

Although scientists and the OFAB are working to get that message out — with some scientists even asking their pastors to let them speak about GM food after Sunday prayers — changing public perception “is extremely challenging,” says Vivian Oduro, a plant scientist with the Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute in Accra.

In Ghana, the debate around GM food is highly polarized, as it is elsewhere in the world, even in the U.S., where resistance has paralleled a growing demand for organic foods and clear labeling of genetically modified products. “This is a very connected movement,” says Mark Lynas, a former anti-GM activist turned science writer. “I often see European and U.S. themes quickly picked up by anti-GM activists in Africa.” But Lynas also notes that as people are exposed to a wider variety of facts and opinions — beyond the simple anti-GM narrative — their own views tend to become less entrenched. Many now say they don’t know enough about the technology to be for or against it.

Oduro remembers a debate organized by a government ministry in Accra last year, where the audience was asked to vote on the introduction of GM foods. After Oduro explained the science of genetic modification, a different speaker quoted a controversial 2012 study by French scientist Gilles-Éric Séralini. The study showed Séralini’s lab rats developed cancer after eating GM corn. (The paper was retracted the following year after a review found that “the conclusions described in the article were unreliable.”) The speaker also announced that waakye, a popular cowpea delicacy slow-cooked with rice, would be made using that same technology.

That made Oduro furious. In her next turn to speak, she appealed to the audience as a fellow Ghanaian and as the daughter of a farmer. She and her family eat cowpea, she said. Why would she promote something she believed to be harmful?

In fact, experiments show that GM cowpea is not just safe, it also yields about .85 tons more per acre than conventional varieties. And although the GM seeds will be about 50 percent more expensive than conventional seeds according to one estimate, they will require just two rounds of pesticides, rather than the current five to six. That will cut overall production costs by 5 to 10 percent.

But, says Oduro, once someone has stirred up fear, it is difficult to convince people not to be afraid. That day, the audience voted against genetically modified crops.

A couple days later, the aggregated online news site GhanaWeb posted an article about Oduro’s public statements. In the comments section, somebody called Oduro a “dirty bitch.” Someone else called her a “foolish woman.” Alhassan has even been the target of online death threats. In 2015, an Accra-based newspaper ran an article that quoted him saying genetically modified food is safe. “Shoot alhassan on the throat. IDIOT!” wrote one commenter after the article was posted on GhanaWeb. “Prof. Walter Sandow Alhassan must die now,” wrote another.

Baffour, the spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, says that he doesn’t believe studies such as the ones analyzed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. He maintains that other studies show GM crops are not safe because they have “unintended risks” though when questioned didn’t explain what those risks might be. And when asked for examples, he was not able to provide any that were published in peer-reviewed journals.

According to Baffour, organic food is “natural” and “obviously the future of the world.” Organic food, however, is expensive to grow because it requires more labor and costly herbal insecticides, which farmers like Alidu cannot afford. This is why biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

Anti-GM marches have occurred across Ghana, with many of them centered in Accra. But Nashiru characterizes the marches as a “show for media.” When he used to help organize them, he says he would call village farmers, hand them placards they couldn’t read, and pay them for their efforts. The farmers didn’t even know what they were marching for.

Interviews with a wide range of Ghanaians revealed some reservations about genetically modified foods. Wouldn’t there be something wrong, they wondered, with a crop that even insects won’t eat? Some maintained that the foods looked “too clean,” though few had actually seen these foods.

Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana coordinator for OFAB, thinks it is best to train leaders like Nashiru whose community ties and farming background lend him credibility in the eyes of local community members. Yet there are notable differences between Nashiru’s life and the lives of the poor farmers. For one, he has travelled internationally. He also owns 250 acres of land, much more than a farmer like Alidu, who owns just five acres.

For his part, Nashiru says he cares deeply about the seeds poor farmers ultimately use. “My grandfather told me that monuments are not built after rich people,” he says. They are built to commemorate individuals who improve the lives of the whole community. “This is the type I want.”

ON A HOT morning, Alidu opens one of the plastic bags in which she stores her cowpea beans to discover tiny brown weevils — a type of beetle — scurrying around inside. They have bored neat holes into the seeds. Before cooking, Alidu will have to put the cowpea in a pot and cover it with water so that the weevils float to the surface, where they can be seen and removed. She cannot sell this cowpea in the market, even if there is surplus at home.

Farmers in Zinindo are as troubled by weevil attacks on stored cowpea as they are by pests in the field. Yet the African Agricultural Technology Foundation does not yet have a project to address this problem.

Biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

“These [GM] technologies are being privileged at the expense of other potential interventions,” says Matthew Schnurr, a professor at Dalhousie University in Canada. Schnurr has been researching GM orphan crop projects in Africa for over a decade. He says it doesn’t make sense to introduce the crops without solving other problems, such as storage, in the agricultural supply chain.

GM cowpea’s main donor, USAID, does work to solve supply-chain issues for maize, rice, and soybean in Ghana. But it does not yet have a clear plan for how to reduce post-harvest losses for cowpea.

Some people, including Charles Kwowe Nyaaba of the Peasant Farmers Association of Ghana, question whether GM cowpea is even necessary, given that Ghana already grows enough cowpea to feed its population. He wants the government and international aid organizations to use their money to build storage facilities, subsidize seeds and farm equipment, and create more demand for cowpea. Otherwise, overproduction could lead to price declines in local markets and the crop could rot in the field.

In fact, cowpea is one of the few food crops in Ghana not currently being processed for use in other products, says Irene Egyir, an agricultural economist at the University of Ghana. Sorghum, for example, is bought by breweries to make beer. If cowpea were similarly industrialized, says Egyir, this would increase demand and likely help cowpea farmers earn more money.

Distribution is also a problem. About 90 percent of Ghana’s cowpea is grown in the north, and while there’s unmet demand for cowpea farther south, bad roads and lack of storage, among other factors, have deterred traders, says Nyaaba.

In response to these criticisms, USAID and biotech scientists have argued that that there is no reason to pit one problem against the other. African Agricultural Technology Foundation officials have said they will work on reducing post-harvest losses in coming years.

Still, some social scientists doubt GM orphan crops will benefit poor farmers, even if the supply chain is improved. They say there is a gulf between these research projects and the specific needs of small farmers. Schnurr’s research on cooking banana, a staple food in Uganda, provides a case in point.

Traditional cooking banana is low in vitamin A, and almost half of children in sub-Saharan Africa are vitamin-A deficient. This makes them prone to diseases and blindness. So scientists are genetically modifying a banana to increase Vitamin A levels. But this particular variety will require farmers to apply more fertilizer and maintain specific sowing space. This could prove a barrier to poor farmers, who can’t afford additional fertilizer and have limited land. For these reasons, some poor farmers in Uganda may continue to plant their preferred traditional cooking banana varieties, which are not amenable to genetic modification. Schnurr says scientists should have first spoken to farmers to assess how many of them would grow genetically modified cooking banana.

“The donors and scientists probably have good intentions, and they want to help,” says Klara Fischer, an associate professor of rural development at the Swedish University of Agriculture Sciences. “But they are not doing enough groundwork with an open mindset.”

Almost all of Africa’s genetic modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations.

Fischer’s research in South Africa indicates that its GM maize, which resists a common pest that bores into the stalk of the plant, poses a challenge to poor farmers in particular because non-subsidized seeds are expensive and the crops require regular watering as well as synthetic fertilizers. While large-scale farmers can pay for fertilizer and have access to running water, poor farmers depend on rains, which sometimes come late. “The problem was that they wanted the small holder farmers to have the most modern maize,” says Fischer. “But the most modern maize was suited to a completely different kind of agriculture system.”

Still, Songotra — the cowpea variety that has been genetically modified — is already grown in about 20 percent of the cultivated area of Ghana’s Northern Region, and it is one of the varieties preferred by subsistence farmers. According to Mumuni Abudulai, principal investigator for the Bt cowpea project in Ghana, GM cowpea would not require poor farmers to do anything additional except maintain refuge — a practice in which non-GM crops are planted around GM crops making it more difficult for pests to develop resistance to the genes in GM crops. Whether the farmers will adequately maintain this practice, however, is not yet clear.

Both Schnurr and Brian Dowd-Uribe, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco who is researching a GM cowpea project in Burkina Faso, are concerned that orphan crop projects are likely to perpetuate the old agriculture development pattern which benefits rich farmers first and to a greater extent than the poor ones. Rich farmers are mostly literate, understand technology, and can afford risks. Sometimes poor farmers follow their lead after seeing the technology work. But “the goal of these projects is focused on small farmers,” says Schnurr. He believes the projects should be course-corrected to benefit them first instead of asking them to play catch up.

In other parts of the world, there is some evidence that genetically modified crops can help small farmers. A recent study from Bangladesh found that farmers who grew GM eggplant earned six times more per acre than those who grew conventional eggplant. In India, where GM food crops are not yet permitted, some farmers have started growing GM eggplant illegally because they believe it is less costly to grow.

Schnurr’s research has ruffled the feathers of some agriculture scientists in Africa. In an email shared with Undark, a Kenyan scientist cautioned his colleagues against meeting Schnurr, whom he feared could be peddling anti-GM propaganda.

The debate around genetically modified food in Africa is so polarized, says Schnurr, that there is little room for questioning on either side.

According to recent estimates, if GM cowpea is released next year, it will take five to 10 years for it to reach the projected maximum adoption rate of about 70 percent of farmers because of the negative perception surrounding GM foods. And yet, before Nashiru’s visit to Zinindo, many of the local farmers had never even heard of genetic modification. Some soon forgot the term, though they remembered that there is a technology that enables their cowpea to resist pests in the field. That, they said, is a good thing.

But because none of Zinindo’s farmers had actually grown GM cowpea, it was difficult for them to say anything more. Any concerns with the new technology had not yet reached them.

In some ways, this would appear to represent a small but important victory for proponents of Ghana’s GM cowpea, who have struggled to be heard above the voices of anti-GM activists. But whether the seeds will truly benefit small farmers like Alidu and her family — that remains an open question.","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/768x600/public/07-31-19/1_long.jpg?h=8c29533f&itok=2RFJEZX6,"['crop', 'seeds', 'crops', 'bumper', 'scientists', 'farmers', 'food', 'opinions', 'modified', 'genetically', 'poor', 'gm', 'cowpea', 'ghana']", ,none

A delegation from Tema’s Executive Council has completed a four-day visit to the Danish city of Aarhus, nestled on the east coast of the Jutland Peninsula. Both cities are port cities and wastewater treatment must provide a better living environment for their respective populations, but above all to prevent them from polluting rivers and the sea.

Aarhus is well ahead of Tema where wastewater treatment remains a real challenge. The objective of the locality of this Ghanaian City was therefore to sign a cooperation agreement with Aarhus. “Our lakes and lagoons are highly polluted due to the lack of effective wastewater treatment, but if you look at the rivers, lakes and lagoons of Aarhus, you will not see any highly polluted water, because there is effective wastewater treatment,” says Felix Mensah Nii Anang, Executive Director of the Tema Metropolitan System.

Prospects for cooperation

The delegation from Tema took advantage of the trip to Aarhus to visit facilities, including a “modern” wastewater treatment plant. Tema officials visited several world-renowned water companies such as Kamstrup, AVK Group and Grundfos, better known in Africa for their drinking water installations.

“Tema is a city on the move. They have a big port. They are the gateway to Ghana and the rest of Africa. We can use Tema as a springboard for cooperation with other African countries, which also represents an interesting potential for private companies in Aarhus and the region,” says Jacob Bundsgaard, Mayor of Aarhus. He said he was available to provide advice and guidance on wastewater treatment in the Ghanaian city of Tema.

Under the noonday sun, Alimatu Alidu uses a stone to grind tomato, red pepper, and small crayfish into a red paste. Drops of sweat collect on her forehead, just below her black headscarf. She adds the paste along with other ingredients into a cooking pot balanced upon a make-shift stove, consisting of two uneven rocks with a small fire burning between them. Once her mixture is sufficiently heated, she adds the final element: boiled cowpea beans. Known as poor people’s meat, these faded yellow legumes with a big black dot along the curve are ubiquitous throughout West Africa, including here in Ghana. Other days, Alidu prepares cowpea fritters, or koose, whipping ground cowpea and water into a batter, adding spices, then frying individually rolled balls to be served for breakfast. She can make five different dishes from cowpea beans, which grow in green pods that are up to 12 inches long. Soon the spicy dish, known as red-red, is fully cooked and ready for Alidu’s 16-person family, which includes herself, her husband, their six children, and her husband’s second wife and their seven children. Together, they live in thatch huts that surround this open-air kitchen in the northern village of Zinindo.

Cowpea is a staple in Ghana and other parts of West Africa, where it is believed to have first been domesticated. The legume is a favorite among farmers and laborers, who consume it in the morning before leaving for work and don’t feel hungry until sundown. At her doctor’s request, Alidu increased her own consumption when she was pregnant, and she used the ground seeds to wean her children. Cowpea is a mainstay of school lunches in Ghana. Because the crop can be harvested within two months of sowing, it fills the “hunger gap” for poor families between May and August when other crops, such as maize, are still young in the field. And cowpea tolerates droughts, which are increasing across sub-Saharan Africa. Every woman in Zinindo keeps some cowpea in her home, says Alidu. But cowpea has been under attack for years. A winged pest, Maruca vitrata, bores into the pods and nibbles away at the seeds, destroying anywhere between 20 and 80% of West Africa’s cowpea crops every year. In response, scientists have genetically modified cowpea plant lines to resist the pest, and advocates for the technology—which involves altering an organism’s DNA in ways that aren’t possible through traditional breeding—believe that genetically modified (GM) cowpea can help feed the fast-growing population on a warming planet. It can also help reduce the use of pesticides, they say, freeing up land for other uses, providing enough surplus for regional market opportunities, and giving farmers an additional choice about what to grow. Ghana plans to release GM cowpea sometime this year or next, which would make it the third sub-Saharan African country, after South Africa and Nigeria, to approve the local production and sale of GM food.

What worries some critics is that all of Africa’s genetic-modification projects are closely tied to Western organizations. Licenses for the patented genes that African scientists use to modify cowpea crops, for example, were provided royalty-free by biotech companies such as Monsanto (since acquired by Bayer)—inviting questions about whether their goals are purely humanitarian. Further, social scientists warn that GM seeds are being pushed by international donors without fully taking into account the agriculture practices of poor farmers and the specific crop characteristics that they most want and need. While some African scientists are working tirelessly to reassure laypeople that GM foods are safe, it’s clear that safety concerns, however unfounded, are not the only challenge standing in the way of GM cowpea in Ghana. Here in this rural village, Alidu and other poor farmers have not been following these controversies. But they say they are open to new approaches that would minimize pests, allowing them to grow enough cowpea to feed their families with a surplus to sell. In the wake of outcry, an effort to restore their public image The roots of GM cowpea date back to the 1990s, when the Rockefeller Foundation, a New York-based philanthropy, entered into a series of conversations with companies that own many of the genes used to modify food, including Monsanto, DuPont, and Syngenta. Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation believed that biotechnology could help poor countries grow more food. But they understood the companies were unlikely to invest in genetically modifying so-called orphan crops such as cowpea, cooking banana, and cassava, which aren’t traded internationally and are often grown and eaten by farmers without the financial means to purchase expensive GM seeds.

Staff at the Rockefeller Foundation proposed that the companies donate the genes to research institutes in developing countries. Researchers at those institutes would then use the genes to develop seeds for orphan crops that could resist pests, tolerate drought and excess salt, and enhance nutrition. A humanitarian organization would be created specifically to facilitate a partnership between the companies, philanthropic and governmental organizations, and the local scientists. The companies initially rejected the proposal, but ultimately accepted the plan after internal discussions about how the partnership could restore their public image. Across the globe, the anti-GM movement had accused the biotech industry of monopolizing the world’s seed supply. Amid this and other criticisms, the companies agreed to an alliance. But they had conditions. The biotech companies wanted Asia and Latin America “off the table” because business was thriving in these regions. The companies also wanted strict licensing contracts that specified where, when, and to whom they would make the genes available royalty-free. These historical details were published in a paper by University of Minnesota sociologist Rachel Schurman, who had interviewed employees of the Rockefeller Foundation, biotech companies, and scientists in Africa.

advertisement

The Rockefeller Foundation agreed to these terms and soon found an additional partner—the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which at that time was also trying to forge partnerships between U.S. universities, biotech companies, and research institutions in developing countries to increase the global acceptance of biotech products. USAID representatives say that their agency promotes biotechnology when conventional breeding is too slow or ineffective to improve a given crop. Over time, other big donors such as UK Aid, and corporations such as PepsiCo, joined the coalition. These groups reached out to African scientists, many of whom believe that biotechnology can solve some of African agriculture’s problems. In 2004, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation was launched. This Nairobi-based nonprofit now coordinates many of the GM research projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Two years later, it formed the Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB), an advocacy arm tasked with changing the public’s negative perception of GM products. Today, with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, OFAB organizes meetings between scientists, farmers, and the media. In Ghana, supporters of GM cowpea welcome Western support and believe the international partnerships serve the interests of local farmers. Anti-GM groups, however, don’t trust the companies or their technology. “There is no free lunch,” says Edwin Kweku Andoh Baffour, a spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, the most active anti-GM group in the country.

For now, OFAB appears to be making inroads. A number of Ghanian journalists said that after attending its workshops, they felt better equipped to address misconceptions. For example, doctored images of animal-shaped fruits—supposedly created by inserting animal genes into fruit seeds—had been making the rounds on social media. “More scientists are coming forward to change public perception,” says Joseph Opoku Gakpo, an Accra-based journalist who has attended GM workshops. A mother’s skepticism One day in January, Alidu joins a small group in a prayer led by an old man under a grass-thatched shed near her house. After the prayer is finished, the old man introduces Mohammed Adams Nashiru, head of a farmers’ group in the region. Ghanian scientists have improved cowpea to fight off one of its pests, explains Nashiru. This could benefit local farmers, some of whom see half their cowpea destroyed by field pests in a given year. With this new cowpea, farmers will be able to grow more using less insecticide.

Alidu is skeptical. For one, she and some of Zinindo’s farmers already intercrop cowpea, which lessens pest infestation. Further, though the farmers’ group leader assures the group that the seeds will be available soon, he is one of many government officials, traders, and researchers who have visited the village with promises to improve farmers’ lives. According to Alidu, none of them have ever returned. In stark contrast to his work today, roughly three years ago, Nashiru was leading marches in northern Ghana against GM crops. He says he had a change of heart in 2014 at an OFAB workshop where Walter Sandow Alhassan—former head of Ghana’s Council for Scientific and Industrial Research—told an audience of farmers and journalists that GM food has been rigorously tested and is safe to eat. People in the United States, he noted, have been eating genetically modified food for many years. “He said that nothing happened to them,” says Nashiru. “There is no need to worry.” Two years later, a report by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that there is “no substantiated evidence” that GM crops are less safe than non-GM crops.

advertisement

Although scientists and the OFAB are working to get that message out—with some scientists even asking their pastors to let them speak about GM food after Sunday prayers—changing public perception “is extremely challenging,” says Vivian Oduro, a plant scientist with the Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute in Accra. In Ghana, the debate around GM food is highly polarized, as it is elsewhere in the world, even in the U.S., where resistance has paralleled a growing demand for organic foods and clear labeling of genetically modified products. “This is a very connected movement,” says Mark Lynas, a former anti-GM activist turned science writer. “I often see European and U.S. themes quickly picked up by anti-GM activists in Africa.” But Lynas also notes that as people are exposed to a wider variety of facts and opinions—beyond the simple anti-GM narrative—their own views tend to become less entrenched. Many now say they don’t know enough about the technology to be for or against it. Oduro remembers a debate organized by a government ministry in Accra last year, where the audience was asked to vote on the introduction of GM foods. After Oduro explained the science of genetic modification, a different speaker quoted a controversial 2012 study by French scientist Gilles-Éric Séralini. The study showed Séralini’s lab rats developed cancer after eating GM corn. (The paper was retracted the following year after a review found that “the conclusions described in the article were unreliable.”) The speaker also announced that waakye, a popular cowpea delicacy slow-cooked with rice, would be made using that same technology.

advertisement

That made Oduro furious. In her next turn to speak, she appealed to the audience as a fellow Ghanian and as the daughter of a farmer. She and her family eat cowpea, she said. Why would she promote something she believed to be harmful? In fact, experiments show that GM cowpea is not just safe, it also yields about .85 tons more per acre than conventional varieties. And although the GM seeds will be about 50% more expensive than conventional seeds, according to one estimate, they will require just two rounds of pesticides, rather than the current five to six. That will cut overall production costs by 5 to 10%. But, says Oduro, once someone has stirred up fear, it is difficult to convince people not to be afraid. That day, the audience voted against genetically modified crops.

advertisement

A couple days later, the aggregated online news site GhanaWeb posted an article about Oduro’s public statements. In the comments section, somebody called Oduro a “dirty bitch.” Someone else called her a “foolish woman.” Alhassan has even been the target of online death threats. In 2015, an Accra-based newspaper ran an article that quoted him saying genetically modified food is safe. “Shoot alhassan on the throat. IDIOT!” wrote one commenter after the article was posted on GhanaWeb. “Prof. Walter Sandow Alhassan must die now,” wrote another. Baffour, the spokesperson for Food Sovereignty Ghana, says that he doesn’t believe studies such as the ones analyzed in the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine report. He maintains that other studies show GM crops are not safe, because they have “unintended risks,” though when questioned he didn’t explain what those risks might be. And when asked for examples, he was not able to provide any that were published in peer-reviewed journals. According to Baffour, organic food is “natural” and “obviously the future of the world.” Organic food, however, is expensive to grow because it requires more labor and costly herbal insecticides, which farmers like Alidu cannot afford. This is why biotech scientists say it’s best to offer choices and let farmers decide which seeds best meet their needs.

advertisement

Anti-GM marches have occurred across Ghana, with many of them centered in Accra. But Nashiru characterizes the marches as a “show for media.” When he used to help organize them, he says he would call village farmers, hand them placards they couldn’t read, and pay them for their efforts. The farmers didn’t even know what they were marching for. Interviews with a wide range of Ghanians revealed some reservations about genetically modified foods. Wouldn’t there be something wrong, they wondered, with a crop that even insects won’t eat? Some maintained that the foods looked “too clean,” though few had actually seen these foods. Richard Ampadu-Ameyaw, Ghana coordinator for OFAB, thinks it is best to train leaders like Nashiru, whose community ties and farming background lend him credibility in the eyes of local community members. Yet there are notable differences between Nashiru’s life and the lives of the poor farmers. For one, he has traveled internationally. He also owns 250 acres of land, much more than a farmer like Alidu, who owns just five acres.

The decisions of Caf’s disciplinary board over the 2019 Champions League final have been revealed

The Confederation of African Football (Caf) have retained Esperance as Champions League winners on Wednesday after its disciplinary board presided over the long-standing debacle.

The Tunisian outfit won the final in May after Wydad Casablanca abandoned the game in the 55th minute owing to Walid El Karti’s disallowed goal and subsequent VAR controversy.

Wydad called for video replays but the technology was unavailable, and they refused to restart play for nearly 120 minutes, forcing Gambian official Bakary Gassama to end the game.

Days later, Caf overturned the decision to award Esperance the title, demanded a return of the medals and announced a rematch of the second-leg at an unnamed date and venue.

Both clubs appealed the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), where Caf was called on to make the final decision on how to proceed.

The African body’s disciplinary board have subsequently meted out punishment to Wydad for their inappropriate behaviour in the game.

The Moroccan outfit “is considered to have lost the game in the final second leg, a fine of 50,000 USD is imposed on the club for the abandonment of the match and a fine of 15,000 USD is imposed for the use of flares by the supporters,” a statement from Caf read.

Esperance weren’t left out either, with club president Mohamed Meddeb receiving a 20,000 USD fine, while the club has been fined 50,000 USD for their supporters’ unsuitable behaviour.

The Tunisian outfit also risks playing two continental home games behind closed doors after the excessive use of smoke and firecrackers. Caf will only enforce the punishment if a repeat offense is committed in the next 12 months.","Wed, 07 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['outfit', 'punish', 'conduct', 'casablanca', 'fine', 'caf', 'champions', 'final', 'disciplinary', 'league', 'wydad', 'retain', 'esperance', 'usd']", ,none

(Photo: Biplab Paul/ Naireeta Services)

Natural and environmental crises do not happen suddenly; they are usually indicators of long-standing socio-economic problems, like overpopulation, poverty or inadequate access to education or employment. The unequal distribution of resources and opportunities is shown to be behind most of the environmental problems we face today, from wildlife-human conflict to groundwater depletion and air pollution. Getting out of this vicious cycle, therefore, requires dealing with the underlying problems first.

In the late 1990s, innovator Biplab Ketan Paul was starting to see these complex connections between natural disasters like droughts and floods on one hand, and the desperate plight of poor farming communities in Gujarat on the other. At the time, farmers, especially those with smaller landholdings, were at the mercy of the rain gods. This landed them in an endless cycle of misery every year. When it rained during monsoons, the fields would quickly flood due to the non-porous soil. And by the time Gujarat’s harsh summer came, there would be no water available in lakes or wells. Even borewells yielded only pitiful amounts of dark, saline water. The resulting crop failures were grinding down farmers and putting them under increasing debt every year.

Fortunately, Paul had (what he thought was) an irresistible proposition for farmers: a technology to channel and store millions of litres of rainwater into underground reservoirs, which farmers could draw water from and use all year round in their fields. It was called Bhungroo, the Gujarati word for a hollow pipe used in kitchens to stoke cooking fires. Paul had developed the solution himself, inspired by traditional rainwater storage systems in rural India.

“With Bhungroo, we could essentially use floods to fight drought and water salinity, using locally available material. It met two objectives: enabling farmers to grow crops all year round, while reducing dependence on borewells that deplete groundwater at alarming levels,” he says.

Initial opposition, and support from unexpected quarters

But if Paul expected local farmers in Gujarat to embrace the idea right away, he was mistaken.

“The farmers were suspicious initially. They called the idea nonsensical, and thought we had our eye on their land or women,” he says. The fact that West Bengal-born Paul was not a native of Gujarat didn’t help gain their trust either.

However, he kept at it, stressing on the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the system. He even told the farmers that if the idea didn’t work, they wouldn’t have to pay him a rupee, but to no avail.

After many rejections, he found someone willing to listen—the womenfolk in the villages he visited. “It was the women who first trusted us, and supported us despite our initial failures,” says Paul.

Advertisement That support enabled Paul’s tiny team to execute the first few projects. To everyone’s collective relief, those initial Bhungroos turned out to be very successful. “Land that wasn’t yielding a single crop started yielding 2-3 crops a year. Within three years of installing the Bhungroo, farmers saw their income growing 250% on average. That money enabled them to pay off their loans, buy livestock, and improve their overall standard of living,” says Paul.

Even more important, Bhungroo’s success justified the trust of the women farmers who stood by Paul in the early days.

Rapid growth, global acclaim

Over the following years, Bhungroo’s successes paved the ground for improved designs, a larger team, and implementation of the technology on a bigger scale.

From one Bhungroo in 2000, Naireeta Services—Bhungroo’s parent company founded by social entrepreneur Trupti Jain—has executed over 4000 projects on the ground. In the ensuing 19 years, Naireeta has built Bhungroos in 12 Indian states and 8 countries including Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ghana and Zimbabwe. Over 1 lakh rural poor have benefited from Bhungroo to date, Paul says.

The original design of the Bhungroo was also refined extensively in the first 15 years. Today, there are 17 main designs, with many variations of each, so that there are over 400 types of Bhungroos available. “Every Bhungroo we have ever built has been customised. We take into account the location, rainfall patterns, the soil type and other parameters, and build a solution that works for a particular landholding,” he says. The capacity of the Bhungroos ranges from 4 lakh to 4 crore litres, and they cost anywhere from Rs 3 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. And from its initial origins as a technology for farmers with small landholdings, today Bhungroo’s clients include agricultural collectives, organisations that manage sports stadiums, and industrial giants.

Now, he has been able to grow banana crop and reverse his circumstances, according to Biplab Paul. (Photo: Biplab Paul/ Naireeta Services)

What hasn’t changed, though, is the company’s focus on below-poverty-line farmers, especially women. Under the Indian government’s National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), Bhungroo is implemented free of cost to farmers in certain regions. Where NRLM is not applicable, the costs are based on the farmers’ ability to pay. All projects are led by women farmers identified by Naireeta, or Self-Help Groups it partners with on the ground, and these women lead the entire process of setting up the Bhungroo on their land, with help from the Naireeta team.

So successful has the technology been, that support and accolades have poured in from all quarters. The Bhungroo team, today led by Ashoka and Fulbright scholars, has been mentored by professors from IIM-Ahmedabad, Stanford, Harvard and INSEAD. The technology also won two UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) Awards for combining women’s leadership with low-cost and sustainable technology.

Today, in addition to Bhungroo, Paul and the Naireeta team are driven by another mission: building climate resilience in rural communities. “The effects of extreme weather can be tackled only if you have informed communities. And in the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi’s principle of ‘Antyodaya’, our goal is to take tools of climate preparedness to the ‘last person’ in the queue,” concludes Paul.","Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.w-x.co/in-bhungroo2_1.jpg,"['today', 'naireeta', 'floods', 'water', 'vicious', 'saved', 'farmers', 'bhungroo', 'poor', 'bhungroos', 'biplab', 'paul', 'women', 'technology', 'lakh', 'droughts', 'rural', 'cycle']", ,Drought

Sai Masu Gida are hoping for maximum concentration in the neighbouring state ahead of their continental qualifier

Ahead of their crucial Caf Champions League tie away to Ghana's Asante Kotoko in Kumasi next weekend, the management of Kano Pillars have announced the club will be returning to Kaduna to prepare for the game.

According to a statement on the Pillars official website, coach Ibrahim Musa’s men will leave Kano for Kaduna on Sunday to proceed into close camping for the game against the Porcupines.

“Players and technical crew, as well as some supporting staff of the team, would leave kano after the club's morning training session on Sunday 18th August 2019,” the statement credited to the club chairman Surajo Yahaya read in part.

“The club would spend three to four days in Kaduna before they move to Abuja where they would fly through Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport to Accra, the capital city of Ghana and then to Kumasi where the second leg would be played.”

Pillars hold a slim 3-2 advantage going into the second leg but the club chairman has advised the team to put the previous result behind them and go all out to get the job done in Kumasi.

“Forget about the 3-2 victory in the first leg and tight your belts to make Kano and Nigeria proud, the club boss added.

A top source speaks to Goal about how late paperwork will deny regular first-team players action against the Porcupines

Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) side, Kano Pillars may not be putting their best foot forward when they begin their quest in the Caf Champions League against Asante Kotoko this weekend.

A top source from the club informed Goal, due to late paperwork, about five first-team players won’t be taking part in the preliminary first-round fixtures.

“Almost four to five first-team players will not be available for the games against Kotoko because they just got their international passports and were not registered for the game,” the club source revealed to Goal.

Even though the identities of the affected players were not revealed, Goal understands David Ebuka, the breakout star of the 2018 Higher Institution Football League (Hifl) will not feature in the two games against Kotoko.

Ebuka was in action for Pillars in their last friendly on Sunday in which the 2019 Federation Cup champions defeated local side Sosso FC 3-0. The young striker got one of the goals in the big win.

Meanwhile, after initially staying in Kaduna to prepare for the crunch tie with Kotoko, Pillars returned to Kano on Monday to round off their preparations for Saturday's tie at the Sani Abacha Stadium.

The winners after the two-legged tie between Pillars and Kotoko are billed to face Hafia FC of Guinea or Tunisian club Etoile du Sahel in the next stage.","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['pillars', 'kotoko', 'miss', 'source', 'tie', 'clash', 'club', 'champions', 'key', 'goal', 'league', 'set', 'kano', 'firstteam', 'players']", ,none

The 20-year-old became the first Englishman to score a goal for the Blues under an English manager since before he was born

Mason Mount scored the first Premier League goal of the Frank Lampard era in putting Chelsea 1-0 up against Leicester City on Sunday evening.

The 20-year-old scored after dispossessing Foxes midfielder Wilfred Ndidi on the edge of the box before slotting past Kasper Schmeichel, despite Ndidi’s desperate attempts to rectify his error.

It was a welcome sight for the Chelsea faithful, after Blues lost their opening game of the season 4-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford.

With his goal, the England Under-21 international became the first English-born player to score a goal for the Blues under an English manager since 1996.

Dennis Wise was the scorer on that occasion with former England manager Glenn Hoddle in the dugout at Stamford Bridge.

Since Hoddle left the club soon after Wise’s goal, three English managers have taken the reins in west London, but all on a temporary basis.

Graham Rix was in charge for two games in 2000, with Ray Wilkins and Steve Holland each managing for one game, in 2009 and 2015 respectively.

Mount, who was born in 1999, achieved another feat not seen in his lifetime.

The academy product is the first English player to score in his first appearance in front of the Chelsea faithful since Paul Hughes in January 1997, according to Opta.

Mount will hope his goal is the first of many, but Hughes only managed one more for the club, and was loaned to Stockport County at the beginning of the next season.

Mount played last season for Lampard too, for Derby County in the Championship while on-loan from Chelsea.

He scored on his debut for the Rams last year and has now done the same on his home debut in the Premier League.

Mount made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford, playing all 90 minutes in a chastening defeat and then came off the bench in the Blues game against Liverpool in the European Super Cup on Wednesday.

He scored his penalty in the shoot-out in that game, after the two teams could not be separated, the game ending 2-2 after extra time.

The Blues lost the shoot-out as fellow youngster Tammy Abraham’s miss from 12 yards handed the trophy to the Mersyside outfit.

And Sunday would prove disappointing for Chelsea as well, with Ndidi making up for his earlier mistake with a second-half equaliser, leaving the Blues to settle for a 1-1 draw.","Sun, 18 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['mason', 'game', 'score', 'blues', 'frank', 'pair', 'english', 'long', 'lampard', 'goal', 'league', 'premier', 'player', 'scored', 'chelsea', 'manager', 'mount']", ,none

A study says indigenous knowledge on how nature flags up extreme weather is also relevant in urban areas to help alert residents

JOHANNESBURG, Aug 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous knowledge about how to spot flood risks ahead of time could save lives in cities, researchers said on Wednesday, as climate change and population growth put millions of people at risk of increasingly unpredictable weather patterns.

Understanding changes in natural indicators - such as plants, birds and temperatures - could be used to alert urban residents to extreme weather where forecasts are seen as unreliable, said a study in the Journal of the British Academy.

""Indigenous knowledge is often overlooked,"" said Caroline Knowles, director of the cities and infrastructure programme at the British Academy, the UK's national body for humanities and social sciences.

""There are knowledge transfers that can be made between rural and peri-urban spaces that could save lives and livelihoods around the world,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

The study interviewed 1,050 people in 21 rural and urban communities in Ghana, including the capital city Accra and the main city of Tamale in its Northern Region.

Researchers documented natural indicators used by indigenous communities to predict floods, droughts and temperature changes.

Those include links between rainfall patterns and ant behaviour, appearances by certain birds, flowering of baobab trees and observations of heat intensity, passed down between generations.

Knowles said not all rural indicators could be transferred to urban spaces, but some are relevant for both environments, such as clouds, heat, insects and trees.

Promoting tree-planting in urban areas could offer further opportunities to apply indigenous knowledge on flora in cities, said study author Raymond Abudu Kasei from Ghana's University for Development Studies.

More than 3 million urban dwellers could be at risk of flooding from extreme rainfall by 2050 as climate change brings more unpredictable weather hazards, the study said.

Extreme heat and power blackouts, alongside food and water shortages, are other threats if climate-changing emissions are not curbed, a 2018 report for the C40 cities network found.

As floods become more sudden and hard to predict, the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in science-based warning systems should be prioritised, researchers said this week.

""We have seen the use of indigenous knowledge for climate adaptation all over the world,"" said Stefan Thorsell, climate advisor at the International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, who was not involved in the study.

""Indigenous people in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Myanmar and Ethiopia, for example, use their knowledge to observe and mitigate impacts of extreme climate events such as flooding and droughts,"" he added.

Dialogue is needed between indigenous groups and climate researchers as ""both can learn from one another"", said the British Academy's Knowles.

Indigenous knowledge can be used as an ""added layer"" to scientific research in designing early warning systems for floods, said Kasei.

More work is needed to document traditional knowledge at risk of being lost as the natural environments in which indigenous peoples live become more threatened by climate-related disasters, the study noted.","Wed, 07 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/metatag/disaster-type/drought.png,"['study', 'world', 'used', 'floods', 'weather', 'extreme', 'rural', 'urban', 'indigenous', 'signs', 'climate', 'warn', 'cities', 'natural', 'knowledge', 'researchers']", ,Flood

As the world population approaches the eight billion mark, it’s becoming clear that we’re impacting the planet in unprecedented ways.

Humans have made such dramatic changes to Earth’s systems, from climate to geology, that many are suggesting we’ve entered into a new epoch – the Anthropocene.

To better understand the challenges of this era of wide-sweeping human impact on the planet, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced a massive report covering land use and climate change.

According to the IPCC, the situation is looking more dire by the year. Below are a few of the key insights buried within the 1,400+ pages of the massive report.

Shifting Global Land Use

The scale of land use and loss of biodiversity are unprecedented in human history.

According to the report, roughly two-thirds of the world’s ice-free land is now devoted to human uses. Ecosystems, both forested and unforested, only account for about 16% of land today. Part of the reason for this dwindling supply of natural habitat is the rapid increase of agricultural activity around the world.

Since the dawn of the 20th century, global land use has shifted dramatically:

Not only has land use changed, but so has farming itself. In many parts of the world, increased yields will primarily come from existing agricultural land. For example, wheat yields are projected to increase 11% by the year 2026, despite the growing area only increasing by 1.8%. Rice production exhibits a similar trend, with 93% of the projected increase expected to come from increased yields rather than from area expansion. In some cases, intensive farming practices can degrade soil more than 100x faster than the time it takes for new soil to form, leaving fertilizers to pick up the slack.

One of the most dramatic changes highlighted in the report is the nearly eight-fold increase in the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers since the early 1960s. These types of fertilizers are having serious downstream effects on aquatic ecosystems, in some cases creating “dead zones” such as the one in the Gulf of Mexico.

In addition to the negative impacts outlined above, the simple act of feeding ourselves also accounts for one-third of our global greenhouse gas footprint.

Things are Heating Up

The past half-decade is likely to become the warmest five-year stretch in recorded history, underscoring the rapid pace of climate change. On a global scale, even a small increase in temperature can have a big impact on climate and our ecosystems.

For example, air can hold approximately 7% more moisture for every 1ºC increase, leading to an uptick in extreme rainfall events. These events can trigger landslides, increase the rate of soil erosion, and damage crops – just one example of how climate change can cause a chain reaction.

For the billions of people who live in “drylands”, climate change is serving up a completely different scenario:

“Heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity and duration in most parts of the world and drought frequency and intensity is projected to increase in some regions that are already drought prone.”

— IPCC report on Climate Change and Land, 2019

This is particularly worrisome as 90% of people in these arid or semiarid regions live in developing economies that are still very reliant on agriculture.

In addition to water scarcity, the IPCC has identified a number of other categories, including soil erosion and permafrost degradation. In all seven categories, our current global temperature puts us firmly in the moderate to high risk zone. These risks predict events with widespread societal impact, such as regional “food shocks” and millions of additional people exposed to wildfires.

This IPCC report makes one thing clear. In addition to tackling emissions in our cities and transportation networks, we’ll need to substantially change the way we use our land and rethink our entire agricultural system if we’re serious about mitigating the impact of climate change.","Fri, 09 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/climate-report-charts-prev.png,"['global', 'charts', 'change', 'report', 'soil', 'projected', 'climate', 'land', 'ipcc', 'increase', 'impact']", ,Drought

As the world begins to wake up to this crisis, there is a lot of talk about solutions. It is good to see more people talking about the need for urgent action.

But far too many, including those in Africa, overlook two essential ingredients: nature and youth. This duo cannot be ignored in the search for solutions to our planetary crises.

In my home country of Kenya, there is simply no way we can achieve our national target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 without addressing deforestation and land degradation—which remain the largest source of emissions here.

Deforestation has long been a problem. When Kenya gained independence in 1963, 10% of the country was covered in forest. By 2009, this number had dropped to 6% as a result of charcoal and timber production, agriculture expansion, unregulated logging and urbanisation. Not only has this increased our contribution to climate change, it has had a number of other devastating impacts, including soil erosion, increased flooding and dramatically reduced availability of fresh water during droughts.

Water towers under threat

Kenya’s five montane forests — called “water towers” because of their ability to store water during the rainy season and release it slowly during dry periods — provide 75% of our fresh water supplies.

The United Nations Environment Programme estimated that between 2000 and 2010 more than 28,000 hectares of forest was lost from these water towers, “leading to reduced water availability of approximately 62 million cubic metres per year”. The resulting costs to our economy far exceeded the financial gains from forestry and logging during that same period by a ratio of four to one.

Nearly a decade ago, the government at the time began to wake up to the problem and made a constitutional commitment to replenish the country’s forests back to 10% of surface area by 2030, which is equivalent to more than 1.6 million hectares of reforestation. Sadly, though, initial efforts were hampered by illegal logging, land disputes, and political infighting.

The good news is there are signs of progress, including new government-led initiatives. For example, the government has moved forward its deadline for the 10% target to 2022 and has created an enabling a legal framework to achieve it. On top of that, it has committed to restoring 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested landscapes by 2030 as its contribution to the African Forest and Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), a pan-African, country-led effort to restore 100 million hectares of deforested and degraded landscapes.

But the simple fact is that we are not making nearly enough concrete progress given the massive scale and urgency of the threat. Yes, the challenges Kenya is facing on this front are very real. For example, the government has estimated the total cost of implementing the 2022 target to be around $430 million over four years, requiring a mix of public and private financing that has not yet emerged. And access to a sustainable supply of high-quality tree seedlings is also proving problematic seeing as the effort is estimated to require 1.8 billion of them.

But there is no time for excuses; we need to dramatically pick up the pace of our efforts. While there is no single solution, one way to take immediate action is by mobilising our young people to become champions for nature. This certainly isn’t a new idea and there have been youth climate groups in Kenya and the region doing great work for a number of years.

However, 2019 has seen the rise of a global youth movement for climate action on a scale never seen before; and this movement has spread to Africa, which has the youngest population in the world. The scale, energy and momentum of this movement creates new opportunities that simply didn’t exist before.

This growing movement of young people are passionate about their futures, motivated and eager to learn. We have the energy and the drive to take action. But, in most cases, we don’t have the information or the know how. That’s why any serious effort to harness the power of this youth movement and transform it into a force for change must begin with education, both as part of formal school curriculums, as well as through initiatives like Youth4Nature. In order for youth to be stewards of nature-based solutions in climate action, we need spaces and resources to strengthen our understanding of what they are and how youth can get involved.

For example, we need to scale up projects like Green Treasures Farms, a Kenyan youth initiative that teaches women and young people in rural Kenya organic farming skills and how and where to plant trees. The project has been running for five years and has had a real impact on local communities by teaching them how environmental concerns and sustainable agriculture go hand-in-hand.

Broadly speaking, there are a number of ways that young people can help make a real impact. On the one hand, we can use our power as advocates within our families, schools, and communities to educate and empower others. And on the other, we can hold our political leaders to account. We must ensure that our leaders continue to push for more action to protect and restore nature. The global climate strike being planned for September 20 offers a good opportunity to send a clear signal of our intent to political leaders.

Time is running out.

We can’t afford to turn our backs on any solution to the climate crisis. And this isn’t just about what we can do in Kenya, or in Africa for that matter.

Nature-based solutions have the capacity to provide roughly 30% of the solution to climate change around the globe. But to achieve this potential, the global community has to step-up support for nature-based solutions. And this includes giving young people the education, support and resources they need to lead initiatives that protect nature and help communities develop and prosper in a sustainable manner.","Mon, 12 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2019/08/Webp.net-resizeimage-80.jpg,"['need', 'act', 'water', 'forests', 'solutions', 'lost', 'climate', 'young', 'nearly', 'million', 'kenya', 'movement', 'africa', 'youth', 'half']", ,Drought
22,22,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Missed Expectations and Disorder: The Dilemma of Political Response to Disasters - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/missed-expectations-and-disorder-dilemma-political-response-disasters,"Natural disasters — such as hurricanes, floods, and tsunamis — are often used as an impetus for massive policy shifts and redistribution of state resources. Often, sudden changes of government expenditure may contribute to public frustration, particularly when a state’s response to an emergency is seen as ineffective. Indeed, a commonly cited cause for public protest activity is poor state response to natural disasters. However, analysis demonstrates that even far-reaching political responses to natural disasters often provoke violent demonstrations, indicating that promises made during high-level visits in affected areas raise expectations among natural disaster victims. If those expectations are not then met, discontent can trigger episodes of riots and protest – regardless of the rapidity or quality of the response. Thus, ‘band-aid’ policy fixes are not enough to reduce riot and protest events in the aftermath of natural disasters: consistently inclusive and sustainable policies are required to effectively reduce those events.

This thesis is suggested by a larger qualitative comparative analysis study (Plänitz, forthcoming) which examines the level of demonstration events following 26 cases of flooding across the African continent: while ten of these disasters were followed by high levels of protest and riot events, the others were not (see map). In an attempt to examine these differences, a set of conditions and models are tested (see Plänitz, forthcoming for more information). The results suggest that in the ten cases with significant post-flood riot and protest events, high-level state institutions were quick to respond and pledge support. In cases without significant demonstration events, the response was considered more reserved, and high-level officials refrained from making financial pledges. Contrary to popular belief, the study suggests that prompt and substantial policy responses to flooding and other natural disasters may in fact provoke increased political disorder if not followed by action.

Flooding in the Ghanaian capital of Accra serves as a prime example of this phenomenon. The city experiences yearly flooding, leading to several affected communities within the metropolis. ACLED data and climate information gathered from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the African Drought and Flood Monitor indicate levels of riot and protest events in Accra trend higher in times of abundant rainfall _(see graph below). _This phenomenon can be observed for the summers of 2014 and 2017, where above-average levels of public unrest occurred in the form of demonstration events during periods of high precipitation, even absent flooding. Figures on rainfall are given as 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is one of the most common climatological precipitation indices for the identification of precipitation surpluses and deficits. It serves to evaluate and characterize the precipitation ratios of a month, quarter or half-year in relation to the respective normal values. However, precipitation levels and even natural disasters do not result in increased protest and riot events. People do not protest natural disasters; they march to express their discontent with policies and actions taken by state institutions around the event.

Therefore, in examining the relationship between natural disasters and demonstration levels, policy responses – rather than the flooding itself – must be examined. Differences are evident when examining demonstration levels surrounding two floods in Accra – one of which is linked to increased demonstration levels, and one which is not. While in the case of the 2011 flood, administrative responses did not lead to civic unrest, there were higher-than-average levels of protest events in the aftermath of the Accra flood of 2015.

Due to heavy rain, large parts of Greater Accra and Eastern parts of Ghana suffered inundation in October 2011. Within Greater Accra, floods impacted residential and low-income neighborhoods from the East (e.g. Tema, Osu Klottey) to the West (e.g. Ablekuma) (NADMO, 2011). According to figures published by National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO), a total of 43,098 people were directly affected by flooding in the capital region in 2011(NADMO, 2011). In an effort to prevent future flooding, the national government made an appeal to the international community to refurbish Accra’s storm drains (Government of Ghana, 2011). President Mills visited flooded parts of Accra but refrained from making concrete statements on state support or relief funds. In the aftermath of the flooding, no incidents of riots and protest were reported to have occurred (see graph above).

Almost four years later, a period of rain in June 2015 submerged parts of Greater Accra near the Odaw drain (see map below). Among those badly hit areas that are marked on the map (see map below) were Kaneshie, Circle and Old Fadama (IRIN, 2015_; _UNCT, 2015). The Red Cross estimated that up to 46,370 people were affected in some way (IFRC, 2015). According to the Inter-Agency Working Group for Emergencies, 9,255 were displaced (IFRC, 2015) and 175 people were killed when a gas station, submerged in the flood waters, detonated. As a response to the flood, President Mahama promised 60 million Ghana Cedi (about 11 million USD) for relief operations and repair of infrastructure for flood prevention (Graphic, 2018). Later in June, a demolition exercise in Old Fadama initiated by the Accra city authorities to remove structures in flood-prone areas sparked clashes between police and demonstrators. Many of the residents did not receive financial compensation and were confronted with the decision taken by the administration. On June 22, riot police used tear gas and arrested 20 people (see graph above) in Accra.

The two episodes of flooding led to displacements and devastated communities in Accra but are different in a critical point – the nature of the political response. While many conditions in 2011 and 2015 were comparable – such as the presence of youth, political representation, or socio-economic inequality – it was the political response that differed. In 2011, President Mills avoided mentioning relief funds or concrete amounts of money dispersed to victims. During his tour to affected neighborhoods, President Mahama in 2016 promised 60 million Ghana Cedi and raised expectations among the affected citizens. This case study is one of 24 outlined in the larger research project (Plänitz, forthcoming), suggesting that protest and riots seem to channel anger resulting from missed expectations and discontent that were seeded by presidential visits and their unfulfilled promises. While it is certainly positive for administrative government to provide rapid and effective relief to communities victimized by natural disasters, the work does not stop there: the only real solution to prevent discontent, especially in the form of violent rioting, is administrative follow-through. Once promises are not transformed into a sustainable policy that improves the livelihoods of affected citizens, or once decisions around post-flood policy are neither based on inclusive processes nor designed in cooperation with local communities, the risk of protest and riot events prevails.","Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1345674-acleddata.com-Missed%20Expectations%20and%20Disorder%20The%20Dilemma%20of%20Political%20Response%20to%20Disasters.png?itok=PwE_Xkw7,"['dilemma', 'world', 'political', 'disorder', 'missed', 'events', 'expectations', 'riot', 'response', 'accra', 'natural', 'levels', 'protest', 'flooding', 'precipitation', 'disasters']", ,Flood

The Buccaneers boss believes the standards set by the management will enable his troops to lift trophies this season

Orlando Pirates coach Milutin Sredojevic believes the club’s solid leadership will pave the way to securing trophies ahead of the new 2019/20 Premier Soccer League (PSL) season.

The Serbian boss is yet to lift a trophy since taking over the coaching reigns at Mayfair two seasons ago, but he is confident his troops will finally bring a smile to their supporters.

“When I turn behind, there are things that are called trophies and there are some that are invisible and will leave a legacy even when I vacate my post from this great club,” Sredojevic said as quoted by Independent Media .

The Sea Robbers narrowly missed out on lifting the Telkom Knockout Cup title last season, where they marched to the final but lost to eventual champions Baroka FC on penalties.

“We are not thinking about anything that’s left behind, but we are fully thinking about the season that’s in front of us,” he added.

In addition, the former Uganda national team boss has been praised for reviving Pirates since taking over two seasons ago and helped the club to finish as runners-up to reigning PSL champions Mamelodi Sundowns.

After winning the CBL Cup by beating rivals Kaizer Chiefs last weekend, the Soweto giants are expected to challenge for trophies whilst looking to dethrone the Brazilians as PSL title holders.

""We have a leadership that’s pushing us to reach the criteria and standards, and once we do that, trophies will come,” continued the manager.

“It is there we shall then see what football will repay us with for the sleepless nights and enormous working days.

Pirates will open their 2019/10 PSL campaign against Bloemfontein Celtic on Saturday evening.","Fri, 02 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['troops', 'trophies', 'psl', 'pirates', 'micho', 'title', 'thats', 'thinking', 'drought', 'orlando', 'end', 'trophy', 'vows', 'sredojevic', 'boss']", ,none

The 18-year-old will continue his career at Merkur Spiel-Arena after completing a transfer on Tuesday

German Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Dusseldorf have added a third Ghanaian to their roster with the signing of Kelvin Ofori of Right to Dream Academy fame.

The teenager joins the Flingeraner on a three-year contract after impressing on trial.

He teams up with compatriots Bernard Tekpetey and Nana Ampomah who both sealed moves to the club earlier this summer.

""Fortuna Dusseldorf have contracted offensive player Kelvin Ofori,"" the club announced on their official website on Tuesday.

""The 18-year-old offensive talent from Ghana has signed a contract until 2022 and will hence play with the No. 14 at the back of his jersey.""

Ofori's highlight during his trial period was finding the back of the net in a 2-1 pre-season triumph over Belgian side Anderlecht.

""I am very pleased to have signed my first professional contract with such a traditional club as Fortuna Dusseldorf,"" said the teenager.

""The Bundesliga is one of the best leagues in the world. I want to learn a lot here as a young player and develop myself step by step.

Addressing a joint press conference with President Lourenço, President Akufo-Addo said that the bilateral talks centered on putting ""Ghana-Angola relations on a new level.""

The President said the two leaders had resolved to collaborate on all fronts, including ""working for the eradication of poverty in Africa, the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and for the search for global peace and security to promote sustainable development around the world.""

He said the meeting, also, centered on boosting the political and economic relations, cultural and people-to-people exchanges, as well as co-operation at the multilateral level.

""Our deliberations also centered on driving investment opportunities, domestic and foreign, into our two countries, and the need for enhanced co-operation and partnership in our development efforts. Towards the realization of the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we touched on the need to promote a better world, and addressed global issues relating to the 17 Goals,"" he added.

The President expressed Ghana's appreciation to the Government and people of Angola for the support Ghana received in her bid to host the Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

The two leaders, also, held closed door discussions - the ministerial teams of the two countries held discussions aimed at deepening the bilateral relations between the two countries - exploring in detail, areas of possible co-operation between Ghana and Angola for the mutual benefit of their two peoples.

The discussions also focussed on the areas of education, trade and industry, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture, environment, science and technology, petroleum and hydrocarbon activities, and tourism, were held in an atmosphere of fruitful cordiality.

""As a result, we have agreed to revive and convene the 6th Session of the Permanent Joint Commission for Co-operation between our two countries, within the next two months, to be held in Luanda. The Commission serves as the legal framework for addressing the trade and investment concerns of our two countries,"" President Akufo-Addo noted.

President Akufo-Addo indicated that as Angola and Ghana were united by their common struggle to free their peoples from foreign domination and exploitation, ""so we are united in our determination to win the battle for rapid economic development, by helping to transform our economies from dependence on the production and export of raw materials into value-adding, industrial economies, anchored on the things we make and grow.""

26,26,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ethiopia's tree planting might not help its climate change battle - Quartz Africa,https://qz.com/africa/1679528/ethiopias-tree-planting-might-not-help-its-climate-change-battle/,"Ethiopia is hoping to tackle the effects of climate change by planting more trees, but in doing so, it might inadvertently be creating new environmental problems.

This week, prime minister Abiy Ahmed joined Ethiopians from northern Tigray to the Southern Nations to plant 200 million trees in one day. Schools and government offices were closed to allow students and civil servants to take part in the initiative, and by day’s end, officials announced the country had surpassed its goal and planted over 353 million trees in 12 hours. The previous Guinness World record for tree planting was held by India, where in 2017, volunteers in the country’s Uttar Pradesh planted nearly 50 million trees in one day.

The call to plant more trees is part of Ethiopia’s national “Green Legacy” initiative, which according to the prime minister’s office, aims to tackle deforestation and the effects of climate change by educating Ethiopians on the environment, and planting different “eco-friendly seedlings”. Perhaps more than other countries, severe droughts, food shortages, and flash floods responsible for mass displacements of people has made the effects of climate change especially felt in the East African country.

Planting trees has also been a generally well-regarded method of combating carbon emissions in the environment for some time now. Just last year, a UN climate report suggested planting another billion hectares of forests to help combat climate change worldwide, and by setting out to plant a total of 4 billion seedlings as part of their own green initiative, Ethiopia seems to be following this approach.

The only problem is planting trees across the country might have an opposite effect, and can even threaten some of the country’s ecosystems.

For the initiative to work, trees planted in the country’s different ecological environments need to be tailor made for their location. If the right trees are not planted in the environments for which they are a fit, the “Green Legacy” might be doing more harm than good.

The reason for the concern is that Ethiopia has faced this problem before. Historical afforestation efforts have introduced damaging non-native plant species including the eucalyptus which had a destructive impact on land, caused soil acidity, and destroyed nearby plants because of their speedy growth. Although well-intentioned in their approach, the country’s tree planting efforts seem to overlook previous afforestation issues by encouraging mass plantings to meet a national quota.

In certain grassy ecosystems across the country, planting trees might in fact damage, and push out plant and animal species that prefer open and sunny environments. Researchers in other African nations have found introducing trees to these tropical grassy biomes can cause loss in biodiversity, alter how these ecosystems work, and reduce water supplies in local streams and rivers.

Politically, the Initiative seems to be a net positive for Abiy Ahmed as he faces ongoing struggles in governing the multi-ethnic country. It “increases the political legacy of Abiy as a conservationist government and adds to the positive image he has around the national community,” said Temesgen Deressa, a climate change and development economics lecturer at the George Washington University.

29,29,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Banking Sector Clean-Up Could Cost Gh¢21 Million - Finance Minister - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908010661.html,"The banking sector clean-up, embarked on by the Bank of Ghana (BoG) to save the industry from collapse, could cost the country between three and four billion dollars, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta has said.

This is equivalent to GH¢21 billion using the Bank of Ghana's dollar transaction rate for commercial banks.

Mr Ofori-Atta, who disclosed this in Accra on Monday, when presenting the Mid-Year Fiscal Policy Review and Supplementary Estimate to Parliament, said the country was at a point of ""major fiscal melt down"" when the banking crisis occurred, and the government needed to step in to save the economy from collapse.

The BoG embarked on banking and Specialised Deposit Institution sector clean up two years ago and revoked the licenses of nine universal banks, 347 microfinance companies and 39 microcredit companies.

They include UT Bank, Capital Bank, uniBank, Construction Bank, The Royal Bank, Biege Bank, Sovereign and Construction Bank.

This, according to the BoG, followed massive failures brought about by several years of an unsustainable licensing regime which lowered standards for entry into the banking and SDI sectors.

Mr Ofori-Atta said so far, the government had pumped about GH₵12.125 billion into the banking and SDI industries.

""The government set the Consolidated Bank Ghana Limited and capitalised it with GH₵450 million to ensure that no depositor lost deposits. The government of Ghana has had to issue bonds to the tune of GH₵11.2 billion to cover the cost of the financial sector resolution and protect depositors. The government has provided an amount of GH₵925 million in cash to cover the small depositors of the 386 microfinance institutions, bringing the total cost to GH₵12.125 billion,"" he said.

He said many of the banking and SDI's had denied depositors access to their deposits for a long period of time, creating liquidity challenges in the financial system resulting in a high incidence of credit defaults in the system, indicating that the threats posed to the stability of the financial system and the economy at large were enormous, justifying the bold actions taken by the BoG.

""The government's actions have restored confidence in the banking system. Through the government's interventions, significant deposits held by some 2,655,100 depositors (1,525, 550 bank depositors and 1,129,820 Micro Finance Institutions depositors) have been saved. Over 3,000 jobs have been saved,"" he said.

The minister stressed ""the government has demonstrated its commitment to providing timely relief to depositors whose funds were at risk as a result of the demise banks and SDI's.""

Mr Ofori-Atta said BoG's directive to banks to increase their minimum paid-up capital to GH₵100 million by 31 December 2018 has been successful, and injected fresh capital of GH₵4.2 billion into the banks, adding that the Ghana Amalgamated Trust intervention is expected to lead a strong indigenous Ghanaian presence in the banking sector.

""It is gratifying to note that these regulatory and policy measures undertaken to clean up the financial sector, have already begun to bear fruit,"" he said.

Responding to suggestions that instead of revoking the licenses of the defunct institutions, the BoG should have kept them going somehow, the Mr Ofori-Atta ""the state at which the current administration found the banking and SDI sectors, it was too late to salvage the already comatose financial institutions and intensive and intrusive surgery was required for the many walking dead.""","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['depositors', 'banking', 'gh21', 'financial', 'billion', 'institutions', 'million', 'bank', 'oforiatta', 'finance', 'minister', 'system', 'sector', 'cost', 'cleanup', 'ghana']", ,none

This followed the laying of the first block to signify the commencement of the first phase of the project held at the Tarkoradi Port on Friday.

The first phase will involve the construction of a 600-metre quay wall with pavement alongside it, coupled with dredging besides it from 14 metres to 16 metres deep.

The 475 million dollars project is a joint venture between Ibistek, an indigenous company and the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GHPA) under a concession agreement signed between the two in 2017.

Royal Haskoning DHV is providing the technical advice and support in relation to all aspects of the project which includes the management of all procurement processes for the EPC contract, supporting all the necessary environmental assessment and plans for the project.

Speaking in an interview with the media after the first block laying ceremony Mr Kwame Gyan, Chairman, Ibistek described the commencement of the project as historic as it was the first time in the nation's history that a local company was undertaking a project of this magnitude.

He said it was an indication that local companies were building their capacity to play a major role in the country's development.

""This is the first time the locals are building and operating a deep sea port and we think that the capacity we have developed from project inception through execution shows our capability. Down the road we will end up in the West African sub region,"" he said.

Mr Gyan said: ""We are happy we have all joined hands to witness the casting of the first block for this milestone project. This means a lot for this port of Takoradi, the Western Region and the Republic of Ghana, container numbers will be boosted, employment will be boosted, and revenue will be boosted. The will be cash in the pocket of those who live in this corridor, transit trade will be boosted and Ghana's economy will b e boosted so we are extremely privileged to be part of this,"" he said.

He said phase one of the project which would cost 200 million dollars was expected to be completed in two years.

He said AFC of Nigeria was providing the debt component of the finance and Ibistek was providing the equity.

""This port will be ready with all the facilities of a first class and then we continue from phase two to extend the key length from 600 miters to 1,495 metres so we are in it for the long haul. We know that by the grace of God we will get there,"" he said.

32,32,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Govt Shuts Down Ghana Manganese Company ... for Non-Payment of Taxes - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908070230.html,"The Ghana Manganese Company Limited will from today stop operating following an order by government to cease operations due to non-payment of taxes as well as price and production manipulation between 2010 and 2017.

Among other things, the shutdown was also as a result of the company's failure to comply but rather circumvent the local content policy at the expense of local contractors which are owed millions of Cedis.

Addressing a press conference in Accra yesterday following an audit of the company which commenced in January this year, Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh, said, the ministry was working with the Minerals Commission to institute measures to retrieve the taxes.

""GMCL has not shown strong commitment to value addition in particular. There are also defaults by the company in the payment of annual minerals rights fees in excess of US$4 million. These and several infractions give me no option as the sector minister than to close down the operations of GMCL.""

""The company is therefore instructed to stop all mining exploration and export of minerals effective August 6, 2019. The Ministry together with the Minerals Commission and other relevant stakeholders will immediately commence discussions with Ghana Manganese to resolve this and other outstanding issues in the course of the shutdown,"" he stated.

Explaining further, the minister noted that, based on fair pricing model and verifiable data, government has been short-changed by the company in relation to payment of royalty taxes, and corporate taxes, among others.

He said the company further manipulated sales between 2014 and 2015 in order to stockpile ore prior to adjusting the price downwards by US$0.65 for every dry metric ton unit contrary to section 13 of the mining lease agreement governing the company's operation.

Mr Asomah-Cheremeh said the audit further revealed that the Ghana Manganese Company Limited failed to invest in its mining assets despite a letter by its mother company indicating that it would add that the lack of investment has resulted in major infrastructural deficits with road and railways facing continuous deterioration due to the company's operations.

In January this year, the Ghana Manganese Company Limited was directed to halt its mining operations to enable the government undertake a thorough technical and financial audit of the company's operations.

The audit was to make transparent the operations of the manganese mining company and to determine its operational challenges and capabilities.","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['shuts', 'govt', 'mining', 'company', 'companys', 'audit', 'nonpayment', 'minerals', 'manganese', 'minister', 'operations', 'taxes', 'ghana']", ,none

34,34,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Ghana: Nyanyano Cold Storage Facility Abandoned - AllAfrica.com,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908010664.html,"Nyanyano — A, which was constructed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD) to address post-harvest fish losses, for the people of Nyanyano, a coastal fishing community, near Kasoa in the Central Region, has been.

Investigations by the Ghanaian Times has discovered.

The facility was commissioned in 2015 by the former Minister of the MoFAD, Ms Sherry Ayittey and former District Chief Executive for Gomoa East, Mr Moses Jehu-Appiah.

The Gomoa East District Assembly took custody of the facility on behalf of the chiefs and people as beneficiaries.

A visit to by the Ghanaian Times to the Nyanyano last Thursday, revealed that the facility which is equipped with a cold room, a blast freezer, an ice-maker, a standby generator, an electrical lifter and a cold van, has been left at the mercy of the weather, invaded by rodents and reptiles.

The compound was over grown with weeds.

The rationale for the construction of the cold storage facility, the Ghanaian Times gathered, was that fish losses recorded, especially during bumper harvests were high.

This was because fishermen were not sending ice to sea, hence the facility was to help improve their income during event bumper harvests.

The fishermen would also not be compelled to sell their catch at unattractive prices due to lack of storage facilities.

The facilities would serve as a source of supply of fish for fish mongers in the area as well.

Records available to the Ghanaian Times has it that the Nyanyano fish storage facility was part of seven million euros secured from the Government of Spain for the construction of a total of six storage facilities along fishing coastal communities in the Greater Accra, Central and Western Regions.

The Chief of Nyanyano, Nana Obeng Wiabo V, when contacted, expressed disappointment that the huge investment was not being utilised but abandoned by the fisheries authorities.

He therefore appealed to the sector ministry to revamp the facility and make it operational for an efficient fishing industry at Nyanyano and the Gomoa East District in general.

The Executive Director of the Fisheries Commission at the MoFAD, Mr Arthur Dadzie, in an interview corroborated the Ghanaian Times story and said the sector ministry was exploring various options including a Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreement to have the facility operational.

He said that from the onset some five companies namely, singer Ventures, OA Kranoc Limited, Sekumba Company Limited, Prampram Coldstore Company Limited, and Gabdor Limited, were contracted under a PPP agreement to manage the facilities but the companies according to him, have not been able to meet the conditions in the agreement, including the payment of the monthly fee to the ministry.

Mr Dadzie mentioned the high cost of electricity tariff, which all the managers complained about, also led to the non-functioning of the facilities.

Their services was therefore terminated hence leading to the equipment and the facilities to deteriorate.

He disclosed that the next step was for the ministry to take over the facilities and to collaborate with the respective assemblies to ensure that they are protected and put to use.","Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['abandoned', 'mofad', 'facilities', 'storage', 'cold', 'limited', 'ghanaian', 'fish', 'facility', 'times', 'nyanyano', 'ministry', 'ghana']", ,none

""In the absence of the payment vouchers, we were unable to authenticate the disbursements. We therefore request management to ensure that the schedule officers refund the amount of GH¢347,014 failure of which they would be surcharged.

According to the 2018 report by the AG, it said Regulation 39 of Financial Administration Regulations, 2004 requires that the head of accounts section of a department shall control the disbursements of funds and ensure that transactions are properly authenticated to show that amounts are due and payable and reject any disbursements that do not meet the requirement.

We observed during our review that the above provision was not fully complied with by the Hospital.

Still with the Kokrle Bu Teaching Hospital, the Auditor General has ordered the management to recover the total amount of GH¢54,157 from Mr James Clifford Oblitey, a staff of the Hospital who was given the amount through a sponsorship package as school fees payment to enable him to pursue a course in BIFM Level 2 Diploma in Facility Management at the College of Central London, United Kingdom (UK) from 2 January 2018 to March 2018.

In the report, the AG said: ""We noted that though Mr Oblitey was not successful in securing the UK entry visa, he failed to return the fees granted him by the hospital's management for the course.

""Though it could be argued that the money was paid to the school, we are of the view that under such circumstance refunds are made to applicants net of administrative charges"", the 2018 report added.

38,38,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Increased atmospheric vapor pressure deficit reduces global vegetation growth - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1396,"Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is a critical variable in determining plant photosynthesis. Synthesis of four global climate datasets reveals a sharp increase of VPD after the late 1990s. In response, the vegetation greening trend indicated by a satellite-derived vegetation index (GIMMS3g), which was evident before the late 1990s, was subsequently stalled or reversed. Terrestrial gross primary production derived from two satellite-based models (revised EC-LUE and MODIS) exhibits persistent and widespread decreases after the late 1990s due to increased VPD, which offset the positive CO 2 fertilization effect. Six Earth system models have consistently projected continuous increases of VPD throughout the current century. Our results highlight that the impacts of VPD on vegetation growth should be adequately considered to assess ecosystem responses to future climate conditions.

Changes of VPD are important for terrestrial ecosystem structure and function. Leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates decline when atmospheric VPD increases due to stomatal closure ( 9 ). A recent study highlighted that increases in VPD rather than changes in precipitation substantially influenced vegetation productivity ( 10 ). Increasing VPD notably affects vegetation growth ( 11 – 13 ), forest mortality ( 14 ), and maize yields ( 15 ). In addition, rising VPD greatly limits land evapotranspiration in many biomes by altering the behavior of plant stomata ( 9 ). Given that the global precipitation is projected to remain steady ( 16 ), the changing VPD and soil drying would likely constrain plant carbon uptake and water use in terrestrial ecosystems ( 17 ). However, the large-scale constraints of VPD changes on vegetation growth have not yet been quantified. In this study, we determined the changes in VPD trends through observation-based global climate datasets, and then quantified the impacts of these VPD changes on vegetation growth and productivity, using satellite-based vegetation index [i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and leaf area index (LAI), tree-ring width chronologies, and remotely sensed estimates of gross primary production (GPP).

Vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which describes the difference between the water vapor pressure at saturation and the actual water vapor pressure for a given temperature, is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants ( 1 ). Rising air temperature increases saturated water vapor pressure at a rate of approximately 7%/K according to the Clauius-Clapeyron relationship, which will drive an increase in VPD if the actual atmospheric water vapor content does not increase by exactly the same amount as saturated vapor pressure (SVP). Numerous studies have indicated substantial changes of relative humidity (ratio of actual water vapor pressure to saturated water vapor pressure) not only in continental areas located far from oceanic humidity ( 2 ) but also in humid regions ( 3 ). Although the long-term trend of globally averaged land surface relative humidity remains insignificant ( 4 , 5 ), a sharp decrease has been observed since 2000 ( 6 , 7 ), implying a sharp increase in land surface VPD. However, the causes of changing atmospheric water demand are still unclear ( 8 ).

RESULTS

This study used four observation-based globally gridded climate datasets—CRU (Climatic Research Unit), ERA-Interim, HadISDH, and MERRA (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications) (table S1)—to analyze the long-term trend of VPD over vegetated land. Similar to previous analyses (4, 5, 7), anomalies in all four datasets showed that VPD trends were temporally and spatially heterogeneous over recent decades (Fig. 1). A piecewise linear regression method was used to quantify the change in trends and detect the potential turning point (TP) in each dataset. It was observed that VPD increased slightly before the late 1990s but increased more strongly afterward with 1.66 to 17 times larger trends according to the four datasets (fig. S1). The datasets showed that 53 to 64% of vegetated areas experienced increased VPD trends since the late 1990s (fig. S2). To illustrate the magnitude and spatial variability of VPD change, we calculated the global pattern of the percentage change of annual growing season mean VPD between two periods of 1982–1986 and 2011–2015 (fig. S3A). On average, the annual growing season mean VPD of 2011–2015 was 11.26% higher than that of 1982–1986, and the VPD increased larger than 5% in more than 53% area. In addition, the increases of global mean VPD over 12 months were positively correlated with the mean VPD values of 1982–1986 at more than 64.5% areas (fig. S3B), which implies that the higher VPD increases in the months with high VPD.

Fig. 1 Global mean vapor pressure deficit (VPD) anomalies of vegetated area over the growing season. Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1982–2015 when data from all datasets are available. Vegetation areas were determined using the MODIS land cover product. Blue line and gray area illustrate the mean and SD of VPD simulated by six CMIP5 models under the RCP4.5 scenario.

Apart from HadISDH, datasets showed that the increased saturated water vapor pressure and decreased actual water vapor pressure jointly determined the increases of VPD after the TP. On average, the rate of increase in saturated water vapor was 1.43 to 1.64 times higher after the TP year than before, and the actual water vapor exhibited stalled or decreased trends (fig. S4). Increased air temperature explains the changes in saturated water vapor pressure (fig. S4). The HadISDH dataset indicates a decrease in saturated water vapor because of large spatial gaps in the dataset.

A change of oceanic evaporation is the most important mechanism for the observed decrease in actual water vapor pressure over the land (18). Oceanic evaporation is the most important source of atmosphere water vapor, and approximately 85% of atmospheric water vapor is evaporated from oceans, with the remaining 15% coming from evaporation and transpiration over land (19). Most of the moisture over land is transported from the oceans, which accounts for 35% of precipitation and 55% of evapotranspiration over land (19). We analyzed long-term changes of oceanic evaporation based on a global oceanic evaporation dataset [Objectively Analyzed Air–Sea Fluxes (OAFlux)] (20). The almost 60-year time series showed that the decadal change of global oceanic evaporation (E ocean ) was marked by a distinct transition from an upward to a downward trend around 1998 (Fig. 2A). The global oceanic E ocean has decreased by approximately 2.08 mm year−1, from a peak of 1197 mm year−1 in 1998 to a low 1166 mm year−1 in 2015 (Fig. 2A), and 76% of the sea surface revealed a decreased E ocean after 1999 (Fig. 2B). Rhein et al. (16) reported stalled increases of sea surface temperature after the late 1990s based on multiple global datasets, which substantially limited oceanic evaporation (20). Some studies using global climate models (GCMs) also highlighted that VPD trends over land were predominantly explained by dynamic mechanisms related to moisture supply from oceanic source regions (8, 21). Changes in the recycling of atmospheric moisture over land controlled by soil moisture in supply-limited regions may be an additional contribution to the observed increase of VPD. Koster et al. (22) showed that moisture variability contributed to total precipitation variance in mid-northern latitude regions such as the western United States. Drier soils evaporate less and thus lead to lower water vapor in the atmosphere (23). Previous study reported a decreased trend in the global land evapotranspiration after the late 1990s limited by soil moisture supply (24).

Figure 3 illustrates that the satellite-based NDVI substantially increased from 1982 to 1998 (y = 0.0014x − 1.86, R2 = 0.43, P < 0.05), while NDVI remained constant and then stalled after 1999 (y = −0.0004x + 1.23, R2 = 0.06, P = 0.65) (Fig. 3A). From 1982 to 1998, approximately 84% of the vegetation surface showed an increased NDVI trend (28.50% with a significant increase; Fig. 4A). In comparison, after 1999, the trends of NDVI over many regions reversed, and 59% of vegetation areas showed a pronounced NDVI browning (decreasing) trend (21.50% with a significant decrease; Figs. 3B and 4). Mean NDVI trends for 12 months after 1999 were lower than those from 1982 to 1998 over globally vegetated areas (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we analyzed long-term trends of LAI based on four global LAI datasets [Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), GLOMap, LAI3g, and Terrestrial Climate Data Record (TCDR); table S1] (25). Despite the large variability of the estimated interannual LAI among the four products, all four LAI datasets exhibited a transition from increasing trends before the late 1990s to decreasing trends afterward (fig. S5). The LAI showed a decreasing trend since the late 1990s over vegetated areas of 64.72, 72.62, 62.73, and 80.11% for GLASS, GLOMap, LAI3g, and TCDR datasets, respectively (fig. S6). The differences of NDVI and LAI trends during these two periods are the opposite of VPD trends derived from four VPD datasets.

Partial correlation analysis indicated significant correlations of detrended VPD with detrended NDVI and LAI when the impacts of air temperature, radiation, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration were excluded (Fig. 5). Detrended NDVI over 62% of the vegetated areas shows a negative correlation with detrended VPD (about 14% with a significant negative correlation) (Fig. 5A). Similarly, four detrended satellite-based LAI correlated negatively with detrended VPD over 65 to 70% of vegetated areas (16 to 22% with a significant negative correlation) (Fig. 5, B to E). In addition, all five satellite-based datasets show highly consistent signs of correlation with VPD, and at least three datasets revealed consistently negative correlations with VPD over 72% of vegetated area (Fig. 5F). A machine learning method [i.e., random forest (RF)] was used to reconstruct NDVI based on atmospheric [CO 2 ] concentration and five climate factors (air temperature, precipitation, radiation, wind speed, and VPD) over the last 34 years in each pixel (fig. S7) and then model experiments were applied to separate the impacts of VPD as well as of other variables (see Materials and Methods). Globally, the model experiments suggest that the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, air temperature, and VPD are the most important contributors for the variability of NDVI (fig. S8A). Rising VPD was found to significantly decrease NDVI, indicated by the larger negative NDVI differences from 1999 to 2015, suggesting that substantial increases of VPD strongly limited NDVI (fig. S8B).

Fig. 5 Spatial patterns of correlations between VPD and satellite-based NDVI/LAI. Partial correlations between detrended CRU VPD and detrended satellite-based NDVI/LAI were shown: GIMMS NDVI (A), GLASS LAI (B), GLOBMap LAI (C), LAI3g LAI (D), and TCDR LAI (E) during 1982–2015 (GLOBMap and LAI3g from 1982–2011). The insets in (A) to (E) show the relative frequency (%) distribution of significant negative correlations (Neg*; P < 0.05; dark green), negative correlations (Neg; light green), positive correlations (Pos; light red), and significant positive correlations (Pos*; P < 0.05; dark red). (F) Number of satellite-based NDVI/LAI datasets with the same sign of correlation: e.g., (5, –) indicates that all five satellite-based NDVI/LAI datasets showed negative correlations with VPD.

This study used two satellite-based models [revised eddy covariance–light use efficiency (EC-LUE) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] to investigate the impacts of VPD on long-term changes of global GPP (26, 27). EC-LUE and MODIS showed quite similar long-term trends of GPP, with a significantly increased trend from 1982 to the late 1990s, averaged at 0.73 Pg C year−1 (P < 0.05; from 1982 to 1998) and 0.26 Pg C year−1 (P < 0.05; from 1982 to 1997) over globally vegetated area, respectively (Fig. 6A). The GPP trends then stalled and decreased afterward (−0.016 Pg C year−1, P = 0.67 and −0.032 Pg C year−1, P = 0.44) (Fig. 6A). The GPP trends derived from the two models during the two periods are the opposite of VPD trends derived from the four VPD datasets.

(B) GPP sensitivity to climate variables, NDVI/fPAR, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration. (C) Contributions of climate variables, NDVI/fPAR, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration to GPP changes over the two periods. Three climate variables are included: vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature (T a ), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

To quantify the impacts of VPD on GPP, we further explored GPP sensitivity to climate variables (i.e., air temperature, VPD, and radiation), atmospheric CO 2 concentration, and satellite-based NDVI/fPAR (see Materials and Methods; Fig. 6B). Two satellite-based models showed the similar GPP sensitivity to VPD, whereby global GPP decreased by 13.82 ± 3.12 Pg C and 18.29 ± 3.65 Pg C with a VPD increase of 0.1 kPa (Fig. 6B), which is comparable to the GPP increase with a 100–parts per million (ppm) rise of atmospheric [CO 2 ] (i.e., β CO2 = 19.01 ± 4.01 Pg C 100 ppm−1). On the basis of the estimated GPP sensitivity, we estimated the contributions of climate variables, CO 2 fertilization, and vegetation index to global GPP over the two study periods (table S2). After the late 1990s, VPD increased by 0.0017 ± 0.0001 kPa year−1 according to the CRU dataset (fig. S1), which resulted in GPP decreases of 0.23 ± 0.09 Pg C year−1 and 0.31 ± 0.11 Pg C year−1 according to the EC-LUE and MODIS models, respectively (Fig. 6C and table S2). The VPD-induced GPP decreases partly counteract the CO 2 fertilization effect (0.38 ± 0.08 Pg C year−1) after the late 1990s with the rising rate of atmospheric CO 2 concentration by 2.02 ± 0.01 ppm year−1. From 1982 to the late 1990s, CO 2 fertilization played a dominant role in the GPP increase (Fig. 6C). According to the EC-LUE model, GPP increases of 0.28 ± 0.15 Pg C year−1 occurred because of the rising atmospheric [CO 2 ] (Fig. 6C and table S2).","Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaax1396/F1.large.jpg,"['reduces', 'vegetation', 'global', 'atmospheric', 'gpp', 'water', 'vapor', 'deficit', 'pressure', 'ndvi', 'trends', 'increased', 'fig', 'vpd', 'growth', 'c']", ,none
39,39,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,UEFA Super Cup can serve as next step in Liverpool's untraditional route to Premier League glory - Ghanasoccernet.com,https://ghanasoccernet.com/uefa-super-cup-can-serve-as-next-step-in-liverpools-untraditional-route-to-premier-league-glory,"The Exploding Heads simulate the UEFA Super Cup of Liverpool vs. Chelsea in FIFA 19 style.

ISTANBUL -- Liverpool can win their sixth European trophy this century when they face Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in Turkey on Wednesday, but another continental cup will only draw attention to the ongoing wait to fill the glaring void in the Anfield trophy cabinet.

European glory used to be the pinnacle, but for Liverpool, it has become a stepping stone towards ending the long journey back to the summit of English football.

Some will point out that a third Super Cup, to add to the two Champions League titles and a UEFA Cup (now Europa League) won since the turn of the millennium, would be adding too much weight to the European club's achievements, considering that it is widely regarded as no more important than the Community Shield. But you have to be in it to win it and Liverpool's European pedigree is such that every piece of continental silverware matters.

To put their haul into context, Chelsea have won three European trophies since 2000 (Champions League 1x and Europa League 2x), while Manchester United have won two (Champions League 1x and Europa League 1x).

The rest of Liverpool's domestic rivals have yet to get off the mark in Europe this century, but Manchester City, Arsenal and even Leicester City will point to their names on the Premier League trophy in order to dampen any sense of superiority from the red half of Merseyside.

And as Jurgen Klopp's players prepare to face Chelsea in Istanbul -- the city which hosted Liverpool's momentous 2005 Champions League triumph against AC Milan -- they will face Chelsea knowing that, whatever happens at Besiktas' Vodafone Park, the only trophy that truly matters this season is the one which continues to elude them.

Liverpool's Champions League success in Madrid last season, the club's sixth overall, more than made up for the disappointment of missing out on the Premier League title to Man City at the end of the most compelling title race for 20 years.

-- What's Liverpool's succession plan for Salah, Mane and Firmino

-- Where did you club fail in the transfer window

But it was also unusual for the fact that Liverpool emerged as European champions having gone so long without being crowned kings of their own country. It is now 29 years since Liverpool were champions of England and no Champions League winners have lifted the European Cup having been second best in their own domain for so long.

Sir Alex Ferguson once compared winning the Champions League with Manchester United to scaling a mountain, with key staging posts along the way. Winning a trophy, then winning the title, were crucial milestones for Ferguson's United team on their journey to the Champions League crown in 1999.

Most clubs win the Premier League before the Champions League but Liverpool will be hoping to reverse history and their 29-year drought.

Chelsea took a similar path before lifting the Champions League in 2012, while City now see winning the European Cup as the culmination of their growth since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan's takeover of the club in 2008.

In trophy-winning terms, Liverpool ran before they could walk by lifting the European Cup at the end of last season, bypassing the traditional route to success in the competition.

Since 2000, only two Champions League winners have won the European Cup having failed to win their own domestic league during the five years prior to their success -- Liverpool in 2005 and Liverpool in 2019.

But despite adding to their European haul last season, the desperation for domestic glory remains unquenched and, in many ways, becoming European champions has added to the pressure and expectation for the long wait for the English title to end

Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley always described the English title as Liverpool's ""bread and butter."" Anything else on top of winning the league was viewed as a bonus or embellishment on what really mattered. By that logic, bread and butter has been in short supply at Anfield since 1990, though.

Canvass anyone with a Liverpool affiliation -- player, supporter, owner, manager -- who was in Madrid in June and you would be hard pressed to find anyone who would swap that night, and the European Cup, for the Premier League trophy.

Privately, however, there is a growing determination and desperation to scratch the 30-year itch at Anfield and win the title.And winning the Champions League, with the Super Cup potentially also on the way, only sharpens the focus on winning the one that continues to elude the club.

Klopp has urged everyone at Anfield to forget about the events of last season and concentrate only on what lies ahead. He has told his players to ""stay greedy"" and spoken of the Super Cup as a ""big one"" because of the prestige that comes with getting there in the first place.

But Liverpool need to use their Champions League triumph and Super Cup appearance as steps towards winning the Premier League, rather than regard them as the cherry on top of the cake. For Liverpool, the cake is still to be cooked, but last season showed how close they are to ending the long wait.

Victory in Istanbul, against a Premier League rival, will only consolidate the winning mentality that Klopp aims to develop at Anfield. But until they win the Premier League, there will be a hollow feeling at Anfield, no matter how many European trophies they collect along the way.

41,41,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,New high yielding maize varieties introduced to farmers - Ghana Business News,https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2019/08/11/new-high-yielding-maize-varieties-introduced-to-farmers/,"Share this with more people!

Two high yielding hybrid maize varieties have been introduced to farmers at a field show at Tinkong in the Eastern Region.

The field show, which was organised by the Legacy Crop Improvement Centre (LCIC) , a private foundation seed producing company was attended by seed and crop farmers from all over the country.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Amos Rutherford Azinu, CEO of LCIC said the two maize varieties, Aburo Legon and Abeefo Aburo could yield ten tons per hectare or 88 mini bags per acre.

He said the maize matures in 95 days and are planted two seeds per a hole within the distance of 50 centimetres by 70 centimetres and explained that such high yielding maize varieties were developed to ensure food security and help improve on the incomes of farmers.

Professor (Prof)Pangirayi Tongoona of the West African Centre for Crop Improvement(WACCI) of the University of Ghana , a maize breeder and a member of researchers who developed the maize varieties said the two maize varieties were single cross hybrid maize varieties.

Prof Tongoona said the varieties are not Genetic Modified(GM) products and tastes good when used to produce local dishes like banku, kenkey, akpele and others and could also be used for any industrial production.

He said the issues raised by the farmers and the research team would be taken into consideration in further development of the maize varieties .

Mrs Augusta Nyamadi-Clottey, Executive Secretary of National Seed Trade Association of Ghana[NASTAG] said, the seed trade association is an umbrella body of all players in the seed industry and the association was opened to all for information .

Mr Joseph Amartey , Chief Executive Officer of Victory Farms urged the researchers to consider further improvement of the maize varieties to produce two cobs per a plant.

He also appealed to the researchers to consider making the new maize varieties pest and drought resistant.

She made the remarks during president Hage Geingob's townhall meeting at Ongwediva on Monday.

Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said the first round of distributions, which commenced in Oshana and which will end this month, has already registered 15 367 people as beneficiaries for the programme.

She thus urged Namibians earning a salary to emulate the example set by foreign donors and assist the drought relief programme by voluntarily making a 2% once-off donation from their salaries.

Contributions to the programme by the business sector and international donors now stand at N$104 million.

This is in addition to the government's estimated budget of N$570 million budgeted for the programme, which Kuugongelwa-Amadhila said might not be sufficient to benefit all drought-affected households and farmers.

""Political stability and peace are imperative prerequisite factors that guarantee economic growth and social well-being,"" Oshana governor Elia Irimari said at the start of the meeting. Despite the government's continued support, Irimari appealed to farmers to put in place and implement drought mitigation measures, and also join agricultural insurance schemes.

As our world becomes warmer the chances of climate extremes, such as droughts and floods, become greater.

We can’t control the weather, but we can manage the water. A technique known as managed aquifer recharge, where flood water is captured and injected into aquifers, is already helping the US state of Texas ride out the worst of its weather extremes.

Gentle drizzle is good at recharging aquifers, but heavy rain tends to run across the surface and ultimately ends up back in the sea. Managed aquifer storage diverts and captures some of that flood water, by storing it temporarily at the surface and then injecting it gradually into depleted underlying aquifers.

More than 1,000 such schemes already exist worldwide and now a study in Texas (which has three managed aquifer storage schemes) has demonstrated the potential of this technique.

Weather and river data from the past 50 years suggest that if flood-capture systems were installed on the 10 major rivers discharging into the Gulf of Mexico, Texas could replenish much of its depleted groundwater in just a few years.","Mon, 12 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c0e0f4b96cc162183c9200d06b5fc30bdd09cd/0_7_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4dc3c0203ef5b22c09fd50eda54c68dd,"['texas', 'schemes', 'ride', 'water', 'weather', 'storage', 'captured', 'weatherwatch', 'minute', 'managed', 'aquifer', 'storms', 'rain', 'surface', 'help', 'flood']", ,Flood

The frontman's representative speaks on the player's inability to join a new club so far in the transfer window

Abdul Majeed Waris' representative Yussif Alhassan Chibsah has explained the reason behind the striker's inability to decide his future ahead of the coming season.

Out of Porto's plans for 2019-20 campaign, the 27-year-old is in the search for a new club, having spent the second half of last term on loan at French Ligue 1 fold FC Nantes.

A move away has, however, failed to materialise so far despite reported interest in his services from Nantes and St. Etienne

""Majeed is training with team B,"" Chibsah told as reported by Ghanasoccernet.

""He has a contract until 2022, so another three years.

""We are trying to figure out what the club wants to do with him.

""FC Porto only releases him for €6 million.

""I am trying to unblock the situation, it is not easy.

""He had a good time in France but that amount is driving many people away.""

Last season, Waris made 33 league appearances for Nantes, starting 25 of the matches and scoring five times.

He also netted twice in two matches in the French League Cup.

The Tamale-born player previously played for Swedish side Hacken, Russian club Spartak Moscow, Trabzonspor in Turkey and French outfits Valenciennes and Lorient.

He was undoubtedly the biggest casualty when Ghana announced their final squad for the recent Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, having made the preliminary list.

Napoli’s Jose Callejon is desperate to beat Barcelona when they meet them in the United States this week.

The Partenopei will have two bites at the ferry though, with the pair to face off in Florida and Michigan.

“I want to beat Barcelona,” the former Real Madrid player said.

“It’s a special game for me because of my past. It’s a friendly, but it’s very important for us.

“We’ve played well against both Liverpool and Marseille.”

Napoli have finished runners up in both of the most recent seasons in Serie A, second only to Juventus.

“We want to reach the end of the season with the chance of doing great things,” he explained.

“We want to give it our all and hope we have a great year.”

Serie A appears to be improving of late, with Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival at Juventus increasing interest around the world.

“It’s been behind other leagues for a few years,” the Spaniard said.

“But Italy is getting better.

“With the arrival of Cristiano, something is changing in Serie A.”

47,47,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Zimbabwe: Zim On an Electricity Prayer As Another Drought Looms - AllAfrica - Top Africa News,https://allafrica.com/stories/201908080202.html,"Zimbabwe's power crisis is unlikely to end any time soon amid fears another drought is looming, Energy Minister Fortune Chasi warned this week.

The country's foremost hydro-electric power station, Kariba is likely to shut-down for the first time since it was established in the last 1950s as water levels have hit record lows forcing the country into a crippling 18hr load-shedding schedule.

Chasi told a post-Cabinet media briefing Tuesday that the coming season could present further problems for power generation at Kariba.

""It has been posited that we are looking at possibly another drought, meaning that Kariba will be in sharp focus and that it will become more difficult to generate therefore.

""The situation on power really does not require a comment from me. I think all of us experience the challenges,"" said Chasi.

""The dam is now at 23% full, leaving us with really 3 metres of live water which is water that is usable for generation of power. We continue to pray that we have rains and that if they occur they will be significant enough to improve our capacity to generate power.""

The Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), a US agency has already predicted a crisis is looming in rainfall and food for the 2019/2020 season.

After two weeks shuttling between Harare and Johannesburg, South Africa, Chasi managed to convince the neighbouring country's State power producer Eskom to resume power supplies to the embattled Zesa, tied to a massive US$890 000 per week payment as part of a debt clearance plan to clear an outstanding US$25 million.

This follows a US$15 million payment to the same entity by a local bank.

Although the 400MW may ease the crisis to some extent, the situation has not been made better by Zesa's subdued production at its Hwange, Harare and Munyati stations.

The three power stations are producing 42MW against a possible 60MW.

Kariba Power Station which at full capacity produces 1 039MW, is producing 461MW, leaving a shortfall of 582MW.

The country's electricity demand stands at 1 400MW, according to Energy Ministry statistics.

Only a few of the 47 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) are adding to the national grid.

Chasi, who warned IPPs sitting on licences, is expected to fly to Mozambique for similar talks with Hydro Cabora Bassa (HCB).

He will be negotiating another 400MW deal.","Thu, 08 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png,"['prayer', 'water', 'power', 'really', 'crisis', 'drought', 'countrys', 'zim', 'situation', 'looms', 'station', 'producing', 'zimbabwe', 'electricity', '400mw', 'warned']", ,Drought

51,51,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Climate adaptation: setting the stage for transformation | United Nations Development Programme - UNDP,https://www.undp.org/blogs/climate-adaptation-setting-stage-transformation,"In early August, the World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that July 2019 at least equalled, if not surpassed, the hottest month in recorded history. It followed hard on the heels of the hottest June ever recorded, when heatwaves in Europe reportedly caused 13 deaths.

While this headline perhaps startled some readers, providing clear and brutal evidence on the status of our warming planet, for many who have been dealing with the impacts of climate change for decades, it was no surprise. Chennai in southern India with a population of over nine million is in the midst of city-wide water shortages, after months of poor rain and average temperatures stretching well into the 30Cs.

The world is trying to deal with a dawning reality: after decades of learning about the causes of climate change, we are far from where we need to be to effectively tackle it. But there is room for hope. In the past few months both the United Kingdom and the European Union have pledged to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. The upcoming UN Climate Action Summit in New York City in September and this year’s UN climate talks, the COP25, in Santiago, Chile in December are opportunities for all countries to step up their commitments to the Paris Agreement. There are two ways to do this—through the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are the promises each country makes as part of the agreement—and through National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), which integrate climate change risks into all plans and budgets. These two mechanisms are intertwined, because an NAP will contribute to a country's NDC.

Since 2010, when the the process to formulate and implement NAPs was established under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNDP has been working with developing countries to integrate climate changes risks into development plans. The goal is to ensure that ministries are able to assess the medium and long-term risks of climate change in every decision they make, and, critically, that ministerial budgets take the costs into account. This can range from the costs of adaption strategies, such as research and development and dissemination of drought-resilient crops, or it can be the anticipated costs of detrimental climate-related events, such as floods, or decreases in agricultural yields.

With other UN agencies, UNDP has worked with donors such as the Government of Germany and the Global Environmental Facility in more than 70 countries to understand the NAP process and take stock of their climate change adaptation progress. Priorities have been identified and resources mobilized to address these needs. The Green Climate Fund (GCF), a recently-established source of large-scale climate finance, is allocating up to US$3 million for countries to increase adaptation planning. Thirty of these countries have accessed US$79 million from the GCF, 14 of these with UNDP support.

Finance is a primary concern for all countries. Who is going to pay? It is estimated that 85 to 90 percent of the Paris Agreement goals need to be funded by the private sector, this includes adaptation, which has typically less attractive investment opportunities than mitigation. But the tide on this perception is turning.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cote d’Ivoire, UNDP will help facilitate NAPs that identify opportunities that appeal to the private sector, in particular to address the hesitation of investing in climate change adaptation. This will start with a review of different financial instruments that can create more business-friendly environments. With projects like this, that successfully engage private enterprises, word will spread, more people will get involved, and the mechanisms will be refined and enhanced as activities expand.

In Bhutan, climate change is shifting the country’s monsoon, and rain and water supplies are becoming increasingly unpredictable. UNDP is supporting a NAP process focused on addressing climate risks in the water sector. This project will help make the water pathways resilient to climate change, but it will also act as pilot, to develop and refine methods of assessing the risks faced by certain sectors and infrastructure networks, so that the approach can be applied in other cities and industries.

In light of the latest IPCC report which revealed 23 percent of global emissions between 2007 and 2016 came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use, the need to manage land and resources efficiently and to climate-proof our approaches is paramount. In Armenia the NAP will have a strong focus on agriculture and forestry, and part of the GCF funds are being handled by the Ministry of Nature Protection. The NAP will enable the ministry to train civil servants to better assess and address climate change risks and conduct economic cost analyses.

Adaptation is often the main climate change priority for developing countries. The NAPs are a key piece of this puzzle as we strive to reach the Paris Agreement goals. As we look ahead to the Climate Summit and to COP25, the world will be watching their leaders, to see whether their promises can aggregate to enough action to reverse the dangerous path we are on. Meanwhile, we can take some comfort from knowing that efforts to mainstream climate change risks and adaptation into national plans is happening more effectively, more quickly, and at a larger scale.","Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/blogs/UNDP-Bhutan-2010-landscape_river_46589455694.jpg,"['risks', 'nap', 'naps', 'change', 'undp', 'water', 'stage', 'climate', 'transformation', 'countries', 'plans', 'adaptation', 'setting']", ,none

And to provide a taste of what’s to come in 2022, as well as unveiling the new brand and vision for the Games, a free community festival of sport, culture and food – the Commonwealth Social – will see thousands of residents coming together with Team England athletes, local business and community leaders, and Games representatives, to celebrate the countdown to the Games.

The event includes a series of live performances from regional dance and musical groups and the chance to try Commonwealth cuisine, thanks to local street food traders from Digbeth Dining Club. Budding young sports stars will also be given the opportunity to take part in demonstrations, receiving advice and encouragement from 15 Team England athletes, including five Commonwealth Gold medallists: boxer Galal Yafai, netballer Ama Abgeze, para athlete Katrina Hart and gymnasts Dominick Cunningham and Alice Kinsella.

In 2022 the Games will see 6,500 athletes from 71 different nations flocking to Birmingham and the West Midlands, to rewrite the region’s sporting history but Birmingham 2022 is already proving to be a catalyst for transformation across the West Midlands, attracting new investment and funding, creating jobs and apprenticeships for local people and new opportunities for local businesses, as well as accelerating projects that will ensure the region is ready to host a world-class celebration of elite sport and dynamic and innovative culture.

Ian Reid, Birmingham 2022 chief executive officer, said: “On this day, in three years’ time, millions of people from across the globe will join us in celebrating the opening of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, which is why it will provide a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to truly put this city and vibrant region on the map.

“The idea behind today’s Commonwealth Social event is that we wanted to celebrate this major milestone and to give people an indication of what to expect in three years’ time, when the eyes of the world will be focused on Birmingham and the West Midlands region.

“Just like the Games, sport is at the heart of today’s event, but Birmingham 2022 will also be a showcase for everything that’s great about this region; the culture, the food and, most importantly, the people that live here. We’re creating the Games for everyone and we’re already collaborating with local people to help make that vision a reality.”

The setting for today’s Commonwealth Social, Birmingham’s newly redeveloped Centenary Square, is just a stone’s throw from Arena Birmingham, the venue for gymnastics during the Games and local gymnast, Team England’s Dominick Cunningham, is delighted to be attending today’s festivities.

Dominick said: “It’s so exciting that it’s now three years to go until the Commonwealth Games come to Birmingham, my hometown. Competing for Team England in Australia last year was an amazing experience and to get to do that again in front of a home crowd full of all of my friends and family would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I’m not stopping now, I want that gold for Birmingham!”

With so many people gathering together, today’s Commonwealth Social was identified as the perfect opportunity to introduce the new Birmingham 2022 brand, which was co-created with people from the region through a series of roadshows, workshops, focus groups and conversations held last autumn and winter.

The brand connects key West Midlands destinations – many of which will host events during the Games – bringing their locations together to create a truly unique ‘B’ shaped design.

The new logo has in fact been the subject of speculation in the West Midlands this week, after a series of mysterious tape art installations appeared across the region without explanation, but today it was finally revealed that Birmingham 2022 was behind this artwork, after a giant installation at New Street Station was unveiled this morning.

Birmingham 2022 is already demonstrating its commitment to involving residents across the region in everything they do and its recent research project, Common Ground, has visited communities across the West Midlands, speaking to people about how they think the Games can transform the region and the lives of people that live here.

Local people will also feature in a new advertising campaign, launched today to raise awareness and excitement for the Games. The adverts put local people at the heart of Birmingham 2022 and will be appearing across the city and online.

Commonwealth Games Federation President Dame Louise Martin said: “With three years to go to the Opening Ceremony of the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, the excitement is already palpable.

“Preparations are well underway for the delivery of a spectacular multi-sport event for the people of Birmingham, the West Midlands, England and the Commonwealth.

“Launching the new brand on this special day will also ensure the identity of Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games lasts forever.

“I do hope that everyone who is able will join in the celebrations at the Commonwealth Social in Birmingham’s iconic Centenary Square. Enjoy!”

Nicky Morgan MP, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said:

“With three years to go until Birmingham 2022, this event marks an important milestone in the lead up to what will be a fantastic Games.

“It is great to see people are coming together to celebrate this moment. Harnessing this kind of strong community spirit will help us showcase the best of Birmingham, the West Midlands and our entire country when we welcome our friends from across the Commonwealth to the Games.”

Cllr Ian Ward, Leader of Birmingham City Council, said: “With just three years to go, we are at the point when everything about the Commonwealth Games is becoming much more tangible.

“The council-led projects that are enabling the Games, including the development of the Commonwealth Games Village and refurbishment of the Alexander Stadium, are progressing on budget and on schedule, with activity set to significantly increase in the coming months.

“Enthusiasm and interest in Birmingham 2022 is bubbling and will continue to grow as we get even closer to the staging of the biggest event in the city’s history and the long-term benefits the city and its people will gain in the years to come.”

About the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games

The Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, which will be held from 27 July until 7 August 2022, will be a once in a lifetime opportunity to put the city, the region and its people on the global stage.

The Games is already proving to be a catalyst for transformation across the West Midlands, attracting new investment and funding, creating jobs and apprenticeships for local people and new opportunities for local businesses, as well as accelerating projects that will ensure the region is ready to host a fantastic sports and cultural celebration.

Planned housing and transport schemes have been brought forward and will happen sooner as a result of the Games, with 1,400 new homes being built in Perry Barr. Initially, these will be the Athletes’ Village but are then part of a wider regeneration plan for the whole area.

The Alexander Stadium will also be overhauled, whilst a new Aquatics Centre in Sandwell will be built for the Games.

Birmingham 2022 will be the Games for everyone, bringing people together from across Birmingham and the region, to provide a warm welcome to its millions of visitors during the summer of 2022. Find out more at www.birmingham2022.com

Black Stars midfielder Andre Ayew is one of the richest Ghanaian football stars in the country right now.

Ayew is one player who doesn't like flaunting the expensive assets he has acquired being it his mansions or his powerful cars.

But now, it seems the Swansea City play maker has broken that tradition as he has given a view of his living room.

While not all Malians may be in need of international protection, many from the northern region (Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal, Taoudenni and Menaka), central region (Mopti), some parts of the southern region (Koulikoro, Ségou and Sikasso) and border areas with Niger and Burkina Faso are likely to need asylum.

Persistent violence amongst armed groups and inter-communal clashes continue to affect northern Mali, and have now spread to other regions. Some armed groups affiliated with Coordination des mouvements de l’Azawad (CMA) and the Platform, a loose coalition of militias, have failed to respect the 2015 Peace and Reconciliation in Mali agreement. The conflict has been further escalated by Islamist extremist groups.

The ongoing insecurity has weakened the authority of state institutions in some parts of the country, particularly in the northern and central regions. Civilians, politicians and civil servants and security forces are being targeted and killed. Nearly 200 peacekeepers have been killed since 2013, making it the deadliest peacekeeping operation in the world. People who collaborate with national or international defence forces subsequently find themselves targeted for attack.

Local populations, particularly in the central regions, report widespread human rights violations including summary execution, disappearances, torture and arbitrary arrest. Smugglers and traffickers are able to operate with impunity.

The crisis has had a devastating and disproportionate effect on children. Children are being forcibly recruited by armed groups, kidnapped and killed. More than 285,000 children are being denied an education due to school closures, predominantly in the Mopti region. Girls are being raped and sexually assaulted.

Humanitarian access is severely restricted, creating significant difficulties in providing sufficient access to health, water and sanitation. Drought and desertification in the Sahel have exacerbated the already scarce availability of food.

An estimated 3.4 million Malians are in need of humanitarian assistance, approximately 2.9 million of whom are in areas of the country affected by the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, nearly 140,000 Malian refugees have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries, mainly Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger since 2013.

Within this context, UNHCR urges States to provide access to territory and asylum procedures to people fleeing the conflict in Mali. Nobody from the conflict-affected regions should be forcibly returned to Mali. The remaining parts of the country should not be considered as an appropriate alternative to asylum until such a time that the security, rule of law and human rights situation in Mali has significantly improved.

The Gunners are putting their faith in young players as they look to return to the summit of English football under Unai Emery

""Identifying, recruiting and developing young players is a key part of our strategy.”

Those are the words of Raul Sanllehi, Arsenal’s head of football and the man leading an overhaul at the Emirates aimed at not just restoring the Gunners to the summit of English football, but also putting them back among Europe's elite.

Arsenal are a club known for giving youth a chance. George Graham two’s title-winning teams were built around players who had progressed through the under-age ranks.

The likes of Tony Adams, David Rocastle, Michael Thomas and Paul Merson helped end an 18-year wait for a league championship, in 1989, and then, two seasons later, they were joined by the likes of David Hillier and Kevin Campbell as the Gunners again finished top of the old First Division.

However, during Arsene Wenger's 21-year tenure, Arsenal didn't just rely on local talent. Teenagers were brought in from across the globe and given a platform to turn themselves into world stars.

Nicolas Anelka was the first in a succession of success stories, including Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Wojciech Szczesny.

Those players, along with a British contingent featuring Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott, were the bedrock of Arsenal's famous 'project youth', the period which followed the move from Highbury to the Emirates, which left Arsenal financially hamstrung by construction costs.

It was a period that promised plenty but ultimately failed to deliver any silverware. They went close more than once, but that only strengthened the belief among many critics that Arsenal were hindered by a lack of experience.

Between 2005 and 2014, Arsenal failed to win a trophy – a drought that came to an end in the first season after the purse strings were loosened, resulting in the arrival of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid for £42.5 million ($51.7m).

Arsenal have won the FA Cup three times in the last six years, but now they want more. The Gunners have found themselves outside of the top four in the Premier League for each of the past three seasons – which is considered unacceptable by those now running the club.

Sanllehi, a man who is used to winning following his time with Barcelona, is determined to bring the good times back to Arsenal – and he feels young players will help do just that.

Whenever you speak with the Spaniard, it’s never too long before the conversation turns to Barca and the sustained success enjoyed by the Catalans over the past two decades.

Sanllehi believes the bedrock of that success was the club’s famous La Masia academy, which produced a plethora of players with ‘Barcelona DNA'.

Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique, Carles Puyol and Pedro all knew exactly what it meant to play for the Blaugrana, according to Sanllehi, and, consequently, would go that extra yard when needed because of their deep-rooted love for the club.

And that is precisely what he wants to replicate at Arsenal. Sanllehi makes no secret of the fact that he believes that a successful academy will be key if the Gunners are to get back on their perch at the top of the English game.

“We have some great talent coming through our younger age groups and, like all top clubs, the challenge is to help them make the most of their abilities,” he said.

""We need to make sure the academy pathway continues to drive great talent into the first team.”

Right now, the standard of players being produced is as high as it has been for years. Arsenal have pumped money into their academy, spending £40m ($48m) on improving facilities at Hale End and London Colney.

The redevelopment project lasted for nearly two years and Hale End is now unrecognisable, a sporting complex up there with the best on offer anywhere in England.

This project pre-dated Sanllehi’s arrival, with former chief executive Ivan Gazidis driving the plan forward before the new Hale End was completed in 2017.

“We wanted to take the level of the facility to something that was world class and world leading,” Gazidis said. “It’s something that will stand the club in good stead as we look forward.

“We’ve got an ambitious goal. To get to one young player joining our first-team every two years.

“Youth has always been one of the bedrocks of this club and with this investment we’re future proofed for at least the next 10 years.”

This summer, Arsenal promoted four players from the youth team to the senior set-up: Emile Smith Rowe, Joe Willock, Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson.

What's more, both Nelson and Willock started on Sunday, when Arsenal kicked off their new Premier League campaign with a 1-0 win at Newcastle.

With Ainsley Maitland-Niles also in the side, that meant that three of the starting XI at St James’ Park were academy graduates. Two of them, Nelson and Willock, were teenagers and you'd have to go back 21 years to find the last time two English teenagers started a league game for the Gunners.

That’s a hugely encouraging sign and it must be noted that Nketiah would have probably been involved too had Arsenal decided not to send their impressive young forward out on loan to Leeds United on deadline day.

Nketiah, who took just 43 minutes to score on his Leeds debut, will be back next summer. This isn’t a loan with a view to a potential sale.

Indeed, Arsenal are adamant that he will return and join Nelson, Willock and Maitland-Niles in the first-team; that’s why they were so thorough when it came to choosing a destination for Nketiah.

The north London giants have been hurt in the past by sending players out on loan to the wrong club. Serge Gnabry’s ill-fated move to West Brom is still viewed by senior figures at the Emirates as the reason they lost the German star.

Gnabry made just three appearances while at the Hawthorns during the 2015-16 season before returning to north London, with Pulis stating the teenager – who is now starring in the Bundesliga for Bayern Munich – was not at the required level to play.

A disillusioned Gnabry then turned down a new contract at Arsenal in favour of a return to Germany and in the space of just three years has transformed into one of the brightest young stars in the game.

Arsenal are determined to prevent similar situation happening in the future and the way Nketiah’s exit was handled shows how much attention to detail now goes into deciding where their best young players will be sent.

Close to 20 clubs had shown an interest in loaning the striker and those were whittled down to just three: Leeds, Bristol City and Fortuna Dusseldorf.

Representatives of those three clubs were then invited down to London Colney and - as first revealed by the Athletic - asked to produce a presentation detailing exactly why Nketiah should join them and how they planned to use the forward.

Loan manager Ben Knapper, contract negotiator Huss Fahmy and Nketiah himself listened to the presentations and, ultimately, it was decided that a move to Elland Road would be best for the 19-year-old.

It was the first time that Arsenal used this process to select a club for a young player and is another sign of the importance the Gunners now place on the loan market in terms of developing talent.

But it’s not just academy players that are the heart of the work being done in a bid to bring the good times back to London’s most decorated club.

A look at the recruitment that has taken place since the end of the 2017-18 season shows that youth is now viewed as the way forward.

In the summer of 2018, Matteo Guendouzi arrived as a teenager from France and 22-year-old Lucas Torreira was signed from Sampdoria.

This year, Nicolas Pepe, 24, was signed for a club-record £72m ($87.5m) fee, while 22-year-old left-back Kieran Tierney was bought from Celtic and 18-year-old forward Gabriel Martinelli arrived from Brazil.

William Saliba, aged just 18, also joined from Saint Etienne for £27m ($32.8m), but he will spend this season back on loan with the Ligue 1 outfit before linking up with Unai Emery’s squad on a permanent basis next summer.

With Tierney, Saliba, Rob Holding and Hector Bellerin, Arsenal have a potential back four that could remain in place for years.

However, Arsenal are aware that youngsters need to time to settle, which is why the likes of David Luiz and Sokratis – both now in their 30s – have also been brought in to share the workload and provide much needed experience, both on the pitch and in the changing room.

The clever recruitment in recent seasons, combined with the investment in the academy, has seen Arsenal amass an army of hugely talented young players that is generating plenty of excitement behind the scenes at the Emirates.

Nelson, Willock, Guendouzi and Maitland-Niles are leading the way, but scratch beneath the surface a little and you have teenagers such as Bukayo Saka, Tyreece John-Jules and Folarin Balogun, who are all expected to become first-team players in the coming years.

Of course, while the conveyor belt of talent at Hale End is producing some of the best youngsters in England, the challenge now is ensuring they all get the opportunity to fulfil their potential at Arsenal.

With that in mind a ‘transition team’ was set-up in the summer, which saw Freddie Ljungberg – last season’s Under-23s boss – promoted to the senior coaching set-up.

“The transition from Under-23 to first team is massive,” said Sanllehi. “It’s a specifically English issue as we don’t have B teams playing at a high level, which our European competitors have.

“So, we need to make careful choices around who stays with the Under-23s, who trains with the first team and who goes on loan.

“The transition team will be responsible for managing development plans for each and every player to best optimise their potential.”

Ljungberg’s arrival has already seen the likes of Robbie Burton given a chance during the summer, with the 19-year-old midfielder making a big impression during the tour to the United States.

“Freddie is helping us with the young players because he knows better than us every young player,” admitted Emery.

“For example, I didn’t know Robbie. Freddie said to me he’s a good player with the capacity to play as a six or an eight. Really, he helped us like we needed.”

Whether Burton goes on to make his mark with the first-team remains to be seen, but his performances in the States were another sign that the work being done to get the best out of Arsenal’s young talent is already bearing fruit.

The original ‘project youth’ may have ultimately flattered to deceive in north London, but there are signs that the updated version could go on to bring success that Sanllehi, Emery and the fanbase crave.","Fri, 16 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['pepe', 'tierney', 'nelson', 'arsenal', 'inside', 'arsenals', 'academy', 'creation', 'willock', 'team', 'gunners', 'young', 'best', 'end', 'players', 'youth']", ,none

The 32-year-old, who is a free agent following his release by the Irons this summer, will move to Anfield to replace the departed Simon Mignolet

Liverpool are set to sign former West Ham goalkeeper Adrian on a free transfer, Goal can confirm.

The Reds have moved quickly to bring in the Spaniard following Simon Mignolet’s £8.2million ($10m) switch to Club Brugge.

Adrian had been in talks with Real Valladolid after leaving the Hammers in June, but will now move to Merseyside to be the understudy to Reds No.1 Alisson.

He arrives with plenty of experience, having spent six years in the Premier League with West Ham, where he made exactly 150 appearances in all competitions.

He will become the third signing of a low-key summer at Anfield, following the arrivals of teenage duo Sepp van den Berg and Harvey Elliott.

Liverpool considered other options, including Southampton’s Alex McCarthy who they looked at and turned down the chance to sign Jack Butland from Stoke City.

Andy Lonergan, who has trained with Jurgen Klopp’s squad during pre-season, will not be offered a permanent contract despite impressing staff with his attitude and professionalism.

Instead they have opted for Adrian, whom Goal revealed they were keen on in May, with the 32-year-old set to secure his move ahead of the new Premier League campaign.

Mignolet completed his switch to Brugge on Sunday, flying to Belgium immediately after the Community Shield defeat to Manchester City on penalties at Wembley.

The 31-year-old made 204 appearances for the Reds after arriving from Sunderland in 2013, but featured only twice last term as Alisson established himself firmly as No.1 and requested to leave should a suitable offer be received.

Liverpool will receive an initial fee of £6.4m for the Belgian, with an additional £1.8m potentially due in add-ons. Mignolet has signed a five-year contract, and will go straight into Brugge’s squad for their Champions League qualifier with Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday.

As for Adrian, he will be on the bench when Liverpool begin their Premier League season against Norwich at Anfield on Friday.

Liverpool’s goalkeeping options have been hit by injury this summer, with youngsters Caiomhin Kelleher and Viteszlav Jaros both missing the bulk of pre-season, although both are expected back in full training by the end of the month.

Liverpool will welcome back Sadio Mane to full training at Melwood on Monday, while they will also monitor the fitness of James Milner, who missed the Community Shield due to a tight muscle.","Mon, 05 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['premier', 'goalkeeper', 'west', 'transfer', 'sign', 'reds', 'liverpool', 'adrian', 'anfield', 'mignolet', 'training', 'following', 'simon', 'set', 'league', 'ham', 'summer', 'replace']", ,none

However, frequent gastrointestinal side effects through an unknown mechanism limit its use. We have found that consumption of MMF alters the composition of the gut microbiota, selecting for bacteria expressing the enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS) and leading to an up-regulation of GUS activity in the gut of mice and symptomatic humans. In the mouse, vancomycin eliminated GUS-expressing bacteria and prevented MMF-induced weight loss and colonic inflammation. Our work provides a mechanism for the toxicity associated with MMF and a future direction for the development of therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION Suppression of the immune system is essential after transplantation and is commonly used for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases. One of the most widely used immunosuppressive drugs is mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (1). MMF has important advantages over other drugs (2), but, while effective in enhancing survival, frequent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects can lead to dose reduction or discontinuation, actions linked to increased risk of rejection and patient death after solid organ transplantation (3–5). The xenobiotic metabolism of MMF within humans has been well characterized (fig. S1) (6). MMF is hydrolyzed to active mycophenolic acid (MPA) and then inactivated by hepatic uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzymes to create glucuronidated MPA (MPAG) and a small amount of acyl-MPAG (AcMPAG). Enteric-coated MMF and intravenous MMF are also rapidly converted to MPA and subsequently glucuronidated in the liver. MPAG and AcMPAG are excreted primarily in the urine, but ~10% is transported by the ATP (adenosine triphosphate)–binding cassette subfamily C member 2 (ABCC2) protein into the GI tract where bacteria expressing the enzyme β-glucuronidase (GUS) remove the glucuronic acid (GA) moiety to produce free MPA and GA (7). The resulting GA is available as a carbon source for bacterial metabolism, and the MPA undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. The gut microbiota, referring to all the microorganisms in this niche, and its associated metagenome (microbiome) influence diverse aspects of human physiology, and changes in its composition affect human health (8). The mechanism(s) contributing to MMF-related GI toxicity have yet to be fully characterized, but we have shown that hematochezia and colonic inflammation in a pediatric heart transplant patient taking MMF was associated with a shift in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and that mice consuming MMF develop weight loss, colonic inflammation, and changes in their gut microbiota (9, 10). In our patient, toxicity resolved only after the discontinuation of MMF, but in our mouse model, MMF-induced GI toxicity was reversed or prevented by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and was absent in germ-free animals. These observations suggest that MMF toxicity requires an intact gut microbiota. In the current study, we sought to further investigate the role of gut bacteria in MMF-induced GI toxicity using our mouse model. We hypothesized that MMF toxicity would be associated with alterations in the composition and function of the microbiome. We identified the ability of a single antibiotic, vancomycin, to both prevent and reverse the pathophysiological effects induced by MMF consumption, and we characterized the impact of vancomycin on the gut microbiome. We then explored the activity of gut bacterial GUS enzymes in the presence of MMF and vancomycin and examined the impact of vancomycin on MPAG catabolism. Our data suggest that the introduction of MMF alters the composition of the gut microbiota by selecting for GUS-expressing bacteria. Increased GUS expression and activity lead to increased concentrations of MPA in the colon, which is associated with colonic inflammation and weight loss. Human data suggest that increased stool GUS activity can be associated with MMF-related toxicity. Vancomycin eliminated the GUS-expressing bacteria and prevented MMF-induced weight loss and colonic inflammation without reducing therapeutic levels of MPA in the blood. This work demonstrates a mechanism for MMF-induced GI toxicity and suggests a potential clinical intervention. The interaction between MPA and the gut microbiome provides further insight into the substantial problem of drug intolerance and adverse drug reactions driven by microbial metabolism and may also represent a paradigm for how the metabolism of xenobiotics can create local GI pathology.

RESULTS Vancomycin is sufficient to prevent and reverse MMF-induced weight loss Using an established mouse model of MMF exposure, we found that vancomycin alone, when administered concurrently with MMF, prevented the weight loss caused by MMF treatment (fig. S2). The weight of vancomycin-treated animals did not differ significantly from that of control, untreated animals after 8 days of MMF exposure (103.2 ± 0.68% versus 98.84 ± 0.82%, P = 0.41). Vancomycin was also able to reverse MMF-induced weight loss even with continued exposure to MMF. As seen previously, MMF caused significant weight loss with animals weighing 75.02 ± 1.5% of their initial weight after 8 days, but in the subsequent 8 days after the introduction of vancomycin, animal weights improved significantly with recovery back to 93.82 ± 1.2% of their initial weight (Fig. 1A). Although animals exposed to MMF and vancomycin were still significantly smaller than control, untreated animals (105.7 ± 1.5%, P = 0.003), they were significantly heavier than animals that continued to be exposed to MMF (69.26 ± 0.93%, P = 0.014). Consistent with the improvement in body weight, vancomycin also improved colon length and restored weight of the cecum, liver, and spleen. However, hematocrit remained significantly reduced (fig. S3). Whole colonic tissue homogenates were used to assess changes in the cytokine and chemokine profile of treated mice. Mice consuming both MMF and vancomycin demonstrated significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the levels of KC (keratinocyte chemoattractant, CXCL1), G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), IL-6 (interleukin-6), MIP-2 (macrophage inflammatory protein 2), LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor–α), and M-CSF (macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and significant increases (P < 0.05) in IL-2, RANTES, MIG, and IP-10 (Fig. 1B and fig. S4). In addition to vancomycin, the effects of individual neomycin, ampicillin, and metronidazole were tested for their ability to reverse MMF-induced weight loss (fig. S2). Metronidazole treatment actually exacerbated the MMF-induced weight loss, and ampicillin and neomycin were less reproducibly effective than vancomycin in preventing MMF-induced weight loss. Fig. 1 Effect of vancomycin on mouse body weight and colonic inflammation. (A) Vancomycin was sufficient to reverse MMF-induced weight loss even in the continued presence of MMF. Data represent two separate experiments with four to nine animals for each group and are expressed as means and SD for each time point. (B) Vancomycin induced significant changes (*P < 0.1) in multiple colonic cytokines and chemokines. Each column represents an individual animal. Vancomycin abolishes GUS-producing gut bacteria Using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicon sequencing, we found vancomycin to have broad effects on the composition of the gut microbiota. After 2 days of vancomycin treatment (day 10), the gut microbiome of mice treated with both MMF and vancomycin was significantly (P < 0.05) distinct from the MMF-only group with regard to β-diversity as measured using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and continued to separate from the MMF group over time (fig. S5). After treatment with vancomycin, the α-diversity of the gut microbiome decreased significantly as measured by observed species (277 versus 549, P = 2.8 × 10−4), the Shannon diversity index (1.42 versus 3.83, P < 1.0 × 10−7), and the Simpson’s diversity index (0.59 versus 0.92, P = 8.0 × 10−4) after only 2 days of antibiotic exposure. The Shannon and Simpson’s diversity indices both continued to be significantly lower in the MMF- and vancomycin-treated group for the following 6 days (fig. S5). At the class level, dominant bacteria included Clostridia, Bacteroidia, and Bacilli during the initial 8 days of MMF treatment (Fig. 2A and fig. S6A). Continued MMF exposure led to an expansion of Gammaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichia, and, to a lesser extent, Deltaproteobacteria. After the addition of vancomycin on day 8, the Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia taxa were severely diminished, while Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria flourished. By day 16, after 8 days of combined vancomycin and MMF exposure, the bacterial community was composed almost entirely of class Bacilli, with only a small proportion of Gammaproteobacteria remaining as the next predominant class. The classes Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria were significantly increased (P < 0.05) after the addition of vancomycin (fig. S6A). Considering the differentially depleted classes (Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia present in the MMF-treated animals but eliminated by vancomycin), the genera that were both significantly differentially affected by vancomycin and in relatively high abundance in animals after 8 days of MMF treatment were Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Roseburia, and Turicibacter (fig. S6B). We generated species-level resolution for Bacteroides including Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and Bacteroides nordii, all of which were detectable in the presence of MMF but rapidly eliminated by vancomycin (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2 Vancomycin-induced changes in the gut microbiome. Amplicon sequencing of DNA extracted from mouse fecal pellets was used to determine bacterial composition. (A) Stacked bar plots showing relative abundance of bacterial classes in the presence of MMF with and without vancomycin. Vancomycin decreased overall diversity with a gradual predominance of Bacilli. (B) Bacteroides spp. were abundant in the presence of MMF but were rapidly eliminated by the introduction of vancomycin on day 8. GUS-predicted gene expression and measured enzyme activity are increased by MMF and abolished by vancomycin We examined the proportional abundance of the bacterial GUS gene using PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities using Reconstruction of Unobserved States). We found the predicted proportional abundance of GUS enzyme orthologs [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology K01195, KEGG Enzyme EC 3.2.1.31] to be comparable between groups before commencing MMF treatment. After 4 days of MMF treatment, the MMF-only group had a significant increase in the predicted proportional abundance of K01195 (P = 0.006), but after 8 days, the abundance in the MMF-only group had decreased slightly (Fig. 3A). Functionally, the activity of GUS enzymes, assessed in fecal pellets of untreated and MMF-treated mice, followed the same pattern, with the treated mice exhibiting a significant increase in enzyme activity after 4 days of exposure (Fig. 3B). During the initial 8 days of MMF-only treatment, prior to the initiation of vancomycin, there were no differences between the two groups with regard to gene expression (P = 0.33) (Fig. 3C). The introduction of vancomycin after 8 days of MMF treatment reduced the predicted proportional abundance of K01195 after only 2 days (day 10). After 8 days of vancomycin treatment (day 16), the abundance of K01195 was reduced to nearly undetectable levels, in comparison to preantibiotic levels (P = 1.2 × 10−7), despite continuation of the MMF exposure. Concordant with reduced gene expression, GUS activity in fecal pellets was abolished by treatment with vancomycin (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3 MMF–up-regulated GUS expression and activity are prevented by vancomycin. PICRUSt and an enzyme activity assay were used to assess gene expression and GUS activity in mouse fecal pellets. (A) The proportional abundance of KEGG ortholog K01195 increased significantly (*P = 0.006) in the presence of MMF after 4 days. (B) GUS activity in fecal pellets collected from mice consuming MMF also increased significantly (P = 0.03) after 4 days. (C) The introduction of vancomycin on day 8 rapidly eliminated the expression of K01195. (D) Vancomycin, introduced after day 8, abolished GUS activity in fecal pellets (*P < 0.01). All data are plotted as means and SDs with data points for individual samples represented. Ex vivo imaging of intestinal GUS activity The effect of MMF and vancomycin on intestinal GUS activity in the intact animal was assessed using the fluorescent substrate fluorescein di-β-d-glucuronide (FDGlcU). Mice gavaged with FDGlcU and exposed to MMF demonstrated an up-regulation of GUS activity in the proximal colon after 8 days of treatment but not in the cecum as compared with controls. Vancomycin significantly reduced GUS activity in both the cecum (day 4, P = 0.05; day 8, P = 0.008) and proximal colon (day 8, P = 0.03) and also caused a qualitative enlargement of the cecum (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Intestinal GUS activity is decreased by vancomycin. Mice were treated with MMF or MMF and vancomycin for 8 days, and then GUS activity was imaged using the fluorescent substrate FDGlcU.

(C) Ex vivo imaging of the GI tract of mice exposed to MMF and vancomycin for 8 days. (D) Quantification of GUS activity in the cecum did not demonstrate a significant increase after 4 or 8 days of MMF exposure, but activity decreased significantly after 4 and 8 days of vancomycin treatment. (E) Quantification of GUS activity in the proximal colon did not demonstrate a significant increase with MMF, but activity decreased significantly after 8 days of vancomycin treatment compared with animals receiving MMF only. *P < 0.05. Vancomycin limits MPAG catabolism The catabolism of MPAG/AcMPAG (undifferentiated in our fecal assay) to MPA and GA was found to be significantly reduced by the addition of vancomycin in MMF-treated mice, as measured in fecal pellets using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. 5A). During the MMF-only exposure (days 0 to 8), we observed relatively high-average concentrations of MPA in both groups (35.2 ± 4.13 and 33.73 ± 4.50 μM) and relatively low-average concentrations of MPAG (1.85 ± 0.48 and 1.53 ± 0.47 μM). After the addition of vancomycin on day 8, there was a significant increase in the average concentration of MPAG (16.01 ± 0.92 μM, P = 0.01) and a nearly eightfold decrease in the average MPA concentration (4.27 ± 0.73 μM, P < 1 × 10−7). There were no significant changes in average GA concentration in either group over the treatment period. Notably, in serum, there were no significant differences between treatment groups for either MPAG, MPA, or GA on day 16 (Fig. 5B). AcMPAG was not detectable in either group by our assay. Fig. 5 Changes in MMF metabolites. The concentrations of MMF metabolites were measured in mouse fecal pellets and serum. (A to C) Comparison of MPA, MPAG, and GA levels in mice exposed to MMF only for up to 16 days and mice initially exposed to MMF only for 8 days and then with the addition of vancomycin for 8 days. Vancomycin treatment resulted in significant increases in MPAG and significant decreases in MPA levels (P < 0.05). (D to F) In serum from mice consuming MMF, levels of MPA, MPAG, and GA were not affected after 8 days of treatment with vancomycin. AcMPAG was not detected in the serum. Data are means ± SEM. The mean concentration of each metabolite before (days 0 to 8) and after (days 10 to 16) the introduction of vancomycin was compared independently in each treatment group using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with *P < 0.0005. Intrarectal administration of MPA promotes weight loss and inflammation To elucidate the identity of the toxic metabolite, we directly administered MPA and GA into the mouse distal colon. There was a concentration-dependent effect of MPA, which caused significant weight loss (P = 0.002) in treated animals and appeared to promote inflammation as indicated by a trend toward increased activity of colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (fig. S7). GUS activity in human stool correlates with MMF exposure Human fecal GUS activity measured in stool samples obtained from adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients was variable but correlated with MMF exposure (Fig. 6). Patient 1, with the highest level of GUS activity, experienced significant neutropenia that was attributed to MMF. Patient 3 is the patient from our case report who had developed hematochezia and lymphonodular hyperplasia related to MMF. Patients 10 and 11 were pediatric patients whose MMF had been discontinued following the recent diagnosis of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease. Fig. 6 GUS activity in human stool. Samples were collected from 11 adult and pediatric heart transplant recipients and 2 healthy, nontransplant controls. The highest level of GUS activity seen in patient 1 correlated with lymphopenia requiring a dose reduction in her MMF. Patient 3 had developed hematochezia and colonic lymphonodular hyperplasia while taking MMF. Patients 10 and 11 had been taken off MMF before sample collection.

DISCUSSION The use of MMF as an immunosuppressant is frequently limited by GI side effects. Attempts to relieve toxicity by modifying drug delivery, either through use of an enteric coating or intravenous administration, have not been successful (11, 12). The metabolism of MMF and MPA has been well described, but the mechanism of toxicity has remained elusive. Previously, we have demonstrated the requirement for an intact gut microbiome for MMF to cause GI toxicity in the mouse (10). Here, we now demonstrate the ability of a single antibiotic, vancomycin, to both prevent and reverse MMF-induced GI toxicity through the reduction of GUS expression, activity, and GUS-producing bacteria, and, consequently, decreasing catabolism of the MMF metabolite MPAG to free MPA. In our mouse model, reduced fecal concentrations of MPA were associated with reduced GI toxicity. Complete eradication of the gut microbiome with a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics was able to prevent and reverse MMF-induced GI toxicity (10). From those four antibiotics, it appears that only vancomycin is necessary and sufficient for the prevention and reversal of MMF-induced weight loss. Vancomycin is used clinically primarily for its ability to treat infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and colitis caused by Clostridium difficile. Its impact in reversing MMF toxicity was unexpected. Neomycin and ampicillin have broader activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, and metronidazole targets obligate anaerobes and specific protozoans. Vancomycin was also used to reverse MMF-induced colonic inflammation as demonstrated by improvements in cecum, liver, and spleen weights and colon length. Colonic tissue homogenates also showed changes in multiple cytokines and chemokines consistent with a reduction in the proinflammatory state induced by MMF exposure. This inflammatory stimulus was previously postulated to be a pathogenic bacterium (i.e., Escherichia/Shigella) that expanded due to MMF-induced dysregulation of the microbiome (10, 13). However, our present data suggest that the factor initiating the inflammatory response may be free MPA, released after bacterial GUS metabolism in the lumen, which interacts with the epithelium in the distal GI tract. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we determined which bacteria thrived during MMF exposure, presumably due to their consumption of free GA as a nutrient source (7, 14), and were eliminated by the addition of vancomycin. After 8 days of MMF-only treatment, there was a consistent abundance of the bacterial classes Betaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, Bacilli, Gammaproteobacteria, Erysipelotrichia, and Alphaproteobacteria. After initiating vancomycin treatment, the classes Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and Erysipelotrichia were severely depleted, allowing for expansion of the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Bacilli. Given the reportedly narrow spectrum of activity of vancomycin primarily against Gram-positive organisms, this response was surprising. However, a similar response was also observed in humans treated with oral vancomycin (15, 16). In the study by Isaac et al. (15), the authors found that humans consuming vancomycin for 21 days demonstrated a loss of gut microbe diversity and alterations in most bacterial taxa, including reductions in the Bacteroidetes (which includes the class Bacteroidia) and Firmicutes phyla. This study and our data suggest that vancomycin has broad effects on the gut microbiome, including Gram-negative organisms, or, more specifically, is affecting the gut microbe ecosystem and removing key (as yet unidentified) microbes, causing the collapse of important populations such as the Bacteroidia. The potential pathogenic bacteria Escherichia/Shigella (which cannot be distinguished based on 16S rRNA sequencing) of class Gammaproteobacteria, previously thought to be a primary cause of inflammation following MMF-induced dysbiosis of the microbiota (10, 13), expanded during vancomycin treatment, while inflammation and toxicity improved. The gut bacteria Bacteroides spp. and Roseburia spp., both enriched in the presence of MMF and eliminated by vancomycin, encode for GUS enzymes and have demonstrated GUS activity in vitro (17, 18). B. fragilis, B. uniformis, B. caccae, and B. vulgatus all increased in abundance during MMF treatment, and these bacterial species were eliminated by vancomycin, suggesting the capacity for bacterial GUS activity was reduced. This hypothesis was supported by our PICRUSt analysis and in vivo imaging of GUS activity. PICRUSt predicts the functional content of a metagenome from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data (19). Functional orthologs are annotated in the KEGG Orthology database (20). In bacterial DNA extracted from mouse fecal pellets, PICRUSt predicted an increase in the abundance of GUS orthologs in response to MMF after 4 days. This suggests a rapid increase in bacterial metabolism in response to the introduction of MMF, but this increase does not appear to be sustained. This increase in predicted gene expression was supported by our in vitro assay for GUS activity, which showed a similar, transient increase in activity. In humans, levels of GUS activity were quite variable but did correlate with MMF-related side effects for two of the patients with the highest level of GUS activity and with the lowest levels seen in patients who had been recently taken off MMF as part of a reduction in their immunosuppression related to the diagnosis of malignancy. Levels of stool GUS activity in humans on MMF may therefore represent a potential biomarker to assess for drug-related toxicity, although this remains to be tested in a larger cohort. Assessment of bacterial GUS activity in vivo based on activation of a fluorescent substrate after GUS hydrolysis (21) demonstrated an increase in overall bacterial GUS activity in the proximal colon, but not the cecum, of MMF-treated mice as compared with controls that was abolished by treatment with vancomycin. In fecal pellets, relatively higher levels of MPA and lower levels of MPAG were measured during MMF treatment. The introduction of vancomycin induced a sharp increase in MPAG concentration, in tandem with a drastic reduction in the concentration of MPA, demonstrating that vancomycin does alter bacterial metabolism of MPAG in the colon. Reduced colonic concentrations of MPA in our model coincided with reduced GI and systemic toxicity, suggesting that MPA is the major contributor to MMF-induced GI inflammation and toxicity. The serum concentration of MPA was not significantly reduced in the vancomycin-treated animals. However, our assay did not specifically distinguish between MPAG and AcMPAG. In our previous work, MMF resulted in a modest increase in hepatic gene expression of the MPAG transporter Abcc2, but levels did not decrease with antibiotic exposure (10). Multiple human clinical reports have indirectly implicated GUS involvement in MMF metabolism (22, 23), and recent work by others further supports our hypothesis that MPA is responsible for the GI toxicity experienced by patients. MPA depleted the intracellular guanosine pool in human intestinal LS180 cells, potentially leading to reduced membrane integrity (24). Qasim et al. demonstrated that MPA directly modulated intestinal epithelial tight junctions in Caco-2 cell monolayers by up-regulating myosin light-chain kinase, leading to increased phosphorylation of myosin II regulatory light chain and increased tight junction permeability (25, 26). This may occur via MPA-stimulated activation of the midkine-dependent PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway (27). Our previous work supports these observations of MPA-induced epithelial barrier dysfunction as we found that MMF exposure led to an increase in serum lipopolysaccharide, an indirect measure of intestinal epithelial barrier function (10, 28). Together, these data suggest that MPA may trigger local and systemic toxicity by disrupting GI epithelial barrier function, potentially allowing toxic metabolites to cross into the tissue and circulation. In summary, our data suggest that bacterial GUS metabolism of MPAG to free MPA in the colonic lumen is responsible for the GI toxicity associated with MMF use. The GUS pathway responsible for MMF metabolism affects multiple other commonly prescribed drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen, irinotecan, and cannabinoids (29). The ability of vancomycin to reduce toxicity suggests a possible therapeutic approach to treat or prevent MMF-induced GI toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals All animal procedures were approved by the University of Calgary Animal Care Committee (protocol AC14-0068) and were in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care policies. Female C57BL/6 mice aged 7 to 10 weeks (Charles River) were used in all experiments. Mice were housed in sterilized, filter-top cages under specific pathogen–free conditions, separated by treatment group, and fed control chow (Teklad Global 16% protein rodent diet TD.00217) for a minimum of 1 week before commencing any experiment. MMF-containing chow was administered ad libitum at a concentration of 0.563% (w/w) (30). Vancomycin (500 mg/liter) was administered in the drinking water ad libitum. Consumption of both chow and water was monitored daily. Sample collection and assays Mice were individually placed in clean, ethanol-sterilized cages, and immediately upon defecation, each fecal pellet was placed in a sterile collection tube, snap frozen, and stored at −80°C. Whole blood was collected from anesthetized animals by cardiac puncture. Serum was isolated by centrifugation at 1500g × 15 min and stored at −80°C. Liver, spleen, and intestine were collected immediately after euthanasia. Each tissue was weighed, and colon length was measured before being placed in microcentrifuge tubes, snap frozen, and then stored at −80°C. Hematocrit was determined using a microhematocrit capillary tube reader. Whole colonic tissue was homogenized in cell lysis buffer, and protein concentration was determined using the Precision Red Protein Assay (Cytoskeleton). Samples were sent to Eve Technologies for analysis using their 32-multiplex Mouse Cytokine/Chemokine Array. Bacterial community analysis Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from mouse fecal pellets (31), and concentration was determined using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Invitrogen). Variable regions 3 and 4 of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using barcoded primers (32) before sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq in the Nicole Perkins Microbial Communities Core Laboratory at the University of Calgary. Primers and poor-quality reads were removed using Cutadapt v1.16 and then processed using DADA2 v1.6.0 (33). Taxonomy was assigned using the Silva Taxonomy Training Set v128 and the Silva Species Assignment Set v128 (34). Visual and statistical analyses of amplicon sequencing data were performed using the R packages Phyloseq (35) and Vegan v2.5-2 with support from dplyr 0.7.5 and ggplot2 v3.0.0. Reads of nonbacterial origin and samples with insufficient depth (<10,000 reads) were removed. Observed species, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson’s index were determined. Multiple indices were used to ensure that a potential bias did not arise from unequal numbers of reads between samples. β-Diversity was assessed using an NMDS plot of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. The R package DESeq2 v1.18.1 and microbiomeSeq v0.1 were used to calculate significantly differentially abundant taxa in the vancomycin-treated group over time. Prior to further analysis and visualization of taxa-specific differences between samples or treatment groups, reads in each sample were normalized to relative abundance. For input into PICRUSt v1.1.3, reads were reprocessed into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (36). Read quality was assessed using FastQC v0.11.5, and paired-end reads were merged and filtered using PEAR v0.9.10. Chimeric sequences were removed using VSEARCH v1.11. Sequences were clustered into OTUs using a closed reference OTU picking pipeline using QIIME v1.91 (37) and mapped to the Greengenes Database v13_8. Within PICRUSt, the OTU table was 16S rRNA copy number normalized, and then functional predictions of KEGG orthologs were predicted using PICRUSt’s Hidden State Prediction algorithm. Ex vivo imaging of GUS activity We performed ex vivo tissue imaging of intestinal bacterial GUS activity through quantification of fluorescence following hydrolysis of FDGlcU (Sigma-Aldrich) to fluorescein. Three hours prior to imaging, each animal was gavaged with FDGlcU (7.3 μmol/kg). Immediately before imaging, mice were euthanized, and abdominal organs were excised and imaged using an In Vivo Xtreme 4MP imaging platform (Bruker). Reflectance imaging (2-s exposure time) was followed by fluorescence imaging (5-s exposure time, 470-nm excitation and 535-nm emission filters) and x-ray imaging (10-s exposure time). Pixel binning was kept constant at 4 × 4. Images were acquired and analyzed using the Bruker molecular imaging software MI SE v7.1.3.20550. GUS activity was quantified by measuring the mean fluorescence after background subtraction in a given region of interest, which was kept constant over the time period of imaging. Metabolite extraction and MS Fecal metabolites were extracted from fecal pellets (50 mg) using 500 μl of 4°C 50% methanol followed by homogenization with ceramic beads using a Bead Ruptor 4 (Omni). Insoluble debris was separated by centrifugation at 10,000g × 15 min at 4°C, and 300 μl was collected. The remaining material was reextracted in an additional 300 μl of 4°C 50% methanol following the same procedure, and supernatants from the two-stage extraction were combined. Metabolites present in whole blood were extracted by diluting samples 1:20 (v/v) in 4°C 50% methanol. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,600g × 5 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was harvested. All metabolite extracts were stored at −80°C until quantitative analyses could be completed. All MS analyses were conducted at the Calgary Metabolomics Research Facility (CMRF). Metabolites in the extracts were quantified using UHPLC MS. Fecal metabolites were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (Syncronis HILIC column, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and serum metabolites were separated using reversed-phase chromatography (Accucore Vanquish C18+, Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS analyses were conducted using a Q-Exactive HF Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in negative ion full-scan mode. Metabolites were assigned by high-resolution MS and coelution of the metabolite with a commercial metabolite standard (MPA and GA from Thermo Fisher Scientific, and MPAG and AcMPAG from Toronto Research Chemicals). Metabolite concentrations were measured by fitting peak intensities of extracted ion chromatograms to calibration reference curves prepared using standards. Data were analyzed using the MAVEN software package (38). Enzymatic assay for GUS activity Fecal pellets were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 M, pH 7.0) using a Bead Ruptor 4 (Omni) and then sonicated using a Branson 3510 Water Bath Ultrasonicator. Activity of extracted bacterial GUS was measured by hydrolysis of phenolphthalein glucuronide (Sigma-Aldrich) to free phenolphthalein and quantified by spectrophotometry (39). GUS activity was calculated as mg of free phenolphthalein liberated/mg protein/hour of incubation. Intrarectal administration of MPA and GA Injections were performed daily for 8 days using a 1-ml syringe and a polyethylene catheter (PE-50). With the mouse immobilized, the catheter was inserted 3 to 4 cm intrarectally, and 200 μl of either vehicle (50% dimethyl sulfoxide), GA (17.5 mM), or MPA (1.75 or 17.5 mM) was slowly injected by hand. After removal of the catheter, the rectum was held closed for a minimum of 2 min. Body weight of each animal was recorded daily. After 8 days, animals were sacrificed. Colonic tissue was homogenized in hexadecyltrimethylammonium buffer using a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica). O-dianisidine (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell lysate, and its oxidation was measured by absorbance at 450 nm using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate reader. MPO activity (U/mg tissue) was calculated from absorbance based on a standard curve. Statistical analysis All statistical analysis was conducted using R and Prism 7 (GraphPad). Data are expressed as means ± SD. For each set of data, normality was determined using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test. For data with two treatment groups, each experimental group mean was compared pairwise against the control group mean using either Welch’s t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test with a correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Means of parametric data with >2 treatment variables compared at a single time point were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. Significant ANOVA results were followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test. Means of nonparametric data with >2 treatment variables compared at a single time were analyzed using pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum tests with P value correction for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. To compare means of two treatment groups over time, a two-way ANOVA was used, followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test. If the two-way ANOVA residuals were nonparametric, the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test, followed by Dunn’s Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison post hoc test, was used. Intergroup significance in β-diversity was computed using the Adonis test applied pairwise, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for P value correction. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant, except for the assessment of colonic tissue cytokines and chemokines, the pairwise group comparisons of observed species for α-diversity, and β-diversity comparisons between MMF- and vancomycin-treated animals, where a value P < 0.1 was considered significant.

Ali Sowe ended his nine-game goal drought after scoring CSKA Sofia’s third goal in their 3-2 win over FC Arda Kardzhali on Sunday.

The Gambia international, who last scored a goal against Etar on July 12, put an end to his goalless run to hand the Reds a crucial victory.

In the north this has already happened and worse.

It might be useful then, to prepare for conversations with strangers about the terrible weather, to brush up on your vocabulary for describing mud.

In her informative and entertaining book Wilding, about turning a West Sussex farm back to nature, Isabella Tree says there are 30 local dialect words for mud.

It is an area where the clay is deep and, once the rain begins in the autumn, presents some serious hazards for farmers and anyone else who ventures into the countryside.

Some of the useful terms are: clodgy, a description of a muddy field path after heavy rain; gawm – sticky foul-smelling mud – and gubber, a black mud of rotting organic matter.

The sound of the words helpfully conjures up the type of mud it describes. Slob or slub for thick mud; smeery, wet and sticky surface mud; stodge, thick pudding mud; and swank, a bog.

Isabella says until hard surfaced roads were invented people took to rivers, canals and the sea in winter rather than risk travelling across the land. The mud made farming almost impossible.","Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b6e2e82d46427ec6911a96862a96abf83f7b2be/0_304_5400_3241/master/5400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3b48c59fcb5b88f5f3ddd51f39d0e58d,"['thick', 'wet', 'mud', 'useful', 'sticky', 'west', 'worseit', 'sussex', 'words', 'weatherwatch', 'wilding', 'winter', 'rain', 'lexicon']", ,none

The Belgium international has arrived in Milan to complete a switch to the Serie A side after talks with Juventus fell through

Romelu Lukaku has arrived in Milan to undergo a medical with Inter as he prepares to finally complete his move away from Manchester United.

Goal reported earlier on Wednesday that talks between the two sides were ongoing as they sought to reach a deal that would see Lukaku finally link up with Nerazzurri head coach Antonio Conte

The latest comes amid suggestions that the Belgian's relationship with United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has broken down, with the Norwegian having apparently informed the forward that he would be expected to train with the Under-23s until there was some resolution regarding his future.

Conte has tried to sign Lukaku on more than one occasion in the past, having failed to land the ex-Everton man while in charge of Juventus and Chelsea, but it seems he will now finally get his man.

Federico Pastorello, the Belgian's agent,​ initially posted an image on Instagram of he and the striker on a plane heading for Italy to complete the transfer to Inter.

The caption of the post reads: ""Ready to take off .... direction Milan 🇮🇹 !!! Inter ... we are coming.""

And the pair have now arrived in Milan, with Lukaku being greeted by hundreds of Inter fans chanting as name as the Nerazzurri appear all set to beat rivals Juventus to his signature.

Inter will pay a fee that will total €80 million (£74m/$90m) for Lukaku, with United also receiving a set percentage of the striker's next transfer fee as part of the deal.

Reports suggest that his former club Everton could receive as much as £5m due to a sell-on clause of their own in the deal which saw Lukaku arrive at United in 2017 for a £75m ($91m) transfer fee.

The Premier League transfer window closes on Thursday, but Solskjaer is in no rush to sign a replacement for the 26-year-old and, as such, the club are under no pressure to rush a deal through.

After a summer of speculation, that saw Juve enter the race and seek a swap deal involving Paulo Dybala, Inter finally appear to be putting the finishing touches on the deal for Lukaku.

That would leave the Italian club with over a fortnight to integrate their new front man into their squad ahead of their opening Serie A fixture against Lecce on August 26.","Thu, 08 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['nears', 'trafford', 'utd', 'finally', 'deal', 'juventus', 'transfer', 'complete', 'old', 'striker', 'romelu', 'medical', 'milan', 'man', 'inter', 'united', 'lukaku']", ,none
70,70,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,GABON: Averda suspends waste collection in Libreville for outstanding arrears - AFRIK 21,https://www.afrik21.africa/en/gabon-averda-suspends-waste-collection-in-libreville-for-outstanding-arrears/,"The Libreville municipality and the Lebanese company Averda are no longer working well together. The company recently announced the temporary suspension of all waste collection activities in Gabon. “This decision was taken deliberately after extensive internal discussions and follows the nonpayment of Averda’s benefits by Clean Africa (the Gabonese government) over the past 24 months,” explains Averda.

The suspension of activities concerns waste collection, street sweeping, beach cleaning and gutter cleaning in the cities of Libreville and Akanda, as well as the transfer of collected waste to the Mindoubé landfill site. The Lebanese company, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is linked to the Gabonese State through Clean Africa by a 5-year contract, which began in 2014 and was due to end in December 2019.

Opposition from the Libreville City Council

The contract between Clean Africa and Averda provides for the Lebanese company to manage waste in the capital and Akanda, a city created in 2013 to relieve Libreville’s congestion. It also provides for automatic renewal for a further period of 2 years. A vision that Leandre Nzué, the new mayor of Libreville, elected in February 2019, does not want to see happen.

“This company (Averda) did not fulfil its contract in accordance with its specifications. This includes not only the collection of household waste, but also the maintenance of catchment areas and the cleaning of gutters. The problem is that Averda only collects household waste and does not take care of her other two missions, whereas she is paid 400-500 million CFA francs each month for all the services. This is not normal,” said Leandre Nzué in May 2019.

In an interview with web TV M241TV, the mayor of Libreville even wanted Averda’s contract to be terminated. The tensions between Averda and the authorities obviously echo those experienced by Veolia in 2018, which resulted in its exclusion from the management of the Gabon Energy and Water Corporation (Seeg).

Mayor Leandre Nzué’s hostility towards Averda, which is also highly reported, has caused a buzz on social networks in Gabon. The Gabonese took advantage of this shortcoming initiated by the mayor to appreciate Averda’s work. While waiting for the situation to normalise, waste continues to accumulate in the Gabonese capital, a few days before the national holiday scheduled for August 17, 2019. To deal with the situation, Libreville City Council called dump trucks to the rescue.

The Gunners striker is hoping his side can qualify for the Champions League and end their English top-flight title drought this term

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang believed Arsenal’s aim in the 2019-20 season will be to qualify for the Uefa Champion League and challenge for the Premier League title.

The Gunners have failed to win the English top-flight trophy since 2004 and only managed to clinch a Uefa Europa League ticket last season after finishing fifth on the table.

Aubameyang, who has scored two goals in the Gunners’ opening two games, has revealed his side’s target for the season.

“I think as I said earlier we have made good signings that will help us,” Aubameyang told Canal Plus, as per the Metro.

“Last season, we were not far away from qualifying for the Champions’ League. Whatever happens, that is the most important thing, the most important aim for us; to be back in the Champions League.

“Aside from that, to fight for the title, we know very well that the big guns are ready but we are also ready and in any case we are going to give our all to match the big guns if possible.”

Aubameyang was the Premier League joint-top scorer with 22 goals last season, along with Liverpool duo of Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.

The small family business has come a long way since its creation, three generations earlier.

Olivier Thibaut, expert in communication and graphic designer, joined his father Bertrand in the company about 10 years ago. To the experience with the orchards was then added an ambition to diversify, which gave birth to a workshop for processing fruit juices and to local sales.

Olivier Thibaut

A production valued in its entirety thanks to the juice processing workshop

Besides differentiating it from other farms, the juice processing workshop has allowed the company to enhance the value of its entire harvest. “We have almost no waste. All the slightly damaged fruits are processed into juice. We also help our neighbors add value to their fruits, for example, when scab problems occur, or when frost damages their harvest.”

The activity has been profitable since last year, but setting it up required a lot of hard work. “We built the workshop 8 years ago. But at the beginning, we could not find any qualified employee to help us get started. So I learned everything on the job.” A few years later, this self-taught juice producer recruited employees which he himself trained.

His efforts paid off and last year, the company sold, to large retailers and directly at the farm, nearly 200,000 bottles of 100% natural non-filtered juice and non-alcoholic sparkling fruit juices. The company also received a gold medal for its apple-pear juice in 2018, and a gold medal for its apple juice and apple-pear juice in 2019.

A desire to bring consumers closer to the producers

In addition to his juice processing workshop, Olivier was one of the first to set up, upon his arrival at the company, direct sales and picking in the orchards. “This brought some income before the harvest. We train the visitors so everything goes smoothly during the picking. It is also an opportunity for them to understand how an orchard works, and to see that, unlike what they hear on TV, there is biodiversity in the orchards,” explains Olivier. An activity which benefits everyone. At 1.00-1.20 €/kg [0.50-0.61 $/lb] for apples and 1.40 €/kg [0.71 $/lb] for kiwis, Olivier and Bertrand offer producer prices.

For a few years now, father and son have been opening the gates of their orchards on the first weekend of the fall holidays, which they have called “Vitamin Days”. For the occasion, a small concert is given and a market of local producers is held on the Sunday. “It is an opportunity for people to come visit the orchards, to pick Chantecler apples and kiwis.” A successful event, since the orchards welcomed 2,500 visitors last year, which is 500 more than the previous year.

Multiple ongoing projects

When it comes to projects, Olivier is full of ideas. After modernizing his bottle labels, the manager is now targeting new markets. “The demand is increasing and people consume more and more locally. We would now like to touch the fast-food industry and we plan to offer other formats for our juices. We are also working on a deposit system, but for this, retailers must get involved.”

Olivier also wants to expand and modernize the site. “We are making an expansion of 21,528 square feet and we have installed solar panels on the roofs. There is a plan to buy another juice production line and to create a parking-lot in order to receive our clientele.”

Regional seed manufacturer, Seed Co Limited’s expansion initiatives in Africa are expected to bear fruit this 2019/20 farming season on the back of increased varieties and capacity, good weather and a generally firm demand across the region.

This comes as Seed Co is consolidating its market dominance across the continent for grain and vegetable seeds.

In Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Mozambique and Ghana as well as parts of East and West Africa, the group anticipates increased sales as some countries are recovering from drought experienced in the prior year, while others have increased production after suffering product shortages.

The group is also anticipating to cash in on increasing Government support programmes across the region as well as an anticipated good rainfall.

Bad weather conditions have had a knock on effect on agriculture-related companies while inflationary pressures have also narrowed disposable incomes. However, governments from across the region have several input programmes for their countries and the seed-making firm is angling itself to capitalise on such.

In Zimbabwe, Government is targeting 210 000 hectares of maize for the 2019/20 farming season as well as 30 000 hectares of soya bean under the Presidential Input Programme.

Government is also looking at an additional 640 000 hectares of maize and small grains under support for the vulnerable groups.

Group chief executive officer Morgan Nzwere said they were anticipating to benefit from such programmes as well as firming demand across the region.

“What we will get from Government programmes is debatable, but we will try and get a significant share of that. There is also a drive to cut on imports and this should see an increase in planting,” Mr Nzwere told shareholders at the group’s annual general meeting in Harare yesterday.

“The Government input programme in Zambia is continuing with input distribution starting on September 1, and we expect to get a decent share of the business,” he said.

In Malawi, its subsidy programme is continuing although government has decided to cut the targeted beneficiaries to 900 000 families from one million in the prior season.

Mr Nzwere acknowledged that the operating environment was increasingly becoming unpredictable, especially in Zimbabwe due to inflationary pressures. However, the company has in place strategies to stay relevant both as a business and to its market.

“In Zimbabwe, whilst as a business we are doing everything within our control to prepare for the main selling season, the operating environment is increasingly becoming unpredictable,” he said.

Apart from Government, prospects are generally good for the seed producer on the back of favourable weather conditions across the region as well as increased production capacity in some regional markets.

Said Mr Nzwere: “From the regional operations, we anticipate rebound performance with adequate product and better rainfall forecasts, unlike last year when our markets were badly affected by drought. We expect continued market share growth in East Africa.”

Kenya is expected to recover this season after it suffered product shortages as well as depressed demand last year due to drought and other supply chain related constraints. Seed Co has since increased production capacity in Kenya, and has adequate stocks to meet local demand during the season.

In Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Kenya, vegetable seed business units are expected to start contributing to the bottom line following their full roll-out last financial year.

The group is also upbeat about Mozambique, Angola and the Tanzania where the seed producer has increased production to meet demand after suffering product shortages.

Other market areas are also being explored within the different countries as the firm consolidates its market share.

Business development work is continuing in Franco-phone Africa with demonstration plots of several varieties established this year in Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo, Benin, Cote d’lvoire, Cameroon and Congo Brazzaville.","Fri, 16 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/08/1508-1-1-IMG_5501.jpg,"['programmes', 'demand', 'anticipates', 'region', 'seed', 'product', 'market', 'production', 'firm', 'increased', 'season', 'nzwere', 'group']", ,none
76,76,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Day Zero for water: Mexico on the list of water-stressed countries - Mexico News Daily,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/day-zero-for-water/,"About a third of the world’s population of over 7 billion live in countries at high risk of running out of water in the near future, and Mexico ranks high on the list, according to a study by the World Resources Institute.

The institute categorized countries into five different levels according to their relative risk of consuming all of their water resources, ranging from “Low Baseline Water Stress” to “Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.”

Mexico falls into the high-stress category, the second-highest on the list, meaning that the nation consumes between 40% and 80% of the water supply available in a year. Overall, Mexico ranks 24th out of the 164 nations included in the study.

However, a more detailed look at the maps included in the study shows that some regions of Mexico are under significantly more baseline water stress than others. Fifteen states, all in northern and central Mexico, fall within the “Extremely High Baseline Water Stress” category, meaning that they consume between 80% and 100% of available water every year.

Among the states most vulnerable to water crises Baja California Sur is in the lead, followed closely by Guanajuato, Mexico City, Aguascalientes, México state, Querétaro, Hidalgo, Chihuahua, Zacatecas, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nuevo León, Morelos, Jalisco and Tamaulipas.

Several Mexican states, mostly located in the Gulf region, are at medium to high risk of suffering drought, including Tabasco, Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Tlaxcala, Yucatán, Colima and Puebla.

Mexico is one of 44 countries, representing one-third of the world’s population, deemed most at risk of hitting “Day Zero,” the point at which there is not enough water to meet the needs of its citizens.

“Water stress poses serious threats to human lives, livelihoods and business stability. It’s poised to worsen unless countries act: population growth, socioeconomic development and urbanization are increasing water demands, while climate change can make precipitation and demand more variable.”

However, the institute stressed that decisive action could have a significant and swift impact on countries’ available water resources.

It said that to step back from impending disaster, countries should implement several strategies, including increasing agricultural efficiency, investing in gray and green infrastructure and treating, reusing and recycling water.

“The data is clear: there are undeniably worrying trends in water. But by taking action now and investing in better management, we can solve water issues for the good of people, economies and the planet.”

Amakhosi have not won any of their opening league matches since being crowned PSL champions at the end of the 2014/15 season

Kaizer Chiefs will look to get their house in order and end their four-year trophy drought as the 2019/20 PSL season gets underway.

But their opening league match results over the past four seasons have not been up to their title-aspiration standards.

Amakhosi last won the PSL title in 2015 under the tutelage of Stuart Baxter, but since then, they have had to get their campaigns underway away from home.

This time around, Chiefs get their season underway with a clash away to Highlands Park at the Makhulong Stadium on Sunday afternoon.

Goal takes a look at their results in their opening matches of the season over the past four seasons of their struggles.

2015/16 season

This was Steve Komphela's first season in charge of the Glamour Boys following Baxter's departure from the club.

Komphela led Amakhosi against Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, but the team failed to find the back of the net let alone win the match.

The match ended in a goalless draw; a disappointing result given that Amakhosi were the defending champions at the time.

Chiefs finished the season in the fifth position at the end of the 2015/16 campaign.

2016/17 season

Amakhosi were pitted against Bidvest Wits in their opening match of the 2016/17 season.

Again, this was an away match for the Soweto giants, and they went down 2-1 to Gavin Hunt's charges.

This was soon after the club had made wholesale changes to their squad and losing a few of their experienced players including the likes of Reneilwe Letsholonyane.

Chiefs had an improved season as they ended up in the fourth position with 50 points after 30 league games.

2017/18 season

The Naturena-based outfit kicked started their campaign away to Bloemfontein Celtic in Komphela's final season.

The two sides played to a 1-1 draw with Amakhosi squandering their lead and allowing Phunya Sele Sele to claw back.

At this stage, it was clear that Amakhosi's problems were deepening, however, they kicked on to end up in position three at the end of the campaign, but with two points less than the previous season.

2018/19 season

An unusual start to a PSL campaign saw Kaizer Chiefs visit Mamelodi Sundowns in their opening league match.

The two rivals settled for a share of the spoils in Tshwane as the game ended in a 1-1 draw.

This was Giovanni Solinas' first match in charge of Amakhosi, taking over from Patrick Mabedi who had been the interim coach.

Ernst Middendorp then replaced Solinas, but the German mentor couldn't help the club make the top eight.","Sat, 03 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['position', 'psl', 'amakhosi', 'away', 'title', 'kaizer', 'draws', 'loss', 'matches', 'league', 'opening', 'end', 'winless', 'match', 'chiefs', 'season', 'winning']", ,none
78,78,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,EPL opener: Liverpool GK Alisson injured in win over Norwich - Loop News Barbados,http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/epl-opener-liverpool-gk-alisson-injured-win-over-norwich-1,"Liverpool opened their bid to end a 30-year English title drought by beating Premier League newcomer Norwich 4-1 on Friday but lost goalkeeper Alisson to injury.

In his first game since Brazil's victorious Copa América final a month ago, Alisson was forced off in the first half at Anfield with a calf injury. The severity of the injury isn't known yet but it will rule him out of the UEFA Super Cup match against Europa League winner Chelsea on Wednesday in Istanbul.

""He couldn't carry on,"" Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp said. ""That's not a good sign.""

It was the only blot on Liverpool's start of the attempt to be champions of England for the first time since 1990, having been beaten to the trophy in May by Manchester City by one point before winning the Champions League.

Liverpool were gifted an opener seven minutes into season when Grant Hanley deflected Divock Origi's cross into his own net.

Mohamed Salah steered in the second goal in the 19th minute after Roberto Firmino slid the ball behind the Norwich defense. Salah turned provider in the 28th, swinging in a corner that Van Dijk headed past goalkeeper Tim Krul.

After Liverpool had to change their goalkeepers — with Alisson replaced by Adrian — Krul conceded again before halftime when Origi slipped his marker to meet Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross.

On the video-assistant referee system's Premier League debut, there was a delay to the start of the second half when a problem with the audio feed to assistant referee Simon Bennett led to his headset being replaced.

VAR's only task on the night was to run unobtrusive checks after each goal, with no stoppage to play and no need for referee Michael Oliver to consult his monitor.

Promoted as League Championship winners, Norwich had an uncomfortable return to the Premier League after a three-year absence.

But Norwich stemmed the flow of goals in the second half and scored one of their own. Emi Buendia slid the ball through the Liverpool defense and Teemu Pukki controlled before shooting past Adrian in the 64th.

""We were a bit naive in the first half but that will happen with a young team. I'm proud of the way they reacted,"" Krul said. ""I feel we walk off the pitch thinking if we believe in what we are doing we will get some results this season.""","Fri, 09 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://loopnewslive.blob.core.windows.net/liveimage/sites/default/files/2019-08/0ggOJKAeVI.jpg,"['epl', 'premier', 'second', 'referee', 'liverpool', 'start', 'injured', 'alisson', 'gk', 'opener', 'league', 'slid', 'norwich', 'half', 'win']", ,none

Arsenal ace Aubameyang sets the standard for Pepe & summer signings

The Gunners got their season up and running with a 1-0 win at rain-soaked Newcastle on Sunday

New season, same old Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Arsenal may not have been at their best as they kicked off their Premier League campaign at Newcastle on Sunday, but they returned home with maximum points thanks to their prolific frontman.

Aubameyang walked away with the golden boot in his first full season in English football and it would be foolish to back against the Gabon international topping the scoring charts again.

His goal early in the second half at St James’ Park took his tally in the Premier League to 33 goals in just 50 games. Only four players have scored more in that time.

There are plenty of top strikers in England right now, but Aubameyang is up there with the vest best.

Arsenal were far from their best on Tyneside, but the quality they possess in the final third was enough to get them through.

Patience is not something that goes hand in hand with football nowadays, but you feel it’s going to be needed at Arsenal over the next few weeks.

After the excitement that the transfer window generated, with six new arrivals coming in - including club record signing Nicolas Pepe - optimism was high going into the new season.

But some of the optimism ebbed away during the first half as Emery’s side struggled to stamp their authority on a scrappy game which was played amid horrible conditions on Tyneside.

The display had all the hallmarks of the majority of Arsenal’s away days last season, scrappy in possession and poor in attack. Henrikh Mkhitaryan was especially wasteful.

They still created chances, with Aubameyang having one shot saved and Nacho Monreal setting up Mkhitaryan for an opportunity which he blazed over.

Other than that, however, the visitors were poor - but it has to be noted that this was an Arsenal side that is going to look very different in just a few weeks time.

Teenagers Joe Willock and Reiss Nelson started on Sunday, while the bench was packed full of quality - including three big new arrivals in Pepe, Dani Ceballos and David Luiz. All three of these you would expect to soon be regular fixtures in the starting XI.

Lucas Torreira was also amongst the substitutes, as was Alexandre Lacazette. And when you consider Hector Bellerin, Kieran Tierney and Rob Holding all should soon return from injury - as should Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac following their security-enforced absence - Emery is going to have plenty of talent to choose from.

So patience is required at the Emirates. This team and the performances will improve but right now the important thing is picking up points while the new faces settle in.

And that’s what they did at Newcastle thanks to a moment of quality soon after the interval. Ainsley Maitland-Niles did superbly down the right and when he picked out Aubameyang in space, there was only going to be one outcome.

The goal settled Arsenal down and they went on to see the game out relatively comfortably, meaning they have now already equalled the same number of clean sheets on the road as they achieved last season in the Premier League.

And we also saw the Premier League debuts of Ceballos, Pepe and Brazilian youngster Gabriel Martinelli as second half substitutes - important milestones for both them and the team.

The exciting thing about this Arsenal side is that there is clearly much more to come. Performances will improve and the forward line will get better and better as the weeks go by.

It might not always be pretty over the coming weeks, but when you have Aubameyang in your side, you always have a chance.","Sun, 11 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['pepe', 'newcastle', 'aubameyang', 'arsenal', 'weeks', 'signings', 'ace', 'sets', 'soon', 'quality', '01', 'right', 'premier', 'going', 'season', 'standard']", ,none
80,80,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Cepeda: Success here does rely on being met with a welcoming hand - MetroWest Daily News,https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/opinion/20190818/cepeda-success-here-does-rely-on-being-met-with-welcoming-hand,"The last time I saw Sil Ganzó, she was beaming as she gave a tour of her after-school care facility for newly arrived immigrant and refugee children.

Based on her enthusiasm, you'd have thought the tiny, two-room storefront for the elementary-school students had the grandeur of Google's headquarters. But, as I recall, it had few windows, and she was fighting to get local dog owners to pick up after their pets on the loose gravel outside the building - the barren spot where the trash cans were kept but also where the kids liked to make up games and run out their wiggles.

That was back in 2015, when I visited the OurBridge program in Charlotte, North Carolina, which Ganzó runs as executive director. I learned on my visit about the astounding diversity and expanding population of U.S.-born Hispanics, immigrants and refugees in the American South.

Charlotte continues to expand and serve as a gateway for new Americans. This has meant major changes for OurBridge and for Ganzó's newcomers.

""We've grown! In the last couple of years, we tripled the number of kids to about 200 and expanded to middle school-aged kids. Our home is now a beautiful building with hundreds of acres of green space, a lake and a kitchen,"" Ganzó gushed to me on the phone recently. ""We partnered with an elder care organization and are renting it for one dollar a year! We can take the kids to cook, on hikes; they have soccer fields and have planted a garden.""

It sounds like an oasis for children who are often scarred by the effects of war, deprivation and unspeakable trauma - whether it be from crossing our southern border or arriving here from Syria, Burma, Bhutan or the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Truly, it's a sanctuary. And I don't mean the new facility - I'm sure it is beautiful, but when I visited, I witnessed gold-standard student-centered engagement. Kids working with each other to build block towers, teachers modeling self-advocacy and problem-solving, older students helping younger ones with homework, groups practicing English and filling in the blanks with their shared language of hand gestures and smiles.

My visit to OurBridge sprung to mind when I heard Ken Cuccinelli, the White House acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, make a mockery of the Statue of Liberty's famous Emma Lazarus-penned inscription. He suggested: ""Give me your tired and your poor who can stand on their own two feet and who will not become a public charge.""

What he didn't say was that almost all poor, undereducated immigrants can pull themselves up by their bootstraps - they just need a loving, helping hand.

""We make our families feel cared for, not just by teaching their kids English, but by advocating for them in the community,"" said Ganzó, herself an immigrant from Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""Last year when we had ICE agents knocking on doors, I had a parent calling me from the closet, scared because they were outside her house. We went to our elected officials to ask that the city not cooperate. Unfortunately, the mayor didn't sign on to do that, like many other major cities, but it gives our families peace of mind that someone is fighting for them.""

Ganzó said that both parents and students come to understand and eventually love the U.S., not because they're offered English as a second language classes or after-school care, but because they feel connected to their new home when their own homelands are honored.

""We know we don't want our families to 'assimilate' - that word is misused because it means that one culture supersedes the other. What we want to achieve is acculturation, where you learn and become part of a culture without losing your identity or where you come from,"" Ganzó said. ""We take the kids to their markets where they see their flags. We'll go to the Nepali store, the Asian market, the Latino food market, the African store -- then we ask them to help us buy the food for their recipes, and it makes the kids so proud that they know something that we don't know.""

People who seek to keep others out of this country don't realize that people who make the treacherous and heartbreaking journey to this country do so because they want to get on their own two feet. They don't want a handout, but their success here does rely on being met with a welcoming hand.

Forty years ago this summer, a small group of atmospheric and ocean scientists met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, to project the future impacts on Earth's climate from atmospheric release of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from fossil fuel combustion. Frank Press, head of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy and Science Adviser to President Carter, requested that the National Academy of Sciences conduct the study for the benefit of policymakers. On the basis of then-current trends, the 1979 committee, led by Jule Charney of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, assumed that atmospheric CO 2 concentrations would reach double the preindustrial values sometime in the first half of the 21st century. They calculated that as a result, the average global surface temperature would increase by 3° ± 1.5°C, with the greatest warming at high latitudes—the first assessment of its kind. The Charney committee also noted in the models a lag on the order of decades between CO 2 release and the resulting temperature rise. This delay, from disequilibrium effects with the ocean, masks pending temperature increases long before they are apparent.

Fast-forward to 2019, and these calculations of the sensitivity of climate to a doubling of CO 2 have proven to be remarkably on target. Indeed, on the basis of today's more sophisticated climate models, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms the climate sensitivity proffered by the Charney report. Furthermore, the lag between emission and resulting temperature increases has contributed to society's inaction on a degree of warming to which the planet is already committed from existing emissions. Four decades later, time is running out to control greenhouse gases. What else can scientists do to spur action to avert the worst impacts of climate change?

Back in 1979, without insight as to what revolutions might reshape the world economy their grandchildren would inherit, or how the biosphere might create feedbacks, the Charney committee focused on what they could estimate: the radiative effect of CO 2 in the atmosphere; the negative feedback from clouds; and the ability of the oceans to absorb atmospheric heat. Since then, our scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change has grown well beyond just surface temperature change, and we have deepened our knowledge about the roles of clouds, oceans, aerosols, and other non-CO 2 greenhouse gases. In particular, the science of attributing changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events to climate change drivers has been building credibility.

Whether the extreme event is a heatwave, flood, drought, wildfire, or hurricane, demonstrating to the public how climate change is amplifying the negative impacts of these events can spur more immediate action, even before the most catastrophic warming is upon us. Opinion polls reveal that a majority of Americans are worried about extreme heat, flooding, drought, or water shortages. However, even those who do view climate change as an important national issue rank it well down the list after health care, jobs, and the economy. Geoscientists must work collaboratively with health care professionals, economists, and engineers to link the changing impacts of extreme events and their aftermath to climate change while the effects are still being experienced. This approach could well convince people that climate change is about health, jobs, and the economy.

The Charney report demonstrates the power of scientific prediction. Since its release, scientists have built a formidable evidence base on climate change. At no time since 1979 has the science backed down from its dire predictions for the prospects of human civilization to prosper in a world warming well beyond limits encountered in all of human history. The scientific community must better connect the issues with what now matters to the public, so that the evidence is acted upon for the benefit of society.","Fri, 02 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6452/F1.medium.gif,"['charney', 'change', 'atmospheric', 'scientists', 'extreme', 'temperature', 'impacts', 'warming', 'climate', 'science', 'co2', 'times']", ,none

The World Cup winner has spurned the usual pre-retirement payday to pursue his dream of winning the Copa Libertadores with the Argentine giants

As a footballer approaches the end of his playing days, the last decision he must make is the stage he chooses for his final flourish. Some, like Francesco Totti or Ryan Giggs, remain faithful to the club which saw them grow from their very first days and bow out where it all began.

Others may choose to drop down a division in a bid to prolong their career a few more years. For South American greats, an emotional homecoming in the vein of Diego and Gabriel Milito, Carlos Tevez or Maxi Rodriguez might be on the cards. There is also the promise of a final huge payday in the shape of China or the Middle East, where the dip in quality is more than compensated by the astronomical wages on offer.

Few, however, choose to take the sort of leap into the dark that Daniele De Rossi opted for this summer. The Roma great and World Cup winner signed terms with Argentine giants Boca Juniors, spurning guaranteed millions to enter one of the most cut-throat, intense footballing nations on the planet.

It might be hard at times, submerged as we are in a sea of unscrupulous agents, contracts barely worth the paper on which they are written and slick commercial operations to find a shred of romance left in football. De Rossi, though, shows that there is still some magic and beauty in the game.

De Rossi's adventure in Argentina begins on Tuesday in the most intriguing of fashions. The city of La Plata plays host to Boca's Copa Argentina last-32 clash against second-tier Almagro, with the Italian set to line up against a group of veterans, young hopefuls and journeymen desperate to cause an upset.

His Superliga debut will probably follow on Sunday at the Bombonera against Aldosivi; with the stadium only open to home fans due to the six-year ban on visitors put in place because of endemic match-day violence between organised hooligan groups. Even that restriction is often not enough to avoid trouble, as Boca experienced first-hand last November when their coach was destroyed by missiles thrown by River Plate fans on their way to the Monumental, and River in turn back in 2015 during that infamous pepper spray attack inside the Bombonera suffered at the hands of a Xeneize supporter.

If that fact gives De Rossi a taste of the instability and difficulties faced in Argentina, another came on Monday: the local currency devalued by more than 25 per cent in a matter of hours and stock markets crashed over 30% on the back of nothing more than the result of the previous day's primary presidential election.

Why, then, would De Rossi forego a quiet, lucrative stroll towards retirement in favour of waltzing merrily into the wolf's lair? His relationship with Nicolas Burdisso, a former Roma team-mate and current Boca director of football, was logically key to pulling off this blockbuster transfer. But there was another, less tangible motive for the elegant midfielder, the chance to step where almost no European has ever dared to tread and conquer South America.

“Those who knew me best saw straight away that all roads inevitably were leading me to Boca,” the 36-year-old enthused in an interview with the club's official website. “Even when I thought I might go elsewhere, in the end it was always Boca.

“Winning a big tournament here would truly be the crowning moment of my career, an incredible dream.”

Given a hero's welcome upon his arrival in Buenos Aires at the end of July, De Rossi has wasted no time in settling in to his new environs. Obligatory trips to the city's famous steakhouses and other local landmarks have been eagerly followed by the local press, while Boca fans were driven wild by his meeting with club legend Diego Maradona.

""The guy is a multimillionaire, he was earning €12 million a year at Roma and now he's coming to our country, where people would kill for a pair of shoes,"" Diego told La Red in his usual inimitable style after that chat.

""He said he came because he saw me in my box at a game when we played in the [Copa] Libertadores or against River Plate.""

The mention of River is far from coincidental to this story. Bruised and humiliated by 2018's final defeat at the hands of their arch-rivals in the unlikely surroundings of Madrid, the pressure on Boca to win their first Libertadores since 2007 is higher than ever this time round.

As well as De Rossi the likes of Argentina international Eduardo Salvio and Venezuela prodigy Jan Hurtado joined in the off-season, as did Brighton's Alexis MacCallister on loan. As fate would have it, victories for both Boca and River in their Copa quarters would set up yet another continental Superclasico, no less a matter of life and death for taking place in the last four.

When the Italian speaks of a “big tournament,” it is the Libertadores he has in mind. The lure and romance of the famous old trophy brought him halfway across the world to Buenos Aires and he does not plan on squandering the opportunity: “I am motivated by playing football and by the passion I feel when I play serious football. This is a club that will allow me to play at an excellent level, just as I like it.”

Tuesday's clash against tiny Almagro represents the first chapter of what will be one of the most gripping football stories of 2019, as De Rossi looks to conquer the hearts of Boca's famously raucous support and end their Copa drought once and for all. His transfer may not have caught the most headlines and it certainly does not rank among the most lucrative in this current window; but in terms of pure romantic appeal few will match it over the summer.","Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['debut', 'la', 'boca', 'football', 'diego', 'libertadores', 'transfer', 'daniele', 'romantic', 'juniors', 'signing', 'river', 'copa', 'end', 'summer', 'rossi', 'roma']", ,none

Match Preview

Borussia Dortmund boss Lucien Favre insists “there are no more friendlies” as his side prepare to take on Bayern Munich in the traditional German season curtain-raiser.

Last season’s runners-up Dortmund will again be expected to challenge Bayern for the Bundesliga title this time around so will be looking to lay down a psychological marker for the title race ahead with victory on Saturday.

Dortmund have won all five of their pre-season matches so far, scoring 24 goals, including a 3-2 victory over European champions Liverpool.

And though there are still two weeks to go until the Bundesliga kicks-off, Favre is demanding his side treat Saturday’s game as a competitive fixture.

""There's currently no team out there that can be ready (for the season),"" he told the club’s website.

""(But) we still need to prepare ourselves well for this match. The Super Cup is the Super Cup. There are no more friendlies.”

Those thoughts have been echoed by Favre’s opposite number Niko Kovac as he begins his second season in charge at the Allianz Arena.

Kovac found himself under pressure in the early months of his tenure in Bavaria as a poor start to the season saw Bayern fall behind in the title race. However, a mid-season revival allowed Bayern to claw away at Dortmund's lead before ultimately claiming the 28th Bundesliga title in their history on the final day of the campaign.

Bayern have won three, lost one and drawn one in pre-season so far – with that draw against Tottenham leading to a penalty shoot-out defeat as the Premier League side claimed the Audi Cup earlier this week.

Looking ahead to Saturday, Kovac said: ""I think it's a beautiful cup, an important cup and we want to win it.

“Dortmund have bought well and it’ll be a hard-fought contest. Not everything will work out the way you think it will, you have to take that into consideration. But it’ll certainly be a good game.”

Dortmund and Bayern are the two most successful clubs in the Super Cup’s history, having won the trophy 12 teams between them since its foundation in 1987.

This will be the eighth time they have met in the competition, not including an unofficial Super Cup meeting in 2008, with five of those meetings coming in the last seven seasons.

Bayern have won Super Cup for the past three years in a row including a 5-0 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt 12 months ago. Dortmund last lifted the trophy in 2014 courtesy of a 2-0 victory over Bayern.","Sat, 03 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['squad', 'title', 'dortmund', 'munich', 'preview', 'cup', 'live', 'tv', 'borussia', 'bayern', 'bundesliga', 'channel', 'season', 'stream', 'vs', 'super']", ,none

Indeed before the Ronaldo's and Messi's surfaced, there was Bernard Don Bortey 'The Serial Killer'.



In what seems to be the most trending on Social Media this weekend, Ghanaweb.com brings from its archives Don Bortey's free-kick that sank the Porcupines



Ten years ago, a lone goal scored by Bernard Don Bortey in the 10th minute was all that Accra Hearts of Oak needed to beat arch-rivals Kumasi Asante Kotoko in the second match of the GHALCA/MTN Top 4 tournament at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium in Kumasi on Sunday.



The goal came from a free kick which was expertly taken by Don Bortey after Louis Quainoo had whacked down Douglas Nkrumah just outside the penalty box and the back-to-battan, Bortey made no mistake when he delivered a curling kick to hit the net with goalkeeper Isaac Amoako sprawling.



Kotoko who lost their first match 1-2 to city rivals King Faisal at the same venue in the on-going tournament last Wednesday tried to make amends but failed to tame the Phobians.



It was a match Hearts deserved to win especially with their work rate even though it was Kotoko who started the match on a serious note when they tormented the defence of Hearts within the first eight minutes but could not find the net with Alex Asamoah and newfound Samad Oppong leading the attack.



Hearts took over affairs and nearly scored with danger man Don Bortey wasting two chances until he hit the net in the 10th minute. Kotoko accepted the challenge after the goal and came close to equalizing but Haruna Ganiyu shot in the 23rd minute went wide while Francis Coffie also squandered another opportunity two minutes later. Hearts Ishmael Aryee was flashed the yellow card by Referee Samuel Gyasi of Nsawam for rough play in the 39th minute.



Kotoko came back strongly after recess and made series of forays but the defence of Hearts stood gallantly to prevent any attempt at goal.



As the game progressed, Kotoko sensing danger brought in Edward Affum for Haruna Ganiyu in the 60th minute but it was still Hearts who continued to dominate the game with skilful and accurate passes with Don Bortey who was on top of his acts on day wasting another chance in the 62nd minute.



Kotoko's head coach Herbert Addo introduced Stephen Oduro for Jordan Opoku in the 74th minute while Hearts also brought on Abdulai Hamza for Samuel Affum in the 76th minute.



With their pride at stake, Kotoko made several attempts to level up the scores as they exhausted their substitution with Francis Akwaffo replacing Louis Quianoo in the 80th minute but still failed to find the equalizer till the final whistle.

ABOUT 63 hippos are stranded in shallow water of the Chobe River, which is currently drying out due to drought.

The spokesperson of the environment ministry, Romeo Muyunda confirmed this in a press release issued today.



He said the water levels in the river is becoming shallow by the day, which calls for an intervention between Namibia and Botswana to save the animals.



“Talks are underway between the two countries to look at how best to address this situation. Possible actions are drilling water pumps to fill the ponds with water; relocating them to another part of the river or the hippos will move by themselves when the situation detects,” he said.



Muyunda further noted that they will continue to monitor the hippos while discussions are ongoing between the two countries. A number of crocodiles were also observed in the pond.



“We will also conduct a helicopter assessment in August to verify if there are no similar situations in other parts of the Zambezi and Kavango East regions, “he said.","Fri, 02 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.namibian.com.na/images/logo_small.jpg,"['chobe', 'water', 'hippos', 'stranded', 'shallow', 'todayhe', 'river', 'verify', 'countries', '63', 'underway', 'zambezi', 'situation']", ,none

Carlton Cole believes Frank Lampard is in a ""win-win"" situation with the young England forward and hopes he manages to prove himself at the top level

Carlton Cole hopes Tammy Abraham will take his big opportunity to impress as Chelsea's No.9 after Frank Lampard made the decision to start the 21-year-old as his main striker against Manchester United.

The Blues were defeated 4-0 at Old Trafford but there were positive signs as the likes of Abraham and Mason Mount showed glimpses of their potential.

Like Abraham, Cole was an academy graduate at Stamford Bridge but struggled to get opportunities in the first team with Didier Drogba, Hernan Crespo and Eidur Gudjohnsen all competing for a first-team spot.

Lampard was also a team-mate of Cole's and he has given a chance to a host of academy players as the Blues aim to cope with the transfer ban imposed on them by FIFA.

And, as a result of that ban, Cole is hopeful that Abraham takes the opportunity he feels he never had in west London.

""I wish I was coming through at Chelsea with a transfer ban,"" Cole told Goal at the finals of the #BetRegret Cup, part of the nation’s largest safer gambling campaign. ""This is an excellent chance for Tammy Abraham.

""When I was out there, I was fighting for my life. Hopefully, these boys from the youth team can grasp this chance to make a good account of themselves.

""They have to have the desire to realise what a big chance this is. I would have loved this chance when I was back there. Can you imagine if I had an opportunity like this? I never had that. You need a run of games to show what you can do.

""You will see that these boys will definitely get their chances, the next question is, will they take it? For Tammy, he knows this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I hope he will take his chance. He is a good player. He still has a lot to learn but where’s the best place to learn it?

""Under someone who believes in you and who thinks you can do well for him. The thing is that Lampard also has no choice but to believe in him. He is in a win-win situation, Abraham, but he must believe in himself.

""He has to do something for Chelsea by the end of the year. This is a big stage. He was brilliant at Aston Villa but this is a promotion. This is the big time.""

Cole went on a series of loans at Chelsea before signing for West Ham in 2006 to begin his most productive spell in football. He earned international recognition during his time with the Hammers and has returned to the club as a coach for the Under-18s side.

Manuel Pellegrini splashed the cash to sign Sebastian Haller from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer and Cole is confident that the Frenchman is capable of being a bit hit in the Premier League.

""From what I have seen of him so far, I think he is a top, top player. I think Manuel Pellegrini has bought very well there,"" he added.

""I think he can fill the void that we have been having over the last couple of years. Andy Carroll hasn’t been fit to play.

""He would have been our main go-to guy to hold up the ball and bring others into play. We were missing that. We know we have a focal point of attack and we can build off him. We have other players like [Manuel] Lanzini, [Pablo] Fornals is a great signing and prospect.

""Jack Wilshere is like a new signing. Declan Rice will keep improving and Mark Noble spurring on the boys. So listen, we are looking good. Our defence is not too shabby as well.""

Cole was speaking from the final of the #BetRegret Cup, part of the UK’s largest safer gambling campaign . Teams from across the UK have been battling it out throughout the summer, which culminated at the national final at Powerleague Shoreditch on August 4. Bet Regret is that immediate sinking feeling you get when you place a bet you know you shouldn’t have, for example when you’re bored, drunk or chasing losses.","Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['carlton', 'onceinalifetime', 'chance', 'think', 'good', 'tammy', 'signing', 'lampard', 'urged', 'big', 'opportunity', 'cole', 'abraham', 'chelsea']", ,none

The 20-year-old will spend the season away from Los Blancos as he looks to land more regular playing time at the top level

Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin​ has been loaned out to Real Valladolid for the upcoming season.

The Ukrainian, signed by the club in June of 2018, spent last season on loan with fellow La Liga side Leganes, but struggled for playing time there as well.

With Thibaut Courtois and Keylor Navas​ both still in the squad for Zinedine Zidane​, chances of seeing the field for Los Blancos this season were slim for the 20-year-old.

Luca Zidane, the son of manager Zinedine and a goalkeeper himself, was also sent out on loan by Real Madrid this season, making it unlikely that Navas, who has been linked with a move to AC Milan, will leave the club this summer.

Ukraine were crowned champions of the Under-20 World Cup after beating South Korea in the final this summer with Lunin awarded the Golden Glove as the tournament's best goalkeeper.

He was expected to return to the club and serve as an understudy to Courtois, with Navas and Zidane departing to make way for the youngster to see the pitch more regularly.

However, the club have now taken the decision to let Lunin go out on loan once again.

Despite consistent links with a move away from Madrid, Navas now appears set to stay, the Costa Rican having made clear last season that he wanted to spend the coming season with the Spanish giants.

""I'm very happy, grateful to God for giving me the chance to be here,"" Navas said back in April as Zidane's side struggled through a poor season.

""Whenever I get the opportunity to play I do the best I can. I hope I can stay at Madrid next season. I have a contract and we have to wait and see if anything changes there.""

Madrid open their La Liga campaign on Saturday against Celta Vigo as the club look to rebound from a season that saw them finish a distant third behind champions Barcelona and runners-up Atletico Madrid.

They’ll also be looking to return to the top of Europe following a Champions League campaign that saw their dominance of the continental competition come to an end thanks to a quarter-final exit at the hands of Ajax.","Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['los', 'goalkeeper', 'send', 'valladolid', 'transfer', 'blancos', 'real', 'madrid', 'loan', 'club', 'champions', 'navas', 'lunin', 'zidane', 'season']", ,none
92,92,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Morocco tourism gains momentum - How we made it in Africa,https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/morocco-tourism-gains-momentum/63575/,"The crème de la crème of Hollywood was in Marrakech, Morocco, for the wedding of British movie star Idris Elba in April this year. Elba tied the knot with his Canadian model girlfriend, former Miss Vancouver Sabrina Dhowre, at the Ksar Char-Bagh hotel, an exquisite Alhambra-style hotel.

Kenyan-Mexican Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, American actress Jessica Alba, soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal and others have all embraced the glamour of the rose-coloured city of Marrakech and its plethora of tourist attractions, including the vibrant Jemaa el-Fnaa square and the picturesque Majorelle Garden.

Morocco draws tourists from the far corners of the world. They may be seen strolling along the Corniche in Casablanca – an oceanfront boardwalk lined with restaurants, nightclubs, theatres and hotels—or dining at one of the small cafés in the quiet city of Azemmour – a short day trip or overnight jaunt from the big city.

Adil El Fakir, director of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT), says that over 12 million tourists visited Morocco in 2018, of whom 2.4 million headed for Marrakech.

Morocco’s tourist attractions include the spectacular beaches of Essaouira, an Atlantic coastal town included on the World Heritage List of UNESCO since 2001, and the country’s mountains, particularly the Atlas and the Rif.

“Tourism is a terrific land-use tool, and our territory, from Tangier to Lagouira, is rich in its activities, its landscape, its heritage, its culture and its gastronomy,” declares Mohamed Benamour, a former president of the Morocco Tourism Federation.

A cultural crossroad

The country is also a cultural hub, reflecting the diversity of its inhabitants’ national origins: sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and the Middle East. This crossroads attracts fashion designers, artists, filmmakers and other cultural tourists. In 2017, for example, a museum on the international luxury fashion house Yves Saint Laurent opened in Morocco.

“Marrakech taught me colour. Before Marrakech, everything was black,” Saint Laurent once noted.

Over 50 Hollywood motion pictures have been shot in the country, including Alfred Hitchcock’s The Man Who Knew Too Much; Lawrence of Arabia, directed by David Lean; Orson Welles’ Othello; Jesus of Nazareth, directed by the late Franco Zeffirelli; and the latest James Bond movie, Spectre.

The country is also becoming a major hub for international conferences due to its proximity to Europe, Middle East, the Americas and the rest of Africa. The country recently hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference, which brought about 20,000 participants to Marrakech.

Last year, the Global Forum for Migration and Development and the conference on the adoption of the Global Compact for Migration were held in Marrakech and attracted representatives from most UN member states and non-governmental organisations.

In March the city hosted the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development on “fiscal policy, trade and the private sector in the digital era: a strategy for Africa”, which was organised by the UN Economic Commission for Africa.

This year, UNESCO’s first International Forum on Artificial Intelligence in Africa and the Africa Youth Leadership Summit, among other events, will take place in Marrakech. These international conferences shine a spotlight on the country while contributing to the economy.

Tourism revenues account for 11% of total GDP, according to the tourism ministry. Industries in the sector, such as air and land transport, food service and hospitality, generate significant employment opportunities for young people. Morocco was the most visited country in Africa in 2016, with 10.3 million tourist arrivals.

Despite the potentials in the tourism sector, climate change effects threaten to put a dampener. In 2015, for example, Morocco’s economic growth nosedived to 1.5% due to drought, according to the World Bank. To address the situation, the country is constructing the world’s largest desalination plant, which turns seawater into drinking water, in Agadir, near the Atlantic coast.

It has also set ambitious goals that focus on, among others, generating 52% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2030 and improving coastal zone management.

Regulatory reforms introduced in 2010 are bringing Morocco closer to its goal of making the country one of the world’s 20 leading tourist destinations by 2020. Its 10-year plan, dubbed Vision 2020, is aimed at creating eight new tourist destinations and 470,000 new jobs while doubling tourist receipts.

That goal is within reach, it seems. The country has set its sights on a good slice of the 1.4 billion global tourists traveling abroad annually, many of whom are Chinese. Following Moroccan king Mohammed VI’s visit to Beijing in 2016, the number of Chinese arrivals in Morocco skyrocketed to 180,000 in 2018, up from 42,000 in 2016. By 2020 Morocco hopes to reach the 500,000 mark, according to the Moroccan National Tourist Office, a wing of ONMT.

Investing in tourism

Massive investments in new infrastructure, such as new airport terminals, roads and railways, and the relaxed visa requirements for citizens of some countries, such as China, are two factors in Morocco’s success.

Thanks to the new airport terminal in Casablanca that was opened earlier in 2019, the airport can now handle up to 14 million passengers a year, up from 7 million. Another newly built terminal in the Rabat-Salé Airport can now handle 4 million passengers a year, up from 1.5 million.

Investments in airport infrastructure have had a domino impact on the broader economy. For example, the Rabat airport expansion is transforming the neighbouring city of Kenitra into a fast-growing industrial hub, attracting international companies such as Groupe PSA, the French company that manufactures Peugeot and Citroën.

“[The economic growth of] Kenitra has exceeded our expectations,” says Moulay Hafid Elalamy, minister of industry, investment, trade and the digital economy.

With improving infrastructure, safety and security, Morocco is on its way to becoming a premier destination for an increasing number of tourists.

94,94,Drought_Ghana_2019_Aug,Hydrophobic nanostructured wood membrane for thermally efficient distillation - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw3203,"Current membrane distillation (MD) is challenged by the inefficiency of water thermal separation from dissolved solutes, controlled by membrane porosity and thermal conductivity. Existing petroleum-derived polymeric membranes face major development barriers. Here, we demonstrate a first robust MD membrane directly fabricated from sustainable wood material. The hydrophobic nanowood membrane had high porosity (89 ± 3%) and hierarchical pore structure with a wide pore size distribution of crystalline cellulose nanofibrils and xylem vessels and lumina (channels) that facilitate water vapor transportation. The thermal conductivity was extremely low in the transverse direction, which reduces conductive heat transport. However, high thermal conductivity along the fiber enables efficient thermal dissipation along the axial direction. As a result, the membrane demonstrated excellent intrinsic vapor permeability (1.44 ± 0.09 kg m −1 K −1 s −1 Pa −1 ) and thermal efficiency (~70% at 60°C). The properties of thermal efficiency, water flux, scalability, and sustainability make nanowood highly desirable for MD applications.

In this study, we developed the first robust MD membrane directly from a sustainable wood material. Nanocellulose is an earth-abundant and, oftentimes, waste biomass source that has been used in products with minimal environmental and health impacts such as construction materials, body armor, biofuels, or water filters ( 33 – 39 ). Most nanocellulose-based products, such as paper (fig. S4), are from wood pulp, where degraded cellulose fibers are randomly mixed together to form an isotropic structure with high density (1.20 g cm −3 ) and lower mechanical strength (0.25 to 0.30 MPa) ( 40 , 41 ). In contrast, this new wood membrane was made by directly removing lignin and semicellulose via chemical treatment and freeze-drying, which allowed the preservation of the anisotropic microstructure and hierarchical alignment of wood fibers. As a result, the wood can be prepared into an anisotropic and thermally insulating bulk material with extremely high porosity (~90%), low thermal conductivity (~0.04 W m −1 K −1 ), and good mechanical strength (18 MPa), making it an ideal substrate for MD membrane. In this study, we report a nanostructured wood (i.e., nanowood) from natural American basswood followed by silane coating, which resulted in a hydrophobic nanowood membrane with high porosity yet very low thermal conductivity. The highly porous structure with naturally formed pores either amid the nanofibrils or growing on the wood vessels and fibril tracheid lumens (pits) reduces the water vapor transfer resistance and provides good water flux (20.8 ± 0.8 kg m −2 hour −1 at 60°C) in direct contact MD (DCMD) tests ( Fig. 1 ). The anisotropic property can allow heat to spread along the nanofibril direction and reduce the conductive heat transfer, while the high intrinsic permeability enhances water vapor transfer and, thus, convective heat transfer. Together, these grant the membrane excellent thermal efficiency (71 ± 2% at 60°C) with one of the highest values among all the reported MD membranes in literature ( 22 ). The hydrophobic wood membranes were also compared with commercial membranes in terms of membrane structures [e.g., pore size distribution (PSD) and thermal conductivity] and MD performance (i.e., flux, vapor permeability, and thermal efficiency). Figure 1B shows a large piece of the nanowood membrane with a length of 18 cm, which demonstrates the scalability of the wood membrane fabrication process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a hydrophobic MD membrane made from a sustainable wood material.

Current commercial MD membranes are made of synthetic polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and polypropylene (PP) ( 16 , 25 – 27 ). In general, these membranes have porosities lower than 0.80, thermal conductivities higher than 0.050 W m −1 K −1 , and thermal efficiency up to 60% ( 10 , 15 , 16 , 22 , 25 , 28 ). For example, the microporous PTFE membranes are widely used in MD modules owing to their high hydrophobicity and stability ( 26 ), but many of these membranes are typically isotropic (fig. S4) and not ideal for highly effective thermal insulation ( 29 – 31 ). In addition, these polymer materials are derived from petroleum products, and their use and disposal generate environmental concerns due to low biodegradability ( 32 ). Therefore, MD membranes made from natural and low-cost materials with high thermal stability and hydrophobicity are highly desired, yet not available. Recently, Leitch et al. ( 24 ) presented a new bacterial nanocellulose aerogel MD membrane with high porosity (>98%) and low thermal conductivity (<0.03 W m −1 K −1 ), demonstrating how membranes could be fabricated using natural materials.

Membrane distillation (MD) is an emerging thermally driven separation process with great potential for high-salinity water desalination using solar, thermal or other renewable sources ( 10 ). Driven by difference in temperature and vapor pressure. Water evaporates at the hot feed side of MD cells and diffuses through a porous hydrophobic membrane before condensing at the cold permeate side ( 14 – 16 ). MD can be operated using low-grade heat such as condenser cooling water from thermal power plants or, increasingly, from renewable sources such as solar thermal or geothermal plants ( 17 – 19 ). During MD, the transport of water vapor leads to the convective heat transfer, where the heat partially conducts through the membrane materials thereby reducing temperature gradient and lowering the driving force for mass transfer across the membrane ( 20 , 21 ). Thermal efficiency is an important parameter in MD and is defined as the convective heat flux across the membrane divided by the total heat flux ( 22 ). Accordingly, an ideal MD membrane would have a desired combination of characteristics, such as large pore size, low pore tortuosity, low thermal conductivity, high porosity, optimized thickness, good mechanical strength, cost competitiveness, and low environmental impacts ( 10 , 22 – 24 ).

Water scarcity is a worldwide grand challenge. The United Nations reported this year that nearly half of the global population (~3.6 billion) are currently living in potential water-scarce regions at least 1 month per year. This number could increase to between 4.8-5.7 billion by 2050 ( 1 ). This problem is exacerbated by climate change and rapid urbanization, evidenced by extensive periods of drought and more frequent wildfires in California and other regions ( 2 – 4 ). Desalination can help alleviate water stress by extracting fresh water from a range of saline or contaminated sources including seawater, brackish groundwater, or wastewater ( 5 , 6 ), and the development of desalination has been greatly boosted by nanotechnology and advanced manufacturing ( 7 , 8 ). However, although reaching its energy efficiency limit (~50%), current water desalination processes such as reverse osmosis are still energy intensive [2 to 4 kilowatt-hour m −3 ] ( 9 , 10 ). However, in many regions that can benefit from the technology, an increasing supply of renewable yet intermittent solar energy in the format of heat or electricity generates great opportunities for solar desalination, which also mitigate challenges in energy storage. By taking advantage of this low-cost and sometimes excess supply of heat or electrical energy, water desalination can become more cost effective ( 11 – 13 ).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The unique porous structure of the hydrophobic nanostructure wood as a highly efficient membrane The hydrophobic wood membranes (Fig. 2, A, B and C and Fig. 3, A and B) were directly derived from natural American basswood, in which amorphous lignin and hemicellulose are intertwined with cellulose nanofibrils (42). After chemical treatment and purification, as described in Materials and Methods, we preserved the wood microstructure and the hierarchical alignment. For the nanowood membrane, lignin and hemicellulose were removed, while the naturally aligned cellulose nanofibrils isolated from each other along the growth direction can be directly observed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2, D to H). The removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose for the nanowood membrane greatly reduced the linkage and interaction among cellulose fibrils and the fibril aggregates within the fibril wall, which greatly increased flexibility and porosity (39). The resulting aligned crystalline cellulose nanofibrils were held together by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces (43). Presumably, this aligned structure with weakened interactions would reduce the thermal conductivity in the transverse direction, thereby mitigating the heat loss via the conductive heat transfer during MD.

Hou, University of Colorado. Different from commercial membranes with vertical pores (e.g., finger-like structure; fig. S7) (26), the wood membranes presented a unique pore structure with naturally formed xylem vessels and lumina (channels) in parallel to the membrane surface (Fig. 2D). The channel diameters ranged from 10 to 100 μm, and the channel pores granted the hydrophobic natural wood membrane a porous structure with a porosity of 21 ± 3%. Impressively, the removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose contributed to ~70% mass loss in the wood structure and, thus, further improved the porosity more than four times from 21 ± 3 to 89 ± 3% for the hydrophobic nanowood membrane. Note that the porosity of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane was also larger than that of commercial membranes, of which the porosity ranged from 41 to 85% (Table 1) (10, 15, 22, 25, 28). In addition to porosity augmentation, the removal of lignin and hemicellulose greatly shifted the PSD to the right (Fig. 2I) and increased the average pore size by ~56% from 0.18 ± 0.02 to 0.28 ± 0.03 μm (Table 1). We observed the obtained pore structure of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane using SEM (Fig. 2, D to H). Along the cross-sectional direction, we also detected micropores amid the crystalline cellulose nanofibrils (<100 nm; Fig. 2F). Apart from the pores between nanofibrils, we also observed a large amount of mesopores (pits) growing on the xylem vessels and lumina (5 to 10 μm; Fig. 2, E, G, and H), which were used for water and nutrient delivery during tree growth. This study takes advantage of the gas transportation property of these pores located either between the nanofibrils or on the channel walls for water vapor transportation. The unique pore structure of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane resulted in the nonuniform PSD with several peaks, which were totally different from the commercial PP and PTFE membranes with very uniform PSDs (fig. S6). Benefiting from the large porosity, the theoretical thermal conductivity of the hydrophobic nanowood membrane was decreased from 0.210 to 0.040 W m−1 K−1 at 25°C (section S12), which would contribute to conductive heat loss reduction. Moreover, different from the commercial membranes with isotropic structures and intertwined fibers (fig. S7), the aligned and high–aspect ratio nanofibril channels led to anisotropic heat flow along the alignment direction rather than the cross-sectional direction, which can further prevent the heat transfer across the wood membrane (39). In addition, the increased pore size and porosity were hypothesized to improve vapor permeability and enhance water flux (section 12), thereby increasing convective heat transfer (10). Table 1 Characteristic comparisons of the new wood membranes and commercial polymeric membranes. LEP, liquid entry pressure; ECTFE, ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene. View this table: As shown in Fig. 2C and fig. S8, both the hydrophobic nanowood membrane and natural wood membrane had water contact angles greater than 140°, indicating that the initially highly hydrophilic wood substrate (i.e., no measurable water contact angle) was successfully modified to be hydrophobic after surface fluorination. The hydrophobicity of the treated wood membranes was better than those commercial membranes with PTFE or PP substrate, where the contact angles were lower than 130° (Table 1) (22, 26). The excellent hydrophobicity of the wood membranes was attributed to fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) treatment, which has super low surface energy (13.1 mN m−1) compared to PTFE (20 mN m−1) and PP (30 mN m−1) (26, 44). Note that the surface morphologies and pore structure did not change before and after surface fluorination by FAS (fig. S2). Owing to the good hydrophobicity and relatively small pore size, the nanowood membrane demonstrated decent liquid entry pressure (LEP; ~74.7 ± 0.5 kPa), suggesting a better resistance to membrane wetting than the commercial PP membranes. However, it was noted that the nanowood membrane showed smaller LEP than the PTFE membrane (~130 kPa). This is due to the wide PSD of the nanowood membrane, as larger pores (>0.4 μm) may exert negative effects (45).

Thermal conductivity characterization of the nanowood membrane To demonstrate the thermal insulation capabilities of the fabricated hydrophobic nanowood membrane, we tested the specimens under a conductive heat source to simulate the DCMD. We measured the temperature with an infrared radiation (IR) camera (Fig. 3). Five different temperatures were applied, and the results show that the hydrophobic nanowood membrane yielded lower backside temperature than the hydrophobic natural wood membrane, attributed to its low thermal conductivity and anisotropic property (39). The thermal conductivity of both nanowood and natural wood increased gradually from 0.210 to 0.270 W m−1 K−1 and from 0.040 to 0.049 W m−1 K−1, respectively, with the escalation of the heat source temperature from 40° to 60°C (Fig. 3E). This is assumed because of the increase in conductivity of the cell wall substances rather than the increase in gas phase conductivity or the radiative conductivity (46). The trend was more notable for the natural wood (29%) than for nanowood (23%) due to the presence of hemicellulose and lignin, which are of less thermal stability (47). The measured thermal conductivity was comparable to the theoretical values (section S12), which are 0.184 and 0.037 W m−1 K−1 at 25°C for natural wood and nanowood membranes, respectively. The nanowood membrane showed lower thermal conductivity than most of the commercial membranes, whose thermal conductivity is generally higher than 0.045 W m−1 K−1. This lower thermal conductivity was believed to reduce the conductive heat loss during MD and maintain the effective temperature gradient across the membrane. When heated by a conductive heat source at 60°C, it was shown that the stabilized backside temperature of the hydrophobic natural wood was 47°C, whereas that of the hydrophobic nanowood was 43°C, under 200 mW cm−2 (Fig. 3D). This directly indicated that the nanowood exhibited better thermal insulation property or less conductive heat loss than the natural wood. Accordingly, the thermal conductivity of the nanowood membrane was 0.049 ± 0.002 W m−1 K−1 at 60°C (Fig. 3E), which was only 18% of the thermal conductivity of the natural wood membrane (0.270 ± 0.005 W m−1 K−1 at 60°C). This significantly lower thermal conductivity of nanowood membrane was attributed not only to the higher porosity (89 ± 3% versus 21 ± 3%) but also to bigger pore size (0.28 ± 0.03 μm versus 0.18 ± 0.02 μm). Previous study indicated that higher interspacing (pore size) between fibers than the mean free path of air can mitigate thermal conduction through air. The reduction of microsized and nanosized pores is appreciable for further reduction of thermal conductivity (39). Furthermore, hemicellulose (0.34 W m−1 K−1) and lignin (0.39 W m−1 K−1) carried higher thermal conductivity than the nanocrystalline cellulose (0.26 W m−1 K−1). Therefore, the removal of intermixed lignin and hemicellulose greatly reduced the bulk thermal conductivity of nanowood. Note that the hydrophobic treatment with FAS did not result in significant change of the thermal conductivity of the wood (Fig. 3F).","Fri, 02 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/8/eaaw3203/F1.large.jpg,"['thermal', 'heat', 'conductivity', 'membrane', 'hydrophobic', 'water', 'membranes', 'nanowood', 'distillation', 'fig', 'efficient', 'thermally', 'nanostructured', 'wood']", ,none

The Nigerian was on target as her side maintained their dominance in the Swedish top-flight

Anam Imo scored as she helped Rosengard to a 3-0 triumph over Djurgarden in a Swedish Damallsvenskan contest at the Stockholms Olympic Stadium on Monday.

Before the encounter, the Nigeria international had opened her Swedish top-flight goal account in her side's 2-1 win over Pitea on May 15.

The hosts were aiming to bounce back to winning ways but started on the back foot after Imo gave the visitors the lead a minute from half-time.

In the second half, Lisa Karlseng Utland, who came one as a substitute, scored twice to wrap up the victory for Jonas Eidevall's side.

The 18-year-old Imo, who was in action for the duration of the match, has now scored two goals in seven outings for Rosengard since her arrival in April.

Ghana's Portia Boakye, South Africa's Stephanie Malherbe and Nigeria's Ogonna Chukwudi featured for Djurgardens, who are now 10th with nine points.

The win sees Rosengard three points clear at the top of the table with 24 points from 11 games. They will take on Eskilstuna United on Saturday.","Tue, 06 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png,"['anam', 'winning', 'imo', 'rosengards', 'swedish', 'rosengard', 'points', 'wrap', 'ways', 'inspires', 'scored', 'visitors', 'win', 'djurgarden']", ,none

The now-empty lakebed is located in the eastern municipality of Ocosingo and part of the UNESCO-protected Metzabok lagoon system, which is considered sacred by the local Mayan people.

Local resident Armando Valenzuela said the lake dried up completely on Saturday night but water levels had been dropping during the previous two weeks.

“. . . The community was monitoring it to take care of the [wildlife] species,” he said.

Around 150 residents helped to transfer fish to other lakes in the area, the newspaper Reforma reported, although some ended up on dinner tables.

“There’s nothing left in what was a great expanse of water and a tourist site,” said one local in a video posted to social media.

Valenzuela said there are 10 smaller lakes in the area that dry up every year but it is the first time that a larger one has lost all its water.

Staff at the Natural Protected Areas Commission told Reforma that an investigation is underway to determine the cause.

Lower than usual rainfall appears to be the most likely culprit.

The National Meteorological Service said in May that land in the catchment area of the Usumacinta river, one of several waterways that feed the Metzabok lagoon system, was in a state of extreme drought.

Zimbabwe’s government said it has secured combined loans of $108 million from the Export-Import Bank of China and Export-Import Bank of India to fix its power crisis.

The state-run Herald newspaper reports that the government concluded the loan agreements in the last few months.

The loans according to government officials should significantly help to the country’s power generation projects and broadband expansion.

Areas to receive boost and upgrade according to the government are Bulawayo and Hwange.

Zimbabwe has been experiencing power crisis since May this year, with parts of the country without power for several hours daily.

South Africa has tried to assist but largely unsuccessful due to it’s own power crisis.

The reported impact of power crisis according to the business community in Zimbabwe is around $200m in lost revenue.

Declining water levels in Lake Kariba have plunged most parts of the country into darkness for longer periods per day.

Water levels continue to decline in Zimbabwe’s Lake Kariba which is a source for power generation hydro-electric dam in Kariba.
