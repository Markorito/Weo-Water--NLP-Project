A. Situation analysis

Description of the Disaster

01 May 2021: The Government of Somalia declared a National Emergency due to the Drought situation and called for support in responding to the humanitarian crisis. According to UNOCHA Somalia situational Update of April 26th 2021 and the IFRC Regional Information Bulletin (RIB), the already dire humanitarian situation in Somalia has been deteriorating since the failed Deyr short rains late 2020, especially in the eight targeted districts in the table below:

This affected crop production, pasture regeneration and failed to sufficiently replenish water sources for communities in the eight (8) targeted districts.

The earliest onset of the prolonged Jilaal dry season in late 2020 depleted the little pasture and water sources available for the very vulnerable households in these districts. The late onset of the insufficient and poorly distributed Guu long rains 2021 is projected to be inadequate till June, unlikely to sufficiently replenish water sources and regenerate pasture. The back-to-back poor performance of the Deyr and Guu with a harsh Jilaal in-between eroded the resilience of the targeted communities.

Access to clean water is compromised with the cost of water spiking by 60% in these districts and vulnerable households having to travel long distances in search of water. Vulnerable households have resorted to negative coping strategies. Poor hygiene practices are on the rise putting the health and nutrition of vulnerable <5-year-olds and pregnant women at increased risk. Herders are resorting to hand-feeding their livestock with locally produced cereals. This has caused cereal prices to increase by at least 30% and livestock disease are being reported.

Summary of the current response

Overview of Host National Society Response Action

In response to the emerging drought as a result of failed Deyr (short rains) season September-December 2020, SRCS convened a Partners call in December 2020. The objective was to flag the imminent drought and collectively agree on the next steps moving forward. Two key resolutions reached were: 1) SRCS participates in the planned Government-led interagency drought rapid assessment, and 2) SRCS closely monitors the situation and share periodic updates with partners. SRCS convened a second follow up Partners call in early February 2021 during which the Drought rapid assessment findings for Somaliland were shared and discussed.

The meeting resolved that SRCS focuses and prioritizes areas / sectors of intervention, develops a Preparedness for Effective Response (PER) Plan and shares with members. SRCS further prepared and submitted a proposal to the Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) for consideration. This operational plan is therefore prepared based on the conclusion and sector-specific recommendations of the assessment. Furthermore, the plan is triggered by the Government’s Declaration of a National Drought Emergency on the 01 of May. The eight (8) targeted districts are pockets inside the larger Puntland and Somaliland regions, some already classified to be in IPC-4.

Based on the above, this DREF Operation will initially focus on 1) Livelihood and Basic needs support through Unconditional Mobile Cash Transfer to meet basic needs of households and, 2) Health / Nutrition through additional Emergency Mobile Health Clinics (EMHCs). Subsequent action will depend on the evolution of the drought emergency.","Sat, 15 May 2021 06:12:50 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1567019-MDRSO011do.png?itok=ORVaA4Ys,"['epoa', 'water', 'households', 'n', 'mdrs0011', 'action', 'situation', 'emergency', 'plan', 'drought', 'operation', 'targeted', 'vulnerable', 'districts', 'dref', 'srcs', 'somalia']",drought

Cyclical patterns of erratic weather conditions, climatic causes of displacement, political instability and a rise in conflict — including due to the highly contentious election process and disputes over natural resources (land, water, pasture) — have deepened Somalia’s protection crisis.

Water challenges in Somalia oscillate between water shortages and drought-like conditions, and flash floods and river breakages. As communities struggle to cope with the impact of COVID-19 and the desert locust infestation in a context of protracted armed conflict, insecurity and political instability, pre-drought conditions seen across various parts of the country add an additional layer of complexity, further driving communities to adopt negative coping mechanisms.

In the first quarter of 2021, more than 34 districts in Somalia were already facing devastating water shortages, over 95,000 Somalis were displaced by droughtlike conditions since December 2020, and at least 3.4 million people were projected to be affected by drought or drought-like conditions by year end, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced due to droughtlike conditions and dry season.

The poor weather patterns are expected to continue due to La Niña conditions and a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall with below-average Gu rainfall season forecast from April to June. The impact of drought and livelihoods situation will be exacerbated by the continuation of the desert locust infestation which is forecast to continue spreading following reports of newly formed immature swarms breeding in the northern parts of the country. Progressively, widespread food security Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through September 2021.

Efforts therefore need to be bolstered to provide communities access to sustainable and climate-resilient water services. This means investing in short, medium and long-term solutions that withstand climate shocks. To address the immediate lifesaving needs of affected populations, urgent and collective action is required to mitigate the worse impacts of the various shocks. Complementary to the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan, the Emergency Response and Preparedness (ERP) outlines detailed State-level response and preparedness contingency plans to operationalize and optimize the speed and volume of critical assistance delivered immediately after the trigger of an identified slow-onset or sudden-onset humanitarian of three key shocks: drought, conflict and flooding at both the State and Federal level.","Mon, 17 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1567107-Somalia_ERP_2021.png?itok=K6CalS4a,"['droughtlike', 'conflict', 'floods', 'water', 'weather', 'response', 'conditions', 'plan', 'emergency', 'drought', 'shocks', 'preparedness', 'expected', 'communities', '2021', 'somalia']",drought

SITUATION OVERVIEW

80 per cent of Somalia facing moderate to severe drought conditions

The Federal Government of Somalia in consultation with the United Nations declared a drought on 25 April. More than 80 per cent of the country is currently experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Key factors include below average October to December 2020 Deyr rains, followed by a harsh and warmer than normal January to March Jilaal season and a delayed and poor start of the current April to June Gu season. The worst affected areas include parts of Somaliland and Puntland, central regions and Gedo region. Between October 2020 and March, over 116,000 people were displaced by severe water shortages and drought conditions between October 2020 and March 2021.

“We are at the brink of a human catastrophe amidst an already dire humanitarian situation,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator, Adam Abdelmoula in a 25 April joint statement with the Federal Government. “The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster.”

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. The country has, since 1990, experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. In 2021, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting negative impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by the end of 2021, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1566474-Somalia_%20Humanitarian%20Bulletin_April%202021_final%201_publication.png?itok=dupSWVNb,"['displaced', '25', 'severe', 'moderate', 'conditions', '2020', 'drought', 'bulletin', 'humanitarian', 'include', '2021', 'somalia']",drought

UNITED NATIONS, May 11 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains in parts of Somalia triggered flash flooding, killing at least 25 people about two weeks after a drought was declared in the country, UN humanitarians said on Tuesday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned the combined effects of drought and flooding may worsen the humanitarian situation in Somalia, where more than 2.7 million people are food insecure.

Seasonal rains started in parts of the country in late April and early May as more than 80 percent of Somalia faced moderate to severe drought conditions, said OCHA.

""At least 25 people have died in various parts of the country due to the floods, among them 9 children who lost their lives after their house flooded in the Banadir region on Friday,"" OCHA said. Belet Weyne in the Hiiran region may see unprecedented levels of flooding in the next 24 to 48 hours. The Juba River burst its banks, it said.

The United Nations and partners have reached at least 353,000 people in drought-affected areas with assistance. Urgent efforts are under way to respond to the flash flooding.

The UN 2021 humanitarian response plan for Somalia seeks 1 billion U.S. dollars to help 4 million people, OCHA said. It is only 19 percent funded.

In 2019, floods killed at least 17 people and displaced more than 370,000 others in Somalia.

In immediate response to the Government’s appeal to address the devastating drought conditions in Somalia, the Humanitarian Coordinator released all available SHF funds to launch a targeted drought response allocation. This allocation will provide life-saving response in areas experiencing pre-drought conditions including acute water shortages, causing the death of livestock, escalating hunger and extreme difficulty in growing crops. The crisis is exacerbated by protection risks and limited access to health facilities and basic services. The SHF funds also target underserved and hard to access areas through cluster-specific and integrated projects. Prioritized activities will help address food insecurity and acute water shortages through rehabilitation of dams and construction of water harvesting infrastructure, conditional cash transfers to access food, provision of fodder seeds and training on improved fodder production and management. Other project activities also aim to improve health and nutrition outcomes, through delivery of free basic and life-saving health services, training health care staff and provision of curative and preventative nutrition services.

This SHF allocation is complemented by the two CERF allocations that will allow NGOs and UN early action to save lives, alleviate suffering, reduce displacements, and get assistance out before the situation becomes catastrophic.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Somalia: Drought, Torrential Rains Devastate Somalia - AllAfrica - Top Africa News",https://allafrica.com/stories/202105130047.html,"Geneva, Switzerland — The United Nations warns Somalia faces a perilous future as drought followed by torrential rains have destroyed this year's planting season.

Somalia is one of the countries in the world most prone to the erratic and calamitous impacts of climate change. It has been hit by a double climate disaster for more than two weeks that is likely to worsen its already acute situation of food insecurity.

The drought, which was declared on April 25 was soon followed by torrential rains that caused flash floods and rivers to overflow. The U.N. organization for the coordination of humanitarian affairs reports the rains came too late for the planting season.

OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said floods have killed at least 25 people in various parts of the country. The victims include nine children who died when their house flooded in the Benadir region, in the capital, Mogadishu.

""The Juba River has burst its banks, houses have been washed away and livestock have perished. There are also reports of flooding in the north of the country and there are continuous flash flood warnings across Somalia, especially for people living in low lying areas. In flooded areas, local communities are struggling to prevent further flooding by placing sandbags, poles and other materials to reinforce riverbanks,"" he said.

The World Food Program reports 2.7 million Somalis are short of food, with more than half-a-million on the brink of famine. An estimated 300,000 children under age five are malnourished, including 48,000 who are severely malnourished and at high risk of disease and death.

OCHA spokesman Laerke warned the combined impact of drought and floods is likely to worsen this critical situation.

""Both climate shocks cause displacement, jeopardize access to safe water, increase waterborne diseases and impact people's livelihoods. Despite increasing humanitarian needs, the funding forecast for 2021 is the worst in six years. This year's Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan requires $1 billion to assist four million people. As of today, the plan is only 19 percent funded,"" he said.

Laerke said OCHA and partners are using the limited funds at their disposal to step up operations in drought-affected areas and reach at least 353,000 people with aid. Urgent efforts, he adds also are under way to respond to the flash flooding.

· Between December 2020 and late April 2021, most parts of Somalia experienced moderate to severe drought as a result of below-average Deyr season rainfall from October to December 2020, warmer-than-normal temperatures during the January to March 2021 Jilaal season and a delayed, poor start and performance of 2021 Gu (March/April to June) season rainfall. Further rainfall is expected through mid-May, covering many parts of the country. However, cumulative rainfall amounts are likely to remain below average in many parts of central and southern Somalia. Moreover continuation of the Gu rains in late May through June is uncertain. Accordingly, the 2021 Gu season cereal production in Somalia is expected to be 20-40 percent below average.

· Pasture, browse and water availability continued to deteriorate/or deplete in most of northern and central Somalia and large parts of southern Somalia. Extreme water shortages, widespread reliance on water trucking, and high water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihood zones since January. Most livestock are concentrated near water points with limited migration options. Cases of abortion and livestock death among small ruminants have occurred due to insufficient feed, water, and drought-induced disease in several regions in northern and central Somalia.

· Due to the extended impact of the drought between late December 2020 and late April 2021, the food security situation in most rural livelihoods of northern and central Somalia has deteriorated. Due to limited herd size, lack of saleable animals, lack of access to milk, increased expenditures and high debt levels, most poor pastoral households in northern and central regions face food consumption gaps and are classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and September 2021.

· The food security situation in southern Somalia has also continued to deteriorate since the beginning of 2021, driven by the negative impacts of below average 2020 Deyr season main and off-season harvests, a harsh Jilaal that evolved into drought conditions, the delayed, poor start of 2021 Gu season rainfall, and insecurity on agricultural employment opportunities, crop development, and livestock production. Accordingly, most livelihood zones of southern Somalia are currently classified as Stressed (IPC Phase 2). However, a rising share of poor households in these livelihood zones face food consumption gaps, and several areas are projected to be classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between July and September 2021.

· Most of the IDPs in the main settlements and the urban poor are currently facing food consumption gaps due to limited income-generating activities and rising staple food prices that have reduced household purchasing power. As a result, they have been classified as Crisis (IPC Phase 3) between April and June 2021. Given rising food prices and reduced income and employment opportunities, food security outcomes are likely to remain in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) among IDPs in the main settlements and among poor urban households between July and September 2021.

· Approximately 2.73 million to 2.83 million people across Somalia are expected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes between April and September 2021, reflecting the deteriorating food security situation in the country.

· Food assistance reached an average of 1.6 million people per month between January and April 2021. Humanitarian assistance is preventing further deterioration of food security outcomes at the household level in many areas. However, given the scale of need, current level of food assistance is inadequate to prevent widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes. Given the worsening food security situation across Somalia, assistance must be scaled up and sustained through the end of the year.","Mon, 17 May 2021 19:43:41 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1567214-FSNAU-Quarterly-Brief-May-2021.png?itok=sIlVTW68,"['water', 'season', 'jiaal', 'security', 'ipc', 'food', 'nutrition', 'phase', 'poor', 'warning', 'gu', 'issued', 'impact', 'quarterly', 'crisis', '2021', 'somalia']",drought
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia braces for record levels of displacement as drought takes hold - Norwegian Refugee Council,https://www.nrc.no/news/2021/april/somalia-drought/,"“Once again Somalia is facing the prospect of serious drought. Water and pasture resources are depleting every day and resulting in people abandoning their homes with their livestock to search for better conditions. We are worried that drought coupled with conflict could see record levels of displacement this year,” said Mohamed Abdi, Country Director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Somalia.

According to data from the Protection and Monitoring Returns Network (PRMN), over one million people were displaced by floods, conflict and drought in Somalia last year, the highest figures recorded since 2016. So far, 112,000 have been displaced in the first three months of 2021, of whom 34 per cent were uprooted because of drought.

The last time more than a million people were displaced in Somalia was in 2017, when drought ravaged the country and caused widespread suffering and uncertainty.

“Drought will most likely be the driving factor displacing a large number of Somalis this year due to the poor performance of seasonal rains. Our staff on the ground are reporting that more than 50 districts are currently experiencing moderate to severe drought levels and it is expected to get worse,” Abdi said.

In Somalia, the impact of drought runs parallel with the impact of flooding in other parts of the country.

“It sounds contradictory but simultaneous flooding and drought are a reality in Somalia. Flooding was the main driver of high displacement last year. Some rains have dropped in the past number of days so our teams on the ground are also working towards flooding preparedness and to support those in critical need. We have to prepare for all climate shocks,” Mohamed Abdi explained.

The UN’s 2021 aid appeal for Somalia seeks $1.09 billion to assist four million people in dire need, as a result of widespread insecurity, recurring climate disasters and the indirect economic impact of Covid-19.

“Around 13 per cent of Somalia’s aid appeal has been donated so far, nowhere near enough to sustain the population as it battles drought and multiple other crises. The international community must not turn their back on Somalis, particularly pastoralist communities, who are impacted the most. We must do all we can to prevent another cycle of suffering in Somalia,” Abdi said.

Situation overview

Heavy Gu season rains have hit various parts of the country over the last week triggering flash floods and inundating vast swathes of land, but the short-term forecast suggests the heavy rainfall will begin to subside from mid-May onward.1 Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains: nine children in Banadir who died after their house flooded on 7 May; three people killed by lightning in Puntland and one child that fell into a pond of water on 5 May; four children who died in adam full of rainwater in Sool region on 7 May; one person killed by flooding in Buurhakaba, Bay region and seven IDPs who died on 9 May in Garasbaley district, Banadir, following the collapse of their house due to heavy rains. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms.

In Somaliland, heavy rains on 30 April flooded the dry river valley in Hargeisa, affecting around 40 houses and washing away seven vehicles. The floods also temporally affected some of the IDPs who are living in sub-standard shelters.

Partners report that the intermittent rains characterized by violent storms left an estimated 359 households (2,154 people) homeless, with some temporarily squatting on private land and others seeking refuge with relatives.2 On 7 May, four children, aged 10 to 13 died in a water dam at Goljano village in Caynabo district, Sool region. On 5 May, the Somaliland meteorological department issued a forecast of heavy rains for next week in Awdal, Waqooyi Galbeed and Sanaag regions and warned people living in low-lying areas to prepare for possible flash floods.

In Puntland, torrential rains and flash floods on 5 May affected the Bossaso-Garowe road. The main bridge was damaged, making it impassable for traders. According to the Puntland Disaster Management Authority and local elders, at least three people were killed by a lightning strike and a child died after falling into a pond of water. Damage to two bridges on Qayaadsame river affected the movement of goods and people from Bossaso. In addition, flash floods washed away over 1,250 heads of livestock and damaged shelters in low lying areas of Ceel Daahir under Bossaso district and Berri Cad under Garowe between 27 April and 5 May.

The flooding in Jowhar occurred due to open breakages along the river. The road between Jowhar and Mahaday through airport road is inaccessible. On 1 May, a breakage along the riverbank at Moyko closed the main road connecting Jowhar to Mogadishu through Balcad. This is the main transportation route for food and other essential commodities.

FAO/SWALIM issued a flood advisory on 8 May indicating that observed levels of the Shabelle River have continued to rise alarmingly in the past two weeks. According to FAO/SWALIM, there is a high flood risk in Belet Weyne in the coming days and in middle and lower reaches due to heavy rains in Hiraan and Middle Shabelle regions.

Heavy rains in South West State on 8 May killed at least one person and 28 livestock in Buurhakaba town. Some 112 houses were either damaged or destroyed and around 615 households (3,690 people) were displaced mainly from lowlying flood-prone areas. The rains have also disrupted transport between main towns in parts of South West State. Low lying sections of Afgooye town have been inundated, affecting around 20 households. The routes to the villages have been cut off by rains and the movement of people and traffic remain restricted. Further reports indicate that around 3,500 people have been displaced by flash floods in Damaley, Balguri and Raqeyke villages of Afgooye town. The flash floods damaged unconfirmed hectares of farmlands with crops.

In Galmudug, several trucks loaded with food commodities got stuck in muddy roads between Cadaado and Cabudwaaq following moderate rains on 2 May. About 100 goats were killed by a thunderstorm in Xanabura rural village, Cabudwaaq district.

Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow on 9 May, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, following heavy rains in the Somali region of Ethiopia and the Ethiopian Highlands. Three villages, Warayle, Buula Qalooc and Bara Baraay, were flooded affecting about 35 farms. The Dawa river may also break its banks. The local authority in Doolow has alerted farmers to the situation and water pumps have been relocated from the river.

A neighborhood in Ceelqalaw area in Wadajir district, Banadir, was submerged, forcing about 1,500 people to leave their homes. Two houses collapsed and several others were partially destroyed. The lowland areas and main access roads in Wadijir district are the worst affected. Wadajir district is one of the areas where a large number of families recently relocated due to recent elections-related violence. On 9 May, local sources in Garasbaley district reported that seven IDPs died following the collapse of their house due to heavy rainfall in Al Adale IDP camp. Five other people were severely injured and five houses destroyed.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. The country has, since 1990, experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. As of April, more than 80 per cent of the country was experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions following below average October to December 2020 Deyr rains, followed by a harsh and warmer than normal January to March Jilaal season and a delayed and poor start of the current April to June Gu season. Despite the heavy rains that have hit parts of Somalia, the rains have come too late for the planting season; therefore, further exacerbating already significant food security concerns.","Sun, 09 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1566270-Gu%202021%20flash%20floods%20update%201%20final%202.png?itok=s52V6HmL,"['killed', 'season', 'floods', 'rains', 'river', 'heavy', 'gu', 'died', 'flash', 'district', 'update', 'flooding', '2021', 'villages', 'somalia']",flood

The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar.

MOGADISHU, May 17 (Xinhua) -- The recent torrential rains across Somalia have affected around 166,000 people, the United Nations humanitarian agency said on Monday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while the rains have reduced in some areas, it is alarming that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on April 25 and recent heavy rains causing riverine and flash flooding.

According to OCHA, the combined impact of drought and floods is likely to exacerbate the already critical food security situation in Somalia, where more than 2.7 million people are projected to be food insecure.

""Furthermore, these climate shocks will cause displacement, jeopardize access to safe water, contribute to an increase of water-borne diseases and negatively impact livelihoods,"" OCHA said in its latest Floods Update report released in Mogadishu.

The UN said key air and road transportation routes have been affected, impacting on the availability of food supplies and partners' ability to reach affected populations.

It said the 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan requires 1.09 billion U.S. dollars to assist four million people but is only 19 percent funded as of Sunday.

On May 9, the UN agency said at least 25 people were killed from May 3 to 9 due to heavy rains which were pounding several parts of Somalia.

BY AIMÉE-NOËL MBIYOZO AND OTTILIA ANNA MAUNGANIDZE

Climate change poses serious security threats in Africa. Global organisations, regional communities and countries are increasingly recognising this fact, but that isn’t enough – urgent action is needed.

In March 2021, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AU PSC) issued an unprecedented communiqué dedicated to the effects of climate change on peace, security and stability in Africa. It was the first to specifically address the threats climate change poses to safety and call for specific actions, including establishing an AU Special Fund for Climate Change.

In April, United States President Joe Biden convened a Leaders’ Summit on Climate for 40 world leaders, including from Nigeria, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Gabon and Kenya. The meeting included a theme on responding to the global security challenges posed by climate change.

In early May, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development included a climate change session. World leaders, researchers and practitioners talked about the importance of reducing climate security risks in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and factoring in a climate perspective when dealing with violent extremism.

There isn’t an easily defined direct causal link between climate change and conflict. Nonetheless, it does exacerbate security risks, including violent conflict. In this sense, climate change is a ‘risk multiplier’, ‘fragility amplifier’ or ‘conflict catalyst’. For Africa, where there is already a confluence of risks, it can trigger insecurity and violence.

Studies have linked a 0.5°C warming with a 10% to 20% increase in the risk of deadly conflict. As a threat multiplier, climate change exposes and exploits existing vulnerabilities. It worsens pre-existing tensions, weak governance and other socio-economic factors. This is evident in parts of the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin, the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa.

However, the same climate threats that will increase violence in one region may not do so in another. Zimbabwe, for example, is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change but isn’t at high risk for armed conflict.

Eighty percent of current United Nations (UN)-led peace operations are deployed in countries ranked most exposed to climate change. All of the largest African missions are in climate change hotspots, including South Sudan, Mali, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Sudan and Somalia.

A recent SIPRI paper details how environmental changes in Mali have impacted violence and insecurity. Mali hosts the world’s largest UN peacekeeping mission. Armed extremist groups, ethnic militia, government corruption, a military coup and inter-communal violence contribute to a deteriorating situation.

Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. Most Malians rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, including farming, fishing, forestry and pastoralism that employ nearly 80% of the labour force. All these sectors rely on rainfall, which has become increasingly erratic.

Unreliable rainfall and land degradation have contributed to lower crop yield. With a 3% annual population growth, the result is escalating competition over increasingly scarce resources. This contributes to intra-communal conflict. With endemic disputes between farmers and herders in Mali and across the Sahel, the potential for escalation is high. At the same time, traditional conflict management systems have broken down.

Governance and the rule of law are already weak in Mali, and communities feel marginalised and economically excluded. Extremist groups exploit this by offering alternatives to justice and access to natural resources as recruitment tools. There is evidence that these extremists have more success recruiting during and following low rainfall periods.

Similar patterns have emerged in Somalia, where both a UN-mandated assistance mission with a climate adviser and an AU peacekeeping mission work to stabilise the country. Competition for political and economic power has converged with struggles to control land and water. Livestock and crops make up around 75% of the country’s GDP and 93% of total exports. Both have become increasingly fragile because of more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

Increased competition has exacerbated existing tensions. Extremist groups such as al-Shabaab use water and natural resources as control mechanisms. Al-Shabaab has been accused of breaking riverbanks, taxing charcoal and poisoning wells.

Historically, violent conflict was the primary driver of forced displacement in Somalia and across the region. In 2020, however, 79% of displaced people in Somalia cited drought or flooding as their main cause for moving. Large-scale displacements have fuelled existing community and ethnic tensions.

Despite contributing very low carbon emissions, several regions in Africa are suffering some of the worst climate change impacts. Climate resilience strategies are crucial. However, weak governments and poor infrastructure combine to hamper such plans, meaning the effects of climate change hit extra hard.

In this void, humanitarian actors and peacekeeping missions can assist. However, climate threats also make their operations more difficult. Increasingly, extreme weather patterns affect their mobility and hinder their ability to respond.

There are some promising developments: the AU PSC and UN Security Council engagement, recent pronouncements by world leaders at the climate summit, and the appointment of a United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia climate adviser. These need to be matched with action. As attention increases, African states and institutions should use the opportunity to develop strategies that centre on local solutions.

The extent to which climate threats, conflict and displacement translate into violence depends on context, which means that localised responses are vital. When solutions are drawn up and implemented, those whose lives and livelihoods are being disrupted must be involved. The process should start with building local awareness and drawing on community leadership.

Internationally, pledges to generate financial support for climate mitigation and adaptation are falling short. Measures are needed to translate rhetoric into action.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Who's afraid of COVID-19? Somalia's battle with the virus - The New Humanitarian,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/analysis/2021/5/5/whos-afraid-of-covid-19-somalias-battle-with-virus,"NAIROBI

With one of the weakest health systems in the world and a government in turmoil, Somalia is struggling with a new wave of coronavirus infections that will likely lead to a surge in unrecorded and unrecognised deaths, health officials and aid workers warn.

Officially, there have been more than 14,000 confirmed cases and over 720 fatalities, but “this is the tip of the iceberg,” Mohamed Mohamud Ali Fuje, chief medical adviser to the government’s COVID-19 National Task Force, told The New Humanitarian.

Somalia has a poor testing rate. Just 156,000 tests have been performed in a country of more than 15 million people, so gauging the severity of the outbreak through official data is extremely unreliable, while information on any new variants is almost non-existent.

The lack of healthcare coverage and an absence of documentation means “the actual death toll is much higher than the figures reported,” said Fuje. Most sick people are cared for at home, and the dead are typically buried according to Islamic tradition within 24 hours.

Even if patients do make it to hospital, the lack of equipment – including oxygen – means “there's almost a zero chance of surviving if one develops COVID-19 complications,"" a UN health worker in the southwestern city of Kismayo – who asked not to be named as they weren’t authorised to speak to the media – told The New Humanitarian.

Somalia received 300,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in March and has reportedly inoculated close to 120,000 people with the first jab of a two-shot rollout. But the vaccines delivered so far cover under 0.5 percent of the population.

That means the wearing of masks and social distancing remain vital, but such measures are only being very loosely adhered to. “Nobody wears a mask, let alone socially distance,” said Mogadishu-based freelance journalist and filmmaker Abdirahman Ahmed Aden. “They don’t take COVID seriously; they don’t see it as a risk.”

In the first COVID-19 wave, from April to June last year, healthcare and funeral workers reported anecdotal evidence of an unprecedented spike in fatalities, especially in the capital, Mogadishu: The number of graves dug in the city jumped by at least fourfold.

The second wave, beginning in February this year, has been even more severe. According to the official data, more people have died in the past three months than during the entire March to December period in 2020.

“In this second wave, I estimate Kismayo [alone] lost around 300 people between March and mid-April,” the UN health worker said. “Gravediggers in Kismayo were overwhelmed – so much so that [bulldozers] were being used to dig graves.""

The surge in COVID-19 cases comes as the country is in political gridlock, grappling with an electoral impasse. Delayed elections cannot happen because of a bitter stand-off between President Mohamed Abdullahi “Farmajo'' and the opposition on how to hold the polls. Armed groups loyal to opposition leaders occupy parts of Mogadishu.

“People are much more concerned by the political crisis in the country than COVID,” Aden told The New Humanitarian.

Fragile and disaster prone

Somalia has struggled with three decades of armed conflict, recurring climate shocks, and – as a result – ever-deepening levels of poverty and vulnerability.

When the pandemic hit last year, the country was already grappling with floods that had forced more than half a million people from their homes, plus the largest locust invasion for a quarter of a century that threatened the coming harvest and pasture land.

It now faces a drought emergency, with a second consecutive season of failed rains predicted. “The unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, [means] many lives are at stake,” humanitarian affairs minister Khadija Diriye said in a press release at the end of April.

Humanitarian action – from responding to the six million people currently in need of assistance, to mounting a coordinated COVID-19 response – is complicated by the country’s fragility and limited administrative capacity.

The internationally recognised federal government in Mogadishu is weak and its authority and edicts barely reach beyond the capital.

There are five semi-autonomous federal member states, whose relationships with Mogadishu range from ambivalent to bad. Somaliland in the northwest has declared its unilateral independence, while the violent jihadist group al-Shabab controls most of the rural hinterland, several towns, and major supply routes in the south and the centre of the country.

Al-Shabab initially ridiculed the COVID-19 threat, but has since done a U-turn and accepted the danger. It has, however, refused access to health teams to territory it controls and has urged people to reject the AstraZeneca vaccine as dangerous.

The risks of such a policy extend beyond Somalia. A large untreated reservoir of COVID-19, where variants could potentially mutate, would be not only a regional threat but possibly a global one as well.

Aid agency dependent

The federal government’s COVID-19 task force comprises government line ministries, donors, UN agencies, and NGOs. The states have created similar structures, but coordination is haphazard.

“Even the states deemed friendly to Mogadishu did not coordinate smoothly with the federal government,” Zakaria Yusuf, Somalia analyst for the International Crisis Group, told The New Humanitarian. At both federal and state level, ""the capacity of government institutions… is weak”, he added.

As with all humanitarian crises in Somalia, the COVID-19 response has largely fallen to the international aid community, which is bunkered in the heavily guarded “green zone” around the airport. Grounded by insecurity and the risk of spreading the virus, aid agency staff provide planning, logistics, and expertise, but are reliant on national civil society partners to do much of the work outside.

UN agencies have provided funding and assisted the federal government and regional authorities to procure diagnostic kits and other medical supplies, which are transported around the country on humanitarian flights.

Three molecular COVID-19 testing labs have been established by the World Health Organization in Mogadishu, Garowe, and Hargeisa. The WHO also covers the operational costs, as well as providing salary support to 11 technicians. There is also one private lab in Mogadishu.

No new lockdown

Aware of the almost non-existent testing and tracing capacity, the initial response to the first wave of the pandemic by the federal government and some states was a lockdown. International and domestic flights were prohibited, schools and universities were shut, and dusk-to-dawn curfews imposed – measures that punished everyone, from the urban poor to business owners.

This time around, the authorities have been more lax, and markets, mosques, and even football stadiums have remained open. Aside from the public health messages carried by the public media – or daubed on walls – life has continued relatively normally.

covid-mogadishu-beware.jpg Abdirahman Ahmed Aden/TNH “Beware COVID-19” – graffiti in the Ceelgaab district of Mogadishu. The government has mounted public information campaigns warning of the threat of the virus, on the radio and in print.

“People wouldn’t obey the rules anymore anyway,” said Aden, the filmmaker. “At the beginning of the year, when the government said it would fine people that didn’t wear face masks, people would pull up their masks when they saw police. Now, no one bothers.”

A new lockdown in Mogadishu would be unpopular, reflecting badly on a government struggling for political support. Most people depend on a daily wage, with no welfare safety nets to fall back on.

In Mogadishu alone, more than 800,000 displaced people live in over 700 overcrowded camps and unofficial sites scattered across the city. These long-term refugees from the countryside, escaping drought and conflict, are largely unassisted and lack even basic services – including water, key to the most rudimentary COVID-19 protection measures.

“At the beginning of the year, when the government said it would fine people that didn’t wear face masks, people would pull up their masks when they saw police. Now, no one bothers.”

While the health risks of the virus aren’t immediately apparent to a lot of people, the economic effects of the pandemic have been keenly felt. The World Bank projected that COVID-19 would cut growth by 2.5 percent last year, after earlier forecasting the economy would grow by 3.2 percent.

Somalia is estimated to receive approximately $1.3 billion to $2 billion per year in remittances from its large diaspora community. The transfers are normally a lifeline for close to 30 percent of the population. But remittances fell sharply in 2020 and could decrease again this year if the global economic recovery is not as robust as hoped.

Weak and dependent, the Somali government seems to have few resources other than persuasion to battle the virus.

“From the beginning, we understood the limited capacity of our Somalia institutions,” said Fuje, the chief medical adviser. As a result, “we decided to focus on awareness campaigns to sensitise the people and limit spread.”

But these efforts don’t appear to be working, and the lesson being learnt around the world at the moment – from Brazil to India to Turkey – is that if you don’t do enough to contain a virus that can mutate so rapidly, new waves are often worse than previous peaks.

The Horn of Africa region is staring at food shortages after the delayed start of the long rains in some countries and below-average rainfall in others.

The UN and the government of Somalia have jointly declared drought in the country after officials determined that 80 percent of Somalia had received little rainfall. Usually, much of the Horn considers March to May as a planting season.

However, projections by the Famine Early Warnings Systems Network and the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) and Red Crescent Societies indicate that the situation is likely to get worse as we get into May down to September if the weather situation does not change.

“In eastern Africa, worse outcomes are expected through May 2021 across much of the region (North East Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia — including the restive Tigray region) attributed to conflict and displacement, long term macroeconomic challenges, the economic impacts of Covid-19, multiple weather shocks and the desert locust upsurge,” the IFRC Food Insecurity and Hunger for Africa bulletin says.

A situational report by the Federal Government of Somalia and humanitarian partners said the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought and warned that the population there was on the “brink of human catastrophe.”

Somalia’s Humanitarian Response Plan requires $1.09 billion to assist about four million people, and more than three million who are in acute need.

In Somalia, drought is almost routine, appearing once in every two years. Since 1990, it has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards including 12 droughts and 19 floods.

This is three times the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990.

In Kenya, Cabinet Secretary for Agriculture Peter Munya announced on April 14 that the country will not be facing an acute maize shortage at least until later in the year, saying “We will have a surplus of at least 11.8 million bags by the end of May.”

An assessment by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group in February puts the population at risk at over 1.4 million people who are in need of urgent life-saving support.

IFRC notes that in South Sudan, 60 per cent of the population (7.2 million people) are expected to face acute food insecurity between April and July.

“This includes 2.4 million in emergency situations and 108,000 people in catastrophic situations,” the federation states.

Ethiopia, just like Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan and Somalia is facing one of its worst locust outbreaks in 25 years rendering crop production, food security and millions of lives at the dire risk of starvation.

Tigray region is particularly in an “extremely grave” quoting remarks made by the High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi who alongside a high ranking team of UN officials toured the region in February to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground.

“People need all possible forms of support; food items, non-food items, medicine, water, shelter and access to banks and telecommunication systems,” Grandi told journalists in Addis Ababa.

He added that though the government of Ethiopia had reported on some progress being made in improving the security situation in the region, isolated incidents are still taking place resulting in looting, various kinds of violence including rape and the unfortunate loss of six humanitarian workers.

On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed the need for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to end the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights crisis in the country including the growing “risk of famine” in Tigray region.

This year, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes with at least 3.4 million people projected to be affected by drought conditions 380,000 are expected to be displaced by the end of this year.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia: Humanitarian leadership declares drought - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-humanitarian-leadership-declares-drought,"(Mogadishu, 25 April 2021) – Based on observed drought conditions and rainfall forecasts, the Federal Government of Somalia and the humanitarian community are deeply concerned about the deterioration of the dry conditions in Somalia which has now escalated to a drought situation.

More than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. Limited rainfall amounts are expected in May and June with larger parts of Somaliland, Puntland, central regions and Gedo region being the worst affected.

“Somalia experiences a cyclical pattern of drought every five to six years and the failure of the rains thus far spells disaster. At a time when communities are already struggling to cope with the recent water shortages in many parts of the country, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, many lives are at stake,” said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Khadija Diriye.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. In 2021, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting negative impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by the end of 2021, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced.

The loss of livelihoods forces families to rely on increasingly severe coping mechanisms, worsened by political instability, armed conflict and forced displacement. “We are at the brink of a human catastrophe amidst an already dire humanitarian situation,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator, Adam Abdelmoula. “The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster.”

The Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requires US$ 1.09 billion to assist four million people, including more than three million people in acute need. As of today, the HRP is 15 per cent funded.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. The already dire humanitarian situation in 2021 will likely be exacerbated by another drought. Already in 2021, more than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by year end, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced. Access to clean water is compromised by the water shortages and the cost of water is skyrocketing by 60 per cent in some areas. This forces the most vulnerable households to travel long distances in search of safe water. Poor hygiene practices have increased, livestock diseases have been reported across all districts, and pasture has been depleted. Herders are resorting to handfeeding their livestock using locally produced cereals, which has caused cereal prices to rise by 30 per cent. The worst affected areas include parts of Somaliland and Puntland, central regions and Gedo region. The WASH and health clusters have ramped up responses in the most affected areas. However, funding shortfalls remain a major challenge in scaling up the response. As of 25 April, the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan is 15 per cent funded. Without immediate mitigative assistance, drought conditions will be a key driver of displacement, communicable diseases and protection violations in the country.","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564513-Drought%20Update_snapshot_Somalia_1.png?itok=0iz74cxZ,"['areas', 'water', '26', 'conditions', 'climaterelated', 'situation', 'drought', 'cent', 'update', 'country', '2021', 'affected', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought

Khadija M Diriye, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Federal Republic of Somalia, commented, “Somalia’s hazard profile is dominated by droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, desert locust, diseases (epidemic/pandemic), and terrorism that disrupt people’s livelihoods, destroy the infrastructure, divert planned use of resources, interrupt economic activities and retard development.

“The impacts of natural hazards do not occur in isolation; but recognition of such cause and effect on a national scale has encouraged the Government of Somalia in taking on a paradigm shift from crisis management to risk management. This will enable us to utilise our finite resources in a more efficient and timely manner towards assisting the vulnerable populations in the event of disasters. Therefore, we are proud to sign the ARC Establishment Agreement,asits35th Member,as well as the MoU, with a strong commitment to taking the necessary steps to ensure that the collaboration leads to building of our national response capacities against the adverse impacts of natural disasters.”

UN-ASG and ARC Group-Director General, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong also said, “As the nature and intensity of natural catastrophes evolve across the region, we maintain that the continent will be better protected through a pooled-risk approach bringing together countries and leveraging smart partnerships. Today, the ARC Group proudly welcomes the Federal Republic of Somalia as its 35th Member State. By simultaneously signing the ARC Treaty and MoU, the Government (of Somalia) has demonstrated a clear commitment to strengthening the country’s disaster risk reduction capacities; and thereby joining a growing number of African Union Member States that are accessing our tools to create coordinated contingency plans before catastrophes strike.

“We would like to particularly convey our readiness to work with the (Somalian) Authorities in accurately profiling their natural disaster risks and designing quantified response plans to better secure the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations in the event of a peril.”

A framework will be developed to facilitate cooperation between African Risk Capacity (ARC) and the Somali Government to address the impact of extreme weather events.

This will include provision of training to support Government personnel, as well as preparing Somalia’s potential participation in future parametric (drought/flood/tropical cyclone) insurance risk pools operated by ARC.

Since 2014, 65 policies have been signed by African countries, providing cumulative parametric insurance coverage of US $719 million.

ARC relies on efficient access to global reinsurance markets to underpin its ability to pay claims against the growing risk pool, meaning that expansion and diversification of the risk pool are both key to recognise economies of scale.

Recent developments at ARC add diversification to the risk pool, such as plans to expand into flood risk, an expansion of the ARC client base to include non-sovereign actors, ARC’s recent plan to further expand its risk pool by underwriting inwards reinsurance, and the writing of its first parametric tropical cyclone cover.

These efforts and continued work to ready other countries in Africa, such as Somalia, to take up parametric disaster insurance promise to further expand ARC’s risk pool and therefore its ability to access reinsurance markets more efficiently.","Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://149448276.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/african-risk-capacity-logo.png,"['risk', 'disaster', 'pool', 'mou', 'targets', 'natural', 'addition', 'arc', 'african', 'insurance', 'capacity', 'parametric', 'somalia']",none

KEY MESSAGES

The start of the April to June gu rainfall season was either delayed, significantly below average, or poorly distributed across Somalia. As this follows a below-average deyr season in late 2020 and a harsh dry season in early 2021, drought was prevalent in mid-April, leading to water scarcity and poor crop and livestock production conditions. Further, rainfall is forecast to subside from mid-May into June.

Due to poor rainfall, the July harvests and seasonal livestock production will be below average. Gu crop development is delayed in several northwestern and southern agropastoral and riverine livelihood zones, and yield losses are likely due to the shortened growing period. In northern and central pastoral areas, there are reports of atypical livestock migration and deaths. While mid-season rainfall will partially alleviate water and pasture scarcity, livestock health, value, and reproduction will not fully recover before the dry season. Many poor households will be unable to meet their minimum food needs due to reductions in agricultural labor income, own-produced food stocks, livestock saleability and reproduction, and milk availability.","Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1566139-Somalia%20Food%20Security%20Outlook%20Update%2C%20April%202021.png?itok=KU1TMxuj,"['outlook', 'water', 'season', 'late', 'security', 'food', 'poor', 'reproduction', 'gu', 'livestock', 'production', 'scarcity', 'update', 'rainfall', '2021', 'somalia']",drought

They left the rural area of Ceel-Garaar along with many other families after the three water wells dried up in February. Since the beginning of the year, 240 of Mohamoud’s goats have died due to lack of pasture and water.

Mohamoud used $80 sent by his brother working as a casual labourer in Mogadishu to pay a tuk-tuk taxi to transport his family in two trips the 40 kilometres to the town of Luq. They are living there in a flimsy hut Mohamoud put together using cartons and plastic bags they were given by their host, who works as livestock broker.

“My family and the livestock lived a good life during the rainy seasons, but this is our life now, full of hardships despite the Gu’ rains,” he recounted sadly.

“My family used to eat three meals a day, but now getting one meal is a hustle. I don’t have livestock to sell to provide for my family. We are living with these relatives and I don’t know how long they can host us.”

Mohamoud said he tried to secure unskilled labour jobs on construction sites, but he has not been lucky. He is considering relocating his family to internal displacement camps across the border in Ethiopia’s Somali region, where he heard that the World Food Programme is providing families with wheat rations.

“I would have migrated long ago, but I don’t have the money to travel, and we can’t reach there on foot,” he said.

Families across Gedo region, one of the hardest hit by the drought and water crisis, have been moving in all directions seeking survival.

Warsame Mohamoud Isack, a pastoralist living in a rural part of Elwak district, lost 60 of his 100 goats in the drought. He was forced to migrate to Caashacad village, 75 km from Elwak town. He has accumulated $500 in debt mostly buying food from local shops for his family of 16 members.

“The past few months have been tough. The pastoralists have been forced to shift to the nearest towns for help,” said Warsame, who is living in a shelter he put up for the family.

His children are helping him graze his remaining goats in the village.

He hopes to repay his debt when his goats regain the weight they lost in the prolonged dry season, and he can sell them at a good price.

The head of Gedo region’s social affairs department, Ibrahim Mohamed Gumow, told Radio Ergo that 90,000 pastoralist and farming families have been displaced from their homes in the region since December 2020. He said there had been a double tragedy of locust invasions and the early drying up of wells.

Most of the families migrated in the last four months as conditions worsened and their livestock started to die.

However, Ibrahim said he is hopeful the Gu’ rains will ease the food shortage crisis, as some of the families were left with some livestock and the farmers are planting crops. “The current rain is not completely enough to get these displaced families back on their feet, but it will help them get pasture for their livestock,” he said.","Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.53/s26.7b4.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sawirka-Gedo.jpg?time=1622777328,"['region', 'meal', 'gedo', 'food', 'living', 'day', 'rural', 'herders', 'livestock', 'mohamoud', 'goats', 'families', 'droughthit', 'family']",drought

As the drought in Somalia scorches the land, the chances for a family’s survival wither and die like crops and livestock, forcing them to search for lifelines elsewhere.

In February, Hodan Khalif*, 14, moved to an internally displaced camp (IDP) 15 km from her home with her mother, two older sisters and younger brother. After the family’s crops failed, her father left with their herd of animals to search for grazing lands further afield. Ms. Khalif is one of the lucky ones attending school in the camp; some children must stop their education to help run their households. When she’s not in classes, she searches for firewood and water, walking 3 km to fetch 10 litres of water carried in a bucket.

Drought conditions are spreading throughout the country against a backdrop of high levels of forced displacement. According to an OCHA report, more than 1.3 million Somalis were displaced in 2020, and 112,000 have been displaced in the first three months of 2021, about 34 percent of them due to drought conditions. Scientists have linked the frequency and severity of natural disasters to climate change.

Women and girls bear the brunt

UNFPA Representative in Somalia Anders Thomsen said the drought conditions are impeding services, especially to vulnerable women and girls. “Already, many girls and women are poor and disenfranchised,” he said. “They cannot access essential health care services.”

UNFPA has distributed 3,620 dignity kits, which contain basic hygiene necessities including soap and detergent, a toothbrush and toothpaste and underwear and menstrual pads, throughout Somaliland and Puntland. Ms. Khalif said the kit reduces stress and anxiety: “The items provide me with freedom and time.” Still, “I miss my father. The [camp] is helpful, but it does not provide me with a sense of home.”

During the distribution of the kits, women and adolescent girls receive information on how to protect themselves from gender-based violence. UNFPA has also deployed eight mobile teams to deliver gender-based violence, protection and reproductive health services and is treating rape survivors in both IDP camps and host communities.

Awaiting better days

In the absence of humanitarian assistance, a Food Security Analysis System report published by the United Nations in February indicates that up to 2.7 million people across Somalia are expected to face food disruptions or depleted resources including crops and livestock through mid-2021. Drivers of acute food insecurity include the compounding effects of poor and erratic rainfall, flooding, desert locust infestation, socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 and conflict.

As the majority among the poor in Somalia, women – especially heads of households and those with disabilities – bear the brunt of a situation completely out of their control. So they wait for the skies to open up and the relief the rains might bring.

2021-05-17

Climate change poses serious security threats in Africa. Global organisations, regional communities and countries are increasingly recognising this fact, but that isn’t enough – urgent action is needed.

In March 2021, the African Union Peace and Security Council (AU PSC) issued an unprecedented communiqué dedicated to the effects of climate change on peace, security and stability in Africa. It was the first to specifically address the threats climate change poses to safety and call for specific actions, including establishing an AU Special Fund for Climate Change.

In April, United States President Joe Biden convened a Leaders’ Summit on Climate for 40 world leaders, including from Nigeria, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Gabon and Kenya. The meeting included a theme on responding to the global security challenges posed by climate change.

In early May, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute’s (SIPRI) Stockholm Forum on Peace and Development included a climate change session. World leaders, researchers and practitioners talked about the importance of reducing climate security risks in peacekeeping and peacebuilding and factoring in a climate perspective when dealing with violent extremism.

Studies have linked a 0.5°C warming with a 10% to 20% increase in the risk of deadly conflict

There isn’t an easily defined direct causal link between climate change and conflict. Nonetheless, it does exacerbate security risks, including violent conflict. In this sense, climate change is a ‘risk multiplier’, ‘fragility amplifier’ or ‘conflict catalyst’. For Africa, where there is already a confluence of risks, it can trigger insecurity and violence.

Studies have linked a 0.5°C warming with a 10% to 20% increase in the risk of deadly conflict. As a threat multiplier, climate change exposes and exploits existing vulnerabilities. It worsens pre-existing tensions, weak governance and other socio-economic factors. This is evident in parts of the Sahel, the Lake Chad Basin, the Horn of Africa and Southern Africa.

However, the same climate threats that will increase violence in one region may not do so in another. Zimbabwe, for example, is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change but isn’t at high risk for armed conflict.

Eighty percent of current United Nations (UN)-led peace operations are deployed in countries ranked most exposed to climate change. All of the largest African missions are in climate change hotspots, including South Sudan, Mali, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Sudan and Somalia.

A recent SIPRI paper details how environmental changes in Mali have impacted violence and insecurity. Mali hosts the world’s largest UN peacekeeping mission. Armed extremist groups, ethnic militia, government corruption, a military coup and inter-communal violence contribute to a deteriorating situation.

In Mali, violent extremist groups have more success recruiting during and after low rainfall periods

Mali is one of the poorest countries in the world. Most Malians rely on natural resources for their livelihoods, including farming, fishing, forestry and pastoralism that employ nearly 80% of the labour force. All these sectors rely on rainfall, which has become increasingly erratic.

Unreliable rainfall and land degradation have contributed to lower crop yield. With a 3% annual population growth, the result is escalating competition over increasingly scarce resources. This contributes to intra-communal conflict. With endemic disputes between farmers and herders in Mali and across the Sahel, the potential for escalation is high. At the same time, traditional conflict management systems have broken down.

Governance and the rule of law are already weak in Mali, and communities feel marginalised and economically excluded. Extremist groups exploit this by offering alternatives to justice and access to natural resources as recruitment tools. There is evidence that these extremists have more success recruiting during and following low rainfall periods.

Similar patterns have emerged in Somalia, where both a UN-mandated assistance mission with a climate adviser and an AU peacekeeping mission work to stabilise the country. Competition for political and economic power has converged with struggles to control land and water. Livestock and crops make up around 75% of the country’s GDP and 93% of total exports. Both have become increasingly fragile because of more frequent and severe droughts and floods.

Increased competition has exacerbated existing tensions. Extremist groups such as al-Shabaab use water and natural resources as control mechanisms. Al-Shabaab has been accused of breaking riverbanks, taxing charcoal and poisoning wells.

Internationally, pledges of financial support for climate mitigation and adaptation are falling short

Historically, violent conflict was the primary driver of forced displacement in Somalia and across the region. In 2020, however, 79% of displaced people in Somalia cited drought or flooding as their main cause for moving. Large-scale displacements have fuelled existing community and ethnic tensions.

Despite contributing very low carbon emissions, several regions in Africa are suffering some of the worst climate change impacts. Climate resilience strategies are crucial. However, weak governments and poor infrastructure combine to hamper such plans, meaning the effects of climate change hit extra hard.

In this void, humanitarian actors and peacekeeping missions can assist. However, climate threats also make their operations more difficult. Increasingly, extreme weather patterns affect their mobility and hinder their ability to respond.

There are some promising developments: the AU PSC and UN Security Council engagement, recent pronouncements by world leaders at the climate summit, and the appointment of a United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia climate adviser. These need to be matched with action. As attention increases, African states and institutions should use the opportunity to develop strategies that centre on local solutions.

The extent to which climate threats, conflict and displacement translate into violence depends on context, which means that localised responses are vital. When solutions are drawn up and implemented, those whose lives and livelihoods are being disrupted must be involved. The process should start with building local awareness and drawing on community leadership.

Internationally, pledges to generate financial support for climate mitigation and adaptation are falling short. Measures are needed to translate rhetoric into action.

The Middle East and many parts of Africa are arid regions with long experience of drought. However, anthropogenic climate change threatens to significantly exacerbate these challenges. In 2017, the World Bank noted that, “while population and economic growth will increase water demands, climate change will be the primary driver for the most pronounced changes in surface water stress across” the Middle East. The UN has projected that temperature increases in the Sahel will be 1.5 times higher than the global average. Multiple studies indicate that the risks of prolonged, severe drought will be higher as the global climate shifts. Climate change is not the only problem: Population growth, economic development, unsustainable agricultural policies, poor infrastructure, and other factors contribute. Nonetheless, climate change will intensify all of these factors.

Increased drought conditions and more variable rainfall patterns will present many challenges to the Middle East and Africa. One of those challenges will be the way that water stress intersects with conflict and violent extremist groups. While there is statistical evidence that climate change increases the risk of conflict, it is often difficult to draw clear causal links between drought and conflict. In any conflict, there are multiple factors that contribute to violence. Drought puts stress on existing fractures in a society and increases the risk of conflict by exacerbating problems such as inequality, unemployment, migration, food shortages and governance failures. Drought diminishes a society’s overall resilience.

Conflict over water in the Middle East and Africa is as old as civilization, but climate change and population growth are compounding age-old problems. In some cases, water shortages lead to direct forms of conflict. Tribes, local communities and even countries can dispute and contest access to water sources. On a national level, upstream states can take steps that threaten downstream states’ basic access to water, leading to disputes that increase the risk of war — reflected in recent concerns about potential conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt.

More often, drought and water shortages contribute to conflict indirectly by weakening societal and governing structures and putting more stress on existing divisions. Drought can increase competition for food and push food prices higher, with destabilizing effects. Water shortages undermine faith in governments, putting strain on societies that are already struggling with weak governance and benefiting insurgent or extremist groups. War can damage water infrastructure — as it has in Yemen and Syria, for example — which puts further pressures on vulnerable populations. These factors contribute to feedback loops that erode a country’s or a community’s stability.

In many cases, prolonged droughts so badly damage agricultural communities that they lead to migration to urban areas, as has happened in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Such migration from an unusually severe and prolonged drought clearly contributed to the factors behind the Syrian civil war.

Water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. Kerry Boyd Anderson

Another negative impact of the increased risk of drought is that water shortages provide violent extremist organizations with opportunities to expand their influence. At the most basic level, there are examples of extremist groups attacking farmers and stealing their food supplies in the midst of drought or famine, as Al-Shabaab reportedly did in Somalia during the 2011 famine. Such actions contribute to humanitarian disaster and conflict cycles.

In other cases, violent extremist organizations take somewhat more sophisticated approaches to exploiting water shortages. They can benefit from a sense that governments are unable to meet people’s basic needs. There are examples from countries such as Iraq and Mali of extremist groups recruiting boys and men who can no longer survive from farming or herding due to severe drought. Daesh used control of limited water resources to charge taxes to fund its operations and try to present itself as a governing authority. Extremist groups have exploited migrants who have been forced to move due to drought and have used control over water resources to reward allies and punish enemies.

Throughout history, many actors have weaponized water, but Daesh took such actions to a new level. Its brief control of the Mosul Dam threatened many communities as well as opposing forces. Both Daesh and Al-Shabaab used water tactically, diverting it to block opposing forces. They have also attempted to use water to reward allies and punish opponents.

The intersections of climate change, drought, and conflict and violent extremism are complex and vary from country to country. Therefore, solutions to these problems must also be both multifaceted and tailored to the specific conditions in a country or locale. Recognizing that there are links between climate change, drought and floods, and conflict and violent extremist groups is an important start.

Solutions could include shaping aid policies and counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies to take water scarcity into account. Ensuring access to water for displaced populations is an important step. Aid programs can help provide farmers with more efficient farming techniques and tools, such as drip irrigation, and can help build infrastructure that wastes less water. All governments should work to mitigate global climate change.

Governments can also take steps to enforce norms against weaponizing water. There are some international agreements, such as Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions, which can be used to hold actors who weaponize water accountable. Military operations should seek to avoid any direct or collateral damage to water infrastructure, thereby reinforcing a norm against weaponizing water and helping prevent conditions that feed into the conflict cycle. Access to water is a basic human need that should not be a part of warfare.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Recommendations for addressing drought displacement in Somalia - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/recommendations-addressing-drought-displacement-somalia,"Introduction

Somalia is one of the countries most heavily affected by internal displacement, with more than 2.6 million internally displaced people (IDPs) at the end of 2019.1 Many of these IDPs were displaced as a result of conflict and violence, but many more were displaced during disasters, including floods and drought. In addition to human suffering and insecurity, internal displacement was estimated to have cost the country 21.5 per cent of its GDP, or $1 billion in 2019.2 It is not only a humanitarian priority but also a challenge for socioeconomic development.

The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) embarked on a research programme in December 2018 to investigate internal displacement associated with slowonset disasters and environmental change.3 As part of that programme, Somali-speaking local enumerators collected quantitative and qualitative data in October 2019 in the cities of Burco in Togdheer region, Galkayo in Mudug and Qardho in Bari to examine displacement associated with drought.4 The objectives of the study were to investigate the interplay between different drivers and drought in triggering displacement from rural to urban areas, as well as to provide a better understanding of conditions and priorities for local integration and returns. The overall goal was to support policy and programming for durable solutions.

Amid growing needs and the risk of future displacement resulting from drought, IDMC engaged with key humanitarian actors in Somalia to identify recommendations for addressing the issue more efficiently. Building on the study conducted in July 2019, a workshop was organized in November 2020.

This paper presents the key recommendations resulting from that workshop. Participants identified areas for different types of interventions, illustrated in the map below. These include climate-sensitive agriculture and innovative, climate-related solutions for seeds and production. They also include naturebased solutions, such as permaculture and regreening, in areas outside of urban centres that receive less attention (in blue); the provision of safety nets, skills training, drought insurance schemes, small business grants and unconditional cash transfers in urban areas with high numbers of IDPs (in yellow); and assessments to determine levels of tenure security, the generation of title deeds for land and the provision of specialized legal aid services in informal settlements and urban IDP sites (in orange).

Four challenges were discussed during the workshop and are analysed in the following sections:","Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1563667-21_1903_Somalia_BriefingPaper.png?itok=Z58G-Hyk,"['addressing', 'areas', 'idps', 'displaced', 'recommendations', 'displacement', 'drought', 'study', 'urban', 'internal', 'solutions', 'workshop', 'somalia']",drought

MOGADISHU, Somalia - For the last three decades, Somalia has been in shambles due to inter-clan conflicts, political wrangles, and, or Al-Shabaab threat, something which makes life difficult or even challenging for all players in the war-torn country.

During such conflicts, women and children are the most affected, with a number of them facing displacement, rape, and even death, thus making them captives of such eventualities. Thousands have been displaced, raped, or even killed in Somalia.

With these challenges including the economic downturn, Somalia women have yet, strived to build the country under these challenging circumstances, not forgetting the COVID-19 pandemic, which has even made life unbearable across the world.

On Sunday, Mothers Day was celebrated across the world, to mark what many mothers go through during good and bad times. The UNFPA Somalia seized the opportunity to salute all mothers for their extraordinary contribution to the nation, including this difficult COVID-19 season.

""Even under normal conditions, mothers face expectations that often defy science and reality. But now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, mothers are under increasing economic pressures. They are struggling with access to health care, social support, and growing unpaid care responsibilities,"" the global body said.

""This Mother's day, we celebrate the extraordinary strength, resilience, and unconditional love that defines motherhood. We salute mothers around the world for shouldering the burden of the pandemic,"" it further noted.

Most of the international organizations in the country feel safe working with women, who are victims of prevailing circumstances, thus the urge and zeal to protect them from real or imaginary enemies.

In tribute to mothers, the organization added: ""Mothers around the world are doing the impossible every day, but they shouldn't be expected to. Support our efforts to bring better healthcare to the most vulnerable mothers.""

Within Mogadishu, the Somali capital, there is a monument in the Hawo Tako area which was first erected 29 years ago. The monument gives women in the country hope and a sense of belonging, showcasing their enormous contributions to the country.

The United Nations has often saluted Somali mothers for their significant contributions towards peacebuilding, reconciliation, and the promotion of gender equality in their country. Despite being victims of the war, mothers have been on the frontline in pushing for peace and stability in the country.

UNICEF noted that with women, the life-saving of children becomes easy at the time the country is struggling with internal conflicts, wars, and other challenges such as floods and drought. They, it adds, ""are our biggest champions in these circumstances"".

Former European Union Ambassador to Somalia, Ms. Veronique Lorenzo, has previously rooted for more women appointments in the Somali cabinet, a move she argues will both provide a platform for peace and stability besides helping in gender mainstreaming.

“In Somalia, they (women), are a major powerhouse and they are prominent in their different roles. But very often these achievements are not recognized,” Ms. Lorenzo once said.

“They are drivers of reconciliation. They are at the center of peace. They are at the center of the state and peacebuilding. But despite their increased economic role, they have remained largely excluded from decision-making structures.”

“We as international actors want to support you,” added the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General (SRSG) for Somalia, Mr. Michael Keating.

“If you carry on doing what you have done in the last one year, victory will be yours,” Keating told a gathering of women leaders, government officials, and the Somali public, who converged in Mogadishu to mark the day.

The humanitarian crisis facing Somalia as a result of biting drought was a concern of several speakers.

Ms. Batula Ahmed Gaballe, the deputy Chairperson of the Goodwill Ambassadors, a women’s lobby group that advocated for greater participation of women in politics, expressed concern about the debilitating drought.

“I call upon all of us to help in alleviating the suffering of our children and mothers, who are dying of hunger, while some of us eat three meals a day,” she pleaded.

But there are other places that have also been feeling the wrath of Mother Nature.

We start in east Africa. A place that has been inundated with recently heavy rain. Several countries in this region have been particularly hit hard.

Many have been uprooted from their homes as rivers have been rising. Water-logged farms have considerable crop damage. Unfortunately, the heavy has taken the life of at least 15 in Somalia. Parts of this region are still favored to see above-average rainfall.

There are other regions around the world seeing too much rain… and this time head to Afghanistan. An area known for its dry climate is now dealing with catastrophic flooding. According to the countries disaster agency, at least fifty people have died.

Next, we go from flooding to droughts. Hailed as one of the raniest places on earth, Taiwan is now in a devstating dry spell. Many farmers there have had to give up on farming this year and the water has been rationed for residents and businesses.

Now on to the drought in the U.S. As you can tell by ths colorful map, millions of Americans are affected by the drought Over half of the United States is considered abornally dry or in a drought.



California has been so dry, that recently a giant sequoia tree was found still smoldering from a fire in 2020. Officials are warning that this year’s California wildfire season could be one of the worst on record with already more acreage burned this year over last year at this time with nearly two thousand fires already recorded.

While we’re headed around the globe, a few interesting facts about the last 24 hours… the hottest place on earth was Nuwasib, Kuwait at 117°. The coldest place was Concordia, Antarctica at -105°. If you’re wondering what the wettest place on earth was in the last 24 hours, well that was in Thiruvananthapuram, India with 6.56″

DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Triple threat of drought, COVID-19 and insecurity in Mogadishu driving severe humanitarian need in Somalia, warns IRC - International Rescue Committee",https://www.rescue.org/press-release/triple-threat-drought-covid-19-and-insecurity-mogadishu-driving-severe-humanitarian,"Following a declaration of drought from the Government of Somalia, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is concerned about the increasing humanitarian need in the country, especially exacerbated by a precarious security situation and surging COVID-19 cases. In the last month alone, Somalia has seen a 48% increase in deaths from COVID-19 and a doubling of confirmed cases from 6687 to 13,812 cases in the last 59 days. Recent conflict in Mogadishu has been hampering humanitarian service delivery and will drive further need if the security situation deteriorates as more people become displaced.

Richard Crothers, IRC Somalia Country Director said:

“Over 80% of the country is suffering from drought conditions, cattle and crops are dying as the frequency of climate-related hazards increase. We’ve seen a spike in COVID-19 cases and deaths over the last month, with many cases going undetected and untested. In a country already suffering from severe humanitarian crises, with almost 6 million people in need, the drought will drive even more displacement and food insecurity. Now more than ever we need an increase in support and funding in order to meet the rising humanitarian need.”

Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. These climate related shocks resulted in Somalia’s highest number of newly internally displaced people over the past three years at 1.2 million displaced people in 2020, compared to 884,000 in 2018 and 770,000 in 2019. In total, more than 2.6 million people are internally displaced – all of whom continue to face serious risks of marginalization, forced eviction and exclusion. With the Humanitarian Response Plan severely underfunded, standing at just 15% funded, the international community must scale up its response and invest in early action and resilience programs now if we are to avert a major humanitarian disaster.

The IRC is already operational in the main areas of concern including Mogadishu, Puntland and central Somalia, and is significantly scaling up our programming to support families with healthcare for malnourished children, unconditional cash transfers to help people quickly get the support they need, rehabilitation of boreholes and water sources as well as mobile health services to reach deeper into hard hit areas.

The IRC began working in Somalia in 1981 in the aftermath of the Somalia-Ethiopia conflict. Over the years operations faced several interruptions due to insecurity and civil unrest but has been operating continuously since 2007.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Rising food prices threaten world's most vulnerable - Kitco NEWS,https://www.kitco.com/commentaries/2021-05-18/Rising-food-prices-threaten-world-s-most-vulnerable.html,"When we think of global food insecurity, the United States is not top of mind. At least, it shouldn't be. In fact, over 50 million American households out of a population of 328 million are food insecure — ie., lacking access to healthy food.

A study by Northwestern University found the pandemic has doubled food insecurity and tripled it among households with children, meaning one in six adults and one in four kids are not eating properly due to economic reasons.

Of course, hunger didn't begin with the coronavirus, but it has made it worse. Feeding America estimates 35.2 million people faced hunger in 2019, compared to 54 million in 2020.

The current throng of unemployed workers, nearly 10 million who have lost their livelihoods owing to virus-related layoffs/ business closures, contributes to another problem — less people working means fewer contributions to the needy.

Certainly the plight of the poor, and working poor, has improved over the past few months in the United States. Trillions in covid-19 stimulus has been rolled out, including direct payments of $600, $1,200 and $1,400. Large swaths of the economy (more so than Canada) have opened up, a third of the population, or 107 million people, has been vaccinated, and unemployment has fallen to a less dire 6.1%.

US stock markets were knocked back this week but that might not be a bad thing. They are looking decidedly bubbly, as investors throw everything but the kitchen sink into equities, confident that a booming economy will keep stock valuations lofty and dividend payouts secure.

Yet despite all of this good news, an elephant in the room threatens to stomp all over the tender green shoots of economic recovery, and that is inflation — or more specifically, food inflation.

Everything going up

North Americans have likely been noticing their trips to the grocery store are getting more expensive.

The pandemic has put tremendous pressure on supply chains, and the prices of many agricultural commodities such as grain, corn and soybeans, have skyrocketed. This is due to a number of reasons including heavy demand from China, the world's largest consumer of commodities whose economy grew at a blistering 18% in the first quarter, bad weather and drought —dealt with separately in an upcoming section.

A shortage of supply, and a need to replenish hog herds after an outbreak of deadly African swine fever, is expected to push corn imports to 28 million tons this season, the most on record, according to Bloomberg data.

The news sent corn prices to over $6 a bushel, an 8-year high.

Over the past year, corn has nearly doubled (+84%), soybeans have gained 72%, sugar is up 59%, wheat has climbed 19% and coffee has risen 13%.

According to the World Bank, global food prices have gone up by 38% since January, 2020.

Increases in the prices of grains, like corn and soybeans used in animal feed, typically get passed down the supply chain to the prices of meats, including chicken, pork and beef.

A recent Troy Media column states many food manufacturers have already signaled that processing costs have gone up, making it practically certain that retailers will mark goods higher to protect their margins.

Canada's Food Price Report predicts that prices will increase as much as 5% this year, representing almost $700 more for groceries, for the average Canadian family.

In the United States, food prices climbed 2.4% in April, compared to the same month a year ago, including a 3.8% rise in restaurant and take-out meals.

It isn't only groceries that are increasing in price.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the US consumer price index (CPI) surged in April by 4.2%, the most in any 12-month period since 2008, as economic activity picked up but was constrained in some sectors by supply bottlenecks.

Among the costlier items, gasoline rose 50%, while the prices of used cars, representing a third of the CPI increase, climbed by 10%, the most on record; car and truck rentals shot up 82% and airline fares leapt 9.6%.

Gas prices were recently influenced by a cyberattack on the nation's largest energy pipeline network. The May 7 attack on Colonial Pipeline prompted it to halt 2.5 million barrels a day, triggering fuel shortages panic buying and higher pump prices in the southeastern United States.

A video embedded into the WSJ story, narrated by a reporter, states that rising prices are being noticed in a wide range of consumer products, everything from produce, apples and berries, to meat, packaged foods, foil wrap, home appliances, and lawn & garden products.

As for what is causing this inflation, part of it is bad weather, such as the winter storm in Texas that interrupted the supply chain for resin, used in packaging.

Lumber, also used to package goods, has quadrupled due to skyrocketing demand for housing, fueled by rock-bottom interest rates, as well as a shortage of processed wood.

Some companies are running low on drivers and are having to pay them more, which is trickling down the supply chain to higher shipping costs.

Consumers are reacting to the price increases by choosing store brands over name-brand products, buying cheaper frozen food instead of fresh, enrolling in awards programs and driving less.

The reporter who looked into the issue thinks that prices will continue to rise both for food and household products — a view that appears to be shared by experts.

""The CPI data point feeds into a myopic narrative that the US is overheating and the Fed is one step away from tightening,"" Bloomberg quoted Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, a wealth management firm.

US stocks slumped this week after a report showed inflation rose more than forecast, stoking concerns that price pressures could stifle a recovery.

Producer prices surged the most on record in April, a year-on-year increase of 6.2%, beating expectations of 5.8%.

""There is more inflation coming,"" Zero Hedge quoted Luca Zaramella, chief financial officer at Mondelez International Inc. Speaking on the food and beverage maker's April 27 earnings call, she added ""The higher inflation will require some additional pricing and some additional productivities to offset the impact.""

The US Federal Reserve has already said it will tolerate inflation above the normal 2% target, and let the economy run hotter before stepping in to cool it with rate hikes.

China

Adding to inflation worries is what's happening in China. The Chinese economy has led the world in growth, being the first to emerge from the pandemic. Like in the United States, however, the recovery after months of strict lockdowns in cities like Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, is pressuring prices.

Chinese exports rose sharply in March and imports grew to the most in four years, suggesting improved global demand amid worldwide vaccination programs.

After months of deflation (falling prices) China's producer price index (PPI) rose 4.4% in March, the most since July 2018, as the cost of oil, copper and agricultural goods rallied. As the world's biggest exporter, China's rising prices threaten to stoke inflation around the world.

Its factory gate prices climbed more than expected in April while the PPI rose 6.8%, the most since October of 2017.

Going hungry

The global food price increases are clearly of most concern, especially for seniors living on fixed incomes, the poor on social assistance, and the working poor getting by paycheck to paycheck.

For the most vulnerable, not only is food getting more expensive, in some places, it has become less available.

The Guardian reported that people living in poverty around the world are in danger of food shortages as the coronavirus continues.

""Food systems have contracted, because of Covid-19. And food has become more expensive and, in some places, out of reach for people. Food is looking more challenging this year than last year,"" the British newspaper quotes Agnes Kalibata, special envoy to the UN secretary general for the food systems summit 2021.

She noted the main impact of covid has been the shutdown of food markets, which has made it very difficult for farmers. Africa was worst hit, with several countries experiencing serious food prices and shortages, made worse by a drought in East Africa affecting northern Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.

The Guardian reports that many underlying problems have grown worse over the past year, as people have exhausted their reserves of food, cash and family support and now are facing a long crisis without backup.

""We are facing a greater threat this year, as economies have shrunk,"" she said. ""That is happening across the globe, everywhere. Countries are in a very distressed situation, and it is not getting easier – it is getting more difficult. Some countries have hung on, but for how long?""

Kalibata's thoughts are confirmed by the World Bank, which in a May 7 briefing note, states that COVID-19 impacts have led to severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country, with impacts expected to continue through 2021 and into 2022.

Other observations in the note include:

Higher retail prices, combined with reduced incomes, mean more and more households are having to cut down on the quantity and quality of their food consumption.

Numerous countries are experiencing high food price inflation at the retail level, reflecting lingering supply disruptions due to COVID-19 social distancing measures, currency devaluations, and other factors. Rising food prices have a greater impact on people in low- and middle-income countries since they spend a larger share of their income on food than people in high-income countries.

Rapid phone surveys done by the World Bank in 48 countries show a significant number of people running out of food or reducing their consumption.

As of April 2021, the World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 296 million people in the 35 countries where it works are without sufficient food — 111 million more people than in April 2020.

Us ‘mega-drought'

Back to supply chain issues in the United States, one of the most serious factors likely to worsen higher food prices is the major drought engulfing much of the western US.

Last year a team of scientists reported that the current ""mega-drought"" in the region, lasting nearly two decades, is as bad or worse than any in the past 1,200 years.

As of May 6, 67% of the US West was in a state of ""severe"" drought, and 21% is already in ""exceptional drought"", the worst category out of six in the US Drought Monitor's framework.

The states most at risk are southern California, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and Utah. In California, where over a third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown, 90% is experiencing drought conditions — an alarming statistic considering the state last year had its worst fire season in history and just saw its second consecutive dry winter, with most areas 75% of normal snowpack.

It's only May, the amount of extreme and exceptional drought is unbelievable.

According to National Geographic, tree rings from northern Mexico and the US West present a record that goes back to around 800 AD. In that 1,200-year span, the region experienced 35 major droughts and four mega-droughts. Most Americans probably identify the 1920s Dust Bowl as among the nation's worst, but that drought only lasted five to 10 years. The current dry stretch started in 2000 and hasn't let up, putting it second only to a highly arid period in the last 1500s.

Climatologists who analyzed the data say the drought would have been bad from natural causes anyway, but the addition of climate change pushed it into extreme territory. Global warming has bumped average temperatures in the American West up 1.6 degrees F since the early 1900s.

Temperatures in California's Central Valley to southern Arizona are expected to climb into the 90s and above 100 in many places Thursday and Friday — not record-breaking but much higher than normal for mid-May.

The problem this year has been made worse by the La Nina weather phenomenon, that began last fall. In a La Nina year, a cooling of Pacific Ocean surface waters shifts precipitation-rich weather patterns northward, making them miss the US Southwest.

Looking at the country as a whole, the US Department of Agriculture says drought coverage across the US continues to approach record levels.

""There have only been four times in the history of the drought monitor that we have seen more than 40% U.S. drought coverage as we come into early May,"" KIWA Radio quotes USDA meteorologist Brad Rippey. ""The current U.S. drought coverage is 46.6% of the lower 48 states in drought. That is a 2.6% increase from what we saw five weeks ago.""

As farmers tend their fields for this year's growing season, 26% of US corn production is in drought, 22% of the soybean crop faces dryer than normal conditions, 35% of winter wheat is in drought, 33% of sorghum and 31% of cotton.

As of May 4, 36% of US cattle production areas were showing drought, while hay producing regions are looking at 33%.

Water concerns

The two decades-long dry spell is taking its toll on western US water supplies. Not only is the area receiving less rainfall, good for filling lakes and streams, the snowpack is far lower.

Folsom Lake in California, normally fed by melting snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains, this year is only half full. Lake Mead, one of two major reservoirs in the Colorado River basin, on which 40 million Americans depend, is reportedly creeping towards a water level minimum that would trigger the first official shortage declaration for the basin.

With Mead just 39% full, the Bureau of Reclamation expects a water conservation plan to be implemented in June. Water allotments to the states that draw from the lower part of the river, like Arizona and Nevada, would see major cuts.

Farmers are bracing for another season of tight water supplies.

In the Klamath River basin along the California-Oregon border, levels are so low that farmers will receive only 8% of the water they usually get, reports National Geographic, adding that local tribes are concerned they won't have enough water to keep salmon populations healthy.

Less water and warmer temperatures in California's rivers and reservoirs led the state to concoct a plan to truck 17 million smolt to San Francisco Bay from various hatcheries, an emergency step not taken since the last major drought in 2014, Reuters reported on Thursday.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a drought emergency in 41 of 58 counties, which according to Modern Farmer, comes with a huge reduction in the amount of available water for agriculture in the region—primarily grapes in wine country…

[W]arnings have been sent to tens of thousands of water rights holders, asking them to start conserving water. For farmers, this likely means that what water remains will be used to maintain perennial crops like fruit and nut trees, rather than planting usual annual crops like vegetables.

Darker times ahead

Without life-giving bands of precipitation to wet parched soil, US farmers are expected to go through another rough growing season.

Lower crop yields mean higher prices for agricultural commodities. Food producers see their margins squeezed by higher input costs and pass these onto consumers.

A higher-income household can shrug off a 5, 10, even a 20% increase in grocery prices. Not so for families and individuals whose grocery budgets are tighter than a shrunken orange peel.

As incomes rise, households spend more on food but it represents a smaller share of their overall budget. Lower-income people don't have room in their budgets for much other than food and shelter.

According to the USDA, in 2019 the poorest households spent an average 36% of their disposable income on food, compared to the 10% that most Americans spend.

With the difficulties covid-19 has placed on grocery supply chains, 2020's figure is expected to be higher. Some are predicting the percentage of disposable personal income the average US household spends on food will reach 40%, with poorer families having to spend well over 50%.

As stated earlier, the prices of many agricultural commodities including corn, wheat and soybeans, are going haywire amid supply disruptions and robust demand. This past March, pork chops and chicken breasts were both up 10%, while the prices of eggs and cheese increased 6% compared to a year earlier.

The latest inflation data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the largest month-to-month CPI increase in almost nine years.

The Economic Collapse blog takes this a step further by pointing out that the bulk of the stimulus spending the Biden administration has promised, has yet to be rolled out, meaning inflation is likely to get a whole lot worse:

Almost everybody loved it when the federal government started sending out big, fat stimulus checks.

But you aren't going to love it when a cart of food costs you $400 at the grocery store.

Whenever the government hands out ""free money"", someone has got to pay for it, and one way we are paying for it is through higher prices.

If you do not believe that this is a major national crisis yet, you will soon, because it won't be too long before most of the country is loudly complaining about how nightmarish inflation has become.

Another commentary notes that ""the [covid] war is far from over,"" with 100 countries yet to receive a single vaccine shot, some vaccinated countries still seeing cases surge, and global supply chains likely to remain disrupted for a long time.

Michael Every of Rabobank thinks we could even be looking at price controls such as occurred during the 1970s when government put restrictions on the amount that wages and prices could increase, or Second World War-era rationing.

It all points to a pretty grim picture.

Conclusion

Nobody wants to see hyper-inflation in North America, where stable prices are the norm, or anywhere else for that matter, but the risk is certainly there.

US food price increases are already at their highest in nine years, and the consumer price index rose the most in April of any 12-month period since 2008.

The situation is particularly bad in the US Southwest which is experiencing the continuation of a 20-year drought that is the worst in 1,200 years.

Among the crops already seeing drought conditions are corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum and cotton. Hay crops and cattle production are also expected to be hit hard.

A lack of snow-melt runoff and precipitation, in an El Nina year made worse by climate change, has left reservoirs at a fraction of their normal levels, endangering millions of people that depend on them including farmers and ranchers that need to irrigate crops/ water herds.

California has already declared a drought emergency in nearly three-quarters of the state, and an official water shortage declaration for the Colorado River basin is expected by June.

Continuing the US (and Canadian) economic recovery is obviously important but it should not come on the backs of the poor who bear the most weight of inflation, particularly increases in food prices.

Government officials need to be aware of how their monetary and fiscal policies are impacting the most vulnerable in society.","Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.kitco.com/commentaries/2021-05-18/images/image-76.png,"['million', 'water', 'food', 'prices', 'supply', 'price', 'worlds', 'drought', 'threaten', 'vulnerable', 'states', 'rising', 'inflation', 'higher']",none
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Muslim women are using Sharia to push for gender equality - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/muslim-women-are-using-sharia-to-push-for-gender-equality-158371,"Sharia is often portrayed as barbaric and particularly regressive in terms of women’s rights. Citing Sharia, lawmakers in some Muslim-majority countries have punished theft with amputation, and sex outside of marriage with stoning. Women have been also forced to stay in abusive marriages and flogged for defying Sharia because they were wearing trousers.

Commonly translated as Islamic law, Sharia is a broad set of ethical principles found in the Quran, Islam’s holy book, and in the teachings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad. It is not a strict legal code, leaving it open to varying interpretations by governments and religious leaders.

Public outcry over Sharia has led to more than 200 anti-Sharia bills being introduced across the United States. The European Court of Human Rights has twice ruled Sharia incompatible with human rights. Conservative analysts have called Sharia the world’s “other pandemic,” a comparison to COVID-19.

However, many Muslim women do not regard Sharia as being incompatible with their rights. My research shows how women – typically small activist groups in many countries – are using Sharia to fight against oppressive practices.

Sharia and women’s rights

I interviewed nearly 150 women’s rights activists, religious leaders, officials and aid workers over the past decade in Somalia and Somaliland, where more than 99% of the population is Muslim.

The region has suffered cycles of famine and drought, as well as a brutal dictatorship and civil war that led to the collapse of Somalia’s government 30 years ago and the split between Somalia and Somaliland.

I wanted to learn why women were demanding Sharia and whether Sharia could help rebuild societies after war. My book, “Shari‘a, Inshallah: Finding God in Somali Legal Politics,” tells the story of peace builders and peacemakers oriented toward, rather than away from, Sharia.

Because Sharia encourages a diversity of interpretations, there is no right or wrong way to interpret it.

Women activists I met saw an inherent feminism in Sharia. Muslims “can find support for almost everything” in Sharia, a Somali activist reminded me. It’s just that women “have to know their rights in the Quran,” she added.

These activists help their local communities understand women’s rights in Islam. For example, one activist fighting for girls’ education explained to local parents how Sharia demands that both “boys and girls have the right to education.” Billboards put up by human rights groups referred to the Islamic teaching that to educate a girl is to educate a nation. They emphasized that Prophet Muhammad himself taught women and men and encouraged his followers to do the same.

Another activist I talked with invoked Sharia to explain that girls should be allowed to play sports. She explained to parents that not allowing their daughters to play goes against Sharia, which “gives rights to human beings.”

Yet another called the Quran – one of the sources of Sharia – her guide to persuade women to run for public office. Allowing women to stand for election, she publicly insisted, “is Islamic.”

Patriarchy and interpretations

Part of the problem with the often brutal interpretation of Sharia has been that men have been aligning it with their political views. “The custodians of law are men,” an aid worker told me.

Indeed, some religious leaders insist that Sharia allows child marriage and female genital mutilation to preserve women’s premarital virginity and prevent women from experiencing sexual pleasure.

Activists I met tried to put an end to these harmful practices by sharing harrowing stories in workshops with religious leaders. One activist told me that in one such workshop she had related the tragic story of a young girl whose pelvis shattered during childbirth. Another shared the story of a child who drank bleach to avoid a forced marriage.

These women wanted religious leaders to share these stories with others. They argued that Sharia could not be used to permit child marriage and female genital mutilation. Protecting women “is so clearly written in the Quran,” said one activist who added that “Islam always promotes the person, health, and dignity.”

[This Week in Religion, a global roundup email newsletter each Thursday. Sign up.]

Reclaiming women’s power

Religious leaders in these countries have, however, been reluctant to speak publicly on these issues. But many of the Somali women I met were reviving a centuries-old tradition – of women teaching and interpreting Sharia. In the seventh century, Aisha, the Prophet Muhammad’s surviving spouse, was among the first Muslim authorities to render decisions on sacred law that men had to follow.

Not just in Somalia and Somaliland, but in many parts of the world, Muslim women are reclaiming their rights by studying and sharing Quranic verses and prophetic teachings. In Malaysia, for example, groups like Sisters in Islam and Musawah have been publicly putting forward feminist interpretations of Quranic verses to teach women about gender equality and inheritance rights.

In Egypt, women have invoked Sharia to expand access to divorce.

In my research in Sudan, I saw women lawyers teach women displaced by civil war that their rights come from God. On the Day of Judgment, these women said to one another, God will judge those who tried to take away women’s God-given rights.

And in Los Angeles, California, a women’s mosque offers women-led sermons, classes and events.

By interpreting theological and legal texts in less patriarchal ways, these women, as I found, are shattering age-old sexist interpretations of Sharia.","Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/396649/original/file-20210422-18-17aoklz.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C76%2C2968%2C1482&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['quran', 'rights', 'womens', 'equality', 'muslim', 'push', 'using', 'religious', 'women', 'leaders', 'gender', 'activist', 'men', 'sharia', 'interpretations']",none
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Call For Aid As Somalia Faces Severe Drought - OOSKA News,https://www.ooskanews.com/story/2021/04/call-aid-somalia-faces-severe-drought,"The Somali NGO Consortium (SNC) has issued an urgent call for aid as the country faces the risk of severe drought, with rainfall over the next three months forecast to be 70 Percent lower than normal in some areas.

“The time to prepare is now,"" said says Halimo Elmi Weheliye, Acting Director of the Somali NGO Consortium, continuing: ""We know this from past drought responses and we are calling on all actors to be ready for an urgent scale up of humanitarian response to prevent unnecessary harm.”

Somalis are already struggling with crop failure due to a ""disastrous"" rainy season in October-December last year, further aggravated by a locust infestation and the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The worsening of the current drought conditions risks aggravating the situation for millions of Somalis trying to recover from the compounded effects [of] flooding, COVID-19, conflict, and locust invasions, all happening in 2020,"" explained Weheliye.

Quoting information from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS), the SNC anticipates one in five Somalis (2.7 million people) will need humanitarian assistance without a scale up of emergency response. This represents a 69 percent increase from 1.6 million at the same date last year. The threat is particularly severe in the northern and central regions of this highly rain-dependent country.

More than 83,000 people have been displaced by water shortages since November 2020, and the SNC is warning that further displacement is likely as well as an increase in water-borne diseases.

""Worsening water shortages and pasture coupled with widespread COVID-19 crises and total collapse of Somali shilling due to inflation has led to severe humanitarian situation here in Puntland, causing livestock to die and pushing communities into suffering and malnutrition. If the rains don’t come, I don’t know how people and livestock will survive,” says Mohamoud Farah, Water and Sanitation Officer of aid and development NGO KAALO.

The SNC is calling on donors to provide additional funds and on humanitarian actors to ""reprogram their current emergency responses to the worsening drought situation"".

According to UNICEF, more than 50 Percent of people in Somalia do not have access to safe water, while over 30 percent walk more than 15 minutes to reach their main source of drinking water.

It also suffered two famines – in 1992 and 2011.

Every year, between April and May (when food is planted and not harvested), aid agencies make dire predictions about the impending doom of the upcoming growing season and to appeal for funds to support increased food aid. This year, Save the Children announced that millions of Somalis won’t have enough food to eat as crop and vegetable production is expected to drop by 75%-80%. And the UN’s 2021 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan seeks $1.09 billion to provide “life-saving assistance” across Somalia.

As agricultural experts working in Somalia for the last 35 years we have done extensive research into food production. We have been involved in developing agricultural policies aimed at finding solutions to the country’s stagnant cereal production with an eye on reducing food insecurity in the country.

Article continues after advertisement

As part of our work we investigated historic trends over the last 60 years in domestic cereal production, cereal imports, and food aid in Somalia. We found that there’s been a precipitous decrease in the production of key cereals – maize and sorghum – over time, falling from a high of 91 kg per capita in 1972 to just 30 kg per capita in 2012. This is due to a combination of stagnant crop production and a rapidly increasing population. Conflict, corruption and bad governance have made matters worse.

Once almost cereal independent, the production decline has created a dependence on food aid and imports – over 50% of cereal consumed is imported. This is hugely problematic: A majority of Somalis live below the poverty level and cannot afford to pay for food; relying on imports leaves them vulnerable to markets.

Improving domestic cereal production in Somalia should be part of any future food security strategy for the country. The implementation of simple agricultural best management practices – such as fertilizer application and timely planting and weeding – can increase cereal production in the country.

In practical terms this means many farmers could increase production, if there were increased incentives to do so. Currently, food aid and imports can stifle domestic production because farmers have little incentive to put in the extra effort to produce more than that which they consume.

Cereal crops

Sorghum and maize are the predominant cereal crops grown in Somalia and historically, these two crops have provided a sizeble portion of total caloric intake of the Somali diet. Livestock is also a key local consumption commodity for household food security.

Sorghum production is mainly done by smallholder farmers and is carried out in dryland areas. Sorghum is more drought tolerant than maize and is grown predominantly in the Bay Region, south-central Somalia between the Juba and Shebelle rivers, Somalia’s largest rivers.

Maize is typically grown on irrigated land, often by small- and medium-sized farmers. These landholders often employ family labour to manage their land. The major maize growing areas are along the Shebelle and Juba rivers.

Somali cereal production levels have not increased in the last 60 years. In fact, from 1972 to 2012 cereal production per capita decreased by 66%.

Article continues after advertisement

There are a few factors that have contributed to this.

The first is poor yields. Average yield of both sorghum (300 to 500 kg/ha) and maize (900 to 1200 kg/ha) is low compared with most, about 20% of the average yield in developed countries.

Average yields are low because farmers typically don’t have access to the necessary agricultural inputs, for example, quality seeds and fertilizer. They also lack access to farm machinery, such as planters, fertilizer applicators, sprayers and harvesting equipment. In addition, there are no research and extension services in the country to help farmers make an informed decision.

Food shortages can also be due to the weather, such as flooding or drought. Higher frequencies and severity of drought events observed in recent years could make things worse.

Limited rainfall can negatively impact sorghum production. In recent years drought frequency is once every three years. Flooding can negatively impact irrigated maize production. Though localized, the country is experiencing flooding every two to three years.

Because the Shebelle and Juba rivers originate in high rainfall areas of Ethiopia, rains there can cause subsequent flooding in Somalia while drought conditions exist during the same growing season.

Conflict and poor governance

Another major reason for food insecurity in the country remains conflict, corruption and bad governance.

Civil unrest, since the early 1990s, is directly related to a deterioration of irrigation infrastructure. It has reduced the access that farmers may have to markets and the country lacks an agricultural regulatory framework, affecting food production and marketing.

Article continues after advertisement

The unrest has also resulted in the displacement of many farmers – there are about to 2.6 million internally displaced people in Somalia. This reduces the harvest of both crops.

In addition, illegal taxation on agricultural produce while it’s being transported to market is commonplace, both by government officials and rebel groups. This acts as a disincentive to farmers to produce crops.

Food insecurity

The fact that Somalia has not improved crop production has led to food insecurity. There are a few things that can be done to change this.

First, Somalia should improve the way in which production data are reported. Somalia has two growing seasons each year: the Gu from April through May and the shorter Deyr from October into November. However, data is reported annually. This gives an incomplete view of how drastically different the seasons can be and causes confusion on production area data.

Article continues after advertisement

It’s also imperative that production and reliability increase. This can be done by adopting relatively simple agricultural management techniques that have been well-researched and recognized as important yield factors in sub-Saharan Africa.

For example, the country could:

Introduce proper land and irrigation management techniques.

Improve transportation infrastructure and market development.

Work on canal restoration and land leveling for improved irrigation efficiency.

Introduce organic and mineral fertilizers, train farmers on their importance and develop policies on fertilizer importation.

Instigate land ownership laws, giving farmers an incentive to improving agricultural infrastructure.

Encourage timely weeding and a denser planting population for increased yields.

Better monitor food aid distribution and encourage more aid to be domestically produced. This would enhance agricultural capabilities within Somalia.

Enhance security in agricultural areas. This would free up donor funds that currently go to providing security of humanitarian efforts.

Encourage cropping and intercropping with legumes such as cowpea and mungbean. While this will not enhance yield of the cereal crop, it spreads risk and adds to diversity in the diet.

In terms of political instability, unfortunately current tensions prevent policymakers from focusing on issues of food security. This is a big hurdle that needs to be overcome.

But there are steps policymakers can still take to move Somalia from emergency or humanitarian aid toward development aid. This would provide much-needed jobs, particularly for the youth (almost 70% of the population) – and strengthen the agricultural sector to help enable Somalia to be more food secure.

In 1991, Hossein Farzin published an article titled “Food Aid: Positive or Negative Economic Effects in Somalis?” It would seem now – 30 years later – we should have a better answer to that question.

Thirty years after declaring independence, Somaliland is still at the margins of the international system despite its considerable successes.

30 years ago, on 18 May 1991, the Republic of Somaliland declared independence from Somalia. This bold move lacked preparation and was not supported by any other state. For over a decade, it was unclear where secession would lead. Today, it is clear: Somaliland is a most successful de facto state. It has a clearly demarcated territory (at least on paper), a permanent population, and a legitimate government; but it is still not internationally recognised.

Somaliland's breakaway from collapsing Somalia in 1991 followed a decade of state repression and civil war in the region. However, the roots of secession go back to colonial times. Between the 1880s and 1960, northwest Somalia was a British protectorate, while the rest of Somalia was controlled by Italy. The British installed indirect rule that incorporated local customary law handled by lineage leaders. The Italians introduced a more direct administration that undermined local traditions and weakened elders.

Somaliland gained independence on 26 June 1960. The rest of Somalia followed on 1 July. The same day, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic. The Somali government faced considerable challenges harmonising different administrative traditions and balancing power between various clans. As early as 1961, military officers in the northwest attempted a coup because they felt disadvantaged. Somalia was also immediately in conflict with Kenya and Ethiopia, where large Somali minorities reside. Mogadishu insisted on uniting all Somali territories in the Horn of Africa under one rule.

In 1969, military and police officers led by General Mohamed Siyad Barre toppled the nepotistic democratic government. The officers allied with Moscow and created a strong security apparatus against internal and external enemies. The dispute with Ethiopia peaked in the Ogadeen War (1978-79). Somalia's defeat severely weakened Barre's domestic position. The USSR sided with Ethiopia, but Somalia soon aligned with the US.

Around this time, renegade Somali military officers formed the first clan-based guerrilla groups and set up bases in Ethiopia, protected by Barre's enemy. The Somali government reacted with punitive measures against civilians in the northeast (now Puntland) and northwest (now Somaliland), who were clan relatives of the rebels. In 1988, the army bombed the north-western towns of Hargeysa and Bur''o after guerrillas had partly occupied them. Thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands fled to camps in Ethiopia.

With the end of the Cold War, President Barre lost external support. More guerrilla movements were founded. They finally drove the government out of Mogadishu in January 1991. However, Barre's fall did not end the civil war. Rather, clan militias began to fight among themselves for power. While southern Somalia sank into violence, the people in the north sought to resolve their conflicts. Elders who, thanks to the lighter touch of the British colonial administration, still enjoyed respect among northerners cooperated with militia leaders and local intellectuals. Several smaller peace-agreements led to a major clan conference in Bur''o, where, besides region-wide peace, Somaliland's independence was declared, claiming the boundaries of the former British protectorate.

The dominant guerrilla group in the area, the Somali National Movement (SNM), supported by members of the Isaaq clan-family, controlled only about 60% of the country. The west and east of Somaliland were held by local militias from different clans. A transitional SNM-government was established in the new capital, Hargeysa. But the massive destruction of infrastructure, lack of resources, and the spread of small arms among the population made effective governance impossible. Additionally, SNM commanders from various Isaaq clans fought over the region's few valuable resources.

To settle these issues, another clan conference was held in Borama in 1993. After months of negotiations, elders and other clan representatives from the region adopted a peace charter and a national charter. The former dealt with demobilisation, security, and establishing a police force; the latter served as the provisional constitution separating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches and introducing a bicameral parliament consisting of a house of elders (Golaha Guurtida, generally abbreviated as Guurti) and a house of representatives (Golaha Wakiilada). This created the hybrid political order integrating traditional Somali and Western elements of politics, which guaranteed the political stability of Somaliland for years to come.

The conference delegates elected Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal as new President. He was an experienced Isaaq-politician but had not supported the guerrillas. His government demobilised the militias and introduced the Somaliland Shilling as the new currency. Reconstruction work began, especially in Hargeysa and Bur''o. Diaspora Somalis invested in shops, hotels, and schools. The first university of the country was established in Borama in 1998. Some international aid organisations reluctantly engaged in the country, but the UN remained focused entirely on the civil war in southern Somalia. In retrospect, this lack of international attention was a blessing in disguise. It allowed the local actors to experiment with peace and state building and to develop a locally working formula of rule.

President Egal's government held a constitutional referendum in 2001. At the heart of the new constitution were the reaffirmation of independence and the introduction of a multi-party system. A large majority agreed. Democratisation began with the establishment of political parties and the holding of elections in 2002. The unexpected death of Egal that May did not stop the momentum. Since then, several presidential and parliamentary elections have taken place, leading to peaceful transfers of power. The next parliamentary elections are planned for end of May 2021.

Somaliland's success story rests heavily on the will of the members of the Isaaq clan-family to secede from Somalia. However, the country is also inhabited by members of other clans with different political orientations. Members of the Darood clan-family in eastern Somaliland stood against secession early on. Most did not participate in the referendum and subsequent elections. As a result, Somaliland has largely become a ''mono-clan state'' today; Isaaq hold all important offices. The Gadabursi, a clan in the west, participate as well, but they are confined to secondary positions. From the early-2000s onward, armed resistance formed in the east. The more Hargeysa tried to take control of the area, the more bitterly local clan militias fought back. Puntland, an autonomous state in northeast Somalia, supported the anti-secessionists.

Today, the majority of people in central and western Somaliland favour independence. Here, infrastructure, private businesses and the educational sector have developed tremendously over the past 15 years. Nowadays, numerous international NGOs and national development agencies engage in the country. Hargeysa has become a bristling centre, at eye-level with major east African cities.

The eastern parts of the country, however, are not yet at peace. There, Somaliland's influence is limited and occasionally its army clashes with militias. This is where part of the former colonial border runs. To advance its claim to recognition, it would be important that Hargeysa controls this border. But local militias cooperating with Puntland are preventing this; they desire Somali unity.

Globally, most states are against recognising Somaliland. Italy retains economic interests in southern Somalia, and members of the older Somali elite still have relations to the former colonial power. Egypt supports Somali unity to keep Ethiopia, its rival over the Nile-water, under control. The Arab states prefer a united, strong Somalia in the Horn. The US and most EU countries seek to stabilise Somalia, which wouldn''t be helped by recognising Somaliland. The African Union (AU) meanwhile insists that the continent's colonial borders should be respected to avoid unpredictable secessionist dynamics. Eritrea and South Sudan are seen as absolute exceptions (Eritrea had the support of the Ethiopian government, and South Sudan had considerable external backing).

The usual position of those taking a benevolent stance towards Somaliland's independence is that Mogadishu and Hargeysa should negotiate. Some discussions have taken place already, albeit without results. Mogadishu does not want to let Somaliland go, while Hargeysa refuses to return to the status quo ante.

30 years after its declaration of independence, Somaliland is still at the margins of the international system, despite considerable successes regarding peace and state building and massive diaspora investments. Generally, non-recognition in itself is less of a problem; Somaliland shows that political order, democratic process, and a certain degree of development can be achieved without much international assistance. What is worrying is the prospect that a future Somali government could attempt to subdue Somaliland as an unrecognised polity, which could provoke new military conflict.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Winning The Battle Against Desert Locusts - Outlook India,https://krishi.outlookindia.com/story/india-news-winning-the-battle-against-desert-locusts/382244,"Desert locust upsurge could have devastating consequences in vulnerable regions affected by recurrent drought, conflict, high food prices and now fighting COVID-19 pandemic.

For the unsuspecting farmer, the Desert Locust is a formidable enemy. These pests have a voracious appetite with the capacity to devour vast swathes of crops and pastureland on the way, multiply rapidly and can travel up to 150 km/day.

According to some reports, it was the first time since the locust plague of 1926-31 that swarms of locusts took the National Capital Region by surprise in June 2020.

Perhaps for first time, Gurugram too witnessed a locust invasion.

The desert locust upsurge could have devastating consequences in already vulnerable regions. It can cause large-scale crop damage and threaten food security in countries. It can devastate most parts of the world – already affected by recurrent drought, conflict, high food prices – now reeling under the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic.

After spreading to Bihar that time, the insects had entered Nepal and by early July, it swarmed almost a dozen districts in the Himalayan country where the kharif crop cycle was underway.

In the past year, waves of the insidious insect swept across East Africa, Yemen and southwest Asia in massive swarms that contained up to 80 million in a single square kilometre.

The global upsurge of locusts is on the brink of becoming a plague, aided by unusually favourable weather for three years and the international community’s failure to curb their growth.

In India, swarms of locusts invaded Jaisalmer and Suratgarh in Rajasthan and Fazilka in Punjab adjoining the Indo-Pakistan border.

The locusts moved further inside, entering areas of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

Fighting The Swarm

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) closely monitors the spread of locusts and plays a crucial role in its control operations.

Using climate data and weather forecasting, a high-tech response is helping countries win battle against Desert Locusts.

Field teams use its ground-breaking eLocust3 tablet to collect crucial data around the world and feed it to FAO's Desert Locust Information Service. The UN body and national authorities then map locust movements.

But, despite the tablets being used in 20 countries, the latest locust emergency meant that demand skyrocketed, and time was too short to train the farmers and pastoralists. FAO was fighting a battle on several fronts and needed a heavier hand to tackle the onslaught.

According to Keith Cressman, FAO's senior locust forecaster, they are constantly looking for cutting edge technologies to harness and adapt them into innovative tools that can be used to improve forecasting and early warning.

Remote communication tools

By January 2020, Desert Locust swarms the size of Paris or New York were sweeping across the Horn of Africa, a region already impacted by poverty and food insecurity. With the pests' ability to multiply 20 times with each generation, every day that passed made the fight more challenging.

Up against the clock, Cressman turned to researchers at Pennsylvania State University's PlantVillage, which provides technological solutions to farmers and had previously created an app to help FAO track another dangerous agricultural pest, the Fall Armyworm.

In less than a month, Cressman and the developers created a simple smartphone app to allow anyone, even with little training, to collect locust data in the field.

But not every farmer has a cell phone and plenty of areas in East Africa are totally isolated from any network. So, FAO also partnered with global GPS supplier Garmin, to modify a satellite data communicator that would overcome connectivity obstacles in areas that have none.

Though FAO now receives up to 2,500 records of data a day, nearly 25 percent of the data is unusable or incorrect and FAO again turned to PlantVIllage to harness artificial intelligence to rapidly identify and remove the unwanted data.

FAO's Desert Locust team then shares this data with control teams on the ground and in the air so they can quickly identify the location of the swarms, and then target and kill them.

Detection from the air

A telephone call from one of Kenya's wildlife conservancies has also led to another technological breakthrough. On the suggestion of one of the rangers, FAO took a digital system, called Earth Ranger, used to monitor the movement of animals, and adapted it for locust monitoring.

Cressman worked with the developers of Earth Ranger, a philanthropic foundation called Vulcan, to fine-tune it specifically for aerial surveillance and locust control.

At the height of the locust response, FAO partnered with 51 Degrees who used this tool to co-ordinate 28 aircraft in the Horn of Africa for surveillance and control operations, giving pilots the precise information they needed to target locusts on the move. The technology was so effective in locust operations in Kenya that FAO soon expanded its application to Ethiopia and Somalia.

FAO is also collaborating with researchers from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the UK Meteorological Office and Cambridge University to develop new ways to improve swarm surveillance, forecasting and control strategies.

A space-age boost to surveillance

Satellites may be the biggest game changer in the fight against Desert Locusts. Since rainfall is a critical component for locust breeding, FAO is using two satellites to identify rainfall and vegetation that might be attract locusts for breeding.

A third satellite which Cressman dubs the ‘Holy Grail of Desert Locust monitoring' goes a step further and can detect soil moisture beneath the earth's surface, conditions which would allow the female locust to lay her eggs.

FAO is working with NASA, the European Space Agency and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to refine the satellite technology.

Back on the ground, this satellite data is transmitted in real time across cell phones, tablets and other devices so countries can mobilize their control teams and take immediate action to tackle the locust swarms.

Winning the battle

With these operations, the scale of the Desert Locust invasion has vastly diminished in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. In East Africa locust control operations have prevented the loss of 4 million tonnes of cereal and 800 million litres of milk production, while protecting the food security of 36.6 million people and avoiding $1.56 billion in cereal and milk losses.

""While the situation has improved, with few swarms remaining in Kenya and less numerous and smaller swarms in Ethiopia and Somalia, we are still not yet at the end of the upsurge,"" says Cyril Ferrand, FAO's Resilience Team Leader for Eastern Africa.

The threat has also diminished in Yemen, but small swarms have recently appeared in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.

According to FAO, it has won many battles against Desert Locusts, but this war is not over yet.","Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2021/5/7/GDS.jpg,"['data', 'fao', 'locusts', 'africa', 'food', 'desert', 'locust', 'swarms', 'battle', 'winning', 'used', 'control']",none

Somalia has suffered for decades from prolonged conflict combined with extreme weather, especially recurrent droughts and floods. Against a background of widespread poverty, it is now also facing the worst desert locust infestation in 25 years, a major political crisis, and a rapidly-escalating coronavirus outbreak. EU humanitarian funding is helping aid organisations in Somalia provide life-saving assistance to vulnerable people, including those affected by conflict, drought or food shortages.

What are the needs?

For almost 3 decades, conflict has been the main driver of Somalia’s humanitarian crisis. Insurgent armed groups remain the biggest source of insecurity, carrying out indiscriminate attacks on Somalis, kidnappings and forcefully recruiting children. Pervasive insecurity in Somalia impedes access for humanitarian organisations and restricts the ability of Somalis to support themselves economically. Several parts of the country have reported an upsurge in inter-community clashes and violent conflict.

According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), more than 667,000 Somali refugees live in neighbouring countries. A further 2.9 million people are displaced within Somalia, mainly due to conflict, drought and floods. The majority live in the over 2,300 sites for internally displaced people, in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. For most, there is little to no possibility of returning home.

Some 5.9 million people require humanitarian assistance in Somalia and the rate of malnutrition among children is critically high. The ongoing locust infestation is expected to have a significant impact on the next harvest. Almost 2.7 million people are expected to experience severe food insecurity by mid-2021; up from 1.1 million people at the end of 2020. This is further compounded by the coronavirus pandemic, which places extra pressure on Somalia’s already strained health system.

Current political instability may exacerbate all of the above depending on a peaceful resolution to the political stalemate, while elections have been postponed since February 2021. This situation may lead to further violence and displacement.

How are we helping?

In 2021, the EU allocated €42.5 million in funding for humanitarian projects in Somalia. Together, the EU and its Member States provide over 35% of all humanitarian aid in Somalia.

EU humanitarian funding supports aid organisations delivering life-saving assistance to vulnerable people, including those affected by conflict, drought or food shortages, to cover their most urgent needs. This assistance includes access to basic health and nutrition services, clean water, protection, shelter and education.

Last year, the EU also provided €9.5 million of humanitarian aid to help it tackle the locust outbreak and protect the livelihoods of affected farmers and pastoralists in Somalia. This effort is sustained in 2021, with €8 million allocated for the surveillance and control of desert locusts within the Horn of Africa, including Somalia.

During the coronavirus pandemic, EU-funded humanitarian projects in Somalia are adopting measures and adapting to the new challenges to help beneficiaries and staff keep safe, while continuing to provide life-saving assistance to support vulnerable communities. These actions are complementing ongoing efforts by the Ministry of Health of Somalia and are implemented in line with the COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan for Somalia. The EU also organised 3 Humanitarian Air Bridge flights to Somalia in 2020. These flights transported much-needed health equipment to humanitarian partners in the country.

EU-funded humanitarian health actions continue helping local health centres and Somali hospitals in providing access to health care and epidemics prevention and control. Last year, a share of the EU’s humanitarian funding allocated to the World Health Organization (WHO) to support its global coronavirus response was used to support Somalia’s health authorities. The aim was to scale up operational readiness for early detection and respond to large-scale community transmission.

Whenever relevant, EU humanitarian support helps people in need through cash transfers. This system enables households to buy what they urgently need to feed and sustain their family with education for children and health care for the sick. Besides, using cash transfers helps to overcome some of the accessibility challenges in the country, while at the same time supporting local markets.

Given Somalia’s high child and maternal mortality rate, severe malnutrition rates and frequent disease outbreaks, EU support in the country also focuses on the provision of quality health care and the emergency treatment of malnutrition through experienced health and nutrition implementation partners.

Somalia needs more long-term development to prevent vulnerable people, such as pastoral and agricultural communities, from sliding back into crisis. Cooperation between the EU’s humanitarian and development actions is ongoing, especially for cash-based safety nets and education, to build up the longer-term resilience of fragile Somali communities.

The north eastern and central parts of the country remained dry.

The cumulative rainfall forecast for this week indicates significant spread of the rains to the central and northern parts of the country starƟng from 18 to 20 April, this will mark the start of the rains in these areas. Some parts of Awdal Region may experience high localized rains of up to 50mm on 19 April 2020, according to the forecast. Similarly, moderate rains are expected over the southern and central parts of the country. In the Ethiopian highland, whose rainfall is largely responsible for increase in river flow along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers inside Somalia, moderate to high rainfall is foreseen in the coming one week.

It is worth noting that, the foreseen rains in the coming week are not sufficient to alleviate the current drought conditions in the country, more rains with good temporal and spatial distribution are required during the season in order to improve the situation.

River levels along the Shabelle have increased slightly at Belet Weyne over the last few days, but remains low and below the normal for this period of the year. Along Juba River the levels are within normal for this period. Given the rainfall forecast, a slight increase in the levels for both rivers is expected with no risk of flooding over the next seven days.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia: Hirshabelle state hits back at FGS over missing donor funds - Garowe Online,https://www.garoweonline.com/en/news/somalia/somalia-hirshabelle-state-hits-back-at-fgs-over-missing-donor-funds,"Somalia: Hirshabelle state hits back at FGS over missing donor funds

MOGADISHU, Somalia - Somalia's regional state of Hirshabelle has accused the federal government of acting on ""self-defense"" to distort facts about missing donor funds, which were meant to mitigate floods and drought in several parts of the country

At least $135 million were dispatched to Somalia mainly through World Bank and the Hirshabelle state was set to get $35 million for 2020, but the money is yet to be dispatched, with most proposed beneficiaries shifting their wrath to the federal government.

Finance Minister Abdirahman Beileh and his Planning counterpart Ambassador Gamal Hassan refuted claims that the money is being held, arguing that most of it have been disbursed to relevant agencies and organizations for the tasks it had been allocated.

But in yet another bombshell, Hirshabelle state under President Ali Guldilawe, accused the federal government of ""hiding"" from facts, adding that at least nine months have elapsed since the state signed an MoU with the FGS over the release of the money.

The latest twist could complicate the relationship between Villa Somalia and Jowhar, which has often defended Mogadishu's lame federal policies, that have often put President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo at loggerheads with certain regional leaders.

On Sunday, a number of Senators led by Abdirahman Farole accused Farmajo of being an existential threat to federalism in the country. Farmajo, they said, prefers the centralism approach they insisted will further divide the people of Somalia.

Last week, Mohamed Abdi Waare, a former Hirshabelle president, accused the government of failing to release $35 million, adding that they were meant to mitigate floods along the Shebelle Valley, which is now the worst affected according to the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA].

Although he didn't provide evidence, Waare, a former ally of Villa Somalia, said the money was donated by the governments of Italy, Sweden, the European Union, and the World Bank sometimes back, adding that it's yet to be released.

The money, he added, is held at the ministries of Finance, Planning, and Agriculture. He, however, did not specify when the money was disbursed and why it has taken long to have the money disbursed.

""It unfortunate that more than USD 35 million donated for the floods by Italy in Somalia, Sweden in Somalia EU_in_Somalia and World Bank for the Shabelle Valley alone is blocked at Federal Ministries of Finance, Planning, and Agriculture. Shame,"" he said in a tweet.

The Garowe Online could not establish the claims at that time but Waare, is one of the leaders who closely worked with Villa Somalia. He left his office early this year and was replaced by Ali Guudlaawe, a close associate of President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo.

This comes amid raging floods in the country At least 25 people have been killed in the past seven days due to heavy rains pounding several parts of Somalia, the United Nations humanitarian agency said in a statement on Sunday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said among the dead include 14 children and seven internally displaced people.

OCHA said riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar in the Middle Shabelle region, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms.

The heavy rains have hit various parts of Somalia over the past week, triggering flash floods that have killed and displaced people, but a forecast suggests the rains will begin to subside from mid-May.

It has become even more difficult to predict such sequential events. Currently, more than 80 percent of the country is facing drought conditions in the mid of the primary Gu rainy season. Yet, flash floods have been reported in the last two days following heavy and sporadic rains in Somaliland. In addition, limited climate change adaptive capacities has led to irresponsible socio- economic practices like cutting of river banks to extract irrigation waters, further exposing the communities to climate hazards. For instance, riverine flooding due to open river banks near Baarey and Moyko villages has been reported in Jowhar within Middle Shabelle region.

With current climate models predicting extreme temperatures and rainfall in the future within the region, the country is likely to continue experiencing frequent flood and drought events with likely consequences of affecting untold numbers of people, taxing economies, disrupting food production, creating unrest and prompting migrations.

FLOODS AND RAINS UPDATE

The Gu rains continued to spread across most parts of the country with Somaliland and Puntland experiencing moderate to heavy rains over the last week. Other areas in central and southern regions recorded light to moderate rains. The Ethiopian highlands received moderate rains within the last week.

Since 25 May 2021, most parts of Somaliland have been receiving moderate to heavy rains. Localized flash floods caused by the heavy rainfall were reported on 01 May 2021 in parts of Hargeisa district. The riverine areas of the seasonal Hargeisa River were worst affected by the flood waters that lasted a couple of hours. According to unconfirmed reports, approximately 50 houses have been either partially damaged or destroyed leading to displacement of several households. Power and water systems are also reportedly damaged, while public infrastructure have also been impacted.

The river levels along Shabelle river have been increasing over the last few days, and are currently within normal at this time of the year. At Belet Weyne, the river level increased by over 2m in the last 2 days. Today’s level is 4.65 m, which is 1.85 m below the moderate risk level (6.50 m). In Jowhar, two open river bank points at Bareey and Moyko have led to flooding causing extensive damage in the area. Unconfirmed hectares of cropland have been submerged while several houses were affected. The flood waters are from the upper reaches of Jowhar and mostly from Ethiopia as the area has not experienced good rains since the beginning of the current Gu season. The river level at Jowhar today is 3.80 m which is slightly below normal at this time of the year. Due to several open river banks in the area, further increase of river levels will see more flooding. The worst affected villages include Bareey, Moyko, Libiga and Bananey. Parts of Jowhar town have also been affected by flood water streaming from Moyko river breakage.

Along the Juba river there is a sharp increase in river levels over the last few days. The levels are currently above normal for this time of the year, and expected to continue rising over the next week, given the rainfall forecast.","Sun, 02 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565329-Somalia_Flood_Update-02052021.png?itok=GotTtmsX,"['floods', 'rains', 'river', 'heavy', 'moderate', 'level', 'parts', 'issued', 'levels', 'moyko', 'update', 'm', 'rainfall', '2021', 'jowhar', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Extreme weather displaces record numbers of people as temperatures rise - DW (English),https://www.dw.com/en/climate-refugees-migration-displacement/a-57585752,"Storms, floods, wildfires and droughts drove more than 30 million people from their homes last year, as rising temperatures wrought extra chaos on the climate, according to a report published Thursday by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC).

Together with wars and violence, which forced 9.8 million people to flee within their borders, extreme weather brought the number of new internal displacements in 2020 to 40.5 million people, according to the IDMC. The Geneva-based research organization estimates a record-breaking 55 million people were living displaced within their own country by the end of the year.

That's twice the number of refugees in the world.

Conflict and climate change have pushed people into displacement camps

Extreme weather is growing unnaturally strong as people burn fossil fuels and warp the climate. It is projected to drive more and more people from their homes through sudden shocks like floods and storms, as well as slower-burning crises like crop failures and drought. In rich countries, politicians have raised fears that more migration from poorer regions could overwhelm public services as the planet heats up.

The idea that climate change will trigger mass migration towards rich countries is a ""distraction"" from the fact that most displacement is internal, said Bina Desai, head of programs at the IDMC. ""It's a moral obligation to really invest in supporting people where they are — rather than just thinking about the risk of them arriving at the borders.""

Climate displacement

The annual report, in its sixth year, found more than 80% of the people forced from their homes in 2020 were in Asia and Africa.

In Asia, most of the people forced to flee did so because of extreme weather. In countries like China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Philippines and Indonesia — where hundreds of millions of people live on low-lying coastlines and deltas — a combination of population growth and urbanization has left more people exposed to floods that have grown stronger as sea levels have risen.

The most severe cyclone to hit India in two decades made landfall on Monday, forcing authorities to evacuate 200,000 people in the state of Gujarat. But while early warning systems can save lives by pulling people out of harm's way, many of the displaced do not have a home to come back to. When Cyclone Amphan struck Bangladesh last year it forced 2.5 million people to flee and destroyed 55,500 homes, according to the report, suggesting that 10% of the people displaced were left homeless.

Early warning systems can help save lives but do not protect homes

In Africa, most displacements in 2020 were due to conflict. Persistent violence forced people from their homes in countries like Burkina Faso and Mozambique, while new wars sprang up in other countries like Ethiopia. The IDMC estimated half a million people had fled fighting in Ethiopia's Tigray region by the end of last year. Since then, UNICEF has put the figure above one million.

Some conflicts were coupled with unusually long and heavy rainy seasons that brought floods and crop losses to countries already affected by violence. Heavy rains forced people already displaced once to flee again in countries like Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Niger, according to the report. Such environmental disasters triggered 4.3 million displacements in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020. At least half of them were still displaced by the end of the year.

Migrants from rural areas to cities are often ""forced to settle in areas that are not safe for habitation and prone to flooding or other hazards,"" said Lisa Lim Ah Ken, a regional climate specialist at the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Kenya. ""A lot can be done, starting with prevention.""

Schools have been turned into temporary shelters to house people displaced by conflicts like the violence in Tigray, Ethiopia

Climate migration

Researchers say the links between climate and migration are poorly understood and sometimes overstated. While the IDMC compiles data on internal displacement — most of which comes from sudden disasters like floods and storms — there is little data on how many people leave homes because of slow-burning environmental crises like rising temperatures and sea levels.

Still, a meta-analysis published in March by the University of Potsdam's Center for Economic Policy Analysis found that disasters that unfold over a long time like heatwaves and drought are more likely to increase migration than disasters that hit suddenly like floods and hurricanes. The researchers suggest this is because people need money to migrate, which is often lacking after sudden shocks, even though they cause immediate displacement across shorter distances.

Those who stay put — often without insurance to rebuild houses or livelihoods — can be trapped in a cycle of extreme weather that prevents them from leaving, though others may choose to stay behind for other reasons.

""If you want to migrate, then you need some resources to do so,"" said Barbora Sedova, an economist studying conflict and migration at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and co-author of the study. ""What is not so much talked about is the populations that are trapped at the origin and that actually lack the resources to migrate.""

Wildfires in rich countries like the US and Australia have also forced people to evacuate

Increasingly extreme weather

Climate change has already made extreme weather even more extreme — including in rich countries.

A study published in the journal Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences in March found that the risk of intense fire during the 2019/2020 Australian wildfire season was made 30% more likely by human changes to the climate. The fires killed 34 people and destroyed thousands of homes.

On Tuesday, a study published in the journal Nature Communications found that 13 percent of the $62.5 billion in damages when Hurricane Sandy struck New York City in 2012 was the result of sea-level rise. Had humans not heated the planet, and assuming all other factors stayed constant, the floods would have hit 70,000 fewer people, the modelers found.

Climate migration researchers have called for governments to cut their greenhouse gas emissions swiftly, adapt to the changing climate and continue to support displaced communities once the immediate danger has passed.

""If we create opportunities for these people in cities — in terms of employment, housing, life and dignity — then migration does not necessarily have to become an issue of international security,"" said Sedova. ""If it's well managed, it can even have positive consequences for the country.""","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/56889054_6.jpg,"['numbers', 'climate', 'million', 'displaced', 'floods', 'homes', 'weather', 'extreme', 'rise', 'migration', 'displaces', 'record', 'countries', 'forced', 'temperatures']",flood_and_drought

The UK government Tuesday took the opportunity of a high-level dialogue of the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) to announce US$ 17 million for developing countries to better prepare for and respond to disasters, including those linked to climate change.



The funds will go to Start Network agencies, while just over US$ 11 million more will support the Centre for Disaster Protection to help “climate-vulnerable countries deal with crises such as extreme weather caused by climate change and pandemics,” a UK press release said – all part of a package worth nearly $US 70 million announced earlier this year.



“As climate-related disasters increase in ferocity and frequency, we must take action to better prepare for and prevent them, to save lives, protect livelihoods and reduce suffering,” the British International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP 26 Presidency, Anne-Marie Trevelyan told the REAP session.



“The commitment and ambition demonstrated today, including the UK’s partnership with the Start Fund, is vital for reaching REAP’s goal of making 1 billion people safer from disasters by 2025.” She added [original emphasis]: “We must make risk-informed early action the default.”



Hubs



Selwin Hart, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action and Assistant Secretary General for the Climate Action Team, said: “We are in a race against time, a race to save livelihoods, a race we cannot afford to lose.



“Let us not wait until it is too late – the time to act is now,” he told the REAP session, which also included the IFRC’s Pascale Meige, its Director, Disasters Climate and Crises, and which was coordinated by the Wilton Park centre.



“Whether through new investments, sharing good practice, or placing early action at the heart of plans and policies, we need to work together ahead of COP26 to build a safer, more resilient world,” COP 26 President-Designate Alok Sharma said.



The new UK funding will support early action from improved forecasting for heatwaves in Pakistan to drought in Madagascar, as well as a new global network of hubs facilitating locally led responses, the government added.



The announcement follows the G7 foreign and development minsters meetings last week, where G7 countries committed support to early warning, better preparedness and early action, as well as scaling up finance for adaptation.

‘We must make risk-informed early action the default’

The UK has also announced a package of technical assistance by sharing British expertise on social protection and, through REAP, supporting countries vulnerable to climate impacts to implement “laws, policies and procedures” against future risk, and working with the UK-established Adaptation Research Alliance to fill gaps in evidence for early action.



Ms Trevelyan noted that the UK already contributed to the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund, including forecast-based action, and was “working with the British Red Cross to increase access to forecast-based finance, supporting early action in Southern Africa and the Sahel.”



As one of the largest donors to the UN’s CERF, the UK also supported its allocation of up to US$ 140 million for anticipatory action for food insecurity in Ethiopia and Somalia, and flooding in Bangladesh.



In terms of specific REAP targets, the UK would fund work with a priority group of vulnerable countries, “to review and integrate climate and disaster laws, policies and procedures” and strengthen shock-responsive social protection.

“The whole hut came down after it rained from 9pm to 4 am in the morning. We are in great hardship and we haven’t managed to get a place to shelter from the rain,” said Habibo.

Habibo, whose husband is jobless, earns about a dollar a day from the sale of firewood, which she collects and carries on her back from the forest. She manages to cook once a day for the six children.

They have lived in the camp for four years since losing all their 75 goats in the drought in 2016-2017 in their village of Kahan Dhuure, 50 km away from El Barde.

The Gu’ rainfall has badly affected 245 of the 500 IDP families living in three camps, two of which are on the outskirts of El Barde.

Hasno Mohamoud Dhalow, a widowed mother of seven in Bananay IDP camp, 10 km from El Barde, told Radio Ergo she has been sheltering under a tree after flooding washed away their shelter and belongings.

“Our cooking pots and cups were washed away by the floods, we only managed to salvage the rugs which were soaked. But they were also washed away after we placed them out in the sun to dry,” she said.

Hasno has been buying food on credit from local shops for the past year. The shops stopped giving her credit in February after she accumulated $623 in debt. She now begs food from the market to feed her children.

“Some of the shop owners have forgiven me the debt, but they said they won’t give me any more credit. But there are those who are asking for their money daily,” she said.

Hasno migrated from the rural area of Beledweyne in Hiran region after their farm dried up due to the severe drought of 2011-2012, which destroyed the livelihoods of many farmers in the country.

Ali Mohamed Abdi, the chairman of Gargaar IDP camp, informed Radio Ergo that 145 families have been left without shelter by the floods.

“We ask well-wishers to assist these families with food, tents to shelter and even utensils,” he said.

He noted that the IDP families depended on humanitarian aid, but since the outbreak of COVID19 no assistance has been provided to the destitute families.","Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.138.53/s26.7b4.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Barakac-Geed-hoostiis-1.jpg?time=1622777328,"['away', 'region', 'washed', 'idps', 'floods', 'credit', 'camp', 'shelter', 'food', 'ergo', 'somalias', 'idp', 'struggle', 'families', 'bakool', 'el', 'rain']",flood

Gu season rainfall typically starts between late March to early April in northwestern and southern parts of Somalia and expands eastwards to cover central and northeast regions by midApril.

This year, observed rain gauge data and satellite data indicate that sunny and dry weather conditions characterized by higher than average daytime temperatures prevailed in most regions of the country in March. Exceptions are some southern regions (Belet-weyne, Qanzaadhere,

Bardale, parts of Juba regions and Baidoa) that recorded some rainfall of poor distribution and low intensity mainly in the 2nd dekad).

Rainfall conditions started in improving in midApril and by 25 April, most parts of Somalia have received some rainfall of varying amounts and intensities (Map 1). However, cumulative rainfall between 1 March through 25 April is below average in most parts of the country, especially in northwestm central and southern regions (Map 2). Based on available forecasts, further rainfall is expected through 10 May covering many parts of the country (Map 3). However, cumulative rainfall amounts are likely to remain below average in central and southern regions of Somalia (Map 4).

Vegetation conditions measured through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 11-20 April indicate below average vegetation conditions in most parts of central and southern Somalia and parts of northwest regions (Map 5).

Co

Temporary water sources and catchments in traditional grazing areas have been significantly depleted in most parts of the country. Consequently, significant degradation and depletion of pasture and water have been reported in most parts of the country. As a result, there has been abnormal increase in water prices, increased and earlier than normal water trucking and increased and atypical livestock migration to distant grazing areas in most regions of the country. Due to worsening drougfht conditions, livestock abortion among small ruminants, culling of new born kids to save the mothers and increased livestock mortality of the new borns was reported in parts of northern and central regions.

Increased rainfall which started in late April is expected to continue through early May and this will bring some relief in pastoral livelihoods, especially in northern Somalia. However, based on current forecasts, rainfall thorugh 10 May is expected to remain below average in most parts of centgral and southern Somalia. As a result, given the delayed and poor start ofd the Gu rains, conditions are becoming less favorable for crop cuiltivation during the season. As a result, a below average Gu season harvest is expected.","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565019-Climate-Update-March-2021.png?itok=PCi4V9kN,"['climate', 'country', 'southern', 'map', 'central', 'regions', 'parts', 'conditions', 'issued', 'update', 'average', '29', 'rainfall', '2021', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought

The central and southern region will see light to moderate rains within the week in forecast. In the Ethiopian highland, whose rainfall is largely responsible for increase in river flow along the Juba and Shabelle Rivers inside Somalia, moderate to high rainfall is foreseen in the coming one week.

It is worth nothing that, the observed rains and the foreseen rains in the coming week are not sufficient to alleviate the current drought conditions in the country, more rains with good quantity, temporal and spatial distribution are required during the season in order to meet the current water deficit and improve the situation.

River levels along the Shabelle have increased slightly at Belet Weyne over the last few days, but remains low and below the normal for this period of the year. Along Juba River the levels are within normal for this period. Given the rainfall forecast, a slight increase in the levels for both rivers is expected with no risk of flooding over the next seven days.

Users are advised that this is a forecast and at times there may be discrepancies between estimates and actual amounts of rainfall received.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,How climate change drives humanitarian crises - International Rescue Committee,https://www.rescue.org/article/how-climate-change-drives-humanitarian-crises,"Climate change is set to unleash widespread and sustained damage across the world—even if we succeed in limiting global warming.

This is not a problem for future generations to solve. The catastrophic consequences are already here as more frequent and intense natural disasters and extreme weather destroy livelihoods, intensify violent conflict, and force people to flee their homes. The impacts of COVID-19 have only compounded these threats to the lives of millions around the world.

The need for bold and urgent action could not be clearer. Find out what you need to know.

What is climate change?

Scientists estimate that the Earth has already warmed by 2.12 degrees Fahrenheit (1.18 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century. With the exception of 1998, 19 of the warmest years on record occurred after 2000.

There is overwhelming evidence that this warming is caused by human activity, specifically the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), composed of thousands of scientists, projects a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.

How climate change is transforming the planet

Climate, the average temperature and precipitation over time, is distinct from weather, which refers to the day-to-day temperature, precipitation, or events like storms, and is influenced by a number of factors. It is difficult to say one specific weather event, such as a hurricane, is directly caused by climate change. However, scientists do know that global warming makes extreme weather more frequent and more intense.

Extreme weather encompasses heat waves, droughts, and hurricanes or other “megastorms” that transform communities in the blink of an eye. Extreme weather also contributes to less predictable rainy or dry seasons, the transformation of fertile land into desert (also called desertification) and sea level rise.

“When we talk about greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, it sounds very esoteric,” says Tara Clerkin, a technical specialist supporting agriculture and climate livelihoods programming for the International Rescue Committee (IRC). “But I think in the last few years, we've all started to actually experience and feel in our own lives what those impacts of rising temperatures and increased emissions are. And that is even more true for the places in which the IRC works.”

Climate change exacerbates pre-existing risks

Just as it is difficult to attribute an individual storm to climate change, a crisis can result from a combination of factors. Conflict increases when a drought causes food shortages, and hunger is worsened by the economic impacts of a pandemic like COVID-19.

Climate change works like this, as extreme weather events combine with already existing conflicts or other crises to make life even more difficult for those grappling with its impacts.

Tara points to the conflict in Syria, which began in 2011 after years of drought. “Was climate change the sole reason for the civil war? No. Was it a contributing factor? Yes.”

Ethiopia is another example. The country relies heavily on agriculture and has a history of drought and flooding, both of which climate change makes more likely.

In 2020, Ethiopia and other East African countries such as Somalia and Kenya endured the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the largest outbreak of locusts in recent history, a phenomenon at least partly attributed to climate change. In Ethiopia alone, over 1 million people have lost crops due to the locusts and 11 million are expected to face crisis levels of food insecurity. Late in the year, a conflict broke out in the country’s Tigray region, further pushing the population toward crisis.

“What we’re seeing is that multiple once-in-a-generation crises are happening in the same location and in the same year,” says Tara.

Climate change also contributes to poor health outcomes. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are likely to exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. Lack of access to clean water will lead to higher incidence of diarrhea, a major cause of death for children under 5. Coupled with the destruction of fragile ecosystems, the changing climate has a profound impact on the occurrence of viruses like COVID-19 that emerge from animals.

As the Earth warms, people move

Farmers “live and die by the rain,” notes Tara, and in many regions rainfall is becoming increasingly erratic, forcing many farmers and herders to move in search of better lands or other work.

As more farmers and other members of the community move, they often congregate in smaller areas where resources become scarce. Conflict becomes more likely, and that violence forces more people to flee their homes.

Tara cites Chad as an example of this cycle. Considered by at least one index the country in the world most vulnerable to climate change, Chad has one of the highest rates of hunger in the world—87 percent of Chad’s mostly rural population lives below the poverty line. It is also home to hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring countries.

In addition, Chad, alongside its neighbors Niger and Cameroon, faces increasing violence from extremist groups who contribute to the region’s insecurity.

“You have more people trying to earn a living from less land that is less fertile,” says Tara. “And then that just drives more conflict again.”

Climate change is also contributing to crises that are driving people in Central America from their homes. When hurricanes Eta and Iota slammed northern Central America within weeks of one another in November of 2020, they worsened the situation in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other countries that were already plagued by gang violence and extreme poverty.

""The hurricanes were ... the last in the series of what was a devastating year,"" said Meghan Lopez, vice president of the IRC’s programs in Latin America, during an interview with CNN. ""To have the pandemic on top of that, to have aid to the region cut, all of these things create this pressure cooker where there's no escape valve. And the only escape valve is to try to flee the terrible situation people are living in ... People are making desperate decisions.""

Climate change has the biggest impact on people already living in crisis

A University of Notre Dame index recently ranked the top 10 countries most vulnerable to a warming climate; seven were also included in the IRC’s 2021 Emergency Watchlist featuring the countries most likely to face humanitarian crises in 2021. All ten countries are experiencing armed conflict.

Afghanistan is one of those countries. While the central Asian nation continues to grapple with conflict and economic turmoil—as it has for four decades—over a million people remain displaced due to natural disasters.

Unequal impacts are felt within countries, too. Whenever a crisis strikes, women and girls suffer disproportionately, and climate-related crises are no exception.

“Women are usually responsible for household tasks, and this includes gardening, manual labor and farming, as well as getting water and firewood and feeding their families,” says Tara. “All of these are more challenging when climate change has impacted the local environment.”

Gender-based violence also increases during a crisis. In Honduras, for instance, local organizations reported a 60 to 70 percent increase in reported cases of gender-based violence in the aftermath of two hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic. Women looking for help found themselves in overcrowded shelters suffering from a lack of privacy and increasing sexual violence.

What needs to happen

“I think we are at the point where there's willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready,” says Tara. “We're starting to figure out how we can actually move the needle to reduce emissions and vulnerability.”

I think we are at the point where there's willingness and opportunity, and where we have solutions ready.

It is critical that humanitarian institutions call out the lack of global political leadership during the pandemic—and ensure we don’t repeat the same mistakes.

Tara sees hope in programs that build “climate resilience,” which means that they prepare communities to confront the impacts of climate change while also taking steps to lessen greenhouse gas emissions, prevent environmental degradation, and rebuild biodiversity.

It also means preparing for future climate emergencies, with communities given financial support and decision-making power. Local leaders (particularly indigenous populations), smallholder farmers and livestock herders already have the knowledge and experience necessary to confront this crisis.

“There needs to be more respect for the generations of experience these leaders have in managing and maintaining their own land,” Tara says.

Future response to climate change must also be feminist, recognizing the unique and disproportionate ways women are impacted. As farmers, carers or activists, women (and women-led organizations) are central to food security and effective climate change mitigation.

None of these efforts can happen without innovation. We need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that tackle the world’s most pressing climate-related problems, while building on local and indigenous knowledge and expertise on climate resilience and natural resource management.

How the IRC helps

The IRC helps communities respond to the changing climate by mapping climate hazards and developing early warning systems, supporting community-led natural resource management and water conservation, and training people in sustainable livelihoods—all while putting women and girls’ needs at the center of our programs.

The IRC has also developed partnerships for advocacy and policy change. We are a signatory to the InterAction NGO Climate Compact, a promise to advance the global agenda to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the effects of climate change on people with the least power and fewest resources.

This commitment is also reflected in the IRC’s long-term strategy. Our climate action plan puts forward an ambitious agenda to reduce our own organizational carbon footprint by pairing our community programs with concrete changes to our operational delivery, without comprising the depth or quality of support we offer communities responding to climate change.","Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/styles/window_width_breakpoints_theme_rescue_large_2x/public/hero/17872/hero-image/climatecovertjump_ethiopia_tulliguuleed_036_for_size.jpg?itok=15cRS3xS×tamp=1620661131,"['climate', 'irc', 'conflict', 'change', 'weather', 'drives', 'crises', 'women', 'violence', 'impacts', 'countries', 'humanitarian', 'tara']",climate_change
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Somalia: Signs MoU to address impacts of extreme weather events - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77494,"Source(s): United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs - Headquarters (OCHA)



The Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia has signed the Treaty and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the African Risk Capacity (ARC) to work together towards helping the country better prepare, plan and respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters. The ARC Treaty and MoU were signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia by Hon. Khadija Mohamed Diriye, the country’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs & Disaster Management.

Somalia’s exposure to both drought and flood risks further threatens the national economy; requiring pre-emptive disaster risk reduction strategies to improve multi-hazard early warning, preparedness, and national coordination for disaster response. In this context, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs & Disaster Management initiated an engagement with ARC in September 2018 to explore ways of diversifying existing disaster risk management approaches, particularly, through a sovereign and parametric insurance mechanism.

In her official statement, Hon. Khadija M Diriye, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Federal Republic of Somalia, said that ”Somalia’s hazard profile is dominated by droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, desert locust, diseases (epidemic/pandemic), and terrorism that disrupt people’s livelihoods, destroy the infrastructure, divert planned use of resources, interrupt economic activities and retard development.”

Increasingly, it is recognized that hazards are linked. “The impacts of natural hazards do not occur in isolation; but recognition of such cause and effect on a national scale has encouraged the Government of Somalia in taking on a paradigm shift from crisis management to risk management. This will enable us to utilise our finite resourcesin a more efficient and timely manner towards assisting the vulnerable populations in the event of disasters. Therefore, we are proud to sign the ARC Establishment Agreement, as its 35th Member, as well as the MoU, with a strong commitment to taking the necessary steps to ensure that the collaboration leads to building of our national response capacities against the adverse impacts of natural disasters.”Hon. Diriye concluded.

The signing of the MoU will set out the terms, conditions and a framework to facilitate cooperation between ARC and FGS to address the impact of extreme weather events, including providing training support to Government personnel as well as preparing Somalia’s potential participation in future ARC (drought/flood/tropical cyclone) insurance risk pools.

Commending the Federal Government of Somalia for signing the ARC Treaty and MoU, the UN-ASG and ARC Group-Director General, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong remarked: “As the nature and intensity of natural catastrophes evolve across the region, we maintain that the continent will be better protected through a pooled-risk approach bringing together countries and leveraging smart partnerships. Today, the ARC Group proudly welcomes the Federal Republic of Somalia as its 35th Member State. By simultaneously signing the ARC Treaty and MoU, the Government (of Somalia) has demonstrated a clear commitment to strengthening the country’s disaster risk reduction capacities; and thereby joining a growing number of African Union Member States that are accessing our tools to create coordinated contingency plans before catastrophes strike.” Continuing, Mr Diong added, “We would like to particularly convey our readiness to work with the (Somalian) Authorities in accurately profiling their natural disaster risks and designing quantified response plans to better secure the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations in the event of a peril.”","Tue, 27 Apr 2021 16:07:30 GMT",,"['risk', 'signs', 'disaster', 'mou', 'natural', 'events', 'weather', 'extreme', 'treaty', 'federal', 'national', 'impacts', 'humanitarian', 'management', 'arc', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought
DR-2021-000054-SOM,The climate supercycle - The Ecologist,https://theecologist.org/2021/may/14/climate-supercycle,"Climate breakdown erodes people’s lives. It doesn’t arrive with a bang or a whimper but a steady, crushing squeeze.

To be clear, climate breakdown is already driving devastatingly spectacular crises, overwhelmingly in the Global South - impacting those least responsible for it.

But we need to be attentive to the slower, more insidious forms of climate violence as well as the attention-grabbing firestorms, super cyclones and locust plagues.

Supercycle

Climate breakdown is putting the squeeze on living standards around the world. The cost of the basic necessities of life is increasing.

This is not only intensifying the ‘end of the middle classes’ – those working people who have secured more than the bare minimum and some semblance of income security – and producing a deepening crisis amongst the poorest.

This squeeze is where climate breakdown will be most felt over the coming decade, and sets the terms for what our hotter future will look like.

The current squeeze is a boon for investors and extractive industries. It’s not called a squeeze in the financial press. Rather, it goes by the name of a commodity supercycle.

A supercycle describes a period of time where commodity prices – food, ore, oil, coal, etc – rise above the longer-term price trend for decades at a time.

Defaults

It’s generally accepted that there are long-term economic trends that affect commodity prices, driving them up and down based on the cyclical expansion of industrial capacity.

The last supercycle, driven largely by China’s rapid industrial expansion in the 1990s, ended a decade ago with the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession.

It coincided – or rather, produced – the largest ever increase in global greenhouse gas emissions, and generated enormous profits for primary industries - profits that in term fuelled speculative real-estate and share price bubbles.

It not only ended with the financial crisis; it triggered it.

The massive increase in the price of oil, of raw materials and food, combined with stagnant incomes and wages, meant people in the US were unable to pay their mortgages or debt payments, leading to a cascade of defaults starting in 2006 and accelerating through the crisis.

Commodity

Drought, combined with rising oil prices massively drove food prices up in 2008. Foreshadowing the later 2011 food crisis, there were protests and riots around the world.

After oil prices briefly collapsed, they returned to similar highs in 2009, again driving food prices higher.

This time the rise is the cost of living provoke a series of revolts and revolutions, most famously across North Africa in the Arab Spring.

The volatility of food, oil and commodity prices appeared to end by 2015, marking the close of the supercycle. The current signs all signal the start of another, more pernicious squeeze however.

Climate breakdown is driving a new commodity supercycle, putting the squeeze once again on those least able to afford it.

Industry

It is driving prices higher in two ways. The first is through the most commonly known effects of climate change: drought, disaster and declines in crop yields.

Climate change is already producing drought around the world: at the time of writing Madagascar, Somalia and Afghanistan are all facing food shortages due to drought, and a number of crucial food producing regions around the world such as California are also in drought.

A range of foods are already seeing declines in yields, and disasters (floods, fires, storms) have affected food production around the world, and the price of food is rising quickly.

As water becomes more scarce, rainfall patterns shift, and yields decline the price of food will rise, meaning we will see even more people slip into food poverty and malnutrition, and more money from people’s wages being spent on basic food stuffs.

The second impact is more insidious. As governments and industry start the slow move to ‘green’ energy and industry, demand for raw materials is increasing.

Investments

There is currently not enough supply for many of the raw materials for a green transition available, creating the conditions for boomed ore and mineral prices.

Given the long lead in time for developing new mines and supply chains, this means for the foreseeable future – that is, as long as the transition lasts – commodity prices will ride high on government and business investment.

To be sure there are other factors at play here. China is buying in more corn to feed livestock. There are the impacts of last year’s swine flu pandemic - resulting in the deaths of hundreds of millions of pigs.

And there are the the material requirements of China's massive belt and road project. This sits with the hunt for new investments by banks and hedge funds fat with government subsidies and bailouts.

But the bigger picture is this supercycle will continue as long as resource availability continues to fall short of demand.

Neoliberalism

This will last at least a generation, given the impacts of climate breakdown and the need to transform almost all of the global economy.

What this ultimately means is that people face increased prices for a wide range of basic goods, including energy and food - and this in turn will reduce living standards.

We’ll likely see increasing debt defaults, more demand for social services, and increased food and fuel poverty.

This will deepen the current squeeze on the world’s middle and working classes, already under attack as conditions and wages are supressed, and trade union and protest rights are reduced.

Neoliberalism had already reduced the size of the middle classes, and increased poverty amongst the poor - working or otherwise.

Revolts

Climate breakdown risks deepening the polarisation between the wealthy few, and the rest of us. And the question is – and will continue to be – who will pay for climate breakdown? Will the majority quietly watch as their living standards are eroded? Will people accept less as their lot?

The turn to xenophobic nationalism is a worrying indicator of a desire to make ‘other people’ – non-European, non-white – pay for a crisis they did not produce in order to protect ‘our’ standard of living. But there are alternatives to this kind of green ‘paranoid nationalism’.

During the food crises of 2008 and 2011 people rose up against corrupt and violent government regimes, and opinion turned against the suicidal capitalism driving us towards catastrophe.

Protest, riot and revolution have long been the answer given by populations to the collapse of their standard of living.

Recent years have seen massive revolts against police aggression, systematic racism and misogyny, and against the climate crisis. The climate squeeze could well tip things over the edge once more.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Identifying Climate Adaptive Solutions to Displacement in Somalia: Assessment Report - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/identifying-climate-adaptive-solutions-displacement-somalia-assessment-report,"Executive Summary

The urbanisation – displacement – climate change nexus

The climate in Somalia is projected to become drier, warmer, more erratic, and more extreme than in recent decades and thus less favourable to crop, livestock, fisheries, and forestry-based livelihood systems. Other likely impacts include reduction of vegetation for grazing and more variable water availability, with grave impacts on livestock herding and livelihoods. Rising sea temperatures and acidification will reduce fish stocks and change their distribution. In a context of slow-onset natural hazard and environmental degradation, households and entire communities may have no other choice but to leave their place of origin in search of a more inhabitable area. This study explores the interaction(s) between climate change, displacement and urbanisation. The objective is to answer a dual question, in the context of the Somali cities of Baidoa and Kismayo: What factors trigger climate-induced migration? What adaptive and transformative solutions may contribute to building resilience amid displacement and climate change – at the community and policy levels?

Somalia has one the highest shares of urban population in the East and Horn of Africa region, with 46% of a total population of 15.2 million living in urban areas. It is currently experiencing a continuous and rapid urbanisation rate (around 4.3% per annum between 2015 and 2020; higher than the African average of 4%). By 2040, the urban population is estimated to grow to almost 60% of the total and expected to triple by 2050. Mogadishu (2.4 million people) and Hargeisa (1.2 million people) host half of this urban population, but other socioeconomic hubs and secondary cities also record a rapid demographic growth that is predicated to continue.

Exacerbated climate conditions, with a combination of slow and sudden onset events, have the effect of deteriorating food security. Traditional livelihood practices of rural communities and nomadic pastoralists are highly reliant on regular and predictable rainfall to sustain their crops or cattle, camels, goats and sheep, creating an unsustainable situation where displacement remains the only option. The consequence, according to the World Bank, is that close to three-quarters of Somalia’s 2.6 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) live in urban centres ‘in disconnected pockets outside city limits, constraining their access to services and creating poverty traps.’

However, while policymakers, practitioners, and communities often focus on immediate adaptive mechanisms and temporary solutions, this report advocates for a broader perspective, by considering a climate double-bind: 1) On the one hand, the consequences of climate change contribute to both the slow-onset degradation of natural and human ecosystems and also accelerate internal displacement in Somalia; 2) On the other, the subsequent rapid and unplanned urbanisation causes irreversible detrimental impacts on urban areas. What adaptive solutions may contribute to building resilience amid displacement and climate change?

Baidoa and Kismayo are fast-growing cities in Southern Somalia, and key locations of settlement for IDPs from rural areas. IDPs are a highly vulnerable group, with concerns over forced eviction, housing, land and property (HLP), as well as water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) co-existing with other protection risks – whether physical, material or legal safety. Baidoa received the largest number of drought displaced persons in 2017, with IDPs living either on unplanned sites, settlements or joining the ranks of the urban poor in this state and district capital. Under the leadership of its mayor, and support from a range of stakeholders, Baidoa Municipality has, in the last five years, focused on city/urban planning, sustainable urban development and housing, linked with continental African Union priorities on the protection of IDPs. The number of arrivals is lower in Kismayo than in other urban locations of Southern Somalia, but represents a significant proportion of its population. Displacement situations are protracted with both cyclical and chronic trends. Over the last decades, IDPs have settled in Kismayo on government-owned properties, raising concerns over land property issues, as well as poor living and sanitation conditions.

To ensure a robust methodology on such a complex issue, the research team used both quantitative and qualitative data collection tools, including an extensive desk review, a survey of 625 IDP and host community households, semi-structured interviews (SSIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), community observations, and key informant interviews (KIIs). The team conducted fieldwork in April and May 2020, in the urban areas of Calanley and Dalxiiska (Kismayo) as well as Barwaaqo and Towfiiq (Baidoa). Rural areas of origin were also assessed in Jubaland (Bulabartire) and South West State (Reebay).

DR-2021-000054-SOM,A Region on the Move: 2020 Mobility Overview in the East and Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/region-move-2020-mobility-overview-east-and-horn-africa-and-arabian-peninsula,"INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 outbreak has marked the beginning of a new global paradigm, where unprecedented shifts in the capacity of governments to issue multiple restrictive measures impacting movements were observed in a highly fluid mobility environment. In line with a continental trend, the EHoA was less severely affected by the pandemic from a health perspective, and countries have been progressively lifting some movement restrictions during the second half of the year. However, the pandemic is far from over, as governments and authorities continue to issue new mobility restrictions and policy changes, while the socio-economic impact of repeated lockdowns and renewed closures of points of entry (PoEs) are yet to be fully assessed.

Home to an estimated population of 331 million, of which 42 per cent are under the age of 15, the region hosted 6.2 million international migrants at mid-year 2020. With over 6.5 million IDPs and more than 3.6 million refugees and asylum-seekers recorded by the end of the year, countries in the EHoA have continued to experience significant levels of internal and cross-border mobility, although at a reduced pace. Mobility in the region is still triggered by a combination of persistent insecurity and conflict, harsh climatic shocks and conditions, in addition to socio-economic drivers and more traditional seasonal factors, fueling intra- and extra-regional movements. These intertwined flows of IDPs, migrants and refugees are strongly influenced by historical and cultural links such as those tying similar communities separated by borders in the HoA and in the Great Lakes region, as well as by dynamics of labour supply and demand, locally and towards the Gulf countries. At the same time, the pandemic has also generated new trends, while exacerbating existing vulnerabilities of the most fragile population groups.

Hosting some of the world’s most severe protracted displacement contexts, the region has also witnessed new waves of displacement due to hostilities affecting the Tigray region of Ethiopia since the beginning of November. Multiple countries were also hit by repeated drought, a cyclone, and regular flash and riverine floods. The pandemic has also accentuated the existing socio-economic vulnerabilities of these displaced populations and further hampered the achievement of sustainable and durable solutions. These aspects are further investigated in the Forced Displacement section with a focus on four countries which have reported the most volatile conditions in 2020.

New mobility trends were particularly evident along the Eastern Route, which runs from the HoA to the Arabian Peninsula, in particular to Saudi Arabia, and which has long been the most relevant migratory corridor in the region in terms of volume and characteristics. At the beginning of the outbreak, when restrictions were the most severe, a switch in routes was observed as migrants attempted to cross through Somalia rather than Djibouti where border closures were enforced more effectively. Soon enough, many stranded migrants were reported in different parts of the Horn, unable to proceed or return to their place of origin. The increased pressure, coupled with fears of contamination, resulted in a widespread xenophobic and discriminatory narrative, limited or curtailed access to coping strategies and basic services along the journey, in addition to episodes of detentions and deportations. By the end of the year, it is estimated that at least 2,700 migrants were stranded across the region, with a further 32,700 EHoA migrants stranded in Yemen, out of which an estimated 6,200 were in detention. In 2020, only 37,535 new arrivals from the HoA were tracked along the coast of Yemen compared to the same period in 2019, corresponding to a reduction of 73 per cent. Overall, this corridor reported a 66 per cent decrease in movements due to a sharp fall in monthly movements as of March 2020 (from 468,234 movements in 2019 to 157,702 in 2020). Most interestingly and of relevance were the return trends observed from Saudi Arabia and Yemen to the Horn, which were halted or reduced during the year, whereas an increasing number of migrants were observed to return spontaneously from Yemen to the Horn using the same network of smugglers. The complexities, risks and consequences of such revamped bi-directional trends are analyzed in depth in the Regional Mixed Migration Trends section, together with an analysis of migrant movements along the other main corridors affecting the EHoA.

This edition builds on multiple IOM data sources, whereby the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) constitutes the main methodology used to track and monitor displacement and population mobility, as it maps IDP and returnee stocks, migration flows and characteristics of populations on the move.

Further migrant data is collected by IOM through modules targeting specific sub-groups of these populations at different stages of their migration journey. The analysis is further enriched through findings of multiple research efforts being conducted along the Eastern and Southern Routes, as well as external sources to provide a holistic understanding of the articulated population movement dynamics stemming from this region. To this end, a Regional Data Hub (RDH) was established at the beginning of 2018 to promote evidence-based migration dialogue, lead regional research efforts and foster a multi-layered analysis of regional migration data.","Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1567488-IOM_RoMR_EHoA_2020.png?itok=BzUrMtIh,"['region', 'migrants', 'africa', 'regional', 'peninsula', 'world', 'east', 'trends', 'yemen', 'arabian', 'displacement', 'migration', 'horn', 'countries', '2020', 'mobility', 'overview', 'movements']",none

Inflation: Somali Shilling (SoSh)-using areas: Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased (by 2-4%) in March 2021 across all regions of Somalia compared to February 2021 due to increases in cereal prices. Similarly, compared to the five-year average for March (2016-2020), CPI increased (11-26%) across all regions of Somalia due to higher prices of sorghum (the main local cereal used in the calculation of CPI) and increases in imported food prices this year.

Somaliland Shilling (SISh)-using areas: CPI increased (3-4%) in March 2021 compared to both February 2021 and five-year average for March (2016-2020).

Exchange rate: SoSh-using areas: Exchange rates between the SoSh and the United States Dollar (USD) remained relatively stable in most regions of Somalia in March 2021 compared to February 2021. Compared to the five-year average, SoSh depreciated at moderate rates (9-14%) in southern and central regions of the country. The depreciation against the USD was highest in northeast region (42%) due to continued circulation of large amount of locally printed SoSh currency notes in these markets.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Humanitarian Ministry and United Nations jointly declare drought in Somalia - statement - Horn Observer,https://hornobserver.com/articles/849/Humanitarian-Ministry-and-United-Nations-jointly-declare-drought-in-Somalia-statement,"Mogadishu, Somalia– Based on observed drought conditions and rainfall forecasts, the Federal Government of Somalia and the humanitarian community are deeply concerned about the deterioration of the dry conditions in Somalia which has now escalated to a drought situation.





More than 80 per cent of the country is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. Although the Gu rains started in some parts of the country, forecasts indicate below-average rainfall. Limited rainfall amounts are expected in May and June with larger parts of Somaliland, Puntland, central regions and Gedo region being the worst affected.

""Somalia experiences a cyclical pattern of drought every five to six years and the failure of the rains thus far spells disaster. At a time when communities are already struggling to cope with the recent water shortages in many parts of the country, the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and already dire humanitarian situation in the country, many lives are at stake,” said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs Khadija Diriye.

Somalia is on the front line of climate change and the frequency of climate-related disasters is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, Somalia has experienced more than 30 climate-related hazards, including 12 droughts and 19 floods – triple the number of climate-related hazards experienced between 1970 and 1990. In 2021, drought conditions are expected to increase displacement and have a lasting negative impact on livelihoods and food security outcomes. At least 3.4 million people are projected to be affected by drought conditions by the end of 2021, of whom around 380,000 are expected to be displaced.

The loss of livelihoods forces families to rely on increasingly severe coping mechanisms, worsened by political instability, armed conflict and forced displacement. ""We are at the brink of a human catastrophe amidst an already dire humanitarian situation,” said the Humanitarian Coordinator, Adam Abdelmoula. ""The cost of inaction is far too dire and the time to take action is now. Urgent and immediate collective action, including scaling-up of response and funding, is needed now to mitigate a full-scale disaster.”

The Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) requires US$ 1.09 billion to assist four million people, including more than three million people in acute need. As of today, the HRP is 15 per cent funded.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,SAEED SHUKRI - Unrecognized Vote: Somaliland's Democratic Journey - The Elephant,https://www.theelephant.info/long-reads/2021/05/03/unrecognized-vote-somalilands-democratic-journey/,"Somaliland reinstated its independence in 1991 following the collapse of the military regime that had ruled Somalia for two decades. The Somali National Movement which took over the northern regions facilitated a broad-based conference in Burco attended by traditional leaders of all six regions of Somaliland who unanimously agreed to the dissolution of the union with Somalia and proclaimed independence on 18 May 1991.

The conference also established Somaliland’s first government, based on the SNM’s organisational structure, with its Chairman, Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, becoming Somaliland’s first executive president and the SNM Central Committee functioning as the country’s first parliament. It had a two-year mandate, and was tasked with accommodating non-Isaaq clans into the government, developing a constitution and preparing Somaliland for elections.

The new country continued to suffer violence and weak institutions, with elders stepping in to prevent degeneration into protracted civil war. In 1992, the first of two major clan conferences, held in Sheekh, created the national Guurti, or council of elders, bringing together elders from all the clans responsible for controlling clan militia and preventing conflict, as well as defending the country.

The 1993 Borama Conference

The second major clan conference assembled in Borama, a city in the West of Somaliland, for nearly five months in 1993. It eventually produced a National Charter which established government structures and the separation of powers for a transitional two-year period, pending the adoption of a new constitution. The charter included the creation of a bicameral parliament, with the Guurti formally institutionalised as the upper house, and the lower house made up of elected representatives. A clan-based electoral college elected Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal president for two years as well as members of the guurti and the lower house.

The political system established in 1993 became known as Shirbeelad, meaning “clan” or “community,” integrating indigenous forms of institutional arrangements with modern institutions of government. It was only meant to be in place for three years but lasted a decade.

Following the transition of power from the SNM leader Abdirahman to Egal, the new administration now had two years to prepare an interim constitution for approval by parliament and the upper house. The process proved to be time-consuming, necessitating extensions of the charter’s deadline.

Ultimately, two drafts were produced. In 1994, the government hired a Sudanese lawyer to write the constitution while the House of Representatives appointed an ad-hoc committee advised by lawyers, traditional leaders, religious figures and politicians which, suspecting the government’s draft would give excessive power to the executive branch, drafted an alternate version. Following deliberations to reconcile the two documents, a unified draft was adopted as the interim constitution in 1996, with a three-year implementation period leading up to a referendum. A final, revised constitution was approved by both houses on 30 April 2000 and overwhelmingly endorsed by 97 per cent of voters in a public referendum held on 31 May 2001.

The local government and parliamentary electoral system

The constitutional referendum paved the way for popular elections. The first set of municipal and national elections held between 2002 and 2005 were conducted by a novice electoral commission with almost no international technical and financial support and without many of the accoutrements of modern elections such as censuses, comprehensive voter registers and voter education. Though not without problems, disagreements and accusations of malpractice, the elections were considered largely credible, free and fair, and their outcomes were widely accepted.

The constitution defined a new political system for Somaliland — a democratic, multi-party system, in which the head of state and members of parliament and district councils would be elected directly by the public by secret ballot, instead of through electoral colleges of elders.

Within two years, a body of laws was passed to facilitate formation of political parties, define citizenship, delineate the structure of local government, and lay down electoral procedures. The laws provided for a seven-member Registration Committee which administered the registration process for political parties as well as the process of qualifying three to become national parties as stipulated by the constitution. The constitutional limitation to the number of national parties was meant to prevent the political system from fracturing along clan or regional lines.

The first local government elections were held In December 2002. Voter registration was only carried out in urban areas, with around 330,000 people being registered. However, on polling day people were allowed to vote irrespective of whether they had a registration card or not (and were then marked with indelible ink).

Six registered political formations qualified to compete in the polls, with the top three in terms of number of seats won recognised as national parties which could field candidates in national elections, including for the position of president. The successful parties were Egal’s UDUB, Kulmiye and UCID. European Union observers declared the elections — during which 440,000 votes were cast — to be “of as high a quality as is realistic within the prevailing environment”.

The presidential polls

In 2003, with the presidential elections fast approaching, President Dahir Riyale Kahin, who had succeeded Egal after the latter’s death in May 2002, met with the three national parties and agreed on the composition of the seven-member National Election Commission. The president and the Guurti would each nominate two commissioners while the political parties would pick one each.

The elections were held on 14 April 2003, pitting President Riyale of UDUB, Ahmed Mohamed Silanyo of Kulmiye and Feisal Ali Hussein of UCID. The result was a wafer-thin victory for the incumbent, who won by just 80 votes out of the 500,000 cast. The Kulmiye Party immediately asked for a recount at some of the polling stations but this did not change the original tally. The result was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court which endorsed Kahin’s victory. Silanyo conceded and Kahin was sworn in on 16 May.

Many who were uncertain and wary of a disputed election and its consequences, expressed gratitude to the Kulmiye leader, Silanyo, for his incredible decision. A seasoned politician, Silanyo had weighed the situation and seen the turmoil that lay ahead. He sacrificed his own political and party ambitions in order to save the fragile democracy. Given that he had served the longest in the SNM leadership and was from the dominant Isaaq clan, Silanyo’s concession removed the latent suspicion that the powerful Isaak would establish hegemony over the other clans.

2005 legislative elections

On 29 September 2005, Somaliland held its first, and so far only, multiparty contest for the 82 parliamentary seats. The 82 members of the house were elected on the basis of proportional representation. UDUB won with 33 seats, Kulmiye garnered 28 and UCID captured 21.

Smarting from their 2003 presidential loss. Kulmiye and UCID blocked or rejected any motion from the executive branch. It was the beginning of political tensions in Somaliland, which crippled the cohesive nature of Somaliland democracy. The parliament elected in 2005 is still glued to their seats because the opposition political majority in the house has continued to filibuster and shoot down any progressive motion pertaining to elections.

He sacrificed his own political and party ambitions in order to save the fragile democracy.

It was only after the 2005 elections that political stakeholders agreed to establish the first voter registry. A law was enacted in 2007 to govern the process and, following some amendments, voter registration proceeded in 2008. It was, however, briefly suspended following suicide bombings in Hargeisa on 29 October 2008, and was also marred by widespread fraud and mismanagement. Nearly 1.3 million names were collected throughout the country, each of which was meant to be validated through a biometric fingerprint system. According to Michael Walls — Co-Coordinator of the international election observation mission for the Somaliland presidential election in 2009 and lecturer at University College London — registration centres permitted more than half of those registering to do so without taking a readable fingerprint and “large numbers were permitted to hold photos in front of the camera rather than presenting themselves for the purpose”.

The 26 June 2010 presidential election

With the term of President Kahin expiring in May 2008, the voter registration exercise was meant to facilitate municipal and presidential elections. However, the polls were repeatedly delayed because of infighting within the higher political circles, specifically between the parliament, opposition leaders and the president, necessitating two extensions of his term. As provided for in the constitution, the Guurti approved the president’s request for an extension of his term and that of parliament to March 2009 due to the instability in the eastern regions. The second extension occurred at the request of the NEC which needed another year to prepare for the polls due to the prevailing political situation, economic problems and technical issues.

The elections were finally held two years late — on 26 June 201 — and were again contested by Kulmiye, UDUB and UCID. Nearly 540,000 voters cast their ballots across the country on election day, electing Kulmiye leader Silanyo, with 50 per cent the vote. It was now Kahin’s turn to gracefully concede and Silanyo was sworn in on July 26 in a ceremony attended by delegations from across East Africa, including officials from Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia.

Local government elections in 2012

On 28 November 2012, Somaliland held its second round of local council elections, the results of which, like the first a decade earlier, would determine the three national political parties that could contest national elections for the next decade. Though largely free and relatively peaceful, the elections were marred by multiple voting exacerbated by the lack of a voter register – the previous one having been nullified by parliament after it defied attempts to clean up the voter roll — and the ease with which supposedly indelible ink was removed.

With two of the three national parties in trouble — many of UCID’s supporters and MPs had transferred their allegiance to Wadani, a new political organisation, while UDUB, the party of the two previous presidents, was widely thought to be dissolving — there was space for new political formations. Five new formations contested the 2012 elections alongside Kulmiye and UCID. Despite some dispute and violence in the immediate aftermath, the results were accepted and Kulmiye, UCID and Wadani emerged as the national political parties.

Presidential elections — 2017

On 13 November 2017, Somaliland conducted its third presidential election, its sixth popular national voting exercise in 15 years. The election — which had originally been scheduled for June 2015 but was delayed, initially at the request of the NEC and then due to the drought ravaging the country in January 2017 — saw three candidates competing to replace the incumbent Silanyo, who had decided to step down: Wadani’s Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi Irro, UCID’s Faisal Ali Warabe, and Kulmiye’s Muse Bihi Abdi. The polls, which were preceded by the rollout of a new biometric voter registration system, experienced considerable delay caused by technical and political challenges, and drought. Compared to over a million in 2010, 873,000 voters were registered, although only just over 700,000 actually collected the voter cards that would allow them to vote.

Once again, peaceful voting was followed by delays in the tabulation and collation of results, and allegations of malpractice. Violence led to some fatalities and the results were disputed, especially by Wadani which demanded a recount but eventually relented. On 21 November, Abdi was declared the winner with 55 per cent of the vote and became the country’s fifth president, cementing a tradition of peaceful handovers of power that is relatively rare in the region.

On November 7th 2020, as the country prepared for the long-delayed parliamentary and municipal elections that are now to be held at the end of May 2021, the National Electoral Commission (NEC) released the timetable for the voter registration exercise that was scheduled to start on November 29th 2020 and end on January 13th 2021. The voter registration exercise targeted those who had missed the 2016 voter registration exercise as well as those who had attained the voting age. The exercise would also be used to clean up the 2016 register. The NEC also gave voters who needed to change voting locations the opportunity to do so and to also replace lost voter cards.

Successes and challenges in the democratisation process

The Somaliland constitution contains fundamental principles strengthening citizens’ rights and freedoms, and emphasises the transition from clan-based politics to a multi-party democracy. However, political parties have not transformed themselves in terms of structure, vision and strategy. Rather than becoming vehicles for transmitting the noble constitutional principles of a multi-party system, in practice they derailed it and became clan-oriented in order to secure more votes. For example, they deferred to clan leaders in the selection of candidates, favouring those from the larger, vote-rich clans, ignoring the smaller ones, and generating conflicts and divisions between them.

The heteromorphic nature of Somali politics and democracy

Somali society is considered ethnically homogenous, monolingual and singularly Islamic. However, it is characterised by an entrenched paternal clan system. These clans are communities of relationships that share common ancestral origins and are interrelated. Clan relations extend over clan territories marked by fluid borders. Upon birth, a Somali is given one name — their first name. The second name is their father’s, the third their paternal grandfather’s and so on and so forth until you arrive at the sub-clan name. Knowing one’s genealogy several generations back is of paramount importance in Somali culture; it is a primary identifier for the individual and the clan. This genealogical identity has been used successfully in Somaliland to curb crime, insecurity and terrorism. It is the most successful approach to community policing.

The clan therefore is at the core of politics in Somali culture. Clan groups became the basis of the political parties for the parliamentarian election in 1964, which meant that from the outset Somalia political parties had a strong clan consciousness. The political system adopted in the 1960s was a clan-based parliamentary democratic system that inevitably led to the politicisation of the clan and the death of ideological politics and democracy.

Clanism, nepotism and patronage

This is the omnipresent danger to all Somali political and democratic initiatives. In such a clan-based political system, the government must have robust and powerful institutions. The governance culture must also emphasise meritocracy over clanism, nepotism and patronage. Governance must be inclusive economically, socially and in terms of development and must be seen to be meritocratic in the filling of public office. The tenets of democracy are optimistic; they envisage a rational human society. But humans are often irrational and their decisions, beliefs and bias is born out of their own selfish interests and desires.

Democracy calls for one man, one vote, and victory to the majority. This is ideal in a democracy that practices ideological politics. But where ideology is replaced by clanism, the majority will always be the most populous clan or the most populous clan alliance. This denies a country visionary leadership because political contests are not based on ideologies, development agenda or unity.

Further, elections in Somaliland have been characterised by unnecessary postponements when politicians are uncomfortable either with the electoral laws or with the appointment of NEC members. For example, the 2008 presidential elections were postponed for two years due to the opposition severely pressuring the incumbent president on controversial issues related to the choice of NEC members.

The political system adopted in the 1960s was a clan-based parliamentary democratic system that inevitably led to the politicisation of the clan and the death of ideological politics.

More recently, between 2017 and 2019, opposition parties UCID and Wadani were at loggerheads with the president over the nomination of the National Electoral Commission. The opposition was challenging the president’s prerogative to increase the number of the NEC commissioners from seven to nine. That dispute led to the postponement of the elections to 2021.

The political parties have truly shackled many opportunities to develop true democracy in Somaliland. The parliamentarians elected in 2005 are still in office 16 years later due to the cycle of postponements driven by political parties. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, however, as new political parties are rising unburdened by the tedious process of using local government elections to select the parties to compete in national elections. The four-year delay in holding the local government elections now means they will be held on the same day as the parliamentary polls.

Due to this, on April 4th 2021 the Somaliland parliament drew up new criteria for identifying national political parties which will now be selected through a separate electoral process in all the six regions. The political organisations that obtain the highest cumulative votes from all six regions will qualify for the three spots, allowing them to run for national elections in future. This elective process for new political parties will most likely be carried out before the expiration of the 10-year period for the current three political parties in November 2022.

Significance of the May 2021 elections

With 1.3 million registered voters (approximately 30 per cent of the population of Somaliland) expected to cast their votes — with 246 candidates gunning for 82 parliamentary seats and 966 vying for 249 district municipality seats in the six regions — these elections will be the most competitive yet. The outgoing parliamentarians were elected in 2005 and sat for 16 years, a decade longer than their mandated term limit. Similarly, the outgoing local government council was elected in 2012. The citizens of Somaliland are determined to bulldoze these unethical politicians. As stated earlier, the dysfunctional political parties are responsible for the postponements, while incumbent presidents have often played the game to gain more time on the throne.

The government will provide at least 80 per cent of the NEC’s budget, with international partners covering the rest. According to the NEC, it will be using biometric voter registration and a sophisticated voting system which university students have trained operate at the polling stations to ensure smooth operations with minimum technical errors and disruptions.

May 31 is of historic significance for Somaliland as it marks the 30th anniversary of Somaliland’s independence and the 20th anniversary of Somaliland’s multiparty democracy. It was on May 31st 2001 that Somaliland voters approved the constitution through a referendum. Somaliland youth born after 1991 have never had a chance to elect their parliamentary representatives.

Which way forward?

If Somaliland’s democratic transition is to last there must be strict regulation of the behaviour of political parties. Moreover, the structure, composition, competence and size of the National Election Commission must be re-evaluated and the best way to do this is to make its membership independent of political parties. The inclusion of political interests in an institution that is supposed to be a neutral adjudicator only destabilises and weakens the NEC with serious repercussions as the constant bickering brought on by political entities diminishes the trust that the electorate has in the organ. Elections are an emotive exercise in Somaliland especially since political compromise and consensus in Somaliland politics is almost absent. Further, the habitual postponing of the elections by the NEC, allowing elected officials to continue to hold seats beyond the end of their terms without the mandate of the electorate is a direct result of the inclusion of political stakeholders within the NEC.

May 31 is of historic significance for Somaliland as it marks the 30th anniversary of Somaliland’s independence and the 20th anniversary of Somaliland’s multiparty democracy.

The elders’ house is aged and incompetent; many of the key members have either died or are crippled. The Guurti is a powerful legal institution but it has not been re-elected since 1993; dead elders are replaced by their next-of-kin regardless of merit. The president must urgently form an ad-hoc commission to study the criteria required to elect the members of the upper house and laws to eradicate the postponement of elections and the extension of political mandates must be put in place.

And finally, mechanisms to engage citizens’ aspirations, to build trust and confidence in the democratisation process, seminars, lectures, debates and discussions may play a vital role, while the involvement of external experts/institutions will be necessary in providing training in democratisation, specifically for the upcoming parliament and the emerging political parties.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.theelephant.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/somaliland.jpeg,"['elections', 'vote', 'somalilands', 'parties', 'clan', 'voter', 'journey', 'somaliland', 'political', 'system', 'shukri', 'registration', 'saeed', 'democratic', 'national', 'president', 'unrecognized']",none

Examples include complex emergencies in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan; drought, food insecurity, floods, and desert locust infestations in the Horn of Africa; and the COVID-19 pandemic across the region.

USAID provided approximately $13.4 billion to respond to disasters in the East Africa and Sudans region between FY 2011 and FY 2020. USAID/BHA assistance included approximately $10.1 billion for emergency food assistance and nutrition support through U.S. in-kind food aid; locally, regionally, and internationally procured food; cash transfers for food; food vouchers; specialized nutrition products; and related activities, such as asset-building assistance, livelihood support, and early-recovery agricultural assistance. USAID/BHA support also included more than $3.3 billion for programs in agriculture; economic recovery and market systems; health; humanitarian coordination, information management, and assessments; humanitarian policy, studies, analysis, or applications; logistics support and relief commodities; multipurpose cash assistance; nutrition; protection; shelter and settlements; and water, sanitation, and hygiene.

In the last decade, USAID responded to crises in six countries in East Africa and Sudans, including to 63 declared disasters. USAID frequently deployed humanitarian teams to the region, including three Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) responding to the complex emergency in South Sudan, drought in Ethiopia, and a regional food security crisis in the Horn of Africa.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025: UK commitments to reach REAP's goal - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/making-1-billion-people-safer-disaster-2025-uk-commitments-reach-reap-s-goal,"UK International Champion on Adaptation and Resilience for the COP26 Presidency announced UK commitments at the Risk-Informed Early Action Partnership (REAP) pledging meeting.

Excellencies, friends, on behalf of the governments of Saint Lucia and the UK and the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership – welcome to you all.

Thank you for joining today’s important discussions to determine how to scale up early action on disasters.

We must reach REAP’s goal of making 1 billion people safer from disaster by 2025.

Between 1970 and 2019, 79% of disasters involved weather, climate and water-related hazards. 70% of resultant deaths occurred in the Least Developed Countries.

Sadly, these events will only increase. But increasing also is our ability to forecast and forewarn: over half of humanitarian needs stem from ‘predictable’ events.

But still only 1% of humanitarian finance is prearranged. This is not good enough.

This is where REAP partners come in. We are already seeing the benefits of early action. But we must see early action mainstreamed, embedded into policy and plans. As we heard at the Climate and Development Ministerial at the end of March, early action is a priority for developing countries.

So we must work together to make risk-informed early action the default position.

In 2019 the UK committed £175 million to REAP targets. Since then, we have continued to provide expert technical support to REAP.

And the UK funds the REAP Secretariat, who brought us all here today, finding common solutions to global problems.

The UK is a contributor to the IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), including its Forecast-based Action window.

The UK is working with the British Red Cross to increase access to Forecast-based Finance, supporting early action in Southern Africa and the Sahel.

As one of the largest donors to UN OCHA’s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), the UK supports its allocation of up to $140 million to Anticipatory Action, tackling food insecurity in Ethiopia and Somalia, and flooding in Bangladesh.

The UK has invested in expanding disaster risk insurance, so that governments can access cover at reduced prices.

The African Risk Capacity (ARC) enables governments to insure against drought, and the ARC has provided $500 million in drought risk coverage, and $64 million for early responses.

The UK is the largest contributor to the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), which disbursed $20 million to support St Vincent and the Grenadines, to provide money fast after the recent volcanic eruption.

So today, the UK would like to demonstrate further commitments to REAP:

To advance progress on Target 1, the UK will fund work with a priority group of vulnerable countries, to review and integrate climate and disaster laws, policies and procedures.

Partners will develop robust and appropriate policy frameworks, and effective disaster risk management plans.

To advance progress on Target 2, we will provide expert support to strengthen and expand shock-responsive social protection.

Today we are committing an additional £12 million to the Start Network’s Start Fund, so that frontline actors can respond swiftly and ahead of underfunded humanitarian crises.

This money will enable Start Network to develop an innovative series of ‘hubs’ to improve forecasting and locally-led action.

A further £8 million will support the Centre for Disaster Protection to help climate-vulnerable countries to prepare for disasters.

Our progress relies on strong evidence:

The UK-funded Adaptation Research Alliance (ARA) will work with REAP to address research needs, ensuring that strong evidence underpins the fulfilment of targets.

REAP partners are invited to work with us, to ensure research benefits the end user. Because as well as scaling up, REAP calls us to change how we manage risk.

The UK’s FCDO is integrating a climate and environment risk assessment into all of its new programming.

The UK’s G7 presidency has focused on anticipating shocks and acting early.

The UK secured G7 commitment to do more, by pre-agreeing emergency funding so that countries can act early.

The UK led the development of the G7 Famine Prevention and Humanitarian Crises Compact to increase anticipatory action and support to the CERF.

At the G7 in June, we hope to lead the way with more ambitious commitments to REAP targets.

At COP26 in November, we will demonstrate further investment in climate services and disaster risk reduction.

So now, it’s over to all of you:

Those who have come forward to act on avoidable losses, and those who feel their impacts first-hand.

We look forward to hearing what you can offer this ambitious partnership, where you can make investments that make a difference, and, indeed, how your experiences have lead to change.

So, thank you to all of you for your collaboration, your commitment and your ambition for this lifesaving agenda.

I will now hand to my colleague Diann Black-Layne, Ambassador for Climate Change and Director of the Department of the Environment of Antigua and Barbuda. Welcome Diana, it will be wonderful to hear your reflections.","Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/profiles/reliefweb/themes/kobe/images/rw-logo-social-media.png,"['early', 'climate', 'reap', 'million', 'making', 'disaster', 'goal', 'world', 'risk', 'support', 'action', 'reach', 'billion', 'reaps', 'work', 'safer', 'commitments', 'uk']",none

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.

On our radar

Israel-Palestine toll grows as war looms

The intensity of what could turn into a fully-fledged war between Israel and Hamas and its allies in Gaza is ramping up so quickly that much is likely to change by the time you read this. At the time of publication, 119 people had reportedly been killed by Israeli bombs in Gaza, and eight inside Israel by rockets fired from the occupied Palestinian territory that is home to around two million people, who are for the most part unable to leave because of severe restrictions on movement by Israel and Egypt. The death toll is likely to rise, and cities and towns inside Israel that are home to both Jewish and Palestinian Israeli citizens have also seen outbreaks of intercommunal violence. Synagogues were set on fire in the city of Lod, and live TV showed a mob of far-right Israelis in Bat Yam dragging a man they believed to be Arab from his car, beating him bloody. The roots of what’s happening now clearly go far deeper than the rising tensions over the past few weeks, but we suggest you read this for the recent background on the deadly flare-up.

WHO accused of covering up sex abuse claims

The World Health Organization has been accused of covering up sex abuse claims against its workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Ebola outbreak between 2018 and 2020. The WHO knew about allegations against one of its senior doctors during the Ebola crisis – a doctor with close ties to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus – but denied knowledge of the claims, according to The Associated Press, which obtained private emails, legal documents, and recordings of internal meetings. Another doctor allegedly tried to pay off a woman he impregnated. Neither of the men were disciplined, according to the AP. The New Humanitarian and the Thomson Reuters Foundation first broke the story last year about widespread aid worker sex abuse in Congo. This week, we published a second investigation with new claims of aid worker sex abuse during the Ebola outbreak. In total, 44 of the 73 women we interviewed accused men who said they worked for the WHO. Among the new claims: a woman who said she was raped by a WHO worker, and another woman who was allegedly lured into a sex-for-work scheme and died after a botched abortion.

Madagascar drought drives severe hunger

Southern Madagascar is facing its worst drought in 40 years, threatening more than a million people with severe hunger. The region received half of its usual rains during the October planting season and up to 60 percent of the coming harvest is expected to be lost. This is the third consecutive year of drought, and two in every five people are now “severely food insecure”, with nearly 14,000 people facing “catastrophic” levels of starvation – the first time such a degree of hunger has been recorded in the country. In the worst-affected district of Amboasary Atsimo, global acute malnutrition is an alarming 27 percent, a rate at which irreversible damage is caused to children. “The children are starving, some are dying,” said Amer Daoudi, a senior World Food Programme official. “We are already witnessing the abandonment of entire villages.” COVID-19 lockdowns have limited the ability of rural people to find work, and – with transport routes and delivery chains interrupted – food prices have risen. Needs are expected to deepen, with a prolonged and severe lean season forecast, starting in October.

No end to deadly demonstrations in Colombia

More than three weeks after nationwide protests began in Colombia, the political unrest shows little sign of abating. In Cali, the epicentre of the demonstrations, a power void as the strife took hold of the city has led to armed civilians fighting each other amid gasoline and food shortages. In recent days, “humanitarian corridors” have been set up to allow in some food supplies and medicine. On 10 May, President Iván Duque travelled to Cali to meet demonstration leaders upset with rising poverty, inequality, and state neglect – worsened by the pandemic. But talks ended without any agreement on how to end the deadlock. Marchers have expanded their demands to include healthcare reforms and an end to police brutality. Human rights groups say the police are responsible for most of the 42 protest-related deaths so far. Accusations of excessive force by the Colombian police, more used to fighting armed groups , further undermine its ability to take on the gangs and guerrillas that have expanded their control in much of the countryside five years after a widely praised peace deal.

Afghanistan’s school killings and a legacy of impunity

In a country tangled in decades of war, the 8 May bomb blasts outside a Kabul school were particularly shocking for who they appeared to target: children. It came a year after an attack on a maternity ward in the same community – where gunmen killed at least 24 people, including women in labour – provoked similar revulsion and pushed Médecins Sans Frontières to end its work at the hospital. An interview published by MSF this week underscores how little accountability there is for such atrocities. The Afghan government promised to investigate the May 2020 attack, but even a year later there are no answers. The ”most likely hypothesis” from MSF’s own inquiry landed on members of a group affiliated with so-called Islamic State, said Dr Isabelle Defourny, MSF’s operations director. Many Afghans see impunity as the barrier to peace and justice. It’s why groups like the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission called for “reparations and documentation”, along with a UN-backed inquiry, following this month’s violence. The MSF interview also shows the dilemmas aid groups confront, with civilian casualties rising and international forces set to withdraw by September. A year after the hospital massacre, MSF hasn’t resumed its operations there. “We can’t work in an environment where patients and medical staff are targeted, and where we can’t prevent such a massacre from happening again,” Defourny said.

Weekend read

The UK government’s plan to overhaul the country’s asylum system has drawn the ire of UNHCR. The UN’s refugee agency and other migration experts say it goes against the 1951 Refugee Convention and global protection ethics. UK Interior Minister Priti Patel says the plan will prioritise asylum seekers who arrive through legal channels while creating barriers for those who arrive irregularly. Rights groups and asylum advocates disagree. To them, the approach cashes in on public fears of a migration crisis to build a restrictive asylum system that would exclude many who need help. A review was needed, given the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, but the new rules could make migration even riskier than it already is, especially for women and children who don’t qualify for support. With EU governments refusing to sign bilateral return agreements, migrants who arrive in the UK and don’t qualify for asylum are in danger of being “warehoused in deeply inappropriate, inhumane facilities”, one civil society actor told The New Humanitarian. This comes amid rising numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach the UK as EU policies grow more hostile; nearly 8,500 crossed by boat from France in 2020, more than four times the number in 2019.

And finally…

Decolonising research

Foreign researchers in humanitarian settings have too often swooped in and conducted extractive studies without meaningful local involvement, according to a new briefing paper and related webinar. The paper says the academic world should properly regulate so-called “Parasitic Swallows'', as such temporary visitors can “do harm, retraumatising participants, and preventing them from evolving their identity”. Research “co-production” – involving the community as well as academics and NGOs in the entire process – offers a healthier model, according to a paper published by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.","Fri, 14 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/sites/all/themes/thenewhumanitarian/favicon.ico,"['cheat', 'severe', 'asylum', 'food', 'sheet', 'groups', 'sex', 'end', 'strikes', 'hunger', 'humanitarian', 'coverup', 'madagascar', 'rising', 'claims', 'israel', 'uk', 'gaza']",none
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Dossier: the return of hunger - Geographical,https://geographical.co.uk/people/item/4051-dossier-the-return-of-hunger,"The decades-long decline in hunger has now ended, despite the fact that we produce enough food to feed the global population. What can be done?

A hungry man, goes the adage, is an angry man. Perhaps it was with this in mind that the Norwegian Nobel Committee handed its 2020 Peace Prize not to a person but to the world’s largest humanitarian organisation, the World Food Programme (WFP). The gesture was in recognition of the WFP’s efforts and of the knotty relationship between famine, food and conflict, but it also acknowledged the daunting to-do list faced by the UN’s most overworked logistics arm. There is, David Beasley, the head of the WFP, recently warned, ‘a lot of bad coming our way’.

A decades-long decline in hunger in the world has unfortunately ended and the WFP openly speaks of an unfolding ‘hunger pandemic’, exacerbated by climate change, Covid-19 and, above all, political unrest. ‘It’s good to be recognised, but we know the prize is a call to arms,’ says Arif Husain, chief economist at the WFP. ‘The job is far from done. It’s a shame in the 21st century in a globalised world with such wealth that we are still talking about trying to give people a decent meal once a day. We’re not asking for the moon.’

According to the WFP, in 2017, 80 million people faced imminent starvation; by 2020, this had risen to 135 million; in 2021, it already stands at 270 million. These aren’t people just going to bed hungry (that number, this year, is 690 million, or one in nine people on the planet, 414 million of them women and girls, according to Action Against Hunger [AAH]). Every 13 seconds, according to AAH, somewhere on the planet a child dies from hunger or a hunger-related disease. In 2019, that added up to a total of 2.3 million children.

‘Famine has continued into the 21st century, long after it should have been eradicated,’ says Stephen Devereux, a fellow at the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex and a director of the Centre for Social Protection. The fear of the 1970s, that we genuinely might not have enough food to feed a growing global population, has long gone, he says. ‘The Green Revolution saw to that. We have capacity to move food from surplus to those areas with a deficit. We have early warning systems of drought and other extreme weather.’

Four famines have been declared by the UN in the 21st century, the most recent of which, in Somalia in 2011, left 260,000 dead – an estimated 4.6 per cent of the total population and up to 18 per cent of children under five in some regions. Earlier this year, the UN warned that Yemen (see box on page 22) faced the prospect of the worst famine the world had seen in decades, with distressing reports that 400,000 children there were severely malnourished, ‘and as a result are in their last weeks and months’.

Long-term conflicts are now really biting, says Husain. ‘The world has been in turmoil for some time – Syria for ten years, Yemen for five years, South Sudan for ten years and northeast Nigeria for seven years.’ Conflict continues to apply pressure in many corners of the world. In northern Mozambique in the past year alone, 565,000 people have been displaced and pushed into food insecurity by attacks by non-state armed groups.

And, like a Russian matryoshka doll, hunger is merely the outer shell around deeper problems. According to the WFP, about one in three people in 55 of the world’s poorest countries suffer from some form of malnutrition, caused by lack of access to healthy food, poor healthcare systems and unhealthy environments. Five years after the world committed to the concept of zero hunger by 2030 (enshrined as Goal 2 of the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development), we’re way off track. The same goes for the ambition of ensuring good health and nutrition for the first 1,000 days of a child’s life (from conception, nine months gestation and the first two years or so after birth), which would prevent stunting and promote healthy development. Two billion people, or 26 per cent of the global population, lacked regular access to nutritious and sufficient food in 2019. According to AAH, a child with severe acute malnutrition is nine times more likely to die than a healthy child. In 2019, 21.3 per cent (144 million) of children under five were estimated to be stunted (low height-for-age), 6.9 per cent (47 million) wasted (low weight-for-height). Meanwhile, 5.6 per cent (38.3 million) were overweight.

The price of food



The WFP’s 2020 Cost of a Plate of Food report highlights the countries in which a simple meal such as rice and beans costs the most when compared with people’s incomes. South Sudan came top of the list, with basic ingredients costing an eye-watering 186 per cent of a person’s daily income. If a resident in New York State had to pay the same proportion of their salary for a basic meal, the food would cost US$393. In New York State, ingredients for a simple meal – perhaps a soup or a simple stew – costs just 0.6 per cent of someone’s income.



Seventeen of the top 20 countries featured in the index are in sub-Saharan Africa, including Burundi (US$91); Malawi (US$74); Sudan (US$61); and Mali (US$49). Other countries with high food costs include Pakistan (US$16) and Haiti, where people spend more than a third of their daily income on a single plate of food.



Development agencies use a metric known as the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) to quantify whether people are eating enough. The PoU in Africa was 19.1 per cent of the population in 2019, more than 250 million undernourished people, up from 17.6 per cent in 2014, double the world average. Even for the many who do get enough food to keep them alive there is the question of monotony – the same meal of rice and beans for 30 days straight, or longer. The situation is sufficiently dire that, incredibly, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) felt it necessary to declare – without irony – 2021 to be the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables. All this in a world where one third of the food we produce is wasted.

Antidote democracy

So why, given international awareness, food networks and early warning systems, do famines still occur? Simon Levine, senior research fellow in the Humanitarian Policy Group at the Overseas Development Institute, puts it bluntly: ‘Famine is about war, politics and denying people food.’ Shocking as this sounds, just about everyone in development and humanitarian circles agrees and sees this observation as uncontroversial. ‘Famine is anything but pre-ordained. You can sum it up in one word: politics,’ says Devereux.

There is, he adds, no longer such a thing as a ‘Biblical famine’. ‘You can get drought, crops fail and it’s all a catastrophic failure,’ he says. ‘But to say drought causes famines nowadays isn’t a good enough explanation. That doesn’t apply in the modern world. We have crises where people can’t grow their own food or rear livestock and don’t have enough money to buy food in markets when prices spike, but usually, in most cases, the WFP or the government can deliver food. The critical question isn’t why famines happen, but why they aren’t prevented.’

True famine occurs when this system of intervention breaks down. ‘Either the government doesn’t have the capacity or the political will, or the international community has a problem with the government of the country,’ says Devereux, who points to the mid-1980s famine in Ethiopia that killed one million people, affected eight million others and prompted the Live Aid concerts. ‘The Marxist government [in Ethiopia] actually bombed the food markets; drought was used as a weapon.’ Devereux endorses international pressure that ratchets up accountability for famine prevention. ‘If famine happens, someone has allowed it to happen. We saw that with Al-Shabab [an Islamist militant group in Somalia], which prevented aid getting to areas in which it was needed in Somalia in 2011. That cost 250,000 lives. The capacity to prevent famine is there, the problem is faulty security and conflict.’

Levine looks back to Ethiopia in the 1980s and notes that ‘there was a drought, but its effects were intensified by a civil war. It wasn’t random who died – those at the bottom of society died.’ He points out that there was a 30 per cent drop in food production not only in Ethiopia but also in Uganda at the same time. ‘But you don’t hear about the Great Uganda Famine, because there wasn’t one. If the UK ever faced the same problem, the government of the day would import more food and stick a couple of pence on income tax to pay for it later.’

The issue, Levine suggests, is more about wider political accountability. ‘There has never been a famine in a country with a free press.’ Devereux agrees, drily noting that ‘democracy is a good antidote to famine.’

Long-term strategies needed

While politics is generally the catalyst that can tip a region or country into famine, Jon Cunliffe, Middle East regional director for Action Against Hunger, believes that the underlying rhythms of subsistence farming provide the opportunity for vulnerable people to be exploited. Cunliffe refers to ‘the hunger gap’ – the period of time between a crop being planted and it being harvested. ‘For a subsistence farmer, any change during this period puts them at risk,’ he says. ‘They don’t have assets to draw on – if they have nothing to sell, they become at risk of famine.’ Often, erratic weather is the final straw that tips livelihoods that were already acutely vulnerable over the edge. ‘Politics can make that vulnerability much more exaggerated. If a country has functioning governance, then climate change can be mitigated more effectively.’

Yet there remain unrelenting pressures on food security that leave communities vulnerable to the politics of the day. As Husain puts it, ‘In any given place, it’s never a single thing – conflict and climate come together.’ According to AAH, severe drought is a leading cause of undernutrition in more than a third of countries that have seen a rise in hunger levels in the past 15 years. Droughts lead to steep falls in food production, which means less income for small producers and higher food prices – putting a healthy diet beyond reach for the poorest people. ‘The days of saying climate change is a hoax are over. It’s here and it’s real,’ says Husain. ‘We see shrinking growing seasons, with real consequences for subsistence farmers and those in the rural economy.’

Levine argues that what’s really being talked about – and needs to be addressed – is food insecurity. ‘Hundreds of millions of people face food insecurity all the time,’ he says. ‘It means a daily struggle, not quite enough food, very unpleasant trade-offs, such as kids not going to school because what little money a family has must go on food. But that’s not starvation and it’s not famine – it’s desperate poverty. The reality is that millions have always gone to bed hungry. We’re simply getting a new appreciation of the way people have been living for ages.’

While conflict and climate change have long affected people’s ability to produce or afford food to feed their families, Covid-19 has now added another layer to the challenges faced by most vulnerable groups, through increased unemployment, loss of remittances and weak economies. ‘The problem is that you can’t lay famine at the doorstep of Covid – things have been unravelling for a few years,’ says Husain. ‘What Covid did was to double the numbers of people facing famine.’

Longer-term solutions include development of sustainable domestic food markets, social protection schemes and, simply put, more employment. In 2005, India passed the Mahatma Gandhi Employment Guarantee Act that ensured people in rural areas 100 days work at a minimum wage every year. Policies like these ‘helped ensure that countries such as Bangladesh, Russia, China and India have left behind the horrific famines that they endured during the 20th century,’ says Levine. Grass roots social-protection schemes create a snowball effect, adds Husain. ‘If you give money to people who need things, they will spend that money, not save it. That creates jobs and incentives to produce food to sell.’

Measures such as cash payments and early warning systems, innovative when they first emerged, are now established as mitigation techniques. Artificial intelligence and satellite mapping are also making a huge difference. In Bangladesh, hit this year by floods that covered a quarter of the country, early-warning systems provided four days’ notice of the coming deluge. This triggered anticipatory payouts – cash delivered via mobile phones through a social-safety-net programme – that gave 20,000 families the resources to move their valuables out of harm’s way. ‘The aid community has got a lot better,’ says Levine. ‘It’s not just about throwing sacks of maize out of the back of a plane. We’re pretty good at stopping people dying in large numbers.’

As with many public health measures, the world doesn’t tend to notice when something terrible is averted ahead of time. In 2019–20, there were apocalyptic warnings of desert locusts that were destroying crops in East Africa, putting five million people at risk of famine in the worst infestation for 70 years. ‘But the desert locust famine never happened – the international community responded,’ says Devereux. Interventions included manual and aerial spraying of pesticides. Grants, including US$500 million from the World Bank, enabled countries to provide immediate support to affected households through social safety nets such as cash transfers, while investing in the medium-term recovery of agriculture and livestock production systems and rural livelihoods.

Longer-term strategies, as well as short-term pre-emptive measures, are required but will necessitate a change in mentality from the international community, suggests Cunliffe. ‘It’s not just governments that work on short-term election cycles – most development projects only last one or two years,’ he says. ‘This can’t be about the white aid worker flying in to save a country – it’s about building up partnerships and the long-term capacity within a country. You need to build skills and governance. Education is fundamental, that is what pulls a country out of a dire situation.’

Education is one of several major components that, if put in place, make the prospect of famine recede, says Husain. In addition, he highlights the empowerment of women, social protection schemes and investment in rural infrastructure, such as feeder roads, internet access and electricity. ‘If you don’t put the access in place, why would a food producer do anything more than produce at subsistence level?’ he asks. ‘People talk about equality of income, but it’s more about equality of opportunity. If you build a road, you give someone the means to take their food to market.

‘It’s a long piece of work, the results won’t be seen by the politicians who begin the process, so it’s a question of political will. But we know it works – we saw this after the Second World War, when the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Japan were on their knees.’

Yemen



By any measure, Yemen is the world’s worst on-going humanitarian crisis. At the time of writing, 13 million people out of a population of 29 million are being helped by the WFP. By June 2021, this figure, AAH projects, will rise to 15.5 million. Across Yemen, five million people are ‘just one step away from famine,’ according to the UN.



‘What we’re looking at with Yemen is a famine that could unfold on the scale of nothing we’ve seen since the 1970s and Biafra,’ says Cunliffe. An embargo by Saudi Arabia and the UAE means that it has become all but impossible to deliver food aid to a country that, even before the latest crisis, relied on imports for 80 per cent of its food.



‘Yemenis are either selling assets to buy food or have sold all their assets and have no money to buy food, or there is no food to buy,’ says Cunliffe. ‘The government has collapsed, the health system has collapsed, there’s no social protection, there’s no access to potable water. We’re seeing the return of diseases that had been eradicated, such as dengue, malaria and leishmaniasis. There are hundreds of thousands of cases of cholera.’



UN agencies and NGOs such as AAH are simply unable to deal with 15 million people in such extreme need of help, warns Cunliffe. He points to the root causes: conflict and key actors refusing to allow aid to enter the country. ‘The only thing you can push for is some sort of peace agreement and then allow aid relief and trade to resume. It’s very frustrating – this was not pre-ordained.’



In March, the UN hoped to raise US$3.85 billion from more than 100 governments and donors at a virtual pledging conference to avert widespread famine in Yemen but received only US$1.7 billion – less than half of what was needed. ‘Millions of Yemeni children, women and men desperately need aid to live. Cutting aid is a death sentence,’ António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said.



The benefits of peace

The WFP says that each dollar of spending on long-term initiatives can save three dollars in humanitarian aid, as well as avoiding disruption and losses for families. ‘We always talk about the cost of doing something – we should be talking about the costs if we don’t do it,’ says Husain. ‘It’s to our collective benefit that we sort these things out. If we don’t address these issues, you see famine and migration. If people stay in their own country, you pay US$90 per capita [to improve things]; if they migrate to, say, Europe, it costs US$4,500 per capita.’

Husain’s concern is that Covid-19-era financial belttightening will make problems even worse. ‘In the past 12 months, governments have spent US$20 trillion on Covid – that’s 20 per cent of global GDP,’ he says. ‘The problem is not going away, but from now on, we have less capacity, less money to deal with it. Just when needs are increasing, we’re getting a financial crunch – that’s where the “bad” comes in. There’s not much leverage left.’

Leverage of one means or another is going to be needed, with the WFP forecasting that if nothing changes, the number of undernourished people will exceed 840 million by 2030. Right now, we live in a world that produces enough food to feed its entire population but where more than 1.5 billion people can’t afford a diet that meets the required levels of essential nutrients; and more than three billion people can’t even afford the cheapest healthy diet.

While Covid has set back progress, Cunliffe believes that forward momentum is irreversible. ‘I have to be optimistic,’ he says. ‘Great progress had been made pre-Covid, but Covid is a significant hole in the road and it may take more than ten years to get back on track.’

There is room for optimism, Devereux points out. ‘The Horn of Africa and Yemen are probably the last famine-prone regions in the world,’ he says. ‘That is a good advance on 100 years ago.’ Nor, he emphasises, are the solutions particularly complex: ‘Healthy diets, nutrition, employment schemes… we know what works.’ Yet he tempers his optimism when he turns to the question of whether famine will ever cease to be a political tool. ‘As long as there are conflicts, people will lose access to food and there is a choice those in power make as to what happens next.’

It would be naïve, suggests Levine, to assume that enlightened governments will always prevail. ‘You can argue about what is really needed to address food insecurity: whether it’s more deregulation to create jobs, more tax to provide support. Those are routine debates,’ he says. ‘But we need to think more about poverty and inequality in the long term and that’s where political will comes in. Allowing a famine to happen – that is a direct choice that governments make.

‘I would love there to be a silver bullet, a miracle crop that will get rid of hunger, but those wouldn’t get us off the hook,’ he continues. ‘There has to be a mood for change. You have to fight hard just to stand still – there will always be new wars, new warlords.’

However, claiming ignorance, or just standing by, is no longer an excuse, suggests Husain. ‘In previous centuries, when these things were isolated, we didn’t know until after the event that famine happened, but we can’t say that any more. The tangible benefits of peace are bigger to a larger group of people than the benefits of war to a smaller group of people. We can change the world for the better; we need to get the “wrong” right.’

Women and hunger



Inequalities that exist within families or communities, for example because of age or gender, have a huge impact on malnutrition levels. Women and girls often eat last and least. Girls might be attracted to, or pushed into, early marriage, while boys separated from their families during an economic migration might slide into malnutrition if they can’t care for themselves, warns Action Against Hunger. In the south of Madagascar, for example, girls and women lose most of their decision-making powers upon the payment of dowry.



Women generally have smaller and less muscular bodies than men and need about 25 per cent less energy per day. However, they require the same amount of nutrients, which means they need to eat more nutrient- rich foods than men. But this is often unaff ordable as foods rich in nutrients – such as fruit, vegetables and meat – tend to be the most expensive foods.



Pregnant and breastfeeding women need to consume foods even richer in nutrients to maintain their energy and nutrition levels. Lack of access to a healthy diet puts pregnant women at greater risk of complications during pregnancy and birth. Many infant and young child deaths in developing countries are the result of the poor nutritional health of their mothers. Teenage mothers and their babies are particularly vulnerable to malnutrition. In Bangladesh, stunted growth has been linked to the heavy workload of women living in Rohingya refugee settlements, while women’s low levels of decision making is a major factor in undernutrition among children in Uganda.



In one project, which aims to empower women to become community health workers, Action Against Hunger seeks to bridge the gap between communities and the health system, trying to ensure that community health workers have the skills to both diagnose and treat malnutrition cases in the villages where they live and work. By going from mother to mother, home to home, they can reach more children and provide them with care and treatment and, ultimately, save lives.

Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said more than 1 million people were displaced by floods, conflict and drought in Somalia last year, the highest figures since 2016, citing data from the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN).





""Once again Somalia is facing the prospect of serious drought. Water and pasture resources are depleting every day and resulting in people abandoning their homes with their livestock to search for better conditions,” said Mohamed Abdi, Country Director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Somalia.







The agency estimated that the last time more than a million people were displaced in Somalia was in 2017, when drought ravaged the country and caused widespread suffering and uncertainty.





""Drought will most likely be the driving factor displacing a large number of Somalis this year due to the poor performance of seasonal rains. Our staff on the ground are reporting that more than 50 districts are currently experiencing moderate to severe drought levels and it is expected to get worse,” the official said.





Abdi said water and pasture resources are depleting every day and resulting in people abandoning their homes with their livestock to search for better conditions.





""We are worried that drought coupled with conflict could see record levels of displacement this year,"" he said. ""So far, 112,000 have been displaced in the first three months of 2021, of whom 34 percent were uprooted because of drought.""







NRC said the impact of drought in Somalia runs parallel with the impact of flooding in other parts of the country.

According to the FAO latest drought update, the worst affected regions include Lower Juba, Middle Juba, Gedo, Mudug, Nuugal, Bari, Toghdheer and Sool which are currently experiencing severe water shortages for domestic, livestock and agricultural production purposes.





Availability of water and pasture conditions have significantly deteriorated, leading to increased livestock migration and rapid rise of water prices. In Puntland, the price of water in most rural villages has doubled since the beginning of March as the dry conditions persist in most rural villages and settlements across the state. By the end of March, a 200-litre barrel of water sold between USD$7 to $9, up from an average of $3 in February 2021.





In a Drought Need Assessment conducted in February by an NGO in Sool, Sanaag and Togdheer regions, about one-third of communities do not have access to sufficient water, with 88 per cent of water points unable to produce sufficient water for drinking. In Jubaland, 200-liter barrel cost about USD $14 as water pans which were the main source of water in the area dried up. As a result of the ongoing situation, water is trucked from locations 60 kilometers away for communities in Burgabo village in Jubaland.

According to the latest UNICEF humanitarian situation report the water shortages and challenges of getting safe drinking water has contributed to cases of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) /cholera cases in some areas across the country.







According to Federal Ministry of Health and Human Services, a total of 88 suspected cases of cholera were reported in the last week of February from Bay, Afgoye, Merka and Banadir regions, with no reported deaths. As of 23 March, the cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases in 2021 was 780, including 2 associated deaths with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 0.3%.

In response to the water crises, both federal and local authorities, and humanitarian partners are providing support in various areas. The humanitarian leadership mobilized $13.3 million from the Somalia Humanitarian Fund and $7 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to facilitate rapid response efforts for populations hardest hit by the water-shortage crisis as well as up to $20 million to activate the Anticipatory Action Framework. Puntland authorities have secured funding to rehabilitate five strategic boreholes with replacement of submersible pump, control panel, pipes, motors and storage tanks.







Once repaired, all five boreholes will serve up to 15,000 people cumulatively thus reducing the pressure on available water access points. In Hiraan region, UNICEF has responded to areas affected by water shortages with water trucking in Belet Weyne, reaching about 18,000 people.







Disease surveillance is being managed with the support from WHO through the the Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) and is currently being expanded to all health facilities across the country.

MOGADISHU (SOMALIA) - In March, large parts of the country faced severe drought conditions, triggered by below average 2020 Deyr rains and above average temperatures during the Jilal season. Over 116,000 Somalis were displaced by water shortages between October 2020 and March 2021.In Lower Shabelle region of South West State, authorities and partners have reported that a 200-litre barrel of water currently costs around $4.5, a 20% increase compared to prices in December 2020.In Middle Shabelle, consequences of water shortages forced about 5,000 farmers among riverine communities in Jowhar and Mahadaay to flee to Mogadishu in search of casual labour to support their families.","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://hornobserver.com/uploads/article/photo/thumbs/IMG_EA5076-317DDD-8100DF-4DC56A-2D9F9F-181A85.png,"['worsen', 'water', 'reported', 'million', 'support', 'regions', 'response', 'conditions', 'parts', 'predrought', 'drought', 'shortages', 'cases', 'humanitarian', 'somalia']",drought

Situated in a complex region of the world, Puntland State in Somalia is coping with existing threats and instabilities, such as droughts, floods, locusts, the movement of internally displaced people (IDPs), and armed actors. The COVID-19 pandemic has added yet another strain on its tremendously fragile infrastructure. The impact of the coronavirus has been far reaching, affecting livelihoods, with employment such as construction halted due to pandemic restrictions, fostering fluctuations around household assets, and hampering unpaid and underpaid care work and responsibilities. With climatic shocks and infestations, Puntland State in Somalia residents are experiencing decimated livelihoods, livestock and land, limited movement, increased violence and limited access to opportunities and support services. The multitude of crises and rates of inflation have left the majority of families food insecure and without income, halted education and health services, and exacerbated existing vulnerabilities and the incidence of violence. Needs far exceed the current available resources and capacity.

However, response efforts are under way, with many organizations and institutions adding to existing programming. Organizations such as the International Rescue Committee (IRC) have established mechanisms such as village savings and loans associations and unconditional cash transfers to help prepare for and alleviate financial shocks, while the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) provides vocational training and training for women’s empowerment, gender-based violence (GBV) services, and women and girls’ safe spaces. The ASAL1 organization works on advocacy and lobbying efforts, socioeconomic support and building awareness campaigns. KAALO Aid and Development, a local organization involved in humanitarian and development action in the area, has been working with female-headed households, through cash and in-kind support, on continued awareness of GBV prevention and response and recognizing the importance of engaging boys and men, and religious and cultural leaders as a transformative approach in reaching inclusive and gender-sensitive humanitarian programming. From the government side, the Puntland State in Somalia Humanitarian and Disaster Management Agency (HADMA) provides support to the disaster and crisis humanitarian response.

To better help local government bodies, agencies, NGOs and INGOs grasp the differentiated impact on women, men, boys and girls, and host and IDP communities during this time of intense loss and instability, this gender analysis was conducted and funded by the German Federal Foreign Office (GFFO) in partnership with Oxfam in Somalia and KAALO. The analysis provides an overview of the intricacies of the communities, with recommendations for addressing immediate concerns and future programming. It was conducted across 11 villages (in three districts – Bosaaso, Gardo and Garowe), through 34 focus group discussions (FGDs) with women, men, boys, and girls; 18 key informant interviews (KIIs) from the community (of which seven were with women); and nine KIIs with organizations and municipal government officials (of which two were with women).","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564924-rr-puntland-state-somalia-gender-analysis-290421-en.png?itok=VO8JC0Js,"['girls', 'puntland', 'support', 'programming', 'state', 'services', 'women', 'recent', 'men', 'gender', 'violence', 'impact', 'humanitarian', 'provides', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought

It is a very concerning situation that over 100 million people in Africa are facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification-3 and above) and the situation may worsen in the coming months especially between June and August 2021. The socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 have become wider and deeper especially in developing countries.

The secondary impacts of COVID-19 could have long-lasting affects across the continent, particularly for those living in poverty.

In Africa, a continent with a high proportion of workers in the informal economy, the most vulnerable have been hit hard. In Africa, people face the challenges of either too little water or too much water – cyclic patterns of drought to floods to droughts – impacting vulnerable groups either by floods or by famine silently due to profound impacts of climate change.

People are becoming more vulnerable due to civil unrest, displacements, population movement and other complex socio-political and economic factors.

The International Crisis Group is an independent organisation working to prevent wars and shape policies that will build a more peaceful world. Crisis Group aspires to be the pre-eminent organisation providing independent analysis and advice on how to prevent, resolve or better manage deadly conflict.

Over a year after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, the dramatic numbers of infections and deaths that some observers predicted for the African continent have yet to emerge. As of 4 May, the global COVID-19 death toll stands at an estimated 3,217.281, among which -- accurate reporting remains a challenge -- Africa has recorded 82,259. The relatively low number of virus-related deaths on the continent, whichever of many possible factors are driving it, provides a sense that Africa is resilient. Polishing this positive image is the fact that almost all countries, except Benin, Burundi and Tanzania, took vigorous isolation measures when the outbreak started, responding much quicker than Europe and the United States, and consequently averting much of the devastation the disease has wrought there.

All this good news could turn bad, however. Caseloads are on the rise and have been since January 2021. The spread of a new variant in South Africa is raising alarm -- it is the worst-affected country with the highest death rate (54,511), but it has a better testing regime and public health strategy than most African states. Meanwhile, an economic storm is gathering due to virus-related restrictions on movement of people and goods. What the pandemic means for a continent whose population is growing at 2.7 per cent a year -- if national GDPs cannot match that fast growth -- is unclear. More concerning is what it means for Africa's fragile or conflict-affected societies.

In March 2020, Crisis Group began examining the pandemic's long- and short-term consequences for deadly conflict. We assessed the potential for COVID-19 to cause enormous damage to fragile states and trigger unrest. We judged that COVID-19's reach, its impact on public health, the economic downturn it would precipitate and the social disruptions it would leave in its wake would shape conflicts and crises around the world. We argued that women, children, refugees, the internally displaced and citizens of countries suffering from crisis mismanagement would bear the brunt of the pandemic's knock-on effects.

A year on, the jury is still out on the pandemic's impact on international peace and security.

A year on, the jury is still out on the pandemic's impact on international peace and security. COVID-19 has been a complicating factor in various war zones, but conflict resolution has fared no worse than before; indeed, conflict prevention and resolution were struggling before the pandemic. Globally, the pandemic worsened relations between the U.S. and China and dented multilateralism, but those trends were already notable before the virus spread. Whether things will improve with a new U.S. president is unclear, but thankfully Joe Biden has signalled a return to a broad approach to international cooperation.

In Africa, the pandemic has neither altered nor worsened the conflict landscape, but it has often proven distracting. The need to contain the pandemic threw off course the African Union's (AU) work on ""Silencing the Guns"" -- an ambitious goal to end conflicts on the continent by 2020. The organisation has extended this project's deadline by ten years. The AU was right, of course, to pivot to address the pandemic and it responded effectively. Led initially by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- an institution created in 2017 as a result of lessons learnt from West Africa's Ebola crisis in 2014-2015 -- the AU reacted swiftly, establishing the Africa Task Force for Novel Coronavirus with its CDC and the WHO, guidelines and standards for government responses and helping distribute test kits and protective equipment. The AU and CDC are now playing a major role in rolling out vaccines to the AU's 55 member states.

In Africa -- like elsewhere -- the pandemic gave great advantage to strongmen who sought to further tighten their grip.

A year ago, we wondered whether various national leaders would exploit COVID-19 for political purposes. In Africa -- like elsewhere -- the pandemic gave great advantage to strongmen who sought to further tighten their grip. Leaders in Angola, Burundi -- Pierre Nkurunziza, who led the country for fifteen years and died a month after stepping down from office, from what many speculate was COVID-19 -- Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe used pandemic regulations as an excuse to further close the political space and enforce social distancing rules through heavy-handed security forces. In the lead-up to Uganda's presidential election in January 2021, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights accused authorities of enforcing COVID-19 restrictions ""more strictly to curtail opposition electoral campaign activities in a discriminatory fashion"". Diplomats from seven Western countries warned Zimbabwe in late August not to use COVID-19 as an excuse to restrict citizens' fundamental rights.

Nor can one ignore the situation in Tanzania, which was led by a president who denied the pandemic's very presence. He, too, died recently in murky circumstances. Assuming the cause of death was COVID-19, the virus has completely altered Tanzania's political landscape by ushering the country's first female president into office who also appears more willing to contain the pandemic.

But even Africa's more democratic-leaning governments (eg, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa) have seen instances of police using unnecessary force to enforce lockdown rules, though a recently released survey showed South Africans were prepared to sacrifice certain rights to stop the spread of COVID-19, and that black South Africans seemed the most willing in that regard among the country's different population groups.

At its start, the pandemic looked like it would prove to be a particular threat to countries facing political turbulence or delicate transitions. It additionally looked like it would worsen major crises on the continent. Indeed, COVID-19's arrival may have been a complicating factor in some instances, though things were hardly great before it arrived.

Take Ethiopia, for example, one of the continent's major powers. The country is at war in its Tigray region in a contest between Nobel Laureate Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the former ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) party. Prime Minister Abiy's decision to delay elections slated for August 2020 and focus on the pandemic was the right move. Yet he made it with insufficient sensitivity to opposition concerns.He instituted a state of emergency, but then delayed the polls indefinitely amid the opposition's complaints that the government was using the pandemic to cling to power. The TPLF organised regional elections, despite the federal decision to postpone polls due to COVID-19, arguing that the constitution did not permit such delays. This decision in turn led to confrontation with the federal authorities.

The pandemic likely exacerbated tensions and may have accelerated confrontation between Tigray and the federal government, but both were already beating the war drums. Since 4 November, fighting between federal and allied forces (neighbouring Eritrea's troops and Ethiopian Amhara militias), on one side, and Tigray forces, on the other, has resulted in thousands of deaths. It has also displaced up to a million people internally, according to Ethiopian authorities, and sent more than 60,000 others fleeing as refugees into neighbouring Sudan, which is facing its own delicate transition following the April 2019 ouster of President Omar al-Bashir. There are increasing reports of ethnic cleansing, rape and potential crimes against humanity, as well as numerous other human rights violations. Up to 4.5 million people in Tigray, a region of only 6 million, are in acute need of emergency food supplies. Outside pressure prompted the federal government to promise humanitarian agencies access to Tigray, which may lead to more relief into areas under its control.

The pressure the pandemic might have imposed on Africa's warring parties to stop fighting turned out to be strikingly low.

Meanwhile, the pressure the pandemic might have imposed on Africa's warring parties to stop fighting turned out to be strikingly low. Initially, some armed groups heeded UN Secretary-General António Guterres's 23 March 2020 call for a global ceasefire. In Africa, there were offers of cooperation and endorsements by some groups in the Central African Republic and Cameroon, as well as announcements of unilateral ceasefires by the government and most armed groups in Sudan. But globally, the ceasefire call lost momentum. The more potent jihadist fighters in Nigeria's north east and the Lake Chad basin, as well as the Sahel, never embraced the call and continued to fight.

The same is true of Somalia's Islamist Al-Shabaab insurgency. It has oscillated in its COVID-19 response, sometimes displaying pragmatism while blaming outsiders for the pandemic. It labelled COVID-19 as a problem exported to Somalia by ""crusader forces who have invaded the country"", referring to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) troops in the country. But the group has undertaken local measures to prevent the pandemic's spread, probably to avoid the disastrous repercussions it suffered when it refused outside humanitarian assistance during the 2011 famine, which contributed to the loss of 260,000 lives. Al-Shabaab has also rejected the AstraZeneca vaccine. It may fear that the government would capitalise on the vaccination campaign by providing a service that the insurgents could not match. It may also have been loath to allow populations to travel to government-controlled areas, or government actors to enter its areas, which would have posed a security risk from the group's perspective. Curiously, however, Al-Shabaab has left the door open for other ""safe and effective"" vaccines.

COVID-19 also did not deter insurgents from escalating their fight with government forces in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province. The region has been restive since 2017, and the U.S. recently sanctioned the insurgency, designating it an Islamic State (ISIS) affiliate. Before the arrival of COVID-19, the country was already grappling with multiple health crises, including outbreaks of cholera and malaria, and was in need of humanitarian assistance due to climatic shocks linked to several years of drought, cyclones and floods.

As for peace processes, the pandemic neither enabled nor blocked them, though it did slow down mediation efforts and fulfilment of peace deals in some countries.

As for peace processes, the pandemic neither enabled nor blocked them, though it did slow down mediation efforts and fulfilment of peace deals in some countries. Take South Sudan, for example, a country celebrating its tenth anniversary of independence from Sudan, eight years of which have seen it fighting a civil war. The pandemic may have slowed down, for several months, implementation of the 2018 peace deal that brings the country's main warring parties into a ceasefire and unity government. Several of the country's five vice presidents contracted the virus and government was focused on responding to the health crisis. But the peace process was not moving that fast to begin with.

The pandemic appeared to hinder efforts to resume peace talks between the government and Thomas Cirillo's holdout rebellion in Equatoria after both sides agreed to a cessation of hostilities in Rome in January 2020. Coronavirus travel restrictions and the limits of virtual diplomacy undercut mediation. But other salient factors undermined the talks, which only resumed in October. The Rome ceasefire was breached in April. It is not clear who broke it, but President Salva Kiir used it to launch major offensives in Central and Western Equatoria, further undermining Cirillo's trust in the process. He already rejects the main 2018 peace deal on the grounds that it does not address his people's grievances, including the push for greater decentralisation. The project of ending rebellion in Equatoria requires both sides to abide by commitments they made to respect a ceasefire.

COVID did aggravate peace operations in some of Africa's conflicts. Troop rotation was initially halted for AMISOM in 2020 but has since resumed. The UN mission to South Sudan (UNMISS) restricted its troop rotations and undertook patrolling and other peacekeeping activities only cautiously. The pandemic complicated external interventions in the Sahel, which were forced to adapt, hibernate or freeze activities. It disrupted the UN mission in Mali (MINUSMA), the EU missions and the deployment of Operation Takuba, established by European states to reinforce French efforts and support the Malian army in its fight with jihadists. It also slowed development initiatives by introducing new restrictions on meetings and travel; staff had to work remotely. Meanwhile, development projects faced similar restrictions and donors had to suspend some projects or redirect, for good reasons, part of their funding to help stop the virus' spread and underwrite the Malian health ministry's COVID-19 action plan.

Overall, however, amid the dramatic transformations that COVID-19 has wrought, much remains unchanged for peace and security on the continent. The virus cannot be blamed for lack of progress in addressing a number of pressing conflicts. We need to guard against the risk of ascribing problems to COVID-19 -- a narrative that if pushed too far could distort analysis, let actors off the hook and lead to erroneous policies.

Where we do need to remain attentive is the pandemic's economic fallout for the continent. Efforts to counter COVID-19 could reduce the funds available for bilateral and multilateral organisations to deal with the crises that may result. The strongest example of the former is the UK's aid cuts of £4.1bn for 2021, amounting to a 25 per cent reduction. Some of Africa's international partners may lack the bandwidth, funds or appetite to focus on the continent, given the depth of their own crises brought about by COVID-19. Urgent measures are thus necessary to relieve the pandemic's economic distress in fragile or conflict-affected societies. Global economic factors have tended to contribute to conflict risks in many countries, a trend that the pandemic could aggravate. The economic jolts resulting from the pandemic are worrying and will leave a number of the poorest countries in the world facing the prospect of five to ten years of depressed development.

The economic jolts resulting from the pandemic are worrying and will leave a number of the poorest countries in the world facing the prospect of five to ten years of depressed development.

For Africa, the future looks ominous. After South Asia, Africa is the continent with the biggest population projected to plunge into extreme poverty, with around 495 million -- 70 per cent of the world's poor people -- expected to be still living in those conditions by 2030. Worryingly, UN Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa Vera Songwe notes: ""Africa's buffers in 2021 are thinner than pre-pandemic"". A long bout with the coronavirus will be damaging for the continent's youthful and fast-growing population. COVID-19 is testing not just Africa's poorest countries but also its biggest economies. It has further aggravated Nigeria's youth unemployment. The latest figure of nearly fourteen million out of work may have motivated the government to finally roll out its long-awaited special works program for the young. As for South Africa, while it appears to be recovering from COVID-19's economic fallout, unemployment rates and inequality are rising there as well.

International efforts to help African states mitigate the economic effects of the pandemic may not be enough. The G20 countries agreed this month to extend initial suspension of debt service payments from June 2021 for another six months to December 2021 for more than 40 of the poorest countries -- including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. But this relief is only temporary and it will not solve the continent's critical debt problem in the long run. More than 30 per cent of revenue for a number of African governments is directed at debt repayments. The recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank spring meetings put the spotlight on managing divergent recovery both among and within states, but given the growing disparities and inequalities, wealthy countries should ""take the long view and act boldly to forgive the debts of poor countries and expand emergency financial assistance"". President Biden's decision to reverse Trump-era opposition to increasing the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs) -- a form of supplementary monetary reserve -- from its last expansion after the 2008 global financial crisis is a major boost to developing countries. The new $650 billion agreed to with other G7 nations may help poor countries cope with the pandemic's economic shocks, particularly if rich countries channel excess SDRs to poorer ones.

Ensuring that Africa has equitable access to vaccines will also be crucial to the continent's economic recovery.

Ensuring that Africa has equitable access to vaccines will also be crucial to the continent's economic recovery. The challenge of vaccinating people in Africa's most fragile states or those in conflict will complicate rollout plans. Poor logistics, negligible storage infrastructure and underfunded health-care facilities will disrupt those efforts. The continent is also at the periphery of the global scramble for supplies of COVID-19 vaccines and has almost no vaccine manufacturing capability. Its efforts to inoculate its citizens will largely depend on international good-will. Hence, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access -- COVAX facility -- a global mechanism funded by donors to help guarantee access to vaccines, especially for poor and lower-middle-income countries, is important for Africa.

The AU secured 670 million vaccine doses at the start of 2021. The head of Africa's CDC, John Nkengasong, wants to vaccinate up to 60 per cent of the population by 2022; other more conservative estimates don't expect most people to have been inoculated until at least mid-2023. With the initial slow pace of vaccine supply from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca -- the latter is widely available through COVAX, but halted in many countries due to safety issues -- African states have turned to China and Russia to secure reliable vaccines, though recent news suggests that the former's vaccine has proven less effective than alternatives. The race to help Africa inoculate its 1.3 billion citizens has created a vaccine contest, with Ankara, Beijing and Moscow vying with Western partners to strengthen their respective influence in parts of the continent.

Indeed, a number of external powers have seized the opportunity offered by the pandemic to advance soft power diplomacy across the African continent. At the start of the pandemic, China's image on the continent was greatly enhanced when the Jack Ma Foundation sent each African country batches of medical equipment, including thousands of masks and testing kits. Beijing then burnished its credentials by sending additional equipment and donating vaccines to several African countries, including Zimbabwe. By signing up to the G20 efforts to suspend debt payments, China also participated, for the first time, in a multilateral debt relief effort. Turkey has also dispatched thousands of masks along with other medical equipment to 45 African countries, including Niger and Mali. In Sudan, the Gulf states, Turkey and Egypt delivered personal protective equipment with a good amount of publicity, clearly aiming to build the profiles of these countries in Sudan at a time when Khartoum is reconfiguring its foreign policy.

Beyond the dire economic forecasts and concerns about the vaccine's reach, the news is not all bleak. Some of Africa's leaders have moved fast to put in place important social protection measures to help protect jobs, protect the vulnerable and provide some other safety nets.

Can they do more to relieve COVID-19's pressure and to ensure it doesn't worsen the conditions of fragile of conflict-affected societies? The AU has played a central role in managing efforts to limit the contagion's impact. The AU Assembly Bureau, traditionally an administrative body, began to take on a more political role in 2020. Made up of five heads of state, one from each African region, it began meeting on the African response to the pandemic. Under the then AU chair, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, it worked decisively to support the AU Commission and the CDC to launch a number of initiatives.

Crucially, the Bureau appointed six prominent and distinguished Africans as special envoys, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria, the newly appointed director-general of the World Trade Organisation, to mobilise financial resources to support national health responses and assist in the recovery of economies. An AU COVID-19 Response Fund was established in March 2020 by the AU Commission chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat. By October 2020, it had raised $44 million and made plans to raise a further $300 million. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which began operating on 1 January 2021, will open up a vast single market that could significantly boost regional trade and offset the economic shock dealt by COVID-19.

Other initiatives included medical supplies platforms to assist AU member states with access to affordable medical supplies and equipment, and technical assistance on case detection and containment. The Africa CDC also rolled out mechanisms to strengthen testing capacity. As noted, it has also led on acquiring vaccines, but it wants to coordinate vaccine trials and explore the potential for vaccine manufacturing on the continent -- it held a two-day meeting on the latter subject on 12-13 April.

AU members need to extend the robust COVID-19 coordination to more effectively respond to the continent's crises at a time when external partners may be reluctant or unable to continue funding the AU at existing levels.

But AU members need to extend the robust COVID-19 coordination to more effectively respond to the continent's crises at a time when external partners may be reluctant or unable to continue funding the AU at existing levels. Given how badly the pandemic has hit the Global North, we should expect Western governments to become more insular and inward-looking. We should expect a deficit of attention and less focus on overseas conflicts that do not impinge upon what Western leaders see as their national interests. South Africa's President Ramaphosa was right to state in his handover note to the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi as AU chair that ""conflict and war on the continent remains a grave threat to our developmental aspirations"". Member states have agreed to monitor implementation of the newly extended roadmap for silencing the guns every two years. The pandemic places tremendous pressure on Africa's leaders to tackle its debilitating effects and they have acted quickly. That same rapid reaction is necessary to address the continent's worse crises.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Somalia Seasonal Monitor April 23, 2021 - Somalia - ReliefWeb",https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/somalia-seasonal-monitor-april-23-2021,"FEWS NET publishes a Seasonal Monitor for Somalia every 10 days(dekad) through the end of the current April to June Gu rainy season. The purpose of this document isto provide updated information on the progress of the Gu season to facilitate contingency and response planning. This Somalia Seasonal Monitor is valid through April 30, 2021 and is produced in collaboration with U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Food Security andNutritionAnalysis Unit (FSNAU)

Somalia, the Somali Water and Land Information System (SWALIM), a number of other agencies, and several Somali non-governmental organizations(NGOs).

Start of the 2021 gu rains marked by delayed and below-average rainfall

The 2021 gu rainfall season, which typically begins between late March and mid-April, has yet to be effectively established across many areas of Somalia. Somalia received little to no rainfall in March and poorly distributed rainfall between April 1 and 20. To date, rainfall has performed relatively better in the South than in central and northern Somalia. According to CHIRPS preliminary remote sensing data for the period of April 11-20, localized rainfall ranging between 10 and 75 millimeters (mm) fell in most of Bay and Lower Juba regions and in localized areas of Hiiraan, Bakool, Gedo, and the Shabelle regions. Conversely, the central regions received only 10-25 mm while the Northwest received less than 25 mm of rain and the Northeast received less than 10 mm (Figure 1). In comparison to the long-term average, rainfall amounts were 10-50 mm below average across much of the South and in parts of the Northwest but were considered climatologically average in most of the Northeast, central regions, and localized areas in the South.

According to the most recent FAO SWALIM river station gauge data, water levels in the Shabelle River remain below average and water levels in the Juba River range from near average to slightly above average. Currently, the risk of flooding along both rivers is low.

In the Northwest, the rainfall season has yet to be fully established in most pastoral and agropastoral livelihood zones in Awdal,

Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sool, and Sanaag regions. During the period of April 11-20, only localized light to moderate rain occurred in Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed and localized areas of Hawd Pastoral and Golis Pastoral livelihood zones in Togdheer region. However, localized flooding was reported in parts in Guban Pastoral livelihood zone in Lughaya district of Awdal due to moderate rainfall in the Golis Mountains. In Sool and Sanaag, little to no rainfall has been reported. As a result, meteorological drought is present and pasture and water availability remain significantly below normal in most regions, adversely affecting livestock condition and productivity.

In the Northeast, most livelihood zones in Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug regions received little to no rain during the period of April 11-20. In Bari, only localized, light to moderate rainfall occurred in parts of East Golis Pastoral livelihood zone of Caluula and Qandala districts. In Nugaal and northern Mudug, only localized light showers were reported in Hawd Pastoral and Addun Pastoral livelihood zones of Burtinle and Eyl districts. Meteorological drought exists across this area and rangeland conditions range from below normal to poor, especially in Northern Inland Pastoral livelihood zone where rainfall in the preceding 2020 deyr season was also poor.

In central regions, rainfall onset was delayed across Galgaduud and southern Mudug regions. However, widespread moderate to heavy rainfall was reported on April 20 in both regions, marking the onset of the gu season. The exceptions are most of Galkacyo and Hobyo districts in southern Mudug, which remained dry. Although the recent rain has alleviated water stress and reduced reliance on water trucking, rangeland conditions remain well below typical levels with negative impacts on livestock conditions and productivity.

In the South, the onset of the gu varied during the period of April 1-20. Most livelihood zones in Bay, Lower Juba, and Lower and Middle Shabelle regions received localized, moderate rainfall early in the month. In mid-April, light to moderate rainfall was more widespread. However, according to ground reports, Southern Rainfed Agropastoral and Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zones received little to no rainfall through April 20. Between April 1 and 20, rain gauge stations recorded 141.6 mm in Qansahdhere (Bay),

64.5 mm in Jamaame (Lower Juba), 45 mm in Beledweyne (Hiiraan), 42.5 mm in Hudur (Bakool), 30.5 mm in Baidoa (Bay), and 30 mm in Sakow (Middle Juba). No flood risk was reported from the Juba and Shabelle rivers. Given these below-average amounts, the rains have benefitted rangeland conditions but are not yet sufficient to support optimal crop development.

According to the satellite-derived eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period of April 11-20, 2021, negative vegetation anomalies are widespread in southern, central, and northwestern parts of the country (Figure 3). Negative anomalies are attributed to below-average precipitation in late 2020, the hotter-than-normal jilaal dry season in early 2021, and delayed or poor gu rainfall in April. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center's seven-day weather forecast through April 30 predicts heavy precipitation of up to 100 mm across most of the Northwest, while eastern-central Somalia and some parts in the South (including most of Hiiraan and Bakool and localized areas of Bay) are forecast to receive 15-40 mm of rainfall. However, much of the Shabelle, the Juba, and Gedo regions and much of the central and northeastern regions will likely receive little to no rainfall.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564529-somalia-gu-seasonal-monitor-20210423-final.png?itok=ssOsoAmc,"['season', 'mm', 'monitor', '23', 'livelihood', 'regions', 'juba', 'gu', 'localized', 'pastoral', 'received', 'rainfall', '2021', 'seasonal', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought
DR-2021-000054-SOM,"WFP: Millions in West, Central Africa Facing Hunger Emergency - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/africa/wfp-millions-west-central-africa-facing-hunger-emergency,"GENEVA - The United Nations World Food Program warns that millions of people in West and Central Africa are facing catastrophic levels of hunger driven by conflict and soaring food prices.

More than 31 million people, an increase of 10 million over last year, are expected to be unable to feed themselves during the upcoming June to August lean season. This period precedes the next harvest and is the time of year when food stocks in West Africa are at their lowest.

A U.N. food analysis found nearly 2.7 million people are a step away from famine. Among them, it says some 800,000 people are facing emergency levels of hunger in northeast Nigeria's conflict-ridden states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe.

FILE - A girl carries a baby on her back at the Kuchingoro internally displaced persons camp, in Abuja, Nigeria, June 20, 2020.

World Food Program spokesman Tomson Phiri says years of conflict have uprooted millions of people from their homes, destroying their livelihoods and making them dependent upon international aid. He says high food prices also are stoking the growing hunger emergency in the region.

""They have increased sharply across West Africa, leaving millions of people struggling to meet their basic food needs. The price of virtually all local staples has shot up. In some areas, prices are 200 percent higher — the highest levels since 2008,"" Phiri said.

WFP reports that escalating violence in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger is deepening food shortages for some 6.5 million people.

Phiri says malnutrition is worsening in the region. He notes a staggering 10 million children under age five are estimated to be acutely malnourished, a condition that is life-threatening and inhibits their physical and mental development.

""Almost half of those children in the Sahel countries are faced with high levels of global acute malnutrition, out of which 70 percent, approximately 3.3 million, will need emergency food and nutrition assistance immediately,"" he said.

WFP is scaling up its emergency food operation. It plans to help nearly 18 million people in 19 countries in West and Central Africa this year. The agency is appealing for $770 million to implement its humanitarian operation in the coming six months.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Federal Republic of Somalia signs treaty with ARC - Reinsurance News,https://www.reinsurancene.ws/federal-republic-of-somalia-signs-treaty-with-arc/,"The Government of the Federal Republic of Somalia has signed a treaty and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the African Risk Capacity (ARC) to work together towards helping the country better prepare for extreme weather events and natural disasters.

Somalia’s exposure to both drought and flood risks further threatens the national economy and requires pre-emptive disaster risk reduction strategies to improve multi-hazard early warning, preparedness, and national coordination for disaster response.

The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs & Disaster Management initiated an engagement with ARC in September 2018 to explore ways of diversifying existing disaster risk management approaches, particularly, through a sovereign and parametric insurance mechanism.

Khadija M Diriye, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Federal Republic of Somalia, commented: “Somalia’s hazard profile is dominated by droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, desert locust, diseases (epidemic/pandemic), and terrorism that disrupt people’s livelihoods, destroy the infrastructure, divert planned use of resources, interrupt economic activities and retard development.

“The impacts of natural hazards do not occur in isolation; but recognition of such cause and effect on a national scale has encouraged the Government of Somalia intaking on a paradigm shift from crisis management to risk management. This will enable us to utilise our finite resources in a more efficient and timely manner towards assisting the vulnerable populations in the event of disasters.

“Therefore, we are proud to sign the ARC Establishment Agreement, as its 35th Member, as well as the MoU, with a strong commitment to taking the necessary steps to ensure that the collaboration leads to building of our national response capacities against the adverse impacts of natural disasters.”

The signing of the MoU will set out the terms, conditions and a framework to facilitate cooperation between ARC and FGS to address the impact of extreme weather events, including providing training support to Government personnel.

It will also prepare Somalia’s potential participation in future ARC (drought/flood/tropical cyclone) insurance risk pools.

ARC Group-Director General, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong added: “As the nature and intensity of natural catastrophes evolve across the region, we maintain that the continent will be better protected through a pooled-risk approach bringing together countries and leveraging smart partnerships.

“Today, the ARC Group proudly welcomes the Federal Republic of Somalia as its 35th Member State. By simultaneously signing the ARC Treaty and MoU, the Government has demonstrated a clear commitment to strengthening the country’s disaster risk reduction capacities; and thereby joining a growing number of African Union Member States that are accessing our tools to create coordinated contingency plans before catastrophes strike.”

“We would like to particularly convey our readiness to work with the authorities in accurately profiling their natural disaster risks and designing quantified response plans to better secure the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations in the event of a peril.”","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://149448277.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/african-risk-capacity-logo.jpg,"['risk', 'signs', 'disaster', 'mou', 'natural', 'republic', 'treaty', 'federal', 'national', 'management', 'member', 'arc', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Security Council Press Statement on Situation in Somalia (23 April 2021) - Somalia - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/somalia/security-council-press-statement-situation-somalia-23-april-2021,"The following Security Council press statement was issued today by Council President Dinh Quy Dang (Viet Nam):

The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern about the continued political impasse and disagreement among Somalia’s political leaders on the model for elections.

The members of the Security Council recalled the significant progress made during the past decade in Somalia, including in terms of security provision, democracy, political reforms and economic development, in particular debt relief. They commended the Somali people, the Somali authorities, the African Union, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop‑contributing countries, the United Nations and Somalia’s other international partners for their role in this endeavour.

The members of the Security Council emphasized that ongoing disagreement over the electoral model is not only undoing this hard-earned progress, but is also diverting attention from pressing problems, such as floods, drought, desert locusts, the COVID-19 pandemic and combating the terrorist threat of Al-Shabaab. They stressed that reaching consensus on elections would support and facilitate the continued development and progress of Somalia and its people.

The members of the Security Council underscored that consensus would be vital for any electoral model to be successfully delivered. They noted the 17 September 2020 agreement has remained the only basis so far endorsed by the Federal Government of Somalia and all Federal Member States.

The members of the Security Council therefore called on all parties to reject violence and resume dialogue as a matter of urgency and without precondition. They called on Somalia’s leaders to recognize and build upon the many areas of agreement already reached, to resolve their remaining differences and to put the interests of the people of Somalia first, within a Somali-owned, Somali-led electoral process, and with an agreed timetable, as soon as possible. They reiterated that, through the United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia (UNSOM) and in conjunction with AMISOM, the African Union, European Union, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and international partners, they stand ready to assist.

The members of the Security Council took note of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmaajo’s talks with the Democratic Republic of the Congo President and Chairperson of the African Union, Félix Tshisekedi, in Kinshasa on 19 April. They expressed their support for and encouraged regionally led international efforts to help bring the parties back to the table and facilitate inclusive negotiations.

The members of the Security Council took note of the IGAD statement of 21 April and the African Union Peace and Security Council communiqué of 22 April. They expressed their support for the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General, James Swan, and for African Union and IGAD efforts to help resolve the current impasse.

The members of the Security Council condemned all terrorist attacks in Somalia and the region and reaffirmed their respect for the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Somalia.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,AGCO Agriculture Foundation and Kenya Red Cross Society pact to address Climate Change and Food Insecurity in Kenya's Dadaab Refugee Complex - Africa Science News Service,https://africasciencenews.org/agco-agriculture-foundation-and-kenya-red-cross-society-pact-to-address-climate-change-and-food-insecurity-in-kenyas-dadaab-refugee-complex/,"By Julius Kericho

The AGCO Agriculture Foundation (AAF), a private foundation committed to ending hunger through sustainable agricultural development, today announced the second phase of a USD $125,000 project partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) to respond to climate change and food insecurity in the Dadaab Refugee Complex.

The project began this month, with the goal of restoring degraded land, strengthening refugees’ food security and income levels, and increasing the production of diverse, nutritious foods.

The Dadaab Refugee Complex falls within the expansive arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) of Kenya, characterized by hot, dry weather and high rates of evapotranspiration interspersed with occasional ﬂooding in poorly drained areas. Dramatic changes in weather patterns have caused prolonged drought and extreme rainfall, placing 209,584 refugees and 200,000 host community members living near the border of Kenya and Somalia in dire need of food and financial support.

Funded by the AAF, the first phase of the project focused on meeting agricultural and nutritional demands of refugees and host communities through the establishment of a mechanized farm for pivot irrigation and crop production.

“Climate change is a serious threat to the livelihood and food security of many marginalized farming communities. The impact reported from the initial phase of our project in the Dadaab Refugee Complex has propelled us to expand the project deliverables and continue this strategic partnership with the KRCS,” said Metti Richenhagen, Director, AGCO Agriculture Foundation. “This project demonstrates our commitment to address climate change and help farmers in the Dadaab camp and host community improve their soil health and build resilient food systems.”

The second phase of the project will support 6,000 beneficiaries in the Ifo 2 refugee camp and the host community. The goal is to promote climate-smart agriculture and soil fertility management practices, strengthen farmers’ skills in modern irrigation and mechanized agriculture, and create employment opportunities for vulnerable communities.

The KRCS will help farmers establish and manage their farms as well as connect them with local markets. The vegetable crops, lentils and leguminous grass that will be grown during this project phase will support the livelihoods of local farmers and their families.

The project is also supported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which maintains the water infrastructure serving the pivot farm and provides logistical support. The Kenya County Government of Garissa donated the parcel of land for the project and helps identify vulnerable community members who can benefit the most from the program.

“The AAF’s strong partnership and funding have enabled us to advance our work towards climate change adaptation and food security for the Dadaab refugees and host community. This second phase of this project is the right next step to ensuring access to nutrition and improving the livelihoods of refugees and their host community,” said Dr. Asha Mohammed, Secretary-General, Kenya Red Cross Society.","Sat, 15 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://africasciencenews.org/wp-content/themes/epanaito/assets/img/favicon.ico,"['insecurity', 'kenya', 'society', 'refugee', 'food', 'kenyas', 'phase', 'host', 'community', 'pact', 'red', 'refugees', 'farmers', 'dadaab', 'project', 'foundation']",drought

The world delayed a response, knowing that people were dying. Aid agencies like Concern did everything we could to secure funding and reach families forced to make unimaginable choices about which child would live as food and water disappeared.

Parents told us of the choices they made as they walked for days to reach assistance, leaving the weakest children behind.

Over 260,000 people died – a conservative estimate.

In contrast, the 2017 drought in Somalia was adequately resourced, and the response was swift. When action is taken early, lives are saved.

Today, however, 34 million people across the globe are at risk of famine.

Officials are due to detail the effects of the reduced aid on a country-by-country basis this week. The cuts come as the UK is gearing up to host the world’s leading climate conference later this year.

This year’s COP26 will be held in Glasgow in November with the aim of accelerating action towards the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement and the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Members of Parliament have called on the government to place ""transformative diplomacy"" at the heart of its role in hosting the conference.

Save the Children said many countries would face potentially dire consequences after the slump in direct aid from the UK.

“As the host of COP26, the UK has a huge opportunity and responsibility to bring the world together behind a plan to tackle climate change and support the communities worst affected,” said the charity’s chief executive Kevin Watkins.

“Calling on other countries to do more while the UK does less is a dereliction of leadership.”

Cuts of more than 50 per cent in Britain's bilateral aid budget were implemented at the start of the year. The UK had committed to spending 0.7 per cent of its gross domestic product on foreign aid, a target met every year since 2013. However, late last year the government announced this would be cut to 0.5 per cent.

Save the Children estimated that about 673 million children live in the 32 countries directly affected by the proposed aid cuts. Five of those – Yemen, Syria, Libya, Sudan and Somalia – are from the Arab world and all endure ongoing armed conflict.

Worsening climate conditions are increasingly being linked to conflicts as the catastrophic effects of floods, droughts and other extreme weather events result in mass displacement, as well as food and water shortages and disease.

Syria faced its worst drought on record a few years before protests erupted in 2011 and sparked a decades-long war. In Somalia, drought is fuelling ongoing conflict as people are driven into cities, refugee camps or towards militant groups. Yemen, a country with little arable land, has been so devastated by the twin effects of climate change and conflict that more than two million children are suffering from acute malnourishment, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification says.

Save the Children said the UK’s aid for basic child nutrition and food assistance in Yemen is set to fall by £36 million ($49.8m) – or 12 per cent. Last month, the government announced that it would reduce its overall Yemen aid package by 60 per cent to £87 million from £214 million. Aid to Syria may be cut by 67 per cent and Libya by 63 per cent, suggest figures leaked to openDemocracy, a UK-based political website. In Sub-Saharan Africa, Britain’s aid contribution would be almost wiped out – with a cut of 93 per cent being considered.

Mr Watkins warned that children were increasingly on the front line of the climate crisis, adding that the world’s response would decide the fate of millions of children today as well as future generations.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Emerging Lessons from Implementing Climate-Related Peace and Security Mandates - World - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/emerging-lessons-implementing-climate-related-peace-and-security-mandates,"Six of the ten largest United Nations-led peace operations in 2020 were located in countries that are the most exposed to climate change. Both UN peacekeeping operations and special political missions are increasingly mandated by the UN Security Council to consider and respond to climate-related security risks.

In response, UN peace operations have tried to more effectively respond to climate-related peace and security challenges by adapting existing approaches and exploring innovative new ways in which to operationalize these tasks. Efforts to translate these climate and environmental-related mandates into policies and practices are a work in progress, and can benefit from ongoing learning, monitoring, and adaptation. In this regard, lessons and good practices for integrating climate-related security risks into policies, analysis, activities, and reporting are beginning to emerge.

Why Climate-Related Security Risks Matter

Both slow-onset consequences of climate change—reduced rainfall, drought, desertification—and rapid onset events like flooding and sandstorms pose significant risks for communities that can exacerbate conflict and protection risks, undermine already weak governance, and complicate the ability of UN missions to respond and address other priorities. In Somalia, droughts and flooding contribute more to displacement than conflict. Frequent sandstorms and flooding are an obstacle to operational objectives and logistics of peacekeeping and government troops in Mali. In South Sudan, unpredictable rainfall and extreme weather events affect pastoralist mobility patterns and routes and agricultural production that can exacerbate tensions between farmers and herders. At the same time, effective responses to local climate impacts can also create opportunities for peacebuilding, such as creating openings for negotiation or cooperation between conflict parties.

How UN Peace Operations are Responding

UN missions have adopted a range of different tools and approaches, from integrating climate-related security risks into early warning systems and risks assessments, to working more closely with development and humanitarian counterparts and regional partners, to reducing their own environmental impact.

The UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) seconded the first ever climate security adviser to the UN Mission in Somalia (UNSOM). The dedicated position, based in the office deputy special representative of the secretary-general/resident coordinator/humanitarian coordinator, focuses on promoting coordination and integration across the mission and the UN country team, including through monthly environmental task force meetings. The position is helping the mission and UN system to mainstream climate security into programming, to improve the interlinkages between humanitarian, development, and peace actions, and to provide training and support to both mission and other UN personnel, implementing partners and national counterparts. An emerging lesson from the UNSOM experience is that a climate-security adviser provides the mission with dedicated expertise that enables the mission to improve its focus and capacity in this area. Such an advisor also helps the mission to improve its analysis, planning, programming, coordination, partnerships, and reporting related to its portfolio of climate-related peace and security tasks.

UNSOM remains the exception for the time being. Elsewhere, missions have sought to mainstream climate security into their analysis and operations. The UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), for example, has established dedicated focal points (adding this to other existing responsibilities) and task forces on climate-related security issues. The mission’s Joint Mission Analysis Center (JMAC) regularly incorporates climate-related security risks into early warning and risk assessments, for example, looking at the potential implications of weather forecasts and past migration patterns on peace and security, and uses this analysis to inform mission decision-making across the mission. However, institutional mechanisms to translate early warning into timely actions can be further improved.

Responses to climate-related risks often build on activities already undertaken by missions—for example, addressing resource conflict and transhumance-related violence by UNMISS—but requires understanding these issues from a new angle. This entails better linking the mission’s peace and security work with the country in question, with its international partners’ climate adaptation efforts, as well as their development and humanitarian programming. In South Sudan, however, siloed approaches are still a challenge in some areas and there is still room for improvement when it comes to the coordination of joint analysis, assessment, planning, and programming (possibly due to the absence of dedicated lead). In Somalia, by contrast, UNSOM’s latest common country assessment and development cooperation framework includes environmental peacebuilding and inclusive politics; climate security, climate governance, and environmental mediation; sustainable economic growth; and social development, resilience, and mitigation.

Multi-donor trust funds have also served to connect the climate, peace, and security dimensions of UN Security Council mandates to analysis, planning, and programming across peace and security, development, and humanitarian actors. This can help address some of the disconnect between analysis and response, while also building on and pulling together capacities on these issues that exist in the UN country team.

Partnerships beyond the UN system is also critically important—with host governments, civil society, and international and regional counterparts and partners. Specific configurations will differ from mission to mission. Working with and building regional capacities on data and early warning, including of the African Union and Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), have proven particularly important in addressing locusts and transboundary waters.

An enhanced ability to temporarily deploy expertise from UN headquarters or regional hubs could provide much needed advice, training, and mentoring in the absence of, or complementary to, dedicated climate-security positions in missions. The Climate Security Mechanism, a joint initiative of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs (DPPA), the UN Development Program (UNDP), and the UN Environment Program (UNEP) is providing guidance and advice on integrated risk analysis and response. Both DPPA and the Department of Peace Operations (DPO) have established dedicated focal points that convene regular exchanges of information and practices across missions, and identify gaps. These capacities, alongside expertise in the Mediation Support Unit (e.g., on intercommunal conflict) and in the Peacebuilding Fund secretariat (on climate-related project funding), provide important reach-back for missions and UN country offices. Missions would also benefit from regionally-based expertise (with greater familiarity with the context and shorter deployment horizons), for example, shared across multiple missions or operating out of regional offices, e.g., the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel and its counterpart in Central Africa, or regional development offices in Addis Abba or Libreville, or the UN Office in Nairobi (where UNEP has its headquarters).

Addressing Gaps: Next Steps

Despite this progress, missions continue to face challenges, including translating guidance from headquarters. For mission staff—often comprised of versatile generalists—tackling climate, peace, and security can be intimidating, and its entry points difficult to grasp given its cross-cutting nature. Climate-related security risks can seem like a stretch of job descriptions; one that needs to compete with other priorities. Missions are requesting additional training and capacity building in climate-related risk analysis and programming for their own staff, as well as to provide accompaniment for partners in government and regional entities.

The establishment of dedicated climate-adviser positions, budgets for training and capacity building, and temporary deployments have resource implications that require Fifth Committee approval, subject to negotiation over competing priorities and finite resources. By articulating responsibilities for analysis of and response to climate, peace, and security risks in the operational paragraphs of mandates, for example, the Security Council would clearly convey the priority of this issue and increase the prospects of member state approval. More regular reporting by missions to the Council on how climate-related security risks affect mandate implementation would also demonstrate to the Council why such analysis matters.

Pandemic Feeding Many Drivers of Conflict, Instability Says Secretary-General

Despite having suffered some of the COVID-19 pandemic’s worst socioeconomic impacts — including inflated debt burdens, job losses and worsening conflicts — Africa has to date received just 2 per cent of vaccine doses produced globally, the Security Council heard today, as it convened a high-level virtual debate on addressing the root causes of conflict in the continent’s post-COVID-19 recovery process.

Through a presidential statement (document S/PRST/2021/10) — issued at the meeting’s outset by Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, which holds the 15-member Council’s rotating Presidency in May — delegates expressed their concern over those developments. They reiterated the need to enable equitable access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines to all, including the most vulnerable.

Urging greater national, regional and international cooperation and solidarity — with the United Nations playing a coordinating role — they called for support to strengthen health-care systems and invited the accelerated donation of safe, effective vaccine doses to African countries in need, particularly through the COVAX Facility of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. In addition, the Council acknowledged ongoing discussions on waiving intellectual property protections for COVID-19 vaccines under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and on easing global trade to support the provision of vaccines to everyone in need.

Members also heard briefings by several senior officials close to the topic. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, recalling his appeal early in the pandemic for a global ceasefire to enable countries to focus on combating the virus as their common enemy, said that, while the call was embraced by some armed groups and Governments — including in Africa — clashes nevertheless continued. Extremist groups in Western and Central Africa and Mozambique have continued and even increased their heinous attacks on civilians, creating additional challenges for societies and Governments. The recent attacks in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, and the increasing insecurity caused by the Allied Democratic Forces group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, are tragic reminders of that serious threat.

In response, he outlined the accelerated efforts of his Special Representatives and Envoys to advance peace negotiations across Africa amid the pandemic, adding that the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission has worked closely with the African Union and regional economic communities to help leaders build back better. The Peacebuilding Fund has also adjusted its work in response to COVID-19, supporting national crisis‑management efforts, social cohesion and dialogue, and working to counter hate speech and disinformation.

“Many communities and countries on the African continent already face a complex peace and security environment,” he said, citing risk factors such as long-standing inequality, poverty, food insecurity, environmental degradation, urbanization and demographic pressures. Climate disruption is a further crisis multiplier, displacing communities and leaving people susceptible to recruitment by criminal gangs, violent extremists and armed groups. Some countries find themselves in a vicious cycle where conflict breeds poverty and fragility, in turn decreasing the resilience of societies and the prospects for peace.

As the world faces the possibility of an uneven recovery from COVID-19, he said it is clear that the crisis is feeding many drivers of conflict and instability. The severe economic fallout is aggravating tensions, and has already pushed an additional estimated 114 million people into extreme poverty. Economic growth on the African continent has slowed, remittances are drying up and debt is mounting. Meanwhile, in the name of fighting the crisis, some Governments have restricted democratic processes and civic space, and divisive rhetoric, hate speech and harmful misinformation are further eroding public trust. The pandemic has also had a disproportionate impact on young people — especially in Africa, the youngest continent — and on women.

Urging Member States to ensure those groups are meaningfully included in the shaping of post-pandemic recovery plans, he said recovery from the pandemic offers an opportunity to address the root causes of conflict, prioritize prevention and implement both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. While praising the Africa Taskforce created to ensure a unified approach to fighting the pandemic, he went on to sound alarm that of the 1.4 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine administered to date, only 24 million — less than 2 per cent — have reached Africa. “Equitable and sustainable vaccine roll-out worldwide is the quickest path towards a fast, and fair recovery,” he stressed, calling for the sharing of doses, the removal of export restrictions, ramping up local production and fully funding the COVAX Facility. “This pandemic has shown that we are only as strong as our weakest link and will only achieve recovery in solidarity,” he said.

Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), also briefed Council members, describing Africa as a continent of unparallel promise. It is home to nearly one third of global mineral reserves and nearly two thirds of the world’s arable land, as well as a young and dynamic workforce. It also holds the potential to deliver 40 per cent of the world’s solar energy. However, much of that immense promise remains untapped, blocked by obstacles linked to peace, security and development. “Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals […] will require overcoming complex legacy issues and the challenges that compound them,” he said, citing political instability, weak governance, inequality and now also COVID-19 and the climate emergency — “two of the greatest challenges of this generation”.

Noting that African countries account for a small fraction of the world’s reported COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to its population, he said those numbers nevertheless mask the crippling financial, social and political effects of the virus on the continent. Some 40 million Africans have already been pushed back into extreme poverty. As the technical lead of the United Nations socioeconomic response to the pandemic, UNDP is focused on saving lives and livelihoods. Its analysis shows that an “SDG [Sustainable Development Goals] push” now — combining bold policies and investments in governance, social protection, digitalization and the green economy — could lift millions of Africans out of poverty by 2030. A push towards vaccine equity is also needed, as less than 1 per cent of the population of most African countries are currently vaccinated.

Meanwhile, he said, the ratio of external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in Africa has risen to an alarming 65 per cent, and COVID-19 is constraining fiscal space and making it more difficult for Governments to make strategic investments. This week’s conference on debt relief in Sudan, convened by France, is a good example of how world leaders can come together to countries by relieving the debt burden and unleashing development resources. As finance will be crucial to the recovery, UNDP contributed to the drafting of over 40 country-led socioeconomic response plans in Africa, generating new public policy insights at a time of unprecedented complexity. UNDP is also supporting 26 African countries to create Integrated National Financing Frameworks, ensuring that financing for the COVID-19 recovery is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

“For Africa, a sustainable recovery must be powered by sustainable energy,” he continued. Three quarters of the nearly 800 million people with no access to electricity live in sub-Saharan Africa, while, because of the pandemic, 100 million more Africans can no longer afford sustainable energy options. Calling for urgent action to achieve the goal of clean, affordable energy for all by 2030 — and net-zero emissions by 2050 — he went on to draw links between those targets and good governance. From its many projects and studies on the ground, he said UNDP has learned that “when you want to address the root causes of conflict, investing in development works”.

Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, noted a rising trajectory in the number of COVID-19 infections and fatalities across Africa. Stressing that the pandemic will continue to have a profound impact on the continent’s economic and social development, he said the biggest challenge Africans face today is that of vaccine access. It is folly to think the world secure from the COVID-19 crisis while Africa lacks protection against the virus and its variants, he said, adding that slow economic growth, reduced international trade, increased external debt and rising inflation have further deteriorated the socioeconomic situation in many African nations. Twenty countries currently face the risk of collapse due to debt burden alone. In that context, he called for new thinking and initiatives to address the crisis, emphasizing that economic recovery must focus on fiscal stimulus and debt exclusion rather than austerity.

He went on to point out that global travel bans and national lockdowns have disrupted local economies and affected both formal and informal sectors, causing job losses, inflation and a lowered standard of living in many African countries. The pandemic has also had devastating consequences for African small and medium‑sized enterprises and public hospitals. Massive job loss has stripped many parents of the means to send their children to school, while strains on health‑care systems endanger the lives of citizens suffering from other chronic diseases. Among other things, he stressed the need for urgent coordination on vaccine distribution and debt relief that accounts for the countries’ unique circumstances. Concluding, he urged the international community to not lose its pre-pandemic momentum in recognizing the nexus among peace, security and development, as expressed in the 2030 Agenda.

In the ensuing debate, Council members stressed the primary importance of ensuring equitable, affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all and highlighted the necessity of a strong partnership between the United Nations and regional organizations, particularly the African Union. Pointing out that African challenges can only be truly solved by African leadership, many stressed that the continent cannot — and should not have to — tackles these issues alone, calling for increased international support of African-led initiatives. Others linked the continent’s colonial past to its present problems, urging States to lift economic sanctions imposed on African countries to promote socioeconomic recovery in the wake of COVID-19.

Wang Yi, State Councillor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of China, which holds the Presidency of the Council for May, delivered remarks in his national capacity. Stressing that no country in the world can respond to the current pandemic crisis alone — and no country should be left alone to do so — he described Africa as a critical part of the global response. The international community should accelerate its provision of medical supplies and make vaccines affordable and accessible, including through technology transfer, capacity‑building and the provision of excess doses. In the area of peace and security, he spotlighted the crucial partnership between the United Nations and the African Union, calling for more support as the latter works to fight terrorism, achieve sustainable development and prevent the root causes of conflict. States which currently have economic sanctions imposed on African nations, including on Zimbabwe and Sudan, should urgently lift them. Development partners should think creatively to help Africa build its capacity and boost self‑sustained innovation, he said, voicing support for the African Continental Free Trade Area and for initiatives aimed at reversing historic injustices in global governance. In that regard, he noted that African countries now account for more than a quarter of the United Nations membership. The Organization will not be able to hold its moral ground until it finally gives Africa the equal voice it deserves. “This is what true multilateralism is about,” he stressed, outlining China’s strong and long‑standing support for the continent, including its recent decision to cancel the debt of 15 African countries amid the pandemic.

Othman Jerandi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, pointing out the disastrous health impacts of the pandemic to date — 3.4 million deaths and more than 160 million infections, only expected to increase — said that the coming phase will be even more difficult as the pandemic’s socioeconomic and security consequences may continue for several years to come, worsening conflicts and making addressing the same more complicated. He urged an equitable global response to pandemic recovery — so that disparities between States do not deepen — calling for the international community to address debt sustainability and liquidity issues, to alleviate the debt burden for developing and least developed countries and to ensure equitable global vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines have brought with them renewed hope for recovery and a return to development and normalcy, but least developed countries are lagging — while 10 States in the world retain 75 per cent of these vaccines, less than 2 per cent of all Africans have received any dose thereof. He called on the Security Council to adopt a more comprehensive concept of peace and security that accounts for existing vulnerabilities and the impact of the coronavirus.

Jean-Yves Le Drian, Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, underscoring that public health, the planet and security “are common goods that we can only defend together”, said that his country’s first priority is guaranteeing universal, equitable access to vaccines for the people of Africa, who deserve more than announcements and “vaccine cronyism”. France was the first country to provide the COVAX mechanism with financial support and vaccine doses — because of this, Mauritania has benefitted from 100,000 doses already, and four other countries in Africa will receive doses by the end of May. Noting that any discussion centred on equitable vaccine access necessarily includes a discussion of intellectual property, he supported an immediate lifting of impediments to the export of vaccine components. France’s second priority is to support African peace and security initiatives; for example, a political and civil leap is necessary in the Sahel to provide basic services in vulnerable areas as a complement to military action in the region. He added that the international community must support Africa on the path to sustainable development, as the current crisis has only exacerbated poverty and food insecurity on the continent.

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Minister for External Affairs of India, said the deep solidarity between his country and Africa is expressed through the India‑Africa Forum Summit, “Group of 77” developing countries and China, Non-Aligned Movement, and most evidently, at the United Nations itself. “It is a matter of continuing regret for us that the voice of Africa is not given its proper due in its most pivotal institution,” he said, expressing support for the Common African Position, as stated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. As Africa’s capabilities in facing COVID-19 are “still in the making”, the world must stand by the continent. India has supplied medicines, vaccines and health equipment, and post‑pandemic, its approach, as articulated in the 2018 Kampala Principles, outlines support without conditionalities and in line with African expectations. Pointing to India’s peacekeeping presence in South Sudan, Somalia, Abeyi, Western Sahara and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, he endorsed the call to support Africa’s counter-terrorism operations with sustained funding. Bilaterally, India has partnered in the establishment of defence institutions in Nigeria, Ethiopia and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Bui Thanh Son, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Viet Nam, said centuries of slavery and colonialism have dragged the great continent of Africa into poverty, strife and underdevelopment. Now, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely worsened Africa’s socioeconomic prospects, exacerbated ongoing conflicts and undermined efforts to address their root causes of these conflicts. While Africa’s challenges can only be solved by African leadership, the continent cannot — and must not — do it alone. International support and assistance are essential, including to putting in place the peace, stability and security that are prerequisites for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19. It is critical to fully implement Council resolutions 2532 (2020) and 2565 (2020), particularly their calls for a global ceasefire and a durable, extensive and humanitarian pause. Much more also needs to be done to reduce poverty and inequality, address underdevelopment and rectify social injustice. In that vein, he called for close partnerships between the United Nations and African regional and subregional organizations in Africa, particularly the African Union, and the ongoing engagement of the Security Council.

Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence of Ireland, said peace and security in Africa is a key focus of his country’s international development programme. Citing COVID-19’s uneven impact, he declared: “Our efforts to respond in a collective and coherent manner have been insufficient.” The pandemic must be addressed everywhere at the same time, he said, saying Ireland is providing €100 million to global public health in 2021 — including bilateral support to the COVAX Facility — and is part of the European Union’s broader €860 million contribution. Calling for a focus on conflict settings and the related challenge of climate change, he cited the multiple and repeated shocks of drought and flooding currently affecting the Horn of Africa. He voiced support for the African Union’s efforts to advance socioeconomic development, including through the new African Continental Free Trade Area, calling on all parties to live up to their international legal obligations. That includes in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, which has seen many people killed, injured or displaced in recent months. Among other things, he went on to call for the promotion and protection of human rights for all; redoubled efforts to achieve gender equality; good governance; and for the rule of law to be meaningfully integrated into COVID-19 recovery strategies.

Eva-Maria Liimets, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Estonia, underlined the need to work collectively to overcome the pandemic and address the root causes of conflict. For the recovery to be meaningful, partners must ensure unhindered humanitarian access to conflict areas. Reiterating Estonia’s support for the Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire, she said it is now crucial for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines and other immunization programmes. Estonia will never stop underscoring the importance of good governance, accountability, compliance with international humanitarian law, the protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law — all of which play an important role in the conflicts in Africa. To help the continent build back better, its partners must work to get COVID-19 under control faster. The European Union is leading in that regard, having already contributed over €2.47 billion to the global COVAX Facility. Europe also remains the leading exporter of vaccines worldwide, exporting almost as many doses as it provides to its own citizens. Estonia supports Africa in that regard, and also recently adopted its first-ever comprehensive strategy for Africa (2020-2030) which focuses, among other things, on digital transformation, e-governance, innovation and a green transition.

Mutahi Kagwe, Cabinet Secretary for Health of Kenya, said Africa’s security challenges have grown more difficult to manage, due to the emergence of new threats from climate change, migration, terrorism and violent extremism, among others. African States must strengthen their capacities and institutions to respond to pandemics and invest in human security. “A greater focus on the people is needed to ensure that Africa has enough skilled workforce,” he stressed. Africa has special needs, and thus, must be integrated differently in the world economy with a focus on value addition and manufacturing. The causes of conflict relate to poverty and unequal resource distribution, making job creation for young Africans a priority, along with greater State capacity to reach and administer ungoverned spaces, build cohesion among diverse peoples and embrace inclusion in all spheres. He called for boosting the COVAX Facility and enabling easy access to it by all African countries; debt relief and restructuring; investment in national and regional transport and energy infrastructure; and climate change adaptation programmes. He similarly called for greater cooperation between the Council and the African Union to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, adequate resourcing through assessed contributions of all such peacekeeping missions, including the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and a unified voice in tackling terrorism.

Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister for International Development of Norway, stressed that COVID-19 is compounding the impact of conflict and climate change in Africa, widening the poverty gap and undermining development gains. Pandemic response, meanwhile, has been used as a pretext to limit civil liberties and human rights. “This is not the way to build trust,” he said. The pandemic must be met with leadership, partnership and a willingness to address the causes of conflict, as demonstrated by the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Mali. Attempts to limit the spread of the virus are hampered when State authorities are absent or too weak to play their role, making it “extremely challenging” to roll out vaccines. He called for a long-term, dynamic, fair and inclusive approach to addressing the causes of violence. Stressing that the African Union’s normative work on democracy, good governance, human rights and rule of law is essential, he encouraged the bloc to take further steps to resolve the conflict in Tigray, Ethiopia, noting that national and local voices must be brought to the table — and heard — especially those of women. Indeed, post‑pandemic recovery cannot wait. He called on States to start planning now — addressing the causes of conflict — through partnerships and preventive diplomacy.

The representative of the United States said it is not only challenges, but also opportunities, that connect human beings across the globe at this critical moment. Noting that the decisive actions taken by many African leaders to prevent the spread of COVID-19 saved countless lives, she outlined the United States’ long‑term partnerships and investments across the continent, which among other things have greatly reduced child and maternal deaths and prevented the spread of HIV. On 17 May, President Joseph R. Biden announced that 80 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will be donated “where they are needed most” outside the United States, with no strings attached. Turning to the serious impacts of climate change in Africa, which is a source of conflict and insecurity in countless communities, she said economic recovery will be a key piece of the continent’s post-COVID-19 recovery. In that regard, she called for engagement by the international community that supports more equitable growth and more transparent, market-based development strategies. The United States supports the initiative of the G20 and the Paris Club to provide debt suspension to some countries, as well as plans by IMF to provide special drawing rights. Underlining her country’s long‑standing belief that democracy is the most powerful way to prevent conflict, she outlined its support for electoral processes and good governance, emphasizing: “If people have a voice and a vote, they are less likely to turn to violence.”

The representative of Mexico, noting the numerous challenges to achieving sustainable peace across Africa, urged the international community to focus on improving institutional strength and the rule of law, on ending the illicit traffic of small arms and light weapons and on addressing the exploitation of the continent’s natural resources. Further, it is necessary to promote the active participation of all members of society — particularly girls and young women — in all stages of post-pandemic recovery to ensure that process is effective and inclusive. Citing World Bank data that the pandemic has pushed some 40 million people in Africa into abject poverty, he called on the Security Council to guarantee all countries on the continent access to COVID-19 vaccines, as political tensions and conflicts might worsen if vaccinations continue at the current, slow rate.

The representative of Niger, noting that African issues represent more than half of the items on the Council’s agenda and account for 70 per cent of peacekeeping interventions, cited a range of challenges that have plagued the continent since colonial times. Today, climate change and the pandemic are compounding those challenges, but also provide an opportunity to finally address Africa’s many intersecting crises. In that context, he called for a lifting of patent rules and intellectual property rights; relaxation of global trade rules; and efforts to make technology and know-how accessible to all. Describing COVID‑19 as a “widow-maker”, he said development and poverty‑reduction efforts must address the needs of widows and orphans, thereby preventing their radicalization by armed groups and reducing social unrest. At a time when many developed countries have already vaccinated huge swaths of their population, he emphasized that Africa’s population remains vaccinated at a rate of less than 1 per cent. Countries on the continent have also suffered severely from the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts, and require substantial debt relief, special drawing rights and other support to reviving their economies. Such measures should also be applied as the continent addresses the “silent pandemic” of climate change, he added, while echoing the call to urgently overhaul the global governance structures that have long rendered African countries onlookers as others make decisions about their destiny.

James Duddridge, Minister for Africa at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office of the United Kingdom, noting that the challenges of recovering from the pandemic are numerous and interconnected, called for a comprehensive approach across the pillars of human rights, peace and security and development. The United Kingdom has worked with its partners towards equitable access to COVID‑19 vaccines around the world, and under its presidency, the Group of Seven (G7) doubled its contributions to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) ACT‑Accelerator and the COVAX Facility. Citing the risks posed by conflict, he said “vaccination ceasefires” are crucial. Turning to the post-pandemic recovery, he urged Member States to consider ways to ensure that everyone, particularly women, girls and young and marginalized people, have the chance to fulfil their potential. In that regard, he called for increased access to health care, education, poverty reduction and efforts to end preventable deaths. As climate change also continues to magnify challenges, especially in Africa, the United Kingdom has pledged more than $15 billion in international climate finance over the next five years and will continue to support sustainable development and peace processes across the continent.

The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said that, against the backdrop of the pandemic, security risks in Africa have become accentuated, social contracts have faltered, public trust has diminished and ethnic, intercommunal and political divisions have deepened. Stressing that “lasting solutions can never be imposed”, she said the surest pathway to peace and security in Africa is through home-grown solutions. The expertise of local and regional actors — grounded within the unique context of Africa — must be leveraged through enhanced partnerships among the United Nations, African Union and subregional organizations that span the continent. She called on developed countries to honour their official development assistance (ODA) commitments, to provide greater debt-relief and long-term capacity-building assistance in line with national priorities and to withdraw prejudicial constraints — including unilateral coercive measures — imposed on African countries in favour of inclusive, people-centred and climate-informed solutions delivered in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals.

The representative of the Russian Federation pointed out that the relevance of today’s debate is evidenced by the fact that the Council devotes upwards of 70 per cent of its discussions to crises in African countries that face threats like terrorism, organized crime, arms and drug trafficking and exploitation of natural resources. While the Council often hears of the relationship between development and security, the “theoretical interdependence of various processes” should be left to the academic community; United Nations entities should instead focus their efforts on practical solutions to existing problems within the scope of their mandates. She said that, in many ways, the root causes of conflict in Africa are the consequences of the continent’s colonial past, and colonialism is taking on new forms — in addition to unfair trade policies and restricted market access, there is active interference in the internal affairs of States. If such interference does not achieve the intended result, then the “sword of Damocles” of unilateral coercive measures hangs overhead, inhibiting swift economic recovery and preventing true independence. She said that, despite this, it is encouraging that African countries, guided by the principle of “African solutions to African problems” are forging an independent path to recovery.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Drought is Leading to Instability and Water Weaponization in the Middle East and North Africa – Homeland Security Today - HSToday,https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/drought-is-leading-to-instability-and-water-weaponization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa/,"Water stress is a growing problem worldwide. Overuse, population growth, and climate change are contributing to desperate conditions and violent extremist organizations (VEOs) are turning scarce water into a weapon. Nowhere is this trend more visible than in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), a region of critical importance to U.S. national security interests. The MENA region has long been prone to both cyclical and discrete periods of droughts. There is mounting evidence suggesting that climate change, by driving significant winter precipitation decline, is increasing the frequency and severity of these events.

Climate change impacts that affected Syria could be a harbinger for other countries in the region. The connection between climate change and Syrian instability was first raised by our colleagues Francesco Femia and Caitlin Werrell in 2012, and confirmed by climate scientist and Center for Climate and Security Senior Fellow, Colin P. Kelley, and his colleagues, who linked the consequential 2007-2010 drought to a long-term warming trend in the eastern Mediterranean (finding that the drought was made 2-3 times more likely due to climate change).. Drought conditions as well as poorly-designed and discriminatory water policies implemented by the Assad regime and the Alawite elite were also factors that contributed to societal instability at the onset of the Syrian civil war. The regional climate model ALADIN corroborates previous studies projecting that the MENA region will continue to be a global hotspot for drought into the late twenty-first century.

Declining water security in MENA is expected to stem not only from climate change impacts but also from other factors such as pollution, population growth, government corruption, and unsustainable utilization of existing water sources. Over the next 20 to 30 years, threats to water security in the region will be further exacerbated by continuing transboundary disputes over access to water resources as described in a July 2020 memorandum by the U.S. National Intelligence Council on how water affects economic and political stability. Countries of particular concern include Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Syria, and Yemen.

Water and Conflict: A Vicious Cycle

In MENA and Africa there is correlation between the spheres of influence of VEOs—groups that support and perpetrate ideologically-motivated violence—and areas of dry land or sparse vegetation.

Where extremist groups are active, the correlation between climate-based water stress and the onset of violence can be viewed in terms of a water conflict cycle which Marcus King (one of the authors of this article) described in a series of case studies of Syria and Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia. In all three cases, water stressors such as increases in temperature, water scarcity, extreme weather, and depletion of groundwater led to detrimental local systemic outcomes. Climate shocks weaken state resiliency on multiple fronts. As a result of these stressors, people experience strains on rural livelihoods that accompany decreases in the productivity of agricultural systems. In each case, farmers responded through internal and external mass environmental migration, where in many cases they fell prey to violence perpetrated by VEOs.

Cross-border migration can also have cascading impacts on international security in a region as volatile as MENA. Somali migrants have fled to Yemen, another state embroiled in chaos, further complicating the delicate human security conditions in that country. Migrants from Syria, Iraq, Nigeria, and Somalia—all epicenters of water weaponization—continue on their way to Europe, and ethnonationalist political forces, by stoking fear of migrants, have exploited this humanitarian crisis to gain political power. The next stage of this vicious cycle is the loss of foreign investment and development assistance due to ongoing conflict which in turn hinders water infrastructure development. Domestic resources that could be used for this purpose are diverted to combat terrorism.

Water Weaponization

State and nonstate actors already at war have taken advantage of water stress to weaponize water as detailed in the three case studies featuring ISIS, Al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram. These VEOs have weaponized water in distinct ways depending on their capabilities and the characteristics of these ongoing internal wars. These cases prove that water can be used as a strategic or tactical weapon or as a means to terrorize, coerce, and subjugate local populations. For example, ISIS weaponized water on the strategic level by capturing the Mosul Dam on August 7, 2014. The group also wielded water as a tactical weapon against Iraqi forces, and collaterally flooded several villages. a In an article in the Washington Quarterly by one of the authors of this article, Marcus King, it’s argued that water weaponization was essential to the warfighting strategy of ISIS

Aside from outright weaponization, water has also been used by parties to conflict in MENA as a political lever. Mark Zeitoun coined the phrase hydro-hegemony to describe this behavior. As the upper riparian in the Tigris-Euphrates River System, hydro-hegemony places Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government in a position to leverage water resources against “Federal Iraq” which lies downstream. The construction of dams in Turkey and Iran, including in Ilisu, Daryan, and Sardash, are further decreasing water supplies.

As water becomes more polluted and scarce there is a perception in southern Iraq that the Kurds are overusing the waters of the Tigris and other rivers. This perception alone could be enough to destabilize relations, further eroding a frayed working relationship between Erbil and Baghdad. A treatment by Marcus King of the hydro-politics of Iraqi Kurdistan, including how climate change has impacted water resources, can be found in the volume Water and Conflict in the Middle East.

Today, as impacts of climate change are growing more intense, ushering in micro level water conflicts throughout Iraq, there is a sobering possibility that water stress will play into dissatisfaction with the national government manifested by popular support for a resurgence of ISIS in many areas.

Take the situation in the southern Iraqi city of Basra. Upstream damming has decreased water levels in the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers which converge in this area. This issue paired with decades of water mismanagement, climate-induced heatwaves, increased pollution, and seawater intrusion have limited access to electricity and clean water for drinking and sanitation leading to continued popular dissatisfaction and instability. Tensions exploded in 2018, as violent protests erupted after 100,000 fell sick from polluted waters. In January 2020, similar protests in Basra were met with violent reprisals by national authorities. Severe desertification in this area has caused farmers to abandon their livelihoods; some turning desperately towards theft for survival. In recent years, the worsening of desertification has correlated positively with increasing instances of crime such as armed robbery and human trafficking in Basra.

In 2020, the country faced scorching, record-high temperatures that reached 125.8 degrees Fahrenheit. In July 2020, government cuts to electricity left households throughout the country with few ways to combat unbearable temperatures. Again the Iraqis saw their upstream neighbors as the culprits while the increasingly delegitimized government in Baghdad did nothing. This raises the questions of what will happen as we approach another sweltering summer in Iraq.

Recommendations

Climate-driven environmental scarcity contributes to hydro-hegemonic behavior by nations and repeated, systematic, and unprecedented water weaponization by VEOs. Today, there is rising concern that Islamic State in West Africa is now extending its reach into Burkina Faso and that it may choose to leverage access to water over subjected populations to build allegiances, much as their brethren did in Syria and Iraq. Despite recent growth in water weaponization, we must not allow it to be normalized in modern warfare, and we must recognize and combat the role climate change has played in enabling such weaponization.

Overall, nations need to appreciate water as a potential tool for terror, and that it needs to be safeguarded as such. Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions prohibits the destruction of drinking-water installations, supplies, and irrigation works. Another agreement, the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD), prohibits action such as the deliberate destruction of infrastructure to kill civilians or to flood enemy positions. While climate has been addressed as a contributor to instability, there is a need for more robust legal remedies at the national and international level.

Development assistance from the United States and other multilateral actors that builds resilience to climate change will alleviate climate-induced water stress and reduce instability that could lead to violence across the MENA region. However, development assistance is a long-range strategy that is hard to implement during ongoing conflict. The Global Fragility Act, passed by Congress in 2019, provides funds to stabilize conflict-affected areas and prevent violence globally, including through development assistance, but it fails to mention climate change in any capacity as impacting state fragility.

The Biden Administration now has the opportunity to address this gap. In MENA, addressing water stress through development assistance can be a tool toward stability and conflict prevention and therefore form an integral part of counterinsurgency strategies against violent extremist organizations.

DR-2021-000054-SOM,Building back better from COVID-19 and building lasting peace across Africa - Mirage News,https://www.miragenews.com/building-back-better-from-covid-19-and-building-563106/,"Thank you, State Councillor Wang, for convening this timely debate.

As we’ve heard today, this devastating pandemic presents fresh challenges to building a lasting peace across the African continent. The virus indeed has disproportionately impacted those affected by conflict, particularly women, children, refugees and internally displaced persons.

The challenges of recovery are numerous and interconnected. And that’s why we must work together through a comprehensive approach across human rights, peace, security and development.

The UK has worked with all our international partners for equitable access to COVID vaccines for people around the world. Under our G7 presidency, the G7 has doubled contributions to COVAX, and we’re proud to be one of the largest bilateral donors, committing $770 million.

More than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from these vaccination campaigns because of instability and conflict. A multilateral approach is the only viable way to ensure that rapid, equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, including in conflict affected areas through vaccination ceasefires.

However, as we consider pandemic recovery, we need to look beyond vaccines and consider how to ensure everyone – particularly women, girls, the young, the excluded – has the opportunity to build their potential. This requires increased access to healthcare and ending preventable deaths. It requires quality education, which is why the UK is part of and is indeed the largest global donor to the Global Partnership for Education, reaching 24 million children since 2015 – the majority of which are in Africa. We look forward to the Global Education Partnership’s replenishment Summit in July with our Kenyan friends, and we call on all countries to step up their efforts in this regard.

Addressing health and education shortcomings will reduce poverty, but we must also address the undeniable links between poverty and conflict. By 2030, 80 per cent of the world’s extreme poor will be living in fragile states. Climate change will continue to magnify this trend, driving food insecurity, drought and exacerbating conflict. That’s why we’ve already pledged over $15 billion of international climate finance over the next five years.

There’s a chance to support Africa not only to recover from the pandemic, but rebuild better than before. Unleashing the potential women and young people is central to this. Health and education and climate support not only will change lives for the better, but it will only do so if it’s not undermined by conflict.

So we must address the underlying grievances that cause people to take up arms. Development gains and fragile peace can be lost if large parts of the population are marginalised or human rights are not respected. That’s why in Somalia, for example, the UK places such importance of promoting full, equal and meaningful participation of women and community leaders in elections and also in peace processes.

That’s why ending horrendous levels of sexual and gender based violence that we’re witnessing in Tigray is so, so urgent.

Peace can only be built from the foundations of strong institutions, the rule of law and open, inclusive societies. The UN and African Union are working stronger together than ever before. Early interventions, including by the African Union, will need to be coupled with long-term engagement and development programmes by the UN and its partners.

We’ve seen this in Sudan, where Prime Minister Hamdok continues to make progress towards peace, prosperity and democracy.

In Mali, the UK is supporting UN stabilisation efforts and increasing the meaningful participation of women in the peace process through our peacekeeping deployment, and also by working with UN agencies to strengthen civil-military cooperation.

The UK also strongly supports the sustaining peace agenda, which builds an inclusive cross-pillar approach to peacebuilding that draws on expertise of the whole UN system. We’re proud to support the Peacebuilding Commission and Peacebuilding Fund, to which the UK has been a top donor, having donated £220 million since its inception.

To conclude, there is more to do if we’re to reduce the dangers that poverty, marginalisation and the pandemic pose to African peace and development, and global stability more generally. We need countries to come together to support an integrated approach to post-pandemic recovery, because only by working together can we address the underlying drivers of conflicts and achieve a lasting peace for Africa – a peace we all want.","Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/person/image/1860/james-duddridge.jpg,"['conflict', 'africa', 'support', 'pandemic', 'lasting', 'approach', 'education', 'women', 'global', 'african', 'building', 'covid19', 'better', 'peace', 'uk']",none

We commend Prime Minister Roble and the Federal Member State leaders for rejecting a mandate extension. We now call on the President and Federal Member State leaders to engage urgently in talks without preconditions. They should come prepared to make necessary compromises and negotiate in good faith.

We are gravely concerned that failure to move quickly towards elections could lead to greater insecurity, in Mogadishu and elsewhere, and have serious humanitarian consequences. Violence in Mogadishu has already displaced tens of thousands. Drought compounds the risks to civilian lives and livelihoods.

We call on all security forces in the capital to refrain from violence and maintain calm.

KEY MESSAGES

From March to mid-April, the seasonal rains across the Horn were largely well below average, around 40-60 percent of average, across most of the region. However, a few areas over the western sector recorded average to above average rainfall.

Rangeland resources have declined driven by the cumulative adverse impacts of the poor 2020 short-rains, hotter-than-normal conditions since January, and cumulatively below-average rainfall, particularly over the predominantly pastoral and marginal mixed agricultural areas of the eastern Horn.

Due to the significantly delayed onset (20-30 days) of the seasonal rains in belg/gu/long-rains dependent areas, most planted crops are in the emergence to early vegetative crop stages. However, in some belg dependent areas, planting has not taken place. There are increasing concerns of crop water stress and limited crop growth and development due to the anticipated subsiding of the seasonal rains in May.","Sat, 01 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1565239-EAST_AFRICA_Seasonal_Monitor_April_2021-Final.png?itok=ibVgR9nI,"['areas', 'belg', 'water', 'africa', 'rains', 'east', 'monitor', '2021', 'crop', 'poor', 'dependent', '30', 'western', 'average', 'seasonal', 'somalia']",flood_and_drought

Conflict and insecurity continue to be a primary driver of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Yemen and in greater Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile states of Sudan. Most recently, conflict in Tigray region of Ethiopia is causing high levels of population displacement, disrupting livelihood activities and market functioning, and limiting food assistance. In Yemen, intensified conflict in Marib is of increasing concern and a risk of Famine (IPC Phase 5) persists. South Sudan also continues to experience one of the worst food insecurity emergencies globally and urgent food assistance is needed to save lives, especially in greater Jonglei and the greater Tonj in Warrap.

High and above-average staple food, fuel, and water prices continue to limit food access and compound the severity of Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes in Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, and Somalia. In Sudan, millet and sorghum prices rose 600-650 percent above the five-year average in March across most markets. Similar trends are observed in South Sudan. In Ethiopia, maize prices in Addis Ababa rose to 100 percent above the five-year average and sorghum prices rose 50 percent above the five-year average in Woldia in Amhara region. In Yemen, although four fuel ships were permitted to deliver fuel to Al Hudaydah port in March, fuel shortages and upward pressure on food prices are expected to resume after 1-2 months. In central and northern Somalia, water scarcity has caused the price of a 20-liter jerrycan of water to double compared to 2020.

In bimodal areas of eastern Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, delayed and significantly below-average rainfall in March is anticipated to result in a second consecutive season of below-average harvests and suppressed livestock production. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse is likely to peak in these areas during the subsequent June to September dry season, as households’ access to food and income erodes amid concurrent conflict, price, and desert locust shocks. In unimodal areas of western Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, a forecast of above-average rainfall from June to September is likely to cause a consecutive year of flood-related displacement and crop and livestock losses. The population in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and Emergency (IPC Phase 4) is also likely to peak in these areas during this period, which overlaps the local lean seasons.","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1564345-East%20Africa%20Key%20Message%20Update%20-%20Food%20insecurity%20rises%20amid%20conflict%2C%20price%20and%20weather%20shocks%2C%20and%20COVID-19%20third%20wave%20%28April%202021%29.png?itok=vh82Ycen,"['rises', 'ipc', 'fuel', 'food', 'price', 'message', 'phase', 'weather', 'wave', 'prices', 'crisis', 'south', 'sudan', 'shocks', 'key', 'yemen', 'update', 'ethiopia']",none

The humanitarian response system in Somalia has mechanisms in place for rapid scale-up and sustained programming, including cash and voucher assistance (CVA). Despite the challenging context of COVID-19, 224.8 million USD was dispursed through CVA in Somalia by the end of November 2020. The use of CVA, through multi-purpose cash assistance and sectoral cash, is expected to rise throughout 2021, as it remains an effective means of delivering aid. .

The Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI) is a joint initiative from the Somalia Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Shelter, and Education clusters and REACH. It aims to address an information gap in Somalia in terms of regular and updated monitoring of market functionality and a broad range of non-food items (NFIs), while contributing to existing supply chain and price monitoring of the main minimum expenditure basket (MEB) items.

The aim of the JMMI is to harmonize market monitoring, avoid duplications and overlaps in data collection, maximize geographic coverage and ensure a regular and predictable output to inform cluster programming and cash responses. It is a model that REACH has supported to set up and coordinate in several countries.

The assessed items are selected based on needs of the three clusters and their members, currently implementing or planning to implement MarketBased Programming (MBP) and CVA. On the supply side, MBP supports traders to expand their products, for example through providing non-refundable cash grants for business development. On the demand side, CVA is provided to increase access to WASH, shelter, and education commodities.

Data collection takes place on a quarterly basis.

The pilot round of the JMMI in Somalia took place in June 2020, in 6 locations with a reduced list of assessed items. The August 2020 round was the first full round of the JMMI, which covered more than 50 items from the WASH and Shelter clusters, in 12 different locations. Atypical circumstances due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have increased both the demand for an updated monitoring of a broad range of NFIs, and the limitations faced when collecting primary data.

Twenty additional items were added to the JMMI in November 2020, in collaboration with the Somalia Education Cluster, to respond to persisting information gaps on education-related expenses.

As of the most recent round in February 2021, the JMMI continues to grow and improve, with partners working together, learning from experience, while delivering the best possible data with transparency and accuracy","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1563875-REACH_SOM_Factsheet_JMMI_2021-Feb-final.png?itok=OZH2ggNt,"['shelter', 'items', 'initiative', '2020', 'joint', 'jmmi', 'wash', 'monitoring', 'cva', 'market', 'round', 'cash', '2021', 'somalia']",none

The announcement by the interior ministry on Thursday followed a meeting between Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi about the status of the Dadaab and Kakuma camps. Most of the 433,765 refugees and asylum seekers living at the settlements are from Somalia and South Sudan.

“A joint team comprising officials from the Kenyan government and the (UN Refugee) agency will therefore be formed to finalise and implement a road map on the next steps towards a humane management of refugees in both camps,” a joint statement said.

Kenya has formally communicated to @Refugees its decision to close Dadaab & Kakuma camps by 30 June 2022. Among the precursory activities in GoK's roadmap is repatriation of refugees to countries of origin & socioeconomic integration of some of them through Work/Residence Permits pic.twitter.com/KuUSrjkLkE — Ministry of Interior (@InteriorKE) April 29, 2021

Earlier this month, UNHCR presented Kenya with what it said were “sustainable rights-based measures” for finding solutions for the refugees’ longstanding displacement.

This followed a two-week ultimatum given by Kenya’s interior minister for the agency to come up with a road map to close the decades-old camps.

A push by Kenya’s government to shut down the camps sooner was blocked after the country’s High Court issued a temporary 30-day order following a legal challenge filed by former presidential aspirant Peter Gichira that sought to block the closure.

UNHCR’s “sustainable and rights-based measures” to find a solution for the displacement of the refugees include voluntary return for refugees in safety and dignity, departures to third countries under various arrangements and alternative stay options in Kenya for certain refugees from East African Community, or EAC, countries.

“We are serious about completing the repatriation program which we started in 2016, in full view of our international obligations and our domestic responsibility. We therefore reiterate our earlier position to close both Dadaab and Kakuma camps by 30th of June, 2022,” Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i said, according to the statement.

“I believe that the government and people of Kenya will continue to show their generous hospitality towards refugees as they have done for nearly three decades, while we carry on discussions on a strategy to find the most durable, appropriate and rights-based solutions for refugees and asylum-seekers residing in the refugee camps in Dadaab and Kakuma,” Grandi said.

Refugees from East African countries will be given the option of being issued a work permit for free so that they can integrate into Kenyan communities or return to their country of origin, Matiang’i said.

Kenya has said the Dadaab refugee camp near the Somalia border is a source of insecurity. Some officials have argued that it has been used as a recruiting ground for the armed group al-Shabab and a base for launching violent attacks inside Kenya, but officials have not provided conclusive proof.

Kenya has been saying for years that it would like to close Daadab, near Kenya’s eastern border with Somalia and which hosts nearly 200,000 mostly Somali refugees.

A Kenyan court in 2017 blocked the closure of the Dadaab camp, saying it was not safe for refugees to return to Somalia.

The Kenyan government’s latest demand is seen as retaliation against Somalia for insisting on pursuing a case at the International Court of Justice over a disputed maritime border between the two countries. Kenya wants the case settled out of court.

Kakuma, home to more than 190,000 refugees, is located in Kenya’s northwest. Dadaab is in eastern Kenya, close to the Somali border, but many Somalis have moved between the two camps.

Dadaab was established 30 years ago and was once the world’s largest refugee camp, which, at its peak, hosted more than half a million people fleeing violence and drought in Somalia.

Speaking to Al Jazeera earlier this month, residents in both camps had urged the Kenyan government to abandon its plans.

“It’s very terrifying because we do not know the next step, like where are we going to go from here,” David Omot, an Ethiopian who has lived in both Kakuma and Dadaab since 2005, said of the closure order. “Where will we go? Back home we still have some insecurity, there are still some problems that people are facing, especially the youths.”

Austin Baboya, a South Sudanese 26-year-old based in Kakuma, said he has not known any other home than a refugee camp.

“I don’t know if the [Kenyan] government have sat down and considered the lives of people living in the camp or they just wake up and make those decisions,” Baboya said, calling on UNHCR and international donors to help find a solution.

“Before the camp was open very many people lost lives. Very many people fled their home countries … They have found a place to call home and I don’t think many of them are willing to go back.”","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2011102142243420580_20.jpeg?fit=680%2C450,"['kenya', 'refugee', 'kenyas', 'refugees', 'kakuma', 'camps', 'dadaab', 'countries', 'close', 'kenyan']",none
DR-2021-000054-SOM,"Tapping regional integration to bolster resilience in the Horn of Africa In 2020, the economies of - World Bank Group",https://blogs.worldbank.org/nasikiliza/tapping-regional-integration-bolster-resilience-horn-africa,"In 2020, the economies of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia together grew by 0.88%, despite the significant downside risks precipitated by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and the accompanying economic shakeout. Stark divergence in growth profiles, underlying fragilities and significant risks create a complex context going forward. It is against this backdrop of risk tempered with cautious optimism that the Finance Ministers of the Horn of Africa Initiative met virtually on March 31, 2021 to further the gains realized in strengthening regional integration in order to bolster resilience in the Horn of Africa.

Crowding in capital to support connectivity and unlock opportunity is a priority under the Horn of Africa Initiative. Of the agreed package of $15 billion, an initial tranche of $3.3 billion has been mobilized from the Africa Development Bank (AfDB), the European Union (EU) and the World Bank to support regional economic corridors, energy trade, digital economy, trade facilitation, disease surveillance and response to the locusts’ crisis. For example, the AfDB and the World Bank have teamed up to support the Isiolo/Mandera corridor, with the Bank funding $750 million through the Horn of Africa Gateway Development project. The Bank has approved a $500 million Emergency Locust Response Project with a Multiphase Programmatic Approach to help support countries in the Horn affected by locust invasions. The EU has also greenlighted $88 million for locust response and another $45 million to promote harmonized trading frameworks between Djibouti and Ethiopia. In 2021, AfDB is prioritizing three projects worth an estimated $500 million for implementation. The World Bank alongside the AfDB have mobilized about $600 million to support second Ethiopia-Djibouti Interconnector and the Ethiopia-Somalia Interconnectors. The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development supports the Initiative with its deep experience in the region and technical insights.

These interventions strengthen the relationships and connectivity across the Horn of Africa to help create jobs, mitigate emerging risks and strengthen resilience. Connected roads, access to energy, and digital systems are a catalyst for commerce; they help businesses trim their overheads and strengthen linkages to regional and global value chains. Investments in agriculture and pastoral value chains spur the creation of livelihoods and help to bring economic activity and services to neglected borderland areas. Last, but not least, such interventions create a multiplier for growth and development within broadly underserved markets and can help to address significant inequalities across the sub-region.

Horn of Africa Initiative member countries are working together to deepen regional integration with help from the newly-established 30 million Euro Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), contributed to by the EU and to be administered by the World Bank. Activities under this trust fund will accelerate the pace at which proposals can be translated into viable projects on the ground. The MDTF creates an avenue through which donors can also easily support projects under the Horn of Africa Initiative. The activation of the MDTF is critical given the plan to reach out to more development partners to finance the remaining part of the $15 billion priority financing package.

The Horn of Africa Initiative is also exploring innovative ways to help member states address the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, deal with drought and other climate related crises, and to support displaced populations. Countries have come together in multiple workshops to agree on and prioritize their collective efforts, providing a platform to keep the cooperation advancing even under the weight of the crisis. The initiative has also prioritized the ‘soft aspects’ of the partnership such as policy harmonization across member countries to ensure real spillover benefits, which are vital to enhance regional results and resilience.

Overall, the countries of the Horn of Africa Initiative are moving forward toward a more interconnected, a more integrated and a more resilient Horn. Sudan has participated as an observer and will likely join as formal member in autumn, further broadening the initiative’s potential and impact.","Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://blogs.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/styles/card/public/2021-04/tapping-regional-integration-bolster-resilience-horn-africa-1140x500.jpg?itok=EZB5sMO8,"['help', 'million', 'africa', 'support', 'bank', 'bolster', 'development', 'initiative', 'resilience', 'tapping', 'integration', 'countries', 'regional', 'horn']",none
DR-2021-000054-SOM,Letters to the Editor: Swift action can save lives — don’t wait for alarm bell - Irish Examiner,https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/yourview/arid-40277333.html,"I was an aid worker in Somalia 10 years ago, when 3m people faced famine, as a result of a massive drought and violent conflict.

The world delayed a response, knowing that people were dying.

Aid agencies like Concern did everything we could to secure funding and reach families forced to make unimaginable choices about which child would live as food and water disappeared. Parents told us of the choices they made as they walked for days to reach assistance, leaving the weakest children behind. More than 260,000 people died — a conservative estimate.

In contrast, the 2017 drought in Somalia was adequately resourced and the response was swift. When action is taken early, lives are saved.

Today, however, 34m people across the globe are at risk of famine. Donors are being asked to step up again to save lives and livelihoods so that people not only survive but keep their assets, stay in their homes and recover and rebuild.

Waiting for that famine alarm bell in order to respond means thousands are already dead.

Running ring(road)s around Carrigaline

The local politicians could spend their time more productively doing something about the growing daily traffic chaos in Carrigaline.

Ring roads should have been planned when Carrigaline was designated as a satellite town over 40 years ago. All we have is continuing housing development — all of which required planning permission — but absolutely no infrastructure to cater for the resulting increase in traffic.

At the rate things are going, it will be another 40 years before they build a decent road to cater for the port in Ringaskiddy. Sometimes I despair.

Do we really need USB ports in bed?

Science is again misused and this time it’s not just for making bombs. There is now a bed that comes with two USB ports and this is considered a special feature. USB ports are useful for charging many things, although of course a power board can achieve this and not seem weird.

Although probably useful, it does make you wonder why someone, probably not really a scientist, thought this was worthwhile, given that there are so many other problems to solve. It is also suggested that, for better sleep, people do not take their phones, iPads and other devices to bed.

Wake up to this strange device and go back to sleep.

Vaccine rollout a ‘headache’ for all

The vaccine rollout has been described as being a “huge headache” for well-paid planners. What about the feelings of those who will have to wait a lot longer than May for their vaccines?

Those with concerns are told to join the back of the queue. This sure sounds democratic to me!

Why is the expensive HSE unable to execute a simple rollout for our small population, while the UK has vaccinated a huge portion of its enormous population? Added to this incompetence is the proposed salary increase for the secretary general of the Department of Health. Minister Donnelly then praises this non-PUP recipient for so nobly waiving this outrageous salary increase of €80k.

There’s a lot of “feelgood” dribble about civil liberties. We’ll only have real liberty when we all get safely vaccinated as soon as possible.

Sex education is no place for bishops

It is both inopportune and ill advised that the Irish Bishops’ Conference should publish a sex education programme for Catholic primary schools.

It is both inopportune and ill advised that the Irish Bishops’ Conference should publish a sex education programme for Catholic primary schools, says our correspondent.

Do our bishops not realise how utterly bankrupt they and our Church in Ireland are in terms of sexual mores and ethics and as practitioners, appraisers or mentors of human sexuality?

The Church has devastated generations of individuals and families in every corner of this country, not just through indifference, neglect or dereliction, but through deed in terms of sexual activity and abuse and through its judgment of the laity based on self-serving sexual parameters.

Much better that the Bishops’ Conference start laying a bedrock stamped with candour, humility and reticence focused on rebuilding it’s long lost credibility with those of us who continue to hang in there.

Opportunities for Church socialising

Lay Catholic religion need not be lonely (Sean O’Brien “Religious isolation a negative thing” Irish Examiner, April 27). The Bible tells us that “there’s a time for everything”. During Mass, our focus should be exclusively on the cross — on the outstretched arms of Jesus as he thirsts for our active presence. It’s not the time for banter. But the Church provides lay Catholics many opportunities to discuss “individual views about the Gospel” and more.

As a lay Catholic, I have participated in coffee mornings after mass; lectio divina groups (prayerful Bible study); catechesis study groups; Catholic-theme monthly book clubs; spiritual retreats; pilgrimages with other joyful pilgrims; and many other social activities connected to my faith. Our input as lay Catholics was always part of this and I’m very grateful for the insights and company of the many wonderful people I’ve met this way.

Coronavirus has curtailed things but, please God, the world will soon return to some kind of normality and our socially distanced isolation can end. Jesus founded his Church to support and guide us on the narrow path home. God knows humans are social animals and we need each other’s company, support and prayers (Genesis 2:18). In Catholicism,

it’s known as “the communion of saints”.

Tackling world’s ills will benefit us all

Every one of us is in a kind of doctor’s waiting room. None of us wants to be here. An obese and unsound global economic model based on the mirage of continuous unending “growth” and consumption. One man’s waste is another man’s livelihood, so this “gout” is very difficult to treat. But the longer we leave it, the worse it will get. After a series of quizzical frowns, reproachful glances and scarifying ‘tuts’, the doctor intones the dreaded words — this is going to hurt. Everyone knows it. Cover your ears and you still hear the music. I reckon we’ll feel relieved once we start to tackle the problem in a meaningful way.

On Sunday, April 11, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Tanzanian President Samia Hassan Suluhu signed an agreement to contruct the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). The $3.55 billion pipeline will stretch from Uganda’s Albertine Graben region, where commercially viable oil deposits were discovered in 2006, to the Tanzanian port of Tanga. At 1,440 km, the pipeline will be the largest heated pipeline in the world and connect two oil fields—the Kingfisher field, operated by China National Offshore Oil Corporation Ltd (CNOOC), and the Tilenga field, operated by Total S.A. Contruction is anticipated to take three years, opening up the pipeline for commercial use by 2025 at the earliest. The meeting in Entebbe also witnessed the signing among shareholders of the project, including CNOOC, Total, the Uganda National Oil Company, and the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation.

Christina Golubski Associate Director - Africa Growth Initiative Leo Holtz Intern - Africa Growth Initiative Tamara White Research and Project Assistant - Global Economy and Development, Africa Growth Initiative

Hopes for job creation and long-term profits are high among many: Suluhu noted that the project is expected to create 10,000 jobs, and the World Bank estimates that, by 2030, peak oil production in the region—up to 60,000 barrels of oil per day—could earn Uganda up to $3 billion. Notably, the agreements mandate that the oil companies must award at least 30 percent of project-related contracts to local Ugandan suppliers.

The project has met resistance, though, from both the local and international community over fears of displacement of local communities, risk of environmental harm, and lack of transparency. In fact, in early March, 263 international and local civil society groups published an open letter urging banks not to finance the project. In response to environmental concerns, Total has stated that it will limit oil extraction from the national park to less than 1 percent of the protected area and fund a 50 percent increase in the number of rangers in Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda’s largest protected area.

Poor rains quell resurgence of locust swarms in East Africa

Following a devastating locust swarm that inundated East Africa with the crop-destroying insects in 2020, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that the locusts in East Africa remain immature and underdeveloped this year due to poor rains. Although the FAO identified some locust swarms in the Kenyan Rift Valley, a fertile plain that grows Kenya’s staple foods, cautious optimism persists as, without significant rain, the locusts will not breed—limiting their threat to food security and agriculture-based livelihoods. However, while poor rains might reduce the threat of destructive locusts, it may also translate into a poor harvest for a region that has suffered from perpetual drought. In response to this trade-off, though, as a Kenyan farmer stated to the Associated Press, “a poor harvest [is] better than nothing.”

Farmers and activists in the region have already been gearing up to combat the pests given their potential to cause widespread devastation. Indeed, 2020 saw one of the worst outbreaks in a century. As the locust swarms swelled last year, with billions descending on East Africa, mobile apps became a seminally important grassroots system for tracking the swarms. Now, combined with integrated military, NGO, and civilian control operations armed with insecticide, locust numbers continue to decline. However, the economic and nutritional damage of the locust swarms—an average-size individual swarm can consume enough food to feed 2,500 people in a day—impacted approximately 19 million farmers and herders in the region last year, endangering the already fragile food security situation in the Horn of Africa.

Voters in Chad, Benin, and Djibouti head to the polls amid local and national tensions

On Sunday, April 11, Chad held its presidential election, which was preceded by a number of protests and arrests. As of this writing, results have yet to be released, and al-Jazeera reports that the election commission has until April 25 to announce provisional results. Incumbent President Idriss Deby, who is predicted to win, has been in power since 1996. Election day was met with some violence, as the rebel group Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT), a political-military group founded by dissident army officers in 2016 and based in Libya, attacked the Zouarké border post.

Sunday also saw Benin’s presidential election in which President Patrice Talon was reelected with 86.3 percent of the vote, according to the Associated Press. The results must now be validated by the Constitutional Court. The election in Benin was preceded by boycotts from opposition parties over preelection violence and objections to President Talon’s serving a second term, as he had pledged in 2016 to step down after one and subsequently passed reforms disqualifying many of the opposition from running.

Djibouti also voted last week, with incumbent President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh securing a fifth term—with 98 percent of the vote—among widespread boycotts from the opposition, according to al-Jazeera.

Also this week, Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed signed a law to extended his term for two years despite risk of international sanctions. The decision was met with condemnation from both the United States and European Union, with U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken stating that the move “will compel the United States to reevaluate our bilateral relations with the Federal Government of Somalia, to include diplomatic engagement and assistance, and to consider all available tools, including sanctions and visa restrictions, to respond to efforts to undermine peace and stability.” The Somali election process has been deadlocked since last fall over the organization of the elections, as many want to move away from Somalia’s currently indirect electoral system. Other contentious issues include “the formation of the electoral commission, selection of commission members for Somaliland, and the crisis in the Somalia –Kenya border region,” in addition to accusations that President Mohamed was using the national intelligence agency to rig the voting system.","Sat, 17 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/global_chad_woman_voting.jpg,"['uganda', 'region', 'locusts', 'africa', 'east', 'food', 'election', 'political', 'locust', 'local', 'updates', 'oil', 'fewer', 'national', 'pipeline', 'president']",none

After little to no rainfall in the North and poorly distributed rainfall elsewhere through April 20th, the 2021 gu rains were fully established in late April. Light to moderate to heavy precipitation occurred across much of the country during the April 21-30 period. According to preliminary CHIRPS remote sensing data, most of the Northwest and localized areas in the South received at least 25 to 50 millimeters (mm) of rain. Across the rest of the country, rainfall amounted to less than 30 mm (Figure 1). In comparison to the long-term average, rainfall amounts in the North were either climatologically average or 10-25 mm above average, especially in the Northwest. Conversely, rainfall across much of southern and central Somalia was 10-25 mm below average (Figure 2). According to the most recent FAO SWALIM river station gauge data, water levels in the Shabelle and Juba rivers continue to be well below moderate to high flood risk levels. Despite the low river water levels, SWALIM reports that open riverbank points at two villages in Jowhar district of Middle Shabelle have led to extensive damages to cropped farmland and housing in those villages.

In the Northwest, where conditions had previously remained dry, moderate to heavy rain fell across most of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sool, and Sanaag regions during the April 21-30 period. Rainfall amounts were heaviest in the agropastoral and pastoral livelihood zones of Awdal and Woqooyi Galbeed, where flooding damaged roads and bridges, particularly in Hargeysa district. In Togdheer, field reports confirm moderate rainfall amounts across the region. In Sool and Sanaag, field reports indicate rain was more localized and sparse in pastoral areas than captured by remote sensing data. The rains brought an end to the meteorological drought conditions that were previously observed in March and April, alleviating severe water shortages in most livelihood zones. The rains are expected to support some crop development in agropastoral areas and temporarily regenerate pasture and browse.

In the Northeast, field reports indicate rainfall performance varied across Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug regions during the April 21-30 period. In Bari, localized light to moderate rain was reported in East Golis and Northern Inland Pastoral (NIP) livelihood zones, but little to no rainfall was reported in Coastal Deeh Pastoral livelihood zone. In Nugaal and northern Mudug, no rainfall occurred in coastal areas, though light showers fell in NIP and Addun Pastoral livelihood zones and localized moderate rainfall occurred in Hawd Pastoral livelihood zone. Although meteorological drought has been alleviated according to the Standardized Precipitation Index, field reports suggest conditions are drier than normal in Coastal Deeh, NIP, and Addun livelihood zones of Nugaal and northern Mudug.

In central regions, gu rainfall amounts intensified in Galgaduud and southern Mudug during the April 21-30 period. Field reports confirm moderate to heavy rainfall occurred with normal distribution. However, rainfall amounts were reportedly heavier in Hawd Pastoral and Addun Pastoral livelihood zones compared to Coastal Deeh Pastoral and Cowpea Belt livelihood zones. The increase in rainfall amounts has alleviated acute water and pasture shortages in these areas.

In the South, rainfall performance varied across regions during the April 21-30 period. Moderately intense rainfall with uniform distribution was reported in most livelihood zones of Bay, Bakool, Gedo, and Juba regions. Conversely, most livelihood zones of Hiiraan and the Shabelle regions received relatively less rainfall, where localized light to moderate rains are reported. Between April 21st and 30th, rain gauge stations recorded 97.8 mm in Qansahdhere (Bay), 53 mm in Hudur (Bakool), 52 mm in Sakow (Middle Juba), 45 mm in Beledweyne (Hiiraan), 25.5 mm in Baidoa (Bay), 5.5 mm in Jamaame (Lower Juba), and 0 mm in Afgoye (Lower Shabelle). The late April rains are expected to improve rangeland conditions and boost cropping conditions in many southern regions, though concern remains given the short timeframe of the rainfall season. River water levels rose but remained below flood risk levels. However, open river breakages led to flooding in two villages in Jowhar district of Middle Shabelle, with damage to cropped farmland and housing.

According to the satellite-derived eMODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the period of April 21-30, negative vegetation anomalies remain prevalent in southern, central, and northwestern parts of the country (Figure 3). However, given the increase in rainfall amounts, vegetation conditions are expected to improve in many areas of the country over the coming days and weeks. The NOAA Climate Prediction Center's seven-day weather forecast through May 10 predicts moderate to heavy precipitation of up to 60-80 mm across the country (Figure 4). The highest amount of rainfall is expected in pastoral and agropastoral livelihood zones of the North and in localized areas in the South, including Bay, Bakool, Lower Shabelle, and Juba regions.
