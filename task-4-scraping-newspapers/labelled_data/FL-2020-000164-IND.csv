MUMBAI (Reuters) - India saw 18% more rainfall than average in June as the monsoon covered the entire country nearly two weeks earlier than usual, the state-run weather office said on Tuesday.

Monsoons deliver about 70% of India’s annual rainfall and are the lifeblood of its $2.9 trillion economy, spurring farm output and boosting rural spending on items ranging from gold to cars, motorcycles and refrigerators.

Soybean, pulses and cotton-growing regions in central and western India saw 31% more rainfall in June, while rice, coffee, rubber and tea growing southern India saw 8% higher rainfall, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

A good start to the June-September monsoon season has accelerated planting of summer-sown crops, with farmers sowing crops on 31.56 million hectares as of June 26, doubling from 2019, when the monsoon arrived late.

Cotton sowing was up 165%, while rice planting rose by 35% during the period.

India is the world’s biggest exporter of rice and the biggest cotton producer. A rise in rice and cotton production could lead to higher exports of both products.

Oilseed plantings have risen 525% from a year ago, which could help the world’s biggest edible oil importer reduce imports.

India is likely to see above average monsoon rainfall even in July, a crucial month for sowing of summer crops, said an official with IMD, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.

IMD said last month that India is likely to see above average monsoon rain for the second straight year in 2020, boosting hopes for higher farm output in an economy reeling under the impact of the coronavirus.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200630&t=2&i=1524147235&r=LYNXMPEG5T1OK&w=800,"['rainfall', 'average', 'sees', 'higher', 'crop', 'saw', 'accelerating', 'rice', 'biggest', 'crops', 'sowing', 'india', 'monsoon']", ,flood

New Delhi, July 1

The IMD has predicted an intense monsoon rain spell over west and central India during the next 5 days.

Under the influence of high convergence of strong moist westerly/southwesterly winds at lower tropospheric levels from the Arabian Sea very likely along the west coast till July 5 and plains of northwest India and central India from July 3, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall activity with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are very likely along west coast, Gujarat state and interior Maharashtra during the next 5 days, it said.

Isolated heavy to very heavy with extremely heavy rainfall (≥ 20 cm) very likely over Konkan and Goa on July 3 and 4 band over madhya Maharashtra on July 4, it added.

Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls most likely over Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and east Uttar Pradesh till tomorrow, which will increase in intensity and distribution thereafter between July 3 and 5, it added.","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://englishtribuneimages.blob.core.windows.net/gallary-content/2020/7/2020_7$largeimg_66573643.jpg,"['rainfall', 'imd', 'till', 'madhya', 'widespread', 'west', 'likely', 'rain', 'intense', 'heavy', 'pradesh', 'maharashtra', 'central', 'india', 'monsoon', 'days']",flood,flood
2,2,FL-2020-000164-IND,Global ripple effect of shifting monsoons - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/06/200629124059.htm,"Scientists from the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a dozen other international research institutions have produced the most elaborate set of projections to date that illustrates possible futures for major monsoon regions.

Multiple regions around the world plan energy production, agricultural practices and other essential economic endeavors based on the annual arrival of monsoons, which entails a seasonal shift in the direction of winds that provides periods of steady rainfall. However, unchecked greenhouse gas emissions could disrupt these traditionally predictable events.

Using RegCM4, the latest version of a popular regional climate model developed by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy, the team ran a series of simulations to project and evaluate changes in nine monsoon regions across five continents. The researchers designed the simulations with a tight grid of each region containing spacing of less than 16 miles, which provided a substantial level of detail.

The team, part of a global effort called the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, or CORDEX, published its findings in Climate Dynamics.

""This is the first time that a regional climate model has been used to provide a global view of changes in monsoons,"" said lead author Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at ORNL. ""It took a great deal of time and effort to compile and analyze such high-profile, high-resolution data, and these detailed simulations would not have been possible without a significant international collaboration.""

ORNL researchers simulated the South Asian monsoon region using resources of the laboratory's Compute and Data Environment for Science and the compute cluster Eos, and the rest of the simulations were conducted at various other computing centers. The team uncovered commonalities in regional monsoon responses to increases in greenhouse gas emissions. These responses included monsoon onset delays, shorter monsoon seasons and more intense seasonal fluctuation.

The simulations predicted and compared changes that would occur in different scenarios provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, known as Representation Concentration Pathway, or RCP8.5 and RCP2.6.

RCP8.5 assumes that carbon emissions follow a ""business as usual"" scenario without policy interventions, whereas RCP2.6 is based on much lower increases in emissions with aggressive mitigation policies. Although the monsoon patterns will likely change for both RCPs, the simulations revealed that the amount of change would likely be minimal under RCP2.6 but could be significant under RCP8.5.

""If emissions are reduced based on RCP2.6 out to the year 2100, the simulations show that the long, damaging shifts in monsoon behaviors can mostly be avoided,"" Ashfaq said. ""If you look at the best-case scenario, we do still see changes, but they are insignificantly different from the typical year-to-year variation in regional monsoons that communities are already accustomed to.""

Seasons of change

Seven of the nine monsoon regions showed a gradual delay in monsoon onset with a continuous increase in global emissions, which could create wide-ranging consequences that directly affect approximately two-thirds of the world's population by the end of this century. Unlike the areas that receive relatively even amounts of precipitation in all seasons, heavily populated monsoon regions receive 60% to 70% of their precipitation during the summer monsoon season.

""The RCP8.5 simulations reveal robust delays in the start of rainy seasons that ripple through many aspects of everyday life in these regions,"" Ashfaq said. ""For example, a monsoon that usually starts in the first week of June in South Asia and West Africa may be delayed as long as 15 (days) to 20 days or even an entire month over parts of these regions by the end of the 21st century.""

Although the simulations also showed a delay in the end of the rainy season, otherwise known as monsoon demise, this shift was not nearly as dramatic as the delay in monsoon onset, shortening the length of the entire monsoon season. The researchers also discovered that affected monsoon regions are likely to see more precipitation during that period, leading to more intense rains. Conversely, the rest of the year would see longer dry periods.

This increased seasonality could exacerbate the prevalence of floods, droughts, wildfires and other extreme climate events that already pose challenges to these regions. Significant changes in monsoon behavior could contribute to outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, such as cholera, dengue and malaria.

Since agricultural activities in monsoon regions are typically timed to coincide with the periodic onset and demise of the rainy season, these factors could alter the production of rain-dependent crop yields.

""More than half of the world's arabica coffee supply is produced in Brazil, and more than 70% of the cacao used to make chocolate comes from West Africa, whereas more than one-third of rice exports come from India and Pakistan,"" Ashfaq said. ""If regional agriculture is subjected to monsoon onset delays and shorter rainy seasons, production of these types of commodities will be reduced and have a significant impact on the global economy.""

Many countries located in these regions rely on hydropower to generate electricity, including Brazil, which produces 75% of its energy via this method. Shorter monsoon seasons would not provide enough rainfall at the correct time to supply adequate power without overhauling current operations.

A delicate balance

In addition to identifying potential monsoon changes and their implications, the team also investigated the root causes responsible for these shifts.

In the absence of organized weather systems and a sustained moisture supply, the relatively dry pre-monsoon season receives only intermittent and convective rainfall, which is thermally driven. Lands in these regions get warmer every year during the pre-monsoon period, commonly reaching surface temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. The combination of convective precipitation warming the upper atmosphere and hot surface conditions warming the lower atmosphere causes disparities between warm air over the land and ocean that force the dry season to give way to monsoon rains.

However, the simulations revealed that a continuous increase in global emissions will make the pre-monsoon environment less conducive for convective precipitation, which will delay the warming of upper atmosphere and the transition from the dry to the rainy season. One key factor the researchers determined will decrease convective rainfall during the pre-monsoon period is the formation of a deeper and less saturated boundary layer -- a part of the lower atmosphere where moisture and energy are exchanged between the land and the atmosphere.

""The upward force needed to lift air parcels to their level of free convection increases with the depth of the boundary layer,"" Ashfaq said. ""And the warmer the atmosphere, the more moisture needed for convective instability, which is essential for the development of thunderstorms. Fulfilling the requirement during the pre-monsoon period is challenging because of the limited moisture supply as winds blow away from the land.""

The team will contribute their CORDEX simulations to the regional climate change chapter of the next IPCC assessment.

This research used resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility located at ORNL. The team received support from the National Climate Computing Research Center, a collaboration between DOE and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['team', 'simulations', 'season', 'effect', 'regions', 'regional', 'shifting', 'ripple', 'changes', 'seasons', 'monsoons', 'emissions', 'monsoon', 'global', 'climate']", none,none
3,3,FL-2020-000164-IND,"Kharif sowing doubles, thanks to above-normal pre-monsoon rains in central India - ThePrint",https://theprint.in/india/kharif-sowing-doubles-thanks-to-above-normal-pre-monsoon-rains-in-central-india/452730/,"Text Size: A- A+

New Delhi: Thanks to above-normal pre-monsoon rainfall in June in many states, the sowing of kharif crops across the country has more than doubled over last year.

According to estimates from the Ministry of Agriculture, the area sown this year is 315.63 lakh hectares (lha), up 104.25 per cent from last year’s 154.53 lha, because more water-intensive crops like cotton and soybean are being sown this time.

According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the country has received 22 per cent more rainfall than normal between 1 and 26 June — 165.1 mm against 135.66 mm in the corresponding period last year. Rainfall in central India, including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, was 44 per cent higher than last year.

This has resulted in reservoir storage across the country on 25 June standing at 56.72 billion cubic metres (BCM), against 29.16 BCM last year, while in central India, the corresponding figures are 17.21 BCM and 9.10 BCM respectively.

Water-intensive crops

According to Water Productivity Mapping of Major Indian Crops by NABARD, the five crops grown in India that require the most water are cotton, rice, soybean, sugarcane and wheat. Cotton in India uses the most water — 22,500 litres to produce 1 kg — with the drier regions of Gujarat and Maharashtra being its leading producers. Soybean requires 900 litres of water for 1 kg produce, and is grown primarily in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.

This year, MP received 162.3 mm of rainfall between 1 and 24 June, more than double the normal 77.3 mm, while Maharashtra received 220.4 mm compared to the usual 147.3 mm over the corresponding period. In Gujarat’s case, the corresponding figures were 106.6 mm and 71.7 mm respectively.

This has resulted in MP’s acreage for soybean increasing to 40.28 lha from nil last year, while in Maharashtra, it has shot up to 18.7 lha from last year’s 0.001 lha.

Cotton sowing has also spiked in Maharashtra to 23.772 lha as on 25 June this year from last year’s 0.194 lha, while in Gujarat, the figures are 11.67 lha this year and 5 lha last year.

Other water-intensive crops like paddy and sugarcane have also seen growth — paddy rising to 37.71 lha from 27.93 lha last year, and sugarcane inching up to 49.69 lha from 49.09 lha.

The sowing of pulses is also up to 19.40 from 6.03 lha, with arhar being grown on 9.87 lha (1.83 in 2019), urad on 2.75 lha (90,000 lha in 2019) and moong on 5.30 lha (last year 2.06 lha) of land.

Experts cautious

Bhagwan Meena, the MP-based convener of farmer body Kisan Swaraj Sangathan, told ThePrint: “The rainfall here is more than anything we have witnessed in the last 10 years. Monsoon has arrived 8 days before normal.”

However, Meena added that the rainfall has also caused a series of problems.

“Many farmers have lost their crops due to waterlogging for days in their field. My 20-acre field is still not ready to sow soybean as there has been continuous rain for the last four days in my area,” he said.

Meanwhile, Arabinda K. Padhee, country director of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, advised caution.

“The sowing of crops, especially the water-intensive ones, might increase with the early rainfall, but the yield and productivity of these crops are really dependent on the rains in July. There is a need to be really careful with the increasing sowing of these crops as both cotton and soybean are commercial crops and their prices depend on the market status, which is really unpredictable these days,” Padhee told ThePrint.

He added: “The sowing of coarse cereals and millets like ragi and jowar should be promoted owing to its nutritional value. The support price of these crops should be raised, as compared to other crops.”

4,4,FL-2020-000164-IND,Monsoonal moisture makes its 2020 debut - ABC 4,https://www.abc4.com/weather/monsoonal-moisture-makes-its-2020-debut/,"SALT LAKE CITY, Utah (ABC4 News) – Utah is closing in on the Independence Day holiday and weekend, and ironically, on par with 2020, as many of us head to the outdoors, a subtle monsoon push will move into the state.

This monsoonal moisture arrives most clearly on Friday and Saturday and will impact eastern, central and southern Utah. Weather models bring in the threat of thunderstorms south of Provo and Evanston, Wyoming for the weekend.

This initial push will increase mid level moisture, but what does that even mean? Well, the translation means we could see dry thunderstorms pop up with a lack of rain, but plenty of lightning and gusty winds. An elevated risk for fire danger will be around for the Fourth of July, and it’s noteworthy for any of us packing up the family for a camping trip to the Uintas or any mountainous area in central, eastern and southern Utah.

Keeping those eyes to the skies is critical over the holiday weekend, but it’s a great habit to get into because the start of the monsoon season in Utah indicates the start of several Utah weather phenomena. To understand what that means, we back it up a little and breakdown exactly how the monsoon season happens in the Beehive State.

The word “monsoon” actually means the seasonal reversal of winds. The seasonal change occurs in upper level winds from the polar westerlies to tropical easterlies and includes a switch from dry west winds high up in the atmosphere to moist winds from the east or southeast. Rain actually starts to the south of us over southern Mexico, when heavy rainfall starts in May and June. Rain quickly spreads north along the western slopes of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, and starts to move north. Typically, the monsoon season begins in the Southwestern United States in early July and can hold on until mid to late September.

WATCH: Weak cold front grazes Northern UT (which is why those SW winds were cranking today) and we see the #utwx models pick up the first subtle push of monsoon 💧 into UT. Monsoon season is here!

For Utah, we have a couple of key players when it comes to the monsoon, that includes the “Four Corners High” and our sources of tropical moisture. We have two different sources of tropical moisture with the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of California. The Four Corners High sets up near southeastern Utah and has a clockwise flow, which helps draw moist, humid air into Utah. We get thunderstorm development when hot, unstable air rises and with plenty of mid and low level moisture present during monsoon season, we can tap into heavy rain, numerous thunderstorms and frequently trigger severe storms and flash flooding. Utah has plenty of steep terrain and slick rock, and flash flooding can tear through slot canyons and popular landscapes throughout the state. For a visual of how this happens, you can watch the video.

It’s the time of year when Utahns flock to the outdoors, so you always want to know when we get a surge of monsoonal moisture. This weekend from Thursday through Saturday, we get some mid-level moisture and not so much low level moisture, so we can often see dry thunderstorms as a result.

While the corresponding figure for the suburbs, recorded by the Santacruz-based centre, is 11.2 mm.

Location-wise rainfall in Mumbai over the last 24 hours showed Cuffe Parade received 128.7 mm of rains, followed by Worli (114.7 mm), Nariman Point (105 mm), Dadar (105.9 mm) and Byculla (99 mm).

While major areas in the suburbs recorded up to 40 mm of rains over the past 24 hours.

“Intense rains were received in localised places in Mumbai on Monday night, followed by intermittent light to moderate showers in the south-central parts of the city. However, the suburbs received less rainfall because there was no monsoon cloud bands over the region,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

South Mumbai has reduced its rain deficit for June because of the torrential downpour over the past 24 hours and the tally stands at 524.5 mm, which is 16.4 mm short of the long-period average (LPA), the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010.

So far, Mumbai’s suburbs have recorded 395 mm of rains in June, which is 98.1 mm short of the LPA and the lowest for the month in the past five years.

IMD authorities said that the suburbs are likely to end June with a 22% of rain deficiency.

Though the city woke up to light showers on Tuesday morning, the rains stopped in a while because of a partly cloudy sky.

Millions have been forced to flee their homes in Assam after the Brahmaputra river that flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh burst its banks in Assam over the weekend here, inundating more than 2,000 villages.

“Rainfalls and runoff from northern India have caused some of the rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 70 cm (30 inches) above dangerous levels,” said Jyoti Prasad Ghosh, an official at the Bangladesh Water Development Board. “The floods could worsen further in the coming days if rains continue in Assam.”

One disaster management official in Bangladesh who declined to be named said the crisis was expected to worsen in the coming days and more than 200,000 people marooned are at risk.

“The disaster is worsening by the hour, with several hundred thousands already severely affected by the floods, worsening the COVID pandemic and crisis in the country,” said Antony Balmain, a spokesman for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

When people think of a monsoon, they usually mistake it with a typhoon or some other variation of a huge rainstorm.

In reality, a monsoon is simply a seasonal wind pattern that sweeps moisture into the desert southwest. The North American Monsoon is seasonal because it only happens during the summer months.

KOAA Weather

During July and August, the hottest months of the year, a strong high-pressure system can set up above and east of the four corners region.

At the same time, intense daytime heating in the desert southwest can produce a low-pressure system often referred to as a monsoon low.

KOAA Weather

Moist air from the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and even evaporating plants in the Sierra Madres will rotate north between these two pressure systems.

It's this constant north moving air mass that leads to the North American Monsoon.

Monsoons are famous for bringing heavy rain and scattered, unpredictable thunderstorms to the southern Rockies and desert southwest.

How does it affect southern Colorado?

Daniel Forster

While not as directly affected as Arizona, southern Colorado will usually see at least some effect of a monsoon every year.

Typically during a monsoon pattern in Colorado, we see near-daily thunderstorms develop over the mountains and push east into the plains through the afternoon.

Storms will often start over the mountains between 12 and 2 p.m., drift east into the larger towns on I-25 between 1 and 4 p.m., and move east through the plains in the early evening.

KOAA Weather

Since monsoon season develops over the summer months, most cities along the Front Range tend to see their wettest months in July and August.

Monsoon fueled thunderstorms tend to be frequent, numerous, and often come with heavy rain. This is critical to fighting fire danger by keeping our grassy and forest fuels saturated.

Does a monsoon bring more hail?

While monsoon fueled thunderstorms can easily produce hail, Colorado tends to see the most severe hail reports a month before monsoon season.

KOAA Weather

This graph shows the number of severe hail reports (1 inch or greater in size) for all areas east of the Front Range from 1997.

On top of heat and moisture, June tends to see a more active jet stream which results in a severe weather ingredient called wind shear.

July tends to come in as the second most active month for severe hail, with one of the major factors being an increased number of monsoon-driven thunderstorms. The more storms, the better the chance one or two can drop large hail.

KOAA Weather

The same trend is seen through El Paso County. June is our most likely month for severe hail, with July as our second most likely month.

Monsoon patterns typically come with a lack of wind shear, which makes it difficult for thunderstorms to stay strong to severe.

Because of this, while hail is certainly a worry for storms in monsoon season, flash flooding is often a much more common severe threat.

Do I need to prepare for monsoon season?

Larry Marr

Unless you live in a flood-prone area, the only people who need to prepare for monsoon season are avid campers and hikers.

Monsoon fueled thunderstorms tend to form over the mountains between 12 and 2 p.m. These storms grow quickly and can bring heavy rain, strong winds, and lots of lightning.

Be sure to check the forecast and try to get any big hikes started early, that way you can be off the mountain or at least below treeline in the early afternoon before storms develop.

On days with elevated severe storm risks, try and find covered parking at work or in a parking garage to keep your car safe from hail.

NFR has already deployed personnel and materials for the safety of more than 6,400 km of railway tracks spreading over parts of West Bengal, Bihar and the Northeastern states like Assam, Tripura, Manipur, etc, under the jurisdiction of NF Railway.

“The monsoon season is quite challenging for this railway. Railway serves a difficult terrain close to foothills of Lower Himalayan ranges, carved by turbulent streams, fed by heaviest rainfall reaching up to about 7,000 mm in a year. The southwest monsoon period normally starts from May 15 and continues till October 15 every year except in the Lumding division where the monsoon period starts from April 15. Due to this heavy rainfall landslides, rain cuts in embankments, overflowing of bridges, etc, occur frequently. But for NFR, safety of passengers is the first priority and this cannot be compromised in any way,” NFR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Subhanan Chanda said.

For this, NFR has formulated a detailed strategy for the safety of railway tracks. As part of preparations before the monsoon collection of materials at sensitive places, cleaning drainage systems, cleaning of waterways of bridges, marking danger levels in bridges etc., have been completed. While all preventive measures have been taken, NFR has also deployed patrolling teams to continuously watch more than 6,400-km of tracks in its jurisdiction for any defect that may arise due to heavy rainfall.

“Around 815 patrol teams, each consisting of two patrolmen have been deployed to keep the railway tracks safe. This team patrols the track on the basis of rainfall alert issued by the Meteorological Department. These patrolmen are equipped with the latest and state-of-the-art equipment i.e. GPS tracker, luminous jacket, raincoat, and separate waterproof trousers, safety helmet, safety shoe high, powerful search/ flashlights etc. The team is on full track patrol round the clock. Mobile phones have been made available with each patrol team to provide information to the nearest station about any situation that may affect the normal movement of trains. In addition to patrols, stationary watchmen have also been appointed on sensitive areas i.e. sites prone to landslides, bridges where water is flowing near danger levels, etc,” the NFR CPRO said.

Sometimes, bridges are swept away, embankments are broken and landslides occur despite the adoption of all precautionary measures. To address such a situation, materials like boulders, sand, sandbags, various bridging equipment are kept ready both on the ground and loaded in wagons at important places to cope with such situation and in the least possible time for restoration work. The Monsoon Reserve Stock of this year includes Boulder (on wheel- 199 wagons, on the ground – 90750 cum), Unscreened Shingles/ Quarry Dust (on wheel – 56, on ground- 7966 cum), Service Girder- 28 nos of different spans, CC Crib- 5499 no, UC Span (Span-2, launching nose -2, Span with launching nose -1) and RS Joists- 275 nos which will be utilised at the time of emergency.

“It is hard to predict and avoid natural calamity, but NFR is fully prepared to face the challenges posed by very heavy rainfall in this region during monsoon so as to ensure all-weather connectivity and safety of our esteemed passengers,” Chanda added.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.eastmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/train_1.jpg,"['rainfall', 'situation', 'posed', 'face', 'patrol', 'railway', 'heavy', 'tracks', 'nf', 'rains', 'challenges', 'safety', 'nfr', 'ready', 'bridges', 'team', 'monsoon']", ,none
11,11,FL-2020-000164-IND,Monsoon Season Could Kick Into Gear This Week - WeatherNation,https://www.weathernationtv.com/news/monsoon-season-could-kick-into-gear-next-week/,"Share:

Right on schedule, it looks like the annual monsoon across the Southwest is getting ready to kick back into gear.

A return of monsoonal moisture is likely across the Southwest later this week, potentially bringing drought relief to a part of the country that has been hit hard by drought and wildfires in recent months.

The monsoon is in reference to the annual reversal of winds, and the southerly wind direction frequently draws up moisture-laden air from the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. The result is needed rainfall for a typically parched part of the country.

It typically starts in mid-summer, and that looks to be the case this week.

While showers and storms aren’t expected to be particularly widespread, both Wednesday and Thursday could both feature scattered showers and storms, and they’ll be mainly concentrated in New Mexico.

Of course, this is a part of the country that especially needs the rain. After a paltry monsoon season last summer and early fall, a fruitful monsoon would be especially welcomed this year.

Pockets of extreme and severe drought are in place in some of the most monsoon-dependent areas, including northern New Mexico and southern Colorado.

While it’ll be hot in Albuquerque, New Mexico most of this week, daily shower and storm chances will creep back into the picture this weekend, and that could last into next week as well.

More than a million people have been affected by flooding in northeastern India, where the death toll over the past week rose to 13, authorities said on Monday.

Flooding is an annual phenomenon in India's northeast, claiming hundreds of lives each year.

""The flood situation is grim in Assam. More than a million people have been hit by this year's"" rising waters, Assam Disaster Management Authority's state project coordinator, Pankaj Chakravarty, told AFP.

The state was first hit in mid-May when pre-monsoon rains arrived, causing floods that killed 11 people. Another 20 died in landslides caused by days of incessant downpours.

The floodwaters receded after a few weeks, only to rise again on June 22 at the start of the annual monsoon season.

Almost 29,000 people, mostly in rural regions, have been evacuated from their homes and brought to relief camps, officials said.

About 70 percent of Assam's World Heritage-listed Kaziranga National Park—home to two-thirds of the world's remaining one-horned rhinos—was submerged by the floods.

Park director P. Sivakumar said three hog deer died when they were hit by vehicles while trying to escape the inundation.

""With the water level rising, the animals are rushing to higher areas. Many of these animals cross the highway,"" Sivakumar told AFP.

The monsoon is crucial to replenishing water supplies in South Asia, but also causes widespread death and destruction across the region each year.

(File) The IMD has forecast an increase in the rainfall activity over Mumbai in the first week of July. (File)

After a break of a week, rain in Mumbai commenced over the weekend. In 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Sunday, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory recorded 27.2 mm of rainfall, which falls in the moderate category. Colaba station recorded 2.2 mm of rain. It, however, did not rain on Sunday.

The IMD has forecast an increase in the rainfall activity over Mumbai in the first week of July. The intensity of rain is likely to increase around July 3 and 5, it said.

As per IMD’s 24-hour forecast, the city will witness thundershowers at a few places and moderate rainfall on Monday. Its district rainfall forecast says that for the next four days, light to moderate rain is expected in the city and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Meanwhile, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg are very likely to receive heavy rain at isolated places on Monday and Tuesday.

So far, there has been only one intense spell of rain on June 18 in Mumbai – after the IMD declared monsoon onset in the city – leading to 41 mm rain in the suburbs and 44 mm in south Mumbai. After that only sporadic showers, mostly during the night or early morning, have been witnessed.

The southwest monsoon officially covered Mumbai on June 14, but the city is yet to witness a continuous downpour.

The total rainfall recorded so far since June 1 is 344.4 mm, which is 105.7 mm below the monthly average. According to the state-wise rainfall distribution between June 1 and June 24, Akola and Yavatmal districts have recorded deficient rainfall.

The southwest Monsoon had covered the entire country on Friday. Though the formation of cyclone Nisarga in the Arabian Sea posed a threat and had potential to delay the monsoon progress from Maharashtra onwards north, it was not realised, said IMD.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/06/rain-3.jpg,"['imd', 'increase', 'rain', 'mumbai', 'forecast', 'monsoon', 'week', 'mm', 'recorded', 'rainfall']", ,none

Some parts of Maricopa County could see thunderstorms on Thursday evening, although James Sawtelle, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Phoenix, said Thursday morning that it will primarily hit the southeastern and southwestern corners of the state.

Storms developed over Pinal County, the Weather Service tweeted about 7:30 p.m.

People driving on Interstate 8 between Casa Grande and Gila Bend should watch for hazardous driving conditions due to strong winds, dust and heavy rain.

""We could see slight chances of some blowing dust moving onto the Valley, sort of during the rush hour and early evening period, due to some isolated thunderstorm activity, mainly south of the Valley,"" Sawtelle said

Even without a storm, the Phoenix area saw a colorful sunset full of pinks and oranges characteristic of monsoon season.

These weather patterns are especially common in the early week of July due to monsoon conditions ramping up, Sawtelle explained. The increased moisture present during the course of the monsoon season increases the chances of afternoon and evening thunderstorms.

The closer you get to Tucson, the more your chances of getting caught in a dust storm will increase, Sawtelle said, though the chances are still fairly low.

The National Weather Service in Tucson warned of possible flash flooding, including near the burn scar of the Bighorn Fire in the Catalina Mountains and other areas affected by the still-burning wildfire.

""There is a remote possibility that we could see a renegade isolated storm make it up a little bit further north, but not a really good chance of that,"" Sawtelle added.

The high temperature at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport was 104 degrees on Thursday, according to the Weather Service.

The heat will return starting Friday with a high of 106 before climbing above 110 over the weekend and into the beginning of next week.

Things will cool down again during the second half of next week with a high of 103 degrees expected to start next Thursday.

The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted, ""Hot weather will linger into next week. Stay hydrated!""

Intense monsoon activity is now likely to begin over central India and the western coast as IMD issued an alert to authorities to remain prepared for any emergencies.

The region covering eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, and Sikkim have been receiving very heavy and extremely heavy rain since June 26. According to IMD’s weekly weather report released on Wednesday, Assam received 104%, Meghalaya 141%, Sikkim 304%, and Bihar received 99% excess rain over the past week from June 24 onwards. The rain has triggered flooding in Assam, landslides in Sikkim, and created a flood-like situation in parts of Bihar.

IMD on Wednesday issued an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rains in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Konkan, Goa, central Maharashtra from Friday to Sunday. Orange alert implies that authorities should be prepared for any related emergencies.

National Weather Forecasting Centre head K Sathi Devi said the intensity of rain has reduced marginally over the northeast and eastern India but rain will continue for a few days. “Intense and widespread rains will start in central India including Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, and parts of the west coast like Konkan, Goa and coastal Karnataka.”

Devi said weather stations in the northeast have been recording extremely heavy rains (over 20 cm) since last week. “This was a result of orography [topography of mountains] and the moisture laden south-south westerly winds blowing over the region.”

The monsoon trough shifted to the north around June 26 with a convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from Bay of Bengal over the northeast and eastern India. Now the trough is gradually moving back to its normal position.

IMD bulletin said a cyclonic circulation is lying over south Gujarat and another over eastern Uttar Pradesh and its neighbourhood in lower and mid-tropospheric levels. “Under its influence, fairly widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely along the west coast, Gujarat and interior Maharashtra during the next 5 days,” it said.

It added extremely heavy rain is also very likely over Konkan and Goa on Friday and Saturday and over Madhya Maharashtra on Saturday.

R K Jenamani, a senior IMD scientist, said there will be a high convergence of strong moist westerly and south-westerly winds from the Arabian sea very likely along western coast till Sunday and over northwestern plains and central India from Friday. “All conditions are favourable for intense monsoon activity over the west coast and central India. Monsoon progression and rains have been very good so far.”

The country over the last month has received 15% excess rains. The monsoon accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall and is critical to the country’s agricultural sector. At least 700 million people are dependent on agriculture in India for their livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country, where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its population.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/07/02/Pictures/weather-rain-in-mumbai_1632a80e-bbdb-11ea-b411-fb55c265b659.jpg,"['west', 'eastern', 'intense', 'rain', 'heavy', 'pradesh', 'rains', 'central', 'coast', 'set', 'india', 'monsoon']", ,flood

This year, the Covid-19 pandemic has added to the pre-existing fear of heavy rainfall and the ability of local administration to help those with limited to no means of survival.

Last year, 43,043 houses and 1.25 lakh people living in Sangli city were affected, according to Nitin Kapadnis, commissioner of Sangli, Miraj, Kupwad municipal corporations.

“We have made announcements through social media and local news channels, asking residents to evacuate when the water level crosses 25 feet as that is when it entered houses last year. We will install displays in every area, as a warning, if and when the water starts rising,” said Kapadnis.

People have either turned to their relatives in other villages or started booking rooms on rent in nearby areas like Vijaynagar, Kupwad, and Miraj.

“We do have temporary shelters planned in government schools and if need be, local wedding halls will also be roped in. But even so, with social distancing norms in place, we can accommodate around 15,000 people,” said Kapadnis.

The residents in low-lying areas are bracing themselves for a possible impact of monsoon and are aware of the water-level at which they need to start moving. However, the fear of the virus is adding to their anxiety.

“We received the notice a couple of weeks ago. The corporation officials had come here to serve the notice. Because of the last year’s experience, it is being used as a preventive measure - emptying houses when the water level hits 20 feet. One of them warned of police action if houses are not empty if and when the water hits 20 feet. The water came to our colony after the Irwin bridge mark crossed 40 feet. And they are asking us to leave at half the mark,” said Dattatray Shinde, a man in 40s, who is into cattle and dairy business. He lives in the Magarmach colony. The colony residents lived the flood days in 2019 in a nearby Ganpati temple last year when floods ravaged the city.

“Most of the houses were 15 feet deep under water last year,” he recalls.

“Our house is located at a height and the canal water level is clearly visible from here. The corporation officials who came to serve notices installed a camera and a sensor at our house. The water entered our house when it reached 45 feet. They have asked us to leave at 20 feet. They said they will provide for those who have no means at all. We are scared of the virus too,” said Imran Hajilala Mujawar, a resident of Suryavanshi plot, Jamwadi. Mujawar owns a grocery store in the area.

“They gave us notice that our houses need to be emptied when the water reaches 20 feet. He told us to get a room or go to our relatives’ places. Everybody is scrambling to find accommodation.

“Assam is reporting floods. Bihar is also in a flood-like situation. Cherrapunji, which is known to receive a lot of rainfall around this time of the year, has recorded up to 55 cm in a day. This pattern of continuous heavy rains will gradually reduce from Tuesday. While from Thursday, torrential rains will increase in central India and over the north-west parts of the country from next Sunday, ” said Dr. Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The eastern-end of the monsoon trough continues to run along the Himalayan foothills with the convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over the north-east and eastern India.

This is likely to cause widespread and very heavy rain in many parts of north-east India in the next four-five days. There may be extremely heavy rain, measuring over 20 cm in a day, in the next 24 hours, according to IMD.

Heavy rains are expected in Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim during the next five days. Widespread rainfall is also expected over Madhya Pradesh for the next five days and over Chhattisgarh and the Vidarbha region on Monday and Tuesday.

There will be widespread rains in the west coast also this week, IMD said in its bulletin.

However, rains will be subdued over north-west India and the western Himalayas.

The Central Water Commission (CWC) has warned of an above-normal flood-like situation in Dharamtul, Brahmaputra, Dhubri, Goalpara and other parts of flood-prone Assam.

A severe flood-like situation is also likely in Assam’s Kopili and Kamrup.

The restoration operations at Baghjan gas well in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, which reported a blowout – an uncontrolled release of gas and oil – on May 27 and later caught fire on June 9,were hampered last week for at least three days because of inundation of low-lying areas, while the well continues to leak gas and oil condensate, according to an Oil India Limited (OIL) spokesperson.

The well is set to resume its operations gradually.

From June 1 to 28, Sikkim and sub-Himalayan West Bengal have received 56% rainfall, Bihar received 92% of excess rains, and Assam and Meghalaya received an excess of 34% of rains.

Monsoon this time covered the entire country on June 26 – a good 12 days in advance.

Usually, monsoon covers the country by July 8. But from last Friday an intense monsoon phase in the north-east and eastern India started.

Monsoon rains in the country are 20% excess of the long-period average (LPA) as of Sunday -- 36% excess over central India; 8% excess over north-west India; 4% excess over southern peninsula and 20% excess over eastern and north-east India.

LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010, which is 88.06 cm.

IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year at 102% of LPA.

A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people are dependent for a livelihood.

But dry conditions will likely persist for much of the week. On Tuesday, portions of eastern New Mexico will have red flag warnings for critical fire weather, thanks to low humidity and high winds.

................................................................

Albuquerque will cool off midweek, with a high of 86 degrees on Tuesday and 89 on Wednesday.

On Thursday, dry thunderstorms with lightning are possible for southwestern New Mexico. Albuquerque will have a high of 91 degrees Thursday and Friday.

Temperatures trend upward toward the end of the week, as do chances for rain.

Albuquerque will have a high of 92 degrees Saturday and 91 Sunday.

The region will start to see moisture from the eastern Pacific, and upper-level high pressure will begin to build over the Southwest.

“That’s where we’re looking at the possibility of our monsoon kicking in for the summer,” Overpeck said.

To help gauge the potential of the North American monsoon, meteorologists examine sea surface temperature differences in the Pacific Ocean, short-term weather prediction models and long-term climate models.

Climate change appears to be playing a role in how much rain New Mexico receives from the monsoon, NWS meteorologist Andrew Church said.

“Over the last 10 to 15 years, we have seen a more volatile polar jet stream that has been drying us out more than in the ’80s and ’90s, when we had wet monsoons which were more frequent,” Church told the Journal.

Dry westerly winds often accompany the storms, Church said, and the Four Corners high-pressure system is getting stronger.

“You have to go higher up in the atmosphere before thunderstorms can develop,” Church said.

Summer outlooks predict near-average precipitation across most of New Mexico.

“It’s fickle, and highly dependent on location,” Church said. “We haven’t seen a robust monsoon in 14 years now.”

June 30 (UPI) -- As June winds down, the Southwest monsoon is in full force across India, and rainfall totals are climbing to staggering levels as rising floodwaters leave thousands stranded.

During a five-day stretch from June 23-28, Cherrapunji, located in a region of India to the northeast of Bangladesh, reported 77.51 inches. Around 22.52 inches of that total fell in the last 24 hours of that stretch, stated AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jim Andrews.

As of Friday, the leading edge of the monsoon advanced through the country and moved into Pakistan.

Widespread rainfall totals of 8 or more inches have been measured along the western coast of India, across the center of the country and into northeastern regions since the monsoon arrived throughout the month, according to the India Meteorological Department.

In addition to impressive rainfall totals, runoff from northern India has caused multiple rivers across Bangladesh to rise over 30 inches above dangerous levels on Monday, Bangladesh Water Development Board Northern division chief engineer Jotiy Prasad Gosh said.

Gosh added that the rise in water levels flooded 19 upazilas, or regions, leaving 200,000 people stranded and thousands of hectares of farmland submerged under floodwaters.

Many in the region are still waiting for relief as officials process the requests for help from the upazilas, reported New Age Bangladesh.

The wet season will remain in full swing across the region as occasional showers and thunderstorms persist in much of India and Bangladesh each day through midweek. However, parts of extreme northwestern India will remain largely dry, including New Delhi, which had the onset of the monsoon last week.

The areas most at risk for flooding through the middle of the week will be areas that have already been hit hard by monsoon rain this month.

Heavy thunderstorms are expected to unfold in parts of northeastern India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan each day this week, with some locations potentially receiving 12 inches of rain through Friday.

Meanwhile, drenching downpours will remain across southwestern India from around Mumbai to western Karnataka in the coming days.

The heaviest rain in southwestern India will fall from near the coast into the Western Ghats.

Daily rainfall totals of 2 inches to 4 inches are expected for areas that receive the heaviest rain into the end of the week. An AccuWeather Local StormMax of 8 inches will be possible, especially in the rugged terrain.

By the end of the week and into the weekend, a monsoon low can develop in northeastern India and lead to locally heavy rainfall in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. This low may eventually bring the return of rain to National Capitol Region later in the weekend and early next week.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi_com/2341593563075/2020/1/d547e95d7836e0ee4591947bd3b88a60/v1.5/Torrential-rain-produces-severe-flooding-in-India-strands-over-200000-in-Bangladesh.jpg,"['rainfall', 'totals', 'bangladesh', 'torrential', 'severe', '200000', 'rain', 'strands', 'produces', 'inches', 'region', 'week', 'india', 'monsoon', 'western', 'flooding']", ,flood

Pagasa warned residents of the said areas that flash floods or landslides are possible due to moderate to at times heavy rains.

Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy with chances of isolated rain showers due to localized thunderstorms.

Pagasa said it does not expect a tropical cyclone or weather disturbance near or within the Philippine area of responsibility in the next two to three days.

Maharashtra received 21 per cent above rainfall in June, while Marathwada outperformed the other meteorological sub-divisions in the state with 57 per cent surplus rainfall.

Even though cyclone Nisarga, which hit Raighad district on June 3, caused significant damage to property and livelihood of people living along coastal districts, the associated rainfall eventually contributed to the surplus in the state in June.

The monsoon then entered a weak phase before activity picked up last week.

The rainfall figures for June are Madhya Maharashtra (48 per cent), Konkan and Goa (3 per cent) and Vidarbha (-1 per cent).

The India Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Satara districts between July 2 and July 4.

‘Winds accompanying lightning can aggravate hazards’

Strong winds at the time of thunderstorm and lightning events can aggravate destruction and damage even leading to greater loss of life, said Soma Sen Roy, scientist, Nowcast Department, National Weather Forecasting Centre at IMD, Delhi.

She was speaking on ‘Thunderstorm, Duststorms and Lightning’ as part of a webinar series organised by the Ministry of Earth Sciences on Tuesday. Last week, lightning strikes killed more than 100 people in Bihar. According to Roy, lightning and thunderstorm events are prone to occur in the June to September period over Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and northeastern regions.

Higher casualties are linked with more farmers in the fields who are involved in sowing activities. “Predicting thunderstorms poses great challenges as there are still gaps in sharing forecast information to the last person. Along with lightning, winds can hit projectiles and cause multiple hazards.”","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/06/monsoon-9.jpg,"['phase', 'cent', 'weak', 'picked', 'surplus', 'maharashtra', '21', 'monsoon', 'thunderstorm', 'week', 'entered', 'rainfall', 'lightning', 'received']", ,none

Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo GettyBELLINZONA, Switzerland—Allegations of rape, killing, and cannibalism made the man an outlaw who victims say roared like a lion before striking his prey, and yet the chances were that he would outrun justice.A quarter-century after his alleged crimes, Alieu Kosiah is now in a European detention facility awaiting a decision on his fate, facing up to 20 years in prison.Kosiah fled recriminations at home and was living a new life in a picturesque region of Switzerland, one of the world’s wealthiest nations, when officials finally apprehended him.He is accused of multiple murders and serial rapes back in Liberia, West Africa. The trial came to life thanks to seven plaintiffs, six of whom traveled to Europe to face the man they say once terrorized them. The seventh victim, who The Daily Beast is calling Teta, alleges she was kidnapped and raped by Kosiah, who she says removed a rifle slung across his shoulder and pulled a knife from his belt before he repeatedly violated her.The Terrifying Tale of the Killer Cannibal Who Walked FreeTeta, who gave birth to a premature baby during the trial, provided evidence via videolink from Monrovia, as the child was too fragile to travel. The court asked Teta how she felt towards Kosiah all these years later. She feared him, she said, and buried her head in her hands. “He’s a killer and rapist,” she said. The judge asked if she was waiting for an apology. “I can’t accept his apologies,” she replied. On a subsequent call, when asked how she found the courage to testify despite her trepidation, she told The Daily Beast, “I want justice. He should be judged; he should be tried.”Even once he was arrested—after some two decades of living peacefully in Europe—the prospect of this trial seemed remote. Evidence in such a case is hard to pull together when crime scenes have been destroyed, and witnesses are long since dead. But Swiss prosecutors eventually indicted Kosiah after five years of criminal investigations.According to lawyers for the plaintiffs, the case is monumental because it represents many firsts in the fight toward accountability for crimes committed in Liberia’s back-to-back civil wars from 1989-2003. “It’s the first war crimes trial for sexual violence [in Liberia], for child soldiers, the first time a Liberian will be convicted or acquitted for war crimes, and the first time there will be a judgment for war crimes in front of the Swiss Federal Criminal Court,” Alain Werner, a Swiss lawyer representing several victims in the case, told The Daily Beast. The court is expected to issue a verdict next month.One of the witnesses, a tall man in his fifties wearing a striped polo shirt and jeans, said he watched as a close friend’s chest was sliced open before his heart was removed and served to rebels, including Kosiah, on a metal plate.This man, whose name is withheld to protect him from reprisal when he returns home to Lofa County in northern Liberia, told the Daily Beast that it was breath-taking to face Kosiah again in the flesh. “When you see him, it’s all you can do not to…” he said, as his voice trailed off. “You can’t imagine the brutality.”It was 1994, early in the rainy season, and the then 15-year-old Teta was tending to her family’s rice crops when the fighters arrived in her remote village in Lofa County. The war was raging, and members of the ULIMO faction had come to overtake the area from Charles Taylor’s group. The fighters took some of the men, including Teta’s father and brother, to the town center, where they tied their arms behind their back until their elbows touched. They ordered the women to cook for them and gathered all the rice and oil in the village; Teta fetched water and cleaned the dishes. The rebels, Teta observed, responded to a superior named “General Kosiah.” The General, who was 19, commanded the civilians to form a convoy to transport goods and ammunition, likely toward the Guinean border.Teta thought only of her survival, and when she saw an opportunity, she fled into the bush. She later made her way to the town center, where she’d last seen her father and brother, only to find them slaughtered. For several days, she hid in the bush without food. When the hunger had sucked the life out of her, she ventured to a nearby village to replenish herself. She noticed a group of rebels smoking and chatting in front of a house. A small boy, whose gun dragged behind his body, approached. “Come,” she recalled him saying. “If you don’t come, I will kill you. It’s the General that’s calling you.”Teta says she followed the boy to the General, the same one she’d seen days earlier in her village, named Kosiah. He wore military clothing, his eyes were bulbous, and his skin was darker than hers, Teta noticed. “You will be my wife,” she recalled him saying. Teta says she was ordered into a nearby house and locked in the bedroom. That night, she says, he returned and took off his boots, clothes, and weapons. Teta claims he then took her body for himself, raping her every few hours. His body splayed on top of hers, and when she cried, she says he threatened to kill her. The following day, when the door was left unlocked, Teta escaped. She was naked, had no shoes, and while she’d never menstruated before, she was bleeding. Kosiah denies the charges.Liberia Rethinks Its Past in Wake of Charles Taylor War-Crimes VerdictSexual violence during Liberia’s back-to-back civil wars was endemic. The true scale is still unknown. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated that over 70 percent of sexual-based violations were perpetrated against women and girls, who were used as “bush wives” and domestic servants, among other abuses. Still, more than fifteen years since the conflicts concluded and took the lives of an estimated 250,000 people, civil war-era sexual violations carry a deep stigma, shrouded in a culture of shame.“The impunity for war crimes, in general, had an impact on ongoing impunity for crimes of sexual violence in Liberia,” said Emmanuelle Marchand, the head of the legal unit at Civitas Maxima, a Swiss-based organization that investigates war crimes in Liberia. “Liberia is still a country where violence against women is integrated,” Marchand told The Daily Beast.In 2009, Liberia’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission released a report recommending establishing a special war crimes tribunal. Still, Liberia has yet to hold a single perpetrator responsible for atrocities committed during its two civil wars. Some well-known warlords have taken up high-level government positions, and others have resettled in third countries, building families and businesses. The few cases involving war crimes have occurred in third country courts, in the U.S. and Europe, where perpetrators were found living.Kosiah, a former ULIMO commander who Teta said raped her, is now at the center of the first war crimes trial for atrocities committed during Liberia’s first civil war.In February, six Liberian men traveled thousands of miles by plane from Monrovia to Geneva and then by train to a tranquil town in the Swiss alps called Bellinzona, an Italian-speaking region near Italy's border. They stayed in a modest hotel in the historic town center, where rice was hard to come by, but pizza was in abundance. Some had never seen the snow and found the cold biting. Each was there as a complainant to testify before a panel of three Swiss judges at the Federal Criminal Court about their allegations against Kosiah. The seventh complainant and only woman, Teta, whose name has been changed for her safety, appeared by video stream from the U.S. embassy in Monrovia. She had given birth just days before. The fact the complainants had made it this far was a feat in itself.In 2013, Alain Werner, the Swiss lawyer who runs Civitas Maxima, an organization investigating crimes on behalf of Liberian victims to prosecute perpetrators in national courts, received a tip: a former ULIMO commander was living near Lake Geneva. Werner had never heard of Kosiah, but given the ULIMO’s extensively documented crimes committed in Lofa County between 1993 and 1995, he was confident there would be a case. Werner called their sister organization in Monrovia, the Global Justice and Research Project, whose investigators started digging.The American Warlord Guilty of Torture“It could have been that we got the name [Kosiah], we did the investigation on the ground, and nobody heard about it. In this case, that didn’t happen,” Werner said. “We got the name. We did an investigation. Crimes came back,” he told The Daily Beast. In the summer of 2014, Werner and partner lawyers filed a criminal complaint against Kosiah on behalf of seven Liberian victims. Swiss authorities arrested Kosiah in November that year, and he has been in pre-trial detention since.Much of the material evidence was damaged or destroyed following the first civil war, and key witnesses were killed or since died. Some witnesses feared retribution and refused to participate in the trial. Then, a global pandemic prevented willing victims and witnesses from traveling. When, finally, the logistics were in place, the Swiss courtroom held the hearing at reduced capacity. The complainants, their four lawyers, and two Swiss prosecutors sat at a distance with masks. Kosiah, who is now 46, sat slumped at the front of the room, wearing a white-collared shirt and casual jacket. His lawyer, Dimitri Gianoli, accompanied him.On the first day of hearings, a man, Mr. S, who grew up in Zorzor, in Lofa county, took the stand. He had a soft, round face and wore a collared shirt under a padded jacket. “Kosiah ordered a girl to be carried to his house,” he said. “If he called, you had no option but to follow. You could not refuse him,” the man, who would have been 15 at the time, told the court. For Werner, the strength of the case lies in victims corroborating patterns of crimes across Lofa County. “Kosiah randomly took a woman to rape her, and the woman managed to escape, in a completely different town [from Teta], miles away,” Werner said.At some point, Kosiah abruptly stood up and erupted in shouting. “It’s been six years,” he said, referring to his time in detention. “He lied,” as he pointed to Mr. S., who began trembling. Mr. S. took a break in the courtroom hallway, convening with other plaintiffs. “He’s very rude,” one man said of Kosiah, who had been shuffling through stacks of paper, elbowing his lawyer and whispering into his ear as the plaintiffs testified.Others who took the stand said they were certain Kosiah was the same person who committed the alleged crimes more than two decades earlier—they recognized his bulging eyes, his dark skin, and his anger. One was a former child soldier who, at the age of 12, said Kosiah had recruited him as his personal bodyguard; another said he saw Kosiah order his brother’s execution; and another said Kosiah and his men desecrated the corpse of a civilian and ate his heart.Between 1993 and 1995, Kosiah was a commander with the ULIMO-K as it took control of much of Lofa county, which became the site of gruesome and debased attacks against civilians.As the conflict ravaged Liberia in the early ’90s, the NPFL had targeted members of the Krahn and Mandingo ethnic groups, whom they saw as sympathizing with Samuel Doe’s government. According to news reports, Kosiah, then a teenager, had escaped to neighboring Sierra Leone when his family members were viciously murdered. There, Kosiah joined ULIMO-K, a Mandingo-based faction that took up arms against Taylor’s group, and rose through its ranks to become a commander.According to Swiss prosecutors, during this period, Kosiah violated the laws of war by committing rape, recruiting and using child soldiers, ordering pillages and forced transports, murdering civilians, and committing acts of cannibalism.When, in 1997, Taylor was elected president and the first war concluded, Kosiah fled to Switzerland, where he applied for asylum, claiming to be Guinean. His application was denied, but he later obtained permanent residence through his wife, who lived in the beautiful, mountainous canton of Vaud. The trial was made possible by a 2011 Swiss law that allows the prosecution of non-nationals who committed serious international crimes on foreign soil, also known as the principle of universal jurisdiction. The case is the first war crimes trial to occur outside of a military court in Switzerland; it is also the first, anywhere in the world, to adjudicate rape as a war crime in Liberia, setting a meaningful precedent. (The trials against Mohammed Jabbateh and Chuckie Taylor, the son of Charles, in the U.S., addressed rape during the war in the context of charges for immigration fraud and torture, respectively.)Kosiah claims he is not guilty of any such crimes, as he was not present in Lofa County during the relevant period. He also says that witnesses and victims of these crimes are conspiring against him and lying. Kosiah’s lawyer did not respond to requests for an interview.Teta’s lawyer, Zeina Wakim, flew to Monrovia from Geneva to accompany her on the day she took the stand from the embassy in the second week of hearings. The Swiss ambassador traveled from Abidjan, in Côte d'Ivoire, to ensure the process went smoothly; embassy officials were present, as were Swiss federal police. Teta, whose face is striking, wore a bright orange blouse and long braids. She described to the court, in thick Liberian English, that she had never been educated but that she recognized Kosiah. “It’s him who’s looking at the camera. I know him too good,” she said.After she escaped the house where she said Kosiah raped her, Teta crawled into the bush, following a road toward Guinea. She bled for three days and slept under tree roots to shield herself from the rain. She planted seeds along the way, telling people that if her mother came looking, she could find her in Guinea. Teta made it across the border and cooked for a local family who, in exchange, allowed her to sleep on their kitchen floor. Her mother, by some miracle, got word. She, too, ventured into Guinea, traveling from village to village, searching for Teta. A year or so later, they reunited. More than a decade passed, and when they heard a woman, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, became president in Liberia, they went home.Teta told me she still suffers physical pain and “feels bad” when she puts her mind back to the war. Today, Teta takes care of her mother, who is elderly, and her children, who taught her English. She is happiest when she’s outside farming rice, pepper, and cassava. On Sundays, she rests and attends church. The event that most occupies her time these days is caring for her baby girl, so tiny that Wakim thought they might lose her during the court procedure. Once the baby is strong enough, she’ll carry her as she farms. The baby, she said, she named Justice.Read more at The Daily Beast.Get our top stories in your inbox every day.

But how many strikes of lightning did we see and why was there no rain with that storm?

The Bighorn Fire was started naturally by a dry thunderstorm over Oro Valley that produced more than 25 lightning strikes in under 30 minutes. But no rain poured down in the area that day.

""The reason why they are dry is because the dew point hasn't reached the sweet spot needed to deliver us rain,"" Chief Meteorologist Matt Brode said.

According to the Tucson National Weather Service, storms like these are common in the weeks leading up to the monsoon.

""We can still get thunderstorm development,"" Ken Drozd of NWS Tucson said. ""But since there is not a lot of lower-level moisture, those storms will not produce a lot of rainfall at the surface.""

Brode continued, ""We can actually have good thunderstorms. We can have lightning coming out of the clouds. We can have thunder and gusty winds. But if you have very dry lower levels of the atmosphere despite the fact that it might be raining up high, it's just going to evaporate before it reaches the ground.""

The west wind Southern Arizona saw and the mountains also contributed to the thunderstorm development.

""During the hot part of the day, you get air to rise,"" Drozd said. ""It's going to be push up going through the valley and against the mountain and lifting upward.""

That upward lift also caused more lightning to develop in the storm. Lightning is caused when a storm is so tall that ice crystals start to develop in the clouds.

Those crystals then rub against each other creating static electricity. If you get enough static, that could cause a lightning strike.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://quincy-network.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2020/06/Untitled-design-13-4.png,"['30minute', 'going', 'rain', 'bighorn', 'dry', 'tucson', 'lightning', 'valley', 'strike', 'started', 'thunderstorm', 'strikes']", ,none

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, however, that the hills of North-West India (Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and adjoining plains may continue to witness subdued activity during the next five days though things would change for the better thereafter.

Strong spell for coast

Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is forecast to continue along the West Coast during this period before the proceedings get amplified with raised intensity, precipitating isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Konkan, Goa and Coastal Karnataka as yet another monsoon pulse unfolds.

Scattered to fairly widespread rainfall is the call for Central India, with isolated heavy falls being forecast over Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh during these five days and over Vidarbha on July 2 and 3, the IMD said. A similar outlook is valid for East India, thanks to a trough and a cyclonic circulation.

The North-South trough runs down from Norh-East Bihar to North Coastal Odisha, and is topped off by the circulation over East Uttar Pradesh. This combo feeds in huge moisture from the Bay of Bengal and would rain it down heavily over East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, hills of West Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya.

Truncated monsoon trough

Meanwhile, the crucial monsoon trough running diagonally across North India, the single-most important monsoon feature over North India, ran down on Monday from Amritsar, Ambala, Delhi, Fursatganj, Jehanabad, Dhanbad and Digha before its south-eastern end dipped into the Bay of Bengal.

Its north-western end has to ideally shift further south from South-West to Rajasthan to convert itself to a fully productive channel for low-pressure areas from the Bay to move in and ensure equitable rainfall across and time and space for the farming heartland. This may take a while to happen.

According to the IMD projections, this may be delayed until July 7 when a low-pressure area is expected to form over the Head Bay. It is forecast to move along the monsoon trough across East India initially to Central India, before proceeding to Rajasthan along a more southerly than usual track.

Heavy over Central India

This could bring heavy to very heavy rainfall over Central India, West India and adjoining North-West India, all across the West Coast, Gujarat and South-West Rajasthan by the end of the first week of July. Extended outlook for July 4-6 says fairly widespread to widespread rain/thundershowers with isolated intense to very intense falls for northern parts of the West Coast, North-East India and northern plains.

Scattered rainfall/thundershowers are likely over Central and adjoining East India, Lakshadweep and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands during this period.

Meanwhile, strong winds have been warned over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the run-up to the emerging new active phase of the monsoon.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['rainfall', 'await', 'early', 'west', 'bay', 'rain', 'east', 'heavy', 'trough', 'pradesh', 'spell', 'central', 'coast', 'india', 'monsoon']", ,none

(Representational) Further, nearly 100 talukas have already recorded rainfall between 126-250 mm (nearly 5-10 inch) during this monsoon season, the highest in the last five years. (Representational)

Two weeks since the south west monsoon arrived in Gujarat, Kutch and Saurashtra regions have received around 25 per cent of the average rainfall witnessed during this period. The southwest monsoon officially arrived Gujarat on June 14 covering districts of Valsad, Navsari, Tapi, Dang and Surat.

Kutch district has already received 25 per cent of the average rainfall during monsoon, which is the highest in the last five years – in 2017 it had received 15 per cent of the average rainfall. The Saurashtra region has received 22 per cent of its season’s share.

Further, nearly 100 talukas have already recorded rainfall between 126-250 mm (nearly 5-10 inch) during this monsoon season, the highest in the last five years.

Subsequently, comparing the rainfall data till June 30 for the last five years, this year the least number of talukas – 32 — received 0-50 mm rainfall, which is the lowest rainfall bracket. While 172 talukas received 0-50 mm rainfall in 2016, the highest in last five years, it was 116 in 2018.

Attributing the early rains in Kutch and Saurashtra regions to the Cyclone Nisarga witnessed in the first week of June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that it was also conducive for the entire state.

“Due to the Cyclone Nisarga, a lot of moisture could come to the state and especially to the Saurashtra and arid Kutch regions, which are bereft of moisture. Also, due to this, Gujarat was quite conducive and thus rainfall was active in most parts of the state,” said Manorama Mohanty Additional Director of IMD’s Ahmedabad region.

Kutch and Saurashtra regions that cover almost half of the state geographically are expected to continue to add to its receipt of rainfall as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts rainfall for these regions, throughout this week.

“Due to a cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat now and neig-hbourhood between 1.5 km and 4.5 km above mean sea level tilting towards the southwest with height is expected to bring moderate rainfall with thunderstorm in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch along with north and central districts,” Mohanty added on the forecast for this week.

On Tuesday, the 131 talukas that received rainfall included almost all districts of Saurashtra and Kutch. Kalavad taluka in Jamnagar district recorded the highest in the state (till 4 pm) — 73 mm in barely two hours from 12 pm till 2 pm.

Among the five regions the state has been divided into, the South Gujarat has received the lowest rainfall this season — 9.01 per cent. This is the region’s second lowest share in the last five years — in the monsoon of 2016, it barely received 4 per cent of the average rainfall.

The North Gujarat region has received 10.50 per cent of its monsoon share while the East Central region 14.15 per cent, which is also its highest share in last five years.

The state has recorded 122.24 mm, an average of 14.71 per cent rainfall till June 30, second highest after 2017, the year when the state witnessed one of its worst floods, devastating the North Gujarat districts of Banaskantha and Patan. In 2017, the average rainfall received till June 30 was 15.43 per cent.

The IMD has issued a heavy rainfall warning for districts of North Gujarat including Banask-antha and Patan, South Gujarat including Valsad, Navsari and Surat and in Saurashtra region namely Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Junagadh, Porbandar till July 5.","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/06/monsoon-1.jpg,"['average', '25', 'cent', 'saurashtra', 'regions', 'state', 'highest', 'monsoon', 'gujarat', 'mm', 'kutch', 'rainfall', 'received']", ,none

Dozens die each year while working in the country's highly lucrative but poorly regulated jade industry, which uses low-paid migrant workers to scrape out a gem highly coveted in China.

The landslide struck early on Thursday close to the Chinese border in Kachin state after a bout of heavy rainfall, the Myanmar Fire Services Department said on Facebook.

""A total of 113 bodies been found so far,"" Myanmar Fire Service said in a Facebook post.

A local police officer said search and rescue efforts had been suspended due to heavy rains.

""The jade miners were smothered by a wave of mud,"" an earlier statement from the Fire Service said.

The workers were scavenging for the precious gemstones on the sharp mountainous terrain in Hpakant township, where furrows from earlier digs had already loosened the earth.

Photos posted on the Facebook page showed a search and rescue team wading through a valley apparently flooded by the mudslide.

Open jade mines have pockmarked Hpakant's remote terrain and given it the appearance of a vast moonscape.

Fatal landslides in the area are common, and the victims are often from impoverished ethnic communities that are looking for scraps left behind by big firms.

Watchdog Global Witness estimated that the industry was worth some $31 billion in 2014, although very little reaches state coffers.

Northern Myanmar's abundant natural resources — including jade, timber, gold and amber — help finance both sides of a decades-long civil war between ethnic Kachin insurgents and the military.

The fight to control the mines and the revenues they bring frequently traps local civilians in the middle.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2020/07/02/thumbs/800x531/44111.jpg,"['dead', 'search', 'terrain', 'services', 'myanmar', 'northern', 'service', 'rescue', 'landslide', 'state', 'mud', 'jade', '100', 'workers']", ,flood

Skymet Weather Team

Heavy to very heavy rains are expected over Mumbai and suburbs between 03rd and 05th July. A downpour to the tune of 100mm or more in 24hr has given amiss earlier on a few occasions in June. The situation seems to be building up now with a large probability of receiving heavy rains commencing 03rd and lasting for over 48hrs. 05th July happens to be a full moon and the sea surge and high tide in the afternoon may add to the ferocity of rains, a day prior and even later.

July is the rainiest month for Mumbai with a huge average of 841mm. The month is also expected to cover the shortfall of over 100mm in June and therefore a daunting task ahead. The past records testify that any major deficiency of monsoon rainfall by end of July becomes difficult to catch up in the latter half. High hopes are pinned on the current spell, followed by at least two more in the due course, by fag end of July.

Currently, a cyclonic circulation is marked over Saurashtra and adjoining the Arabian Sea. This feature is building up the surge of strong westerly winds striking the Konkan coast, resulting in heavy rainfall. It may continuously pour for long hours and breaks in between could be short and few.

Heavy rains along with strong winds could cause disruption in communication and connectivity. With waterlogging and inundation of low-lying areas, commuting services are going to be hampered. The heavy spell may as well affect rail, road, and air traffic simultaneously. Mumbaikars need to stay on high alert and exercise the utmost caution for the next three days.

34,34,FL-2020-000164-IND,11 rain centres to come up in Delhi during monsoon - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/11-rain-centres-to-come-up-in-the-city-during-monsoon/articleshow/76719295.cms,"Image used for representational purpose only

NEW DELHI: The monsoon is here and along with it comes the opportunity of replenishing dwindling groundwater of the capital.

Delhi Jal Board has issued orders for setting up 12 rain centres to facilitate adoption of rainwater harvesting systems in the monsoon season. While eleven of these units will be located at the district level to provide guidance and technical expertise on installation of such systems, five teams will work on the central level.

A senior DJB official said that a central rain water harvesting cell has already been functional at Varunalaya, the Jal Board headquarters in Jhandewalan. “In order to educate and facilitate the public at large, district-level rain centres are being established in each revenue district. People from neighbouring areas can also seek guidance for installing RWH systems,” an official added.

In August last year, DJB had tweaked the rules to make it mandatory for all properties, with an area of 100sq metres and above, to have functional rainwater harvesting systems, with strong penal provisions for defaulters.

The compliance, however, has been way lower than expectations. While the initial deadline to create the RWH systems in houses was in March 2020, DJB officials said the Covid pandemic had forced them to consider a fresh deadline. “These eleven centres will be headed by an engineer with attending officials helping the residents with the technical know-how, information related to financial assistance and to provide details of executing agencies empaneled with the Jal Board,” an official explained.

The city receives 617mm of annual average rain and this precious resource can be used to recharge the depleting water-levels in the capital, as highlighted in a recent report submitted by the Central Ground Water Board in the apex court.

It is not that rain centres are a new concept in the city. Several years back, three centres were opened in RK Puram, Dwarka and Lajpat Nagar — which managed to do the job for a while but could not yield decent results.

Experts point out that while the policy of providing incentives and penalties encourages people to fall in line, poor enforcement has failed in delivering the original intent of these centres. Waivers, amnesties and delays in deadline for compliance are rampant.

DJB had already given relaxation of troublesome provisions like using activated charcoal as filtration medium and bore-well for making the water harvesting units. “Repeated postponement of deadlines and lax enforcement are to be blamed for the city performing poorly in ground water conservation,” an official point out.

Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department on Thursday predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in Mumbai and adjoining coastal districts, and issued an orange alert for the next two days.

An orange alert implies that authorities should be prepared to handle any situation arising out of severe weather conditions.

Ratnagiri district, which bore the brunt of cyclonic storm Nisarga last month, is likely to receive extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday, while Raigad will receive similar downpour on Saturday, senior director of IMD Mumbai, Shubhangi Bhute, said.

The restoration, however, has been challenging following intense monsoon rains.

During June, Raigad recorded 545.5 mm rain, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Though it was 22% deficient for the month, it had the third-highest rainfall among all districts in Maharashtra. The district has recorded 791 confirmed cases of Covid-19, 298 recoveries, and 17 deaths so far.

According to the district administration, electricity had been restored across 1,700 of 1,976 villages in Raigad. “Non-electrified villages are mostly across Shrivardhan, Tala, Mhasla and Mangaon tehsils, which were worst-affected due to the cyclone,” said Nidhi Choudhari, district collector and magistrate, Raigad.

“The administration has been working on a war-footing for relief and restoration activities but intense monsoon rain combined with inaccessibility to electricity poles in marshy areas or mangroves has made it even more challenging for us. Also, we are keeping a close watch to ensure residents follow social distancing and safety measures during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Chaudhari.

Overall, 87% electricity restored by the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd. (MSEDCL) across other 11 talukas apart from the four most affected ones. A total of 5.5 lakh of 6.35 lakh consumer’s power supply is currently in place, said Choudhari. “Teams from other districts arrived during the third week of June for restoration efforts. However, due to different topography and climate they have faced difficulties,” she said.

Choudhari said 88,000 people had been paid relief for their damaged houses in the district while 1418 of 2136 water supply schemes had been activated through electricity restoration. “Remaining areas are using generators for water supply. Hence, people aren’t facing inconvenience,” said Choudhari.

“Residents of nearby villages have either been given generators or they have managed to purchase one among three to four households. However, there is very little availability of kerosene to power them. This is still leading to a shortage of drinking water but the situation is better than before,” said Rajendra Kudekar, resident of Tala town in Mangaon.

Dattatreya Karanje, resident of Aravi village, Shrivardhan said, “It is now 28 days since there is no electricity in our village. We have been provided with a few generators that are mostly used for pumping water from bore wells. The local administration said it will take one more week to restore power. We are used to the dark and the dim candle lights.”

Alibag resident Kunal Salunkhe said, “More than relief from the state, quick intervention by residents, non-government bodies, and assistance from relatives from cities like Mumbai and Pune during the Covid-19 pandemic have helped normalise the situation. People have built more studier rooftops but unfortunately, they are still made using tin.”

The administration said they had restored network connectivity with 435 of 548 mobile towers in Raigad. “Telecom operators have powered their towers with the help of generators,” said Choudhari.

Sandeep Mendharkar from Mhasala said, “Network availability is still low. There are certain spots near villages and towns where there is a network, and this can be identified by a small crowd located there through the day across villages in Mhasla.”

The collector said relief amount had been paid for all deceased, injured citizens, livestock, and the compensation process for crop losses is underway. “In all, 12,000 hectares of crop or horticultural losses were recorded in the district. Crop compensation takes more time as land records have many names and all have to either share their account details or give consent for the transfer of relief amount to one of the occupants,” said Choudhari.

Kudekar said this was the reason why long queues were spotted at banks located in small towns. “The only functioning bank is Bank of India, and villagers from surrounding areas are queuing up to claim compensation. Some have come and returned almost five to six times until they receive their money,” he said.

Meanwhile, for the 1.6 lakh tree fall cases during the cyclone, Choudhari said all roads had been cleared. “Wood of trees cut in the wadis (farmlands or hamlets) belongs to people. Directions were given to use the wood of trees fallen by local panchayats for shamshan ghats (burial sites). For major highways and roads, the tree barks are yet to be cut as in cut into logs. Those cutting branches and taking away are using it for fuel in rural areas,” said Choudhari.

CYCLONE NISARGA: WHAT HAD HAPPENED?

Nisarga, classified as a severe cyclonic storm, made landfall at Diveagar, located between Shrivardhan and Murud between 12.15pm and 12.30pm on June 3 as it passed over Raigad district following the onset of the southwest monsoon. The wind speed during and after landfall had touched a maximum of 120 kmph leading to rooftops of several structures blown away, tree fall and power line damages, and a communication blackout across 80% of Raigad. While 1.4 lakh houses were damaged, 5.2 lakh structures were partially damaged. In addition, 1.6 lakh tree fall incidents and 16,000 electricity infrastructure damages was recorded. The district administration had calculated ₹200 crore in property destruction, including ₹40 crore losses due to power infrastructure damages. It also led to issues such as the drinking water crisis as without electricity, people were unable to pump water from bore wells.","Fri, 03 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/960x540.jpg,"['electricity', 'water', 'relief', 'power', 'cyclone', 'raigad', 'villages', 'lakh', 'normalcy', 'administration', 'tree', 'hit', 'crawls', 'district']", ,none

The downpour and resultant flooding has also affected operations at Baghjan – where a leaking oil well of the state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) caught fire on June 9. Adjoining areas in Tinsukia district have been badly hit by floodwater and the accident site has been inundated, affecting the efforts to douse the blaze and cap the oil well that had been spewing natural gas and oil condensates uncontrollably since May 27.

“All connecting roads to the OIL’s oil well site have been submerged with floodwater. Bridges have been damaged. At many places, water is flowing over the road with knee to waist high. OIL’s operational areas are heavily inundated,” an OIL release said.

“Floodwater has entered the debris area, Kill Pump area and CMT Water Pump area, making these unsafe for carrying out further operations. The India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall till June 30,” it added.

Earlier on Sunday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah discussed the Assam flood situation with Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal over phone and inquired about the incidents of landslide in different parts of the state.

“Shah assured all help and support from the central government in dealing with the floods, relief and erosion of rivers while asserting that the central government stood together with the state government in these difficult times,” the Assam government said in a press briefing.

Delivered Thursday.

Why Is India Banning China’s TikTok?

Welcome to Foreign Policy’s South Asia Brief. This week: Why India banned 59 Chinese apps, South Asia records 1 million coronavirus cases, dangerous floods hit Bangladesh, and a review of the new novel A Burning.

If you would like to receive South Asia Brief in your inbox every Thursday, please sign up here.

Why India Banned TikTok

On Monday, India’s government announced it would block the use of 59 mobile apps because they were “engaged in activities … prejudicial to [the] sovereignty and integrity of India.” While New Delhi’s press release didn’t mention Beijing by name, the list of 59 apps—each run by Chinese companies—made clear that it was the intended target.

The blocked software includes the video-sharing app TikTok, which has been downloaded an estimated 600 million times in India; UC Browser, an internet browser that uses very little data and is popular among Indians using low-cost smartphones; and other well-known apps such as Shareit, Baidu, Weibo, and WeChat.

India cited section 69A of its Information Technology Act in its explanation for why it took action. But according to Indian law, it could have kept the decision confidential. Taking a public stand against China was the point. After last month’s deadly skirmish with Chinese troops, New Delhi has faced domestic pressure to come up with a robust response. Its options on trade were limited and potentially self-defeating, while military options were even more dangerous. China’s technological exports were a natural arena to turn to—and one in which India could actually impose some damage.

Monday’s decision is momentous on its own, but it will also likely spur tit-for-tat actions between the world’s two biggest internet markets in terms of users. It may even set a precedent for other countries looking to regulate or ban Chinese tech firms.

The impact on China. India is China’s biggest external market for apps such as TikTok and UC Browser. While India represents a relatively small source of revenue for Chinese apps, it is still its fastest growing major market. As Indians grow richer, average revenues per user will increase: India’s digital advertising market is expected to grow by 26 percent this year, CNN reports. New Delhi’s actions close off this market. There may be further action on other Chinese software and hardware, especially 5G products, as Indians become more aware of the potential security threats of Chinese technology.

Just this week, for example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission officially designated Huawei and ZTE as national security threats, effectively barring U.S. internet providers from using federal subsidies to buy their equipment.

The impact on India. New Delhi’s decision will hurt Indians, too. While the move will please the country’s jingoistic media and those calling for revenge after last month’s border skirmish, banning TikTok will hurt thousands of Indian content creators who depend on the Chinese app for their livelihoods. Even so, Indian companies such as Roposo, a local alternative to TikTok, may see a surge in interest and new users. Chrome is still the most popular browser app in India, and companies such as Google may also benefit from the blocking of UC Browser.

A new era of techno-nationalism? While the immediate impetus for India’s actions comes from the border clashes, the app ban itself is not that surprising given the broader trend of countries trying to safeguard their citizens’ data. As more Indians come online through cheap smartphones and low-cost data plans, personal data will become more valuable to tech firms and governments alike. Given how intertwined China’s biggest companies are with the state, it was only a matter of time before countries such as India imposed their own Great Firewalls.

If anything, India may have left it too long, given the inroads made by apps such as TikTok, and the fact that the most popular smartphone brands in India are not just companies such as Huawei and Xiaomi, but also less Chinese-sounding brands such as Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus. (Vivo is the title sponsor of the popular Indian Premier League cricket series, a relationship that may well now be cut short before next year’s tournament.)

The question now is how Beijing might retaliate.

What We’re Following

Coronavirus update. South Asia’s countries now have more than 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases between them. India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are among the top 20 countries in the world with the most cases, in fourth, 12th, and 18th places respectively. As shown above, the region’s countries have been doubling their total cases between every 14 and 20 days. And with testing rates still low, aggressive contact-tracing is next to impossible. Nonetheless, the region is reopening for business, as leaders begin to accept that some form of herd immunity may be the only solution for people who depend on daily labor.

Dangerous monsoon flooding in Bangladesh. Thousands of hectares of farmland in Bangladesh lie submerged from floods triggered by monsoon rains. A disaster management official told Reuters that the crisis could worsen, with more than 200,000 people marooned and more rainfall expected this week. The crisis was exacerbated after the Brahmaputra River burst its banks in the neighboring Indian state of Assam last weekend, flooding thousands of villages in the area.

Russia’s Afghanistan “bountygate.” After revelations last weekend that U.S. President Donald Trump may have received intelligence showing that a Russian spy unit was paying the Taliban bounties to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, there has been fallout in Washington. While Trump says he was not actually briefed on this intelligence, a growing number of voices on Capitol Hill are calling for action. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Trump’s failure to act was a “dereliction of duty,” while Trump’s former National Security Advisor John Bolton said the news merited “a very serious response.”

It’s worth pointing out that that Russia’s involvement in Afghanistan should be no surprise. Russian night vision scopes have previously been found in Taliban hands, and U.S. commanders in the region have long admitted that Moscow was arming the Taliban. As Sajjan Gohel and Allison Bailey wrote for Foreign Policy this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin has worked to enhance ties with the Taliban for years, “with the purpose of expanding its strategic interests in Afghanistan. … Once NATO and U.S. forces leave, Russia will once again have an opportunity to step in.”

Turbulence ahead for PIA. Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has been banned from operating in the European Union for the next six months. The decision came after Pakistan grounded 262 airline pilots from PIA and other domestic airlines with allegedly “dubious” licenses—a finding that emerged after an investigation into a deadly plane crash in Karachi last month.

Question of the Week

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan faced criticism this week for using the word “martyred” to describe the killing of a terrorist. Who was he referring to?

A) Osama bin Laden

B) Ayman al-Zawahiri

C) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

D) Baitullah Mehsud

Scroll down for the answer.

What We’re Reading

Megha Majumdar’s A Burning is one of the most talked-about novels this summer, and for good reason. As I wrote in a review of the book, Majumdar’s compelling, timely, and propulsive book “is soaring up the global bestseller lists thanks in part to its resonance with this summer of discontent and despair, a time when public trust in leadership and Big Tech is dwindling. One reason why A Burning should appeal to readers unfamiliar with India is that the novel is not just a critique of modern Indian society but a universal parable on inequality.”

Read the full review here.

And the Answer Is…

A) Osama bin Laden.

The former al Qaeda leader was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan in 2011, a decade after he masterminded the 9/11 attacks. Discussing the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in a speech in parliament this week, Khan said, “I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him.” Opposition leaders in parliament strongly objected to Khan’s remarks: One called bin Laden the “ultimate terrorist” who “destroyed” Pakistan.

That’s it for this week.

Rain brings down the pollutants and floating toxins from the air and when this dirt comes in contact with the skin, it can cause rashes and allergies. Due to increased humidity during monsoons, your skin may also lose the ability to retain moisture and turn eczematic. So, it is important that you follow a proper skincare routine to make the most of this rainy season. Also Read - Popular Skin-Care Tools: Benefits of GuaSha and Face rollers

However, your normal skincare routine won’t work now. During the rainy season, you should always keep your skin away from dampness.

Tips to prevent skin issues in the rainy season

Wash your face 2-3 times a day with a soap-free cleanser to remove excess grime and oil that can clog your pores. Using a soap-free cleanser will help clean your face without stripping off its essentials oil.

Exfoliate regularly to get rid of the dead layers on your skin cells but do so gently. Do not skip the toner. Too much sweating can cause skin pores to open up. Always use a toner after cleansing to help shrink these pores. Opt for an alcohol-free toner with antioxidant ingredients like green tea and glycolic acid. This will not only help tighten enlarged pores, but also control blemishes and acne. Regular toning can also help even out your skin’s pH balance and enhance your natural glow.

Exposure to humid weather can leave the skin dry. Use a nourishing moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated and soft. If you have oily skin, use moisturizers that are water-based.

Even though it is cloudy, the sun’s UV rays can still harm your skin. So, don’t forget to use a sunscreen with a good SPF.

You may not feel thirsty when it rains, but you still need to drink at least 8 glasses throughout the day to stay hydrated. Humidity can make you sweat a lot and lack of moisture can make your skin look pale and dull.

Things you shouldn’t do during the monsoon

Don’t take a hot shower as it can make your skin capillaries weak and damage your skin.

Don’t be in a hurry while cleansing your face. If you don’t cleanse your face properly, bacteria can invade your skin and trigger breakouts.

If you have sensitive skin, stay away from artificial jewelry during the monsoon. The humid weather can increase the risk of a breakout.

Avoid clothes made of synthetic fabric as they do not allow skin pores to breathe.

Most of the skin diseases are contagious. So, do not share your personal belongings, especially your make up kit, with anyone ever.

Things you should do during the monsoon

Include good fats in your diet as they can help repair damaged skin and retain moisture.

Always go for minimal make-up so that your pores can breathe.

Keep a lip balm handy so that you can use it anytime to moisturize your lips.

Wear waterproof footwear like sandals and floaters to let your feet breathe. Wearing closed footwear can make your feet sweat, which can increase the risk of infections.","Mon, 29 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://st1.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Monsoon-1-655x353.jpg,"['tips', 'care', 'season', 'issues', 'skincare', 'face', 'cause', 'good', 'help', 'pores', 'skin', 'read', 'prevent', 'toner', 'rainy']", ,none

New Delhi: Locust swarms that wreaked havoc in farmland and cities like Rewari, Jhajjar and Gurugram in Haryana over the weekend have entered areas of Uttar Pradesh, the leading sugar producing state in the country.

The swarms, spread across 3-5 sq km, had ravaged crops near Gurugram on Saturday but had spared Delhi.

They have been hitting various districts of western UP and the Bundelkhand region in the last 48 hours, prompting alerts in several districts such as Agra, Kasganj, Azamgarh, Chitrakoot and Jhansi.

Authorities fear a serious threat to crops in these regions as the Kharif sowing is in full swing due to favourable monsoon rainfall.

“Due to wind direction from west to South-east direction, the locust swarms crossed over to UP and MP from Haryana instead of entering Delhi,” K.L. Gurjar, deputy director at Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), told ThePrint.

“This locust swarm from Haryana has split into 3-4 smaller swarms with one batch of locusts moving to Agra and Kasganj while a big flock is expected to move towards other parts of western UP like Chhota Agra, Badaun and Etah threatening crops in these major sugarcane producing districts in UP.

“Multiple sightings of smaller swarms have also been reported in Bundelkhand area, which borders Madhya Pradesh,” Gurjar added. “The swarms are being controlled by pesticide spray through vehicle-mounted sprayers, fire extinguisher vehicles and drones before they spill over to other nearby states threatening soybean and cotton crops.”

Crops under threat

Farmers in western UP and parts of Bundelkhand, where the swarms are headed, mainly grow sugarcane, rice, pulses, cotton and soybean during the monsoon season between June and September.

If not contained, the locust attack particularly may impact sugarcane crop in Uttar Pradesh, which constitutes 45 per cent of the sugarcane sowing area of India.

In 2019-20, sugarcane crop was grown in over 26.79 lakh hectares of land; the state’s sugarcane industry is estimated to be worth about Rs 40,000 crore. It is also the main source of income for almost 35 lakh farming families and is the backbone of various other industries such as alcohol, sanitiser, ethanol, rectified spirit and other value-added chemical industries.

A Union agriculture ministry official who did not want to be named told ThePrint, “The locust swarms, if not contained on time, can diversify into other areas in smaller groups, making it difficult to tackle them with limited resources. The current swarm is in different zones of UP and other bordering states and is likely to last for at least 14-20 days depending on measures taken.

“This year, at least 4.8 lakh hectares of farmland has been ravaged by the locust swarms. The latest swarms, if not controlled, can lead to a loss in hundreds of crores by not only destroying and delaying Kharif crop but also major horticulture produce such as fruits and vegetables in Northern India,” he added.

The official said several more such severe locust invasions are likely to happen in July as there are reports of heavy breeding across the Horn of Africa and the Iran-Pakistan border.

Resources in favour of Rajasthan, Punjab & Gujarat

While the country has been witnessing waves of locust invasions since April, a major part of the resources to combat the swarms have been deployed in the border states of Rajasthan, Punjab and Gujarat from where the invasions have occurred so far.

This, however, has left the majority of inland agrarian states to fend for themselves. Teams from Rajasthan have now been moved to Haryana and UP to help in the locust control operations.

The state governments of Haryana and UP have resorted to deploying tractor mounted sprayers and fire tender vehicles for locust control in farmlands.

“Spraying of pesticides is being done by vehicle-mounted sprayers and vehicles of the fire department,” a UP agriculture department official told ThePrint.

“Farmers have also been asked to make loud noises by beating ‘thali’ and other utensils in case it is time for authorities to reach them because if they allow the swarms to settle down over the farms then all the crops will be wiped out.

“Meanwhile ground control has been dispatched from Nagaur and Jaipur in Rajasthan to join the operations in UP along with drones from Jaisalmer,” the official added. “Until then, sirens of the police vehicle and smoke will also be used to chase the locusts.”

According to ratings agency Crisil, the predictions of a good and widespread monsoon as has been made by the Indian Meteorological Department augers well for the rural farming sector and therefore, for makers of farm equipment like tractors. ""Despite a 37% on-year decline in April and May combined, tractor volume will likely be barely 1% below last fiscal’s level, in sharp contrast to a double-digit decline expected for the rest of the automobile industry,"" it says.

Crisil further adds that this, combined with lower raw material costs and strong balance sheets, indicate stable credit outlook for tractor makers this fiscal.

The onset of monsoon across India has been swift this year. The entire country was covered by Friday, June 26 - 12 days ahead of normal pattern. This HT report notes that the last time the advance of the monsoon was this early was in 2013, when it covered the entire country by June 16.

For varying reasons, timely and widespread monsoon comes as great news for the Indian economy amid recent months of lockdown-related blues. The blues in the overall automotive sector, however, are likely to prevail. Several auto makers have highlighted that while demand in rural sector may recover quicker, cities remain a source of concern. Earlier this month, Crisil had also predicted sales' volume in the Indian passenger vehicles' segment - including exports, will likely fall by between 22% and 25% in fiscal 2021.

An active monsoon resulted in surplus rain in Jharkhand in June, the first month of monsoon.

Met department statistics revealed on Tuesday that at the end of June the state had recorded 202.4mm, against a normal of 199.9 mm, a surplus of one per cent.

Last year in June, the state had recorded a meagre 89.6mm against a normal of 200mm, a deficit of 55 per cent.

In 2018, June ended on a deficit of 37 per cent while in 2017, the June deficit stood at 38 per cent.

Statistics revealed that between 2010 and 2016, June had ended on a deficit note due to a delayed arrival of the southwest monsoon and its weak spell in the initial few weeks after the onset.

This year, the southwest monsoon arrived two days early in Jharkhand on June 13, when it was facing a 24 per cent rain deficit.

After a good shower show and heavy rains in several districts due to an active monsoon, the deficit rain converted into rain-surplus days.

Since then, the surplus figures kept increasing till 30 per cent around June 22.

The figures witnessed a gradual decrease later as the monsoon became weak over Jharkhand as the trough shifted towards north. On Tuesday, the surplus stood at one per cent.

Statistics revealed that 11 districts out of 24, including Palamau, East Singhbhum, Garhwa, Bokaro, Chatra, Giridih and Ramgarh, recorded a rain surplus, while the remaining 13 districts were facing marginal deficit rainfall.

Weathermen predicted a good shower show in the first week of July.

Ranchi Meteorological Centre also issued a warning of heavy rain in northern and central Jharkhand for three days from July 3.

“We are expecting a good spell of rain in the first week of July due to a cyclonic circulation over Chhattisgarh, coupled with an active monsoon trough,” said S.D. Kotal, the director of the Ranchi centre.

The Patna Meteorological Centre also predicted a good spell of monsoon rain in July.

As many as 38 persons, including 15 females, have been killed in various natural disasters across the country since the onset of monsoon.

According to statistics updated by the Ministry of Home Affairs, at least 2009 households were directly affected by disasters which caused economic loss worth around Rs 133 million. The disasters, mainly the landslides, floods and inundation resulted in damage or destruction of 84 houses or huts.

Major disasters that claimed the lives include landslides, floods, lightning and fire, mainly in the Tarai and hilly districts.

The Meteorological Forecasting Division had officially announced the arrival of monsoon in Nepal on June 12, two days later than the normal onset date of the rainy season.

“Monsoon activity has gained momentum, leading to rain-induced disasters. Therefore, we appeal to everyone to take necessary precautions against disaster events,” Meteorological Forecasting Division advised. MFD has forecast light to heavy rain with thunder and lightning at many places of the country for the next three days.

“Monsoon trough line is now located close to Nepal, bringing more rain. Heavy rainfall may increase the water level in many rivers, leading to inundation and landslide. Therefore, we would like to appeal to all to maintain high alert against the possibility of natural disasters,” read a weather forecast bulletin released by MFD today. It has also forecast obstruction of air and road transport due to bad weather conditions.

More than 120 persons were killed and property worth tens of millions of rupees damaged in natural disasters last year.

The country receives an average of 80 per cent of annual rainfall during the monsoon. The average annual rainfall in Nepal is 1,600 mm, but it varies from place to place depending on climatic conditions.

Running at 12,000 cubic feet/second (5,000 cfs in 2011) Manitoba Infrastructure, under the advice of government and private engineering firms has lost confidence that the dam will hold.

Residents in the Oak River and Rivers areas report rain amounts in some areas closer to 10 inches over the two big rains.

article continues below

At 8 p.m. on Canada Day, the province called for a voluntary evacuation of about 40 families and all livestock immediately downstream of the spillway.

If the Rivers dam gave way, a wall of water could rush down the narrow valley. Minister of Infrastructure Ron Schuler emphasized in a news conference at 1 p.m. on July 2, the evacuation advice is “out of an abundance of caution.”

The Reeve of Riverdale conceded the loss of his home at 1:30 a.m. when water topped the sandbags.

Highway 25 at the Little Saskatchewan bridge below the spillway is now closed as erosion has taken place, despite MIT’s efforts.

Throughout the area, at points of stress such as along the spillway, MIT has dumped stone to protect infrastructure.

A good sign, Schuler reported, “The water flowing down the spillway is like glass.” A muddy flow would indicate that turbulence was eroding the ground around the spillway, but engineers who are monitoring the spillway 24/7 say that has not occurred as of midday July 2.

Downstream at Brandon, Schuler said Brandon has put in a plug. A temporary dike has been constructed where Grand Valley Road joins 18th St.

Some Brandon residents have already suffered huge flood damage. The only way into Brandon is on Hwy 1.

The public is asked to stay out of the Rivers area. Circumstances can change quickly the minister emphasized and MIT/emergency crews are at work.

Meanwhile, throughout the entire waterway, from Minnedosa, Neepawa and on to Branndon, Portage and Winnipeg, Emergency Measures Organizations are on alert.

MIT is watching the sky and hoping forecasted rain will stay away.

The municipal authorities claim that compared to the original plan, the pre-monsoon desilting of major nallahs and rivers has reached 116 per cent with 2.94 lakh metric tonnes of silt removed from major nallahs. The Mithi river, which was the cause of major flooding in 2005, has also been desilted properly.

However, the Leader of Opposition in the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) Ravi Raja believes that the desilting process has been hampered due to the lockdown and only up to 30 per cent of the work has taken place. Since the city receives maximum rains in July, the people of Mumbai should brace for severe flooding, he cautioned.

The whole of Mumbai city has roadside surface drains of about 2,000 km. The underground and lateral drains measure 440 km.

Raja, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of MCGM, told BusinessLine that he has surveyed majors nallahs in the city and based on his assessment only 30 per cent desilting has been done. Therefore, the figure of 116 per cent declared by MCGM Commissioner IS Chahal needs to be explained further, he said. Every year, the process of cleaning is held for three months but still it gets flooded in the city, he added. But this year the contracts were awarded in February and the actual work started in March, but then the lockdown happened.

The contract labourers required for tough jobs started returning to their hometowns. Then how was this work achieved, he asked?

He said that rather than floating big contracts before the monsoon, MCGM should ask the contractors to keep the nallahs, small rivers and stormwater drains clean round the year; only then can the rain water movement remain obstruction-free and there would be no flooding in the city. The sites in the city where major civil works for metro rail is taking place is also expected to flood, Raja claimed.

Additional Municipal Commissioner (Project), P Velrasu, in a WhatsApp message said that MCGM contractors mainly used heavy machinery for cleaning and desilting of rivers, major and medium nallahs. So, they did not face any problem in cleaning. Labour is intensively used in minor nallahs. The work of cleaning them is taken up by ward offices. There are some issues but progress is satisfactory in all except five municipal wards. For metro rail works, a special meeting was convened at the level of the Chief Secretary and instructions were given to keep their sites safe from the monsoon perspective.

BusinessLine also reached out to MCGM Commissioner IS Chahal about the status of desilting and the claims made by Raja, but till the time of going to press there was no response from his office.","Fri, 03 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/pb9o3e/article31968149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BL03MUMBAIFLOOD,"['city', 'municipal', 'greater', 'cleaning', 'original', 'desilting', 'rivers', 'mumbai', '116', 'mcgm', 'plan', 'work', 'major', 'nallahs', 'flooding', 'premonsoon']", ,none

Express News Service

CHENNAI: Tonnes of plastic waste is piling-up near river mouths in Chennai posing serious threat to aquatic life. With the entire state government machinery busy with the containment of coronavirus spread,

there isn't proper clean-up leading to the crisis-like situation.

A visit to the broken bridge area near Adyar Estuary will tell you how grave the situation is. A large portion of the estuary surface and its river bed is covered by plastic debris waiting to make their way into

the sea.

Pet bottles, parcel containers, wrappers, plastic bags, disposed face masks and gloves are found at the river bed. The situation is equally bad near the Cooum river mouth and Kovalam river mouth.

A city-based artist, B Gowtham, a young eco-warrior who created a majestic whale lying on the sands of Besant Nagar Beach using thrown away plastic bottle caps, said: ""I feel the per-capita consumption of

plastics has increased during the lockdown with people preferring to order online lot more food and groceries. The parcel material that is used consists of mostly plastic, which is adding to the problem.""

Gowtham, who designed corona helmets and autos for traffic police to spread awareness, said the general public needs to act responsibly. ""Taking special permission, I undertake 'Walk for Plastic' daily in my

locality and collect approximately 250 pieces of plastic and 40 per cent of the waste is discarded face masks. This is an irresponsible behavior. I find many morning joggers simply littering the pet bottles

on the road. The city corporation personnel are all busy with Covid-19 works and we can't expect them to carry out clean-up during the pandemic,"" he said.

Joe K Kizhakudan, officer-in-charge, Kovalam Field Laboratory, Central Marine Research Institute (CMFRI), said this is a recurring problem. ""Once the monsoon rains begin, all the accumulated plastic waste in the river mouths will enter the ocean. Plastic wreaks havoc on marine ecosystems. As plastic swirls around in the water, much of it breaks down to tiny pieces called microplastics and is consumed by fish species,"" he said.

The New India Express has reported recently on how unscientific disposal of face masks and gloves not only pose potential health risk during the pandemic but also contain materials that do not recycle and

are not biodegradable. Surgical masks for instance are made of non-woven fabrics including plastics like polypropylene.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/7/2/w600X390/Plastic_waster_EPS.jpeg,"['situation', 'mouths', 'near', 'chennai', 'face', 'waste', 'pandemic', 'pieces', 'plastic', 'masks', 'parcel', 'pilingup', 'poses', 'life', 'threat', 'river']", ,none

But their boat capsized and the three were washed away by the surging waters.

Reports of two youths–Bishnu Tanti and Iliyas Khal of Bisakupi Tea Estate washed away by the surging waters of the Dangori River came the next day taking the overall flood fatality in the State to 23. Flood waters also washed away the bridge that connects Doomdooma to Baghjan where a massive fire broke out after a 14-day uncontrollable oil leak from a damaged oil well at OIL’s production well site.

The washed away bridge made the operations more complicated to bring the fire under control. Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal took stock of the situation and asked the deputy commissioner, Tinsukia to lay one Bailey bridge to ensure unhindered movement of vehicles engaged in emergency services.

On Monday, reports of dead fish and other aquatic birds and animals floating on the Maguri-Motapung beel created panic among local people.

Irawati Narah’s family performed the last rites of the deceased woman in a boat as no high ground was in sight in the Chabua Revenue Circle of Dibrugarh district. The Dibru and the Dangori rivers are in high spate while the Brahmaputra, flowing a little distance away creating flood fury from Sadiya to Dhubri. The flood situation in Dibrugarh spread to 120 villages besides inundating most of city of Dibrugarh.

In Tinsukia, over 60,000 people from 140 villages of the district had been severely affected. More than 50 relief camps were set up in the district. For some 1,800 families– evacuated after the blow-out and staying at the dozen–odd relief camps of Baghjan and Dighaltarang—things become more complicated as flood waters inundated relief shelters.

“It has become an ordeal to even use the toilets. With living conditions worsening inside the make-shift relief camps, how can you think of social distancing?” asked one of the inmates of a relief camp at Guijan. Altogether 640 of families from greater Natun Gaon area were forced to take shelter in two schools at Guijan as an aftermath of the inferno at Baghjan.

The second surge of flood devours most of Assam’s flood-prone districts amid community transmission of COVID-19 cases. An alarmed administration grappling dual surges of a severe flood and more severe COVID-19 spread have developed an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for relief camps which has been distributed to every district so as to deal with the Covid-19 situation as the number of positive cases show an upward swing. The Chief Executive Officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), MS Manivannan, assured that they are well-prepared to take on this dual challenge.

At least 200 relief camps were set up across the state where some 30,000 people had taken shelter, said an ASDMA release. To deal with the challenge of COVID-19 from spreading in the relief camps, ASDMA has drawn up standard operating protocol that defines the capacity of each camp so that people are not pushed to more vulnerability. As many of the flood-hit districts have quarantine camps, any suspected COVID-19 case in a flood relief camp would be sent to the nearest quarantine centre, stated the guidelines.

A “Himalayan Challenge” for Assam

The Assam government geared up arrangements for return of most people who were stuck outside the state and their quarantine facilities before June 10 so that the state could shift its focus to flood preparations. On May 3, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma during an interactive session with senior journalists said that the state authorities has been dealing with a Himalayan problem because it has to organize tackling flood in the course of the monsoon season and the outbreak of the Japanese encephalitis, while controlling the COVID-19 spread.

“By August 15, Assam typically witnesses flood and Japanese encephalitis, and so, the state is dealing with a “Himalayan challenge”, said Sarma.

But by the last week of May the season’s first flood, triggered by cyclone Amphan, wreaked havoc in the state. Nearly three lakh people in nine districts of the state had been severely hit.

With floods, cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) had also been reported from some districts of Assam. The Mission Director of National Health Mission (NHM) in Assam confirmed three cases of JE and 79 cases of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) from the districts of Cachar, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Kamrup, and Morigaon. So far, there have been no deaths. Assam reported 154 deaths from JE last year. The combined number of deaths due to JE and AES last year was 600.

After an initial low count of COVID-19 cases when the lockdown started, Assam has seen a spike in the numbers with eased travel restrictions and more people returning home. On an average, the State is now getting around 250 positive cases every day, and half of them are from Guwahati.

The State government has enforced a complete lockdown in Kamrup Metro district for 14 days from Sunday night as well as impose night curfew from 7 pm to 7 am across the State from Saturday and weekend lockdowns in towns and municipal areas till the COVID-19 situation improves. Only pharmacies and hospitals will operate during the 14-day lockdown in the city besides a few emergency services. “We have been forced to take the tough decision and we are taking it with lot of pain. We are left with no other option,” said the health minister.

Rains and dam induced devastation

Heavy monsoon rains lashed India’s Northeast since the third week of June. Incessant rainfall and release of dam water further worsened the flood situation in Assam impacting about half a million people in 1, 289 villages in 61 revenue circles of 21 districts. Hundreds of thousands were displaced from their homes. State authorities warn of a worsening situation with prediction of more rainfall.

Dhemaji is the worst-hit with four deaths and more than 200 villages affected, followed by Tinsukia, Dibrugarh and Majuli. Ferry services to Majuli have been suspended.

The floodwaters also took a heavy toll on livestock. More than 70,000 livestock have so far been affected over 40,000 hectares of crop area have been submerged states ASDMA bulletin.

The second wave of flood inundated much of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, situated in Mayong Revenue Circle in Morigaon district. The Kaziranga National Park, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park, Manas National Park, Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park and Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary were inundated by the recent wave of flood.

The flood situation worsened with neighbouring Bhutan releasing over 2700 cumecs of excess water from Kurichu dam, about 30km from Barpeta Road in lower Assam on Thursday that led to the swelling of Beki, Manas, Pagladia, Kaldia and Pohumara rivers, affecting lower Assam districts.

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal taking stock of the prevailing flood situation directed the different district administrations to keep constant vigil over the water level in their respective districts, especially in the wake of reported release of water from Bhutan.

Last year, the minister of state for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria informed the Lok Sabha that Assam has nine of the 39 most flood-prone districts in the country and Dhubri tops this list. The minister was referring to a report submitted by a committee headed by the Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC) while answering to a question by Dhubri MP Badruddin Ajmal.

According to the report, the nine most flood-prone districts of Assam are Dhubri, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Dhemaji, Barpeta, Jorhat, Goalpara, Sivasagar and Nalbari.

Breach at Subansiri dam site create panic

Reports of damage of infrastructure and breaches in embankments poured in from different places. Although the State chief minister had, on April 30, directed the water resources department to complete all repair work on weak and breached embankments before the onset of monsoon the annual job of repairing river embankments came to a halt with the country-wide lockdown on March 25. Resentment grew along the banks against the administration for in-complete projects of embankment repair, maintenance and also anti-erosion work.

Floods and river-bank erosion pose a grave risk for the entire Brahmaputra valley. Globally, the Brahmaputra river system is perhaps the only one known for its loss of about 100 square kilometres of land every year due to bank erosion.

On May 26 part of a guard wall of the 2000 MW Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project (SLHP) breached. Moreover, erosion at the dam site created panic and riparian anxiety as a coffer dam was washed away. The NHPC authorities issued a clarification on local newspapers on Sunday stating that breach of downstream coffer dam and river flowing above the dam during monsoon is a normal event.

The clarification also stated that slope failure in diversion channel along left bank road is due to prolonged flow of water in diversion structures and is in no way related to the safety of the dam. The slopes shall be repaired after monsoons during the balance construction period after which the Diversion Tunnels shall be plugged. Earlier, the NHPC stated that the erosion site was 500 metres away from the main dam and would not make any impact.

The recent events led to protests by various organizations reiterating the apprehensions expressed by experts on the selected site for the mega-dam of the present dimension which is sensitive geologically and seismologically.

The Assam State Action Plan on Climate Change (2015-2020), states that climate change plays a major role as seen in the recent patterns in flooding in Assam. From April to late September—the state witness number of surges that would cripple the state’s economy each time. Further, thoughtless construction of dams on rivers in the name of flood control and the careless operation of dams have converted floods into a disaster.","Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Flood-Pobitora-by-Chandan-Kumar-Duarah-scaled.jpg,"['relief', 'flood', 'challenge', 'himalayan', 'districts', 'state', 'dam', 'cases', 'assam', 'covid19', 'situation', 'district']", ,flood

The Nagaland State Disaster Management Authority (NSDMA), in coordination with Regional Meteorological Centre, Guwahati, issued a weather update for the coming days on Tuesday.

According to the update, the second half of this period is expected to get more intense than the former. During this period, thundershowers and lighting accompanied by heavy rains are expected in Mon, Mokokchung, Longleng, Tuensang, Peren, Phek, Kiphire and Zunheboto districts.

The state capital Kohima is likely to have moderate to heavy rains from July 7 to July 10.

Nagaland’s major river Dhanasiri may have large flow of water as river Brahmaputra is above the danger level at many places due to the prolonged spell of heavy rain in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

The NSDMA said it is important to take necessary precautionary measures during this time as most rivers of the state are North-South flow and may overflow because of intense rains in the catchment areas.

It urged the public to be vigilant and not to shelter under large trees and near the river banks to prevent unnecessary risk to life from lightning and flash flood.

UNITED NATIONS, Jul 2 2020 (IPS) - Unless there is a restructuring of debt for developing countries, the servicing for this debt will take away valuable resources from these nations that are needed to prevent the further suffering of people during the coronavirus pandemic — particularly with regards to safeguarding the health systems, and protecting the “integrity and resilience of economies”.

This is according to Bogolo Joy Kenewendo, former minister of trade of Botswana, who was speaking to IPS on Wednesday, Jul. 1, after a roundtable discussion at the United Nations over the post-lockdown economy.

In order to prevent economies of developing countries from suffering disproportionately under the current pandemic, it’s crucial that there’s less protectionist thinking and that developed countries approach the economic downturn through means that empower developing countries, said Kenewendo, who is also a former member of the U.N. secretary-general’s high level digital cooperation panel.

“What’s important is that we have debt freeze and restructuring immediately, particularly for the developing countries because our resources are currently on so much pressure with the demand for social welfare to be extended, subsidies to be extended and then having some infrastructure needing to be put in place and paying interest on loans’.

“[This is] really putting a lot of pressure on the fiscal positions of many developing countries,” she told IPS.

At the roundtable titled “Rebirthing the Global Economy to deliver Sustainable Development”, numerous distinguished female leaders spoke on the issue, reiterating solutions that focused on how to accommodate the needs of developing countries.

Vera Songwe, executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, shared an incisive analysis on the importance of removing intermediary parties from trade exchanges during the discussion.

She stated that one of United States tech company, Apple’s, main imports is cotton. However, 80 percent of cotton imports are from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which is in a debt crisis.

“The DRC sells cotton at $40 – $80, [but] on the market cotton goes for $400,” she said, adding that one priority for the next steps should be to brainstorm ways in which intermediation can be reduced.

“My posit for trade and the new trade environment is that we do everything we can to take away every intermediary that exists between the original product and the end product,” she said.

Kate Raworth, the senior visiting research associate at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, brought up the “ecological debt” that high-income countries owe to low-income countries.

She said this kind of debt is much longer term, claiming that advanced regions such as Europe and countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada, U.S. and Japan are living “beyond planetary impact”.

“We are destroying the climate system, we are destroying the ecological system, and that is the debt we owe to the lowest income countries of the world because we are undermining all prospects of development for them,” she said in an impassioned speech.

“They will have no fertile soils, no monsoon rains, no stable climate and they will have no capacity to develop.”

Kenewendo told IPS that this is also a matter of the “capital flight” to developed countries that takes place during a crisis.

“The real issue is that there’s a lot of [foreign direct investment] FDI that has been attracted to developing countries and emerging markets,” she said.

“And when there is such a crisis, you find this capital flight back to developed countries or to the west.”

This, she said, means the manufacturing income that developing economies had expected earnings from will suddenly be redirected to developed countries.

“And it’s mainly because during a crisis, people look at the political and economic stability of economies and it might be found that in Africa, for example, our political instability becomes a problem,” Kenewendo said.

These kinds of protectionist policies can really harm low-income or developing countries, and thus advocates suggest that not taking a “beggar thy neighbour” approach that only makes it less efficient.

“Those kind of ‘inward-looking’ policies make the situation more difficult for everybody and they deepen and prolong the crisis for the global economy,” Kenewendo said, adding that it’s crucial that free flow of capital is maintained and a trading relation is established rather than an aid-based relation.

She further noted the importance of digitalisation that the pandemic has highlighted and said it has a massive role to play in our economies going forward.

“Digitalisation is not all about being online, but it’s also about using the mobile technology resources that exist in order to ensure a much broader level of inclusivity in its delivery,” she said.

Citing Songwe’s example, Kenewendo said that in the conversation about reform, it’s key to ensure that “we are incentivising and stimulating investment”.

“It’s very important that we provide capacity for countries to tap into domestic capital and to also make sure that we’re safeguarding [small and medium-sized enterprises] SMEs and the resiliency of the informal sector,” she said.","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2020/07/8359128983_631ea00bd2_c.jpg,"['kenewendo', 'developing', 'economies', 'economic', 'recovery', 'developed', 'prioritise', 'debt', 'capital', 'restructuring', 'countries', 'cotton', 'global', 'trade']", ,none

With less than four months to go for Durga Puja , it’s that that time of the year when we usually start taking the countdown to the biggest festival of the state seriously. But 2020 is an extraordinary year. Like all other things, the ongoing pandemic is set to have a major impact on Puja celebrations too. While the barowari (public) pujas stare at an uncertain festive season, several bonedi families in Kolkata kicked off preparations with kathamo puja (worshipping the first structure of Ma Durga) on Rath Yatra. As per the tradition, some of them even gave orders for the idols (bayna) to their family sculptors on the auspicious day. While the families are trying their best to continue with age-old traditions despite all odds, they are mindful of the challenges posed by COVID-19. From scaling down celebrations to restricting the entry of devotees, bonedi baris are ready to adapt to the new normal. Here’s what some of the popular bonedi baris are planning for the upcoming Puja.‘Social extravaganza will be drastically cut’“The puja will take place in both Baag-ola Bari and Chhoto Rajbari. As per our customs, we hosted kathamo pujo on the day of Ratha Yatra. The same was hosted at Chhoto Rajbari on Ulto Rath. We’ve been following the same rituals for generations, so all the Puja paraphernalia will remain untouched, but the social extravaganza will be drastically cut. For example, there will be no procession on Saptami for Nabapatrika snan.”— Tirthankar Krishna Deb‘Will have a meeting on how to control the crowd’“We are going ahead with the age-old tradition of hosting Durga Puja at our house following the Vaishnav way of worship. Like always, this year too, we will have kathamo pujo on Janmashtami and the idol-making will start at our thakur dalan. However, we’re not expecting the usual crowd this year since social distancing is the need of the hour. There’s a meeting where all family members will discuss ways to limit the footfall if things don’t improve by Puja. Many of our relatives who stay abroad and in other cities may not be able to make it this time”— Ranjit Mallick‘Durga Puja will be held, but on a smaller scale’“We have six families — Boro Bari, Atchala Bari, Mejo Bari, Majher Bari, Benaki Bari and Kalikinkar Bhaban — which organise Durga Puja. And all of us have decided to carry on with the puja this year, but on a smaller scale. We are still deciding on how to tone down the celebrations. To begin with, our Annapurna Puja this year was a relatively small affair. We did not even conduct Rath Yatra. However, Durga Puja will surely take place and on Janmashtami, all the six families will host kathamo pujo.Tanmoy Ray Chaudhuri‘It will truly be a family affair’“Though our Puja rituals will be the same, the elaborate social functions will be scaled down this year. Our idol artist, who lives in Murshidabad, has promised to come down despite the uncertainties. He is the one who takes care of everything here. Since our family discourages the use of plastic, we have been using shola work, organic colours and biodegradable items to keep our Puja eco-friendly. This year, however, I am not sure what all we can do. My brother and other relatives are stuck in Delhi. If everything goes well, they will be here with us. This year, it will be a family affair — a barir pujo — in the true sense.”— Joydip Kundu‘Rituals will be conducted in keeping with the new normal’“All the puja rituals will be carried out keeping the new normal in mind. Since a lot of visitors come for debi darshan, we’ll follow the latest government orders to keep that in check. We followed our tradition of hosting the kathamo puja at our thakur dalan on Rath Yatra. In August, we are expecting artisans from Birbhum who will make the idol in the house as per our age-old traditions. Our puja goes on for 10 days, starting from Prothoma. It will be the same this year. The Durga Puja at the Janbazar residence of Rani Rashmoni was started by Priti Ram Das – the father-in-law of Rani ma’s. The remarkable feature of our idol is the skin colour of Ma Durga. It is molten gold and the idol is purely handmade as we don’t use any moulds. Years back, it is in this courtyard of our house where Sri Ramkrishna Paramahansa Deb used to conduct Durga Puja.”— Prasun Hazra‘We’ll try to limit the crowd of devotees’“This year, we had to cancel Annapurna Puja because of the lockdown. We only did ghot puja on that day to keep our rituals alive. However, all the family members have decided to go ahead with our Durga Puja. We are hopeful that the situation will improve by then. If it doesn’t, we will think of ways to limit the crowd of devotees. On Rath Yatra, we did thakurer bayana (placing the order of the idol with some token money) at Kumartuli. Like every year, this year too, the idol will be traditional with daker saaj.”— Sutapa Sreemany‘First no-guest Durga Puja in 189 years’“In the light of the pandemic, we are going to have a no-guest Durga Puja this time. This is the first time in 189 years of our puja heritage that we are just going for the ghot pujo. There will be no murti puja (idol worship) because first, we don’t want outsiders to come and carve the idol, which is made on the Girish Bhawan premises. And second, for the immersion, our deity is carried by coolies, and we don't know where they come from. No one knows how the situation is going to be during Puja. So, we are not taking any chances and all the members of Girish Bhawan have unanimously taken this decision. We hope to go back to our usual celebrations from next year.”— Kaushik Mukherjee","Wed, 01 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76719915,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135631,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg","['muted', 'idol', 'prepping', 'families', 'durga', 'yatra', 'kathamo', 'start', 'celebrations', 'pujo', 'rath', 'rituals', 'family', 'bonedi', 'puja', 'bari']", ,none
67,67,FL-2020-000164-IND,Criticism of new signs at Chilbolton Cow Common - Andover Advertiser,https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/news/18557183.criticism-new-signs-chilbolton-cow-common/,"A PARISH council has defended the installation of “hostile” signage at a beauty spot near Andover, which has made the area look like “some East German park”, in the words of one resident.

Chilbolton Cow Common has seen more than a dozen signs put up in recent weeks, warning visitors not to enter or park in certain areas, to observe social distancing, to treat the area with respect and not to “urinate or defecate on our common”.

The village’s parish council, which installed the signs, says the temporary signage is necessary due to “anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common” which have seen police visit the site on “numerous occasions” in recent months.

But the measures have drawn criticism from some visitors.

One resident said the scene was “one of the most shocking things” he had ever seen, and reminiscent of an “East German park”. Another described the new signs as “hostile” and “a visual eye-sore” in a letter to the Advertiser and hit out at the parish council for installing them in the first place.

The council, however, says that action was necessary amid record numbers of visitors to the site.

A statement from Chilbolton parish council read: “Under normal circumstances I would agree that signage on the Common should be kept to a minimum.

“However, like many other beauty spots up and down the country, we have been trying to manage the Common in quite exceptional circumstances with record high numbers of people visiting the site. This has prompted a number of concerns being raised by local residents.”

Those concerns include parking issues, said to be a “hot topic” for a number of years, plus an “increase in complaints about anti-social and inappropriate behaviours on the Common such as the use of BBQs, using parts of the Common as a ‘open-air toilet’ and dis-regarding social distancing measures.”

The authority also says the temporary signage has, so far, been working.

Its statement continued: “The permanent signage that we have has proven to be nowhere near sufficient to manage the large numbers visiting the site and as a temporary measure we agreed to put high profile visible notices to ensure that people visiting the site know what behaviours are expected of them. Since erecting the signage and making changes to the area where cars park we have seen significant improvements. By and large the vast majority of visitors have understood the need for the signage and behaved responsibly.

“As a Parish Council we would like to hold a Public Meeting (when it is safe to do so) to discuss all of these issues and get the broader views of our local residents. We do not propose to do this until the Autumn at the earliest which will give us chance to reflect on all of the options and implications.”","Thu, 02 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/11544996/,"['chilbolton', 'visitors', 'council', 'parish', 'signs', 'site', 'seen', 'criticism', 'cow', 'common', 'signage', 'visiting', 'temporary', 'park']", ,none
