* Pakistan donates dry rations to flood affected in Sri Lanka

Sat, May 22, 2021, 12:28 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

May 22, Colombo: The government of Pakistan has donated over Rs. 700,000 worth of dry rations to Sri Lanka to provide relief to those affected by the country-wide Covid epidemic and floods.

The High Commissioner of Pakistan, Maj. Gen. (Retd) Muhammad Saad Khattak and Deputy High Commissioner Tanvir Ahmad visited Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo Friday (21) and handed over the donation to Piyal Nishantha De Silva, State Minister of Women and Child Development, Pre-School & Primary Education, for distribution in flood relief areas of Sri Lanka.

The dry rations were donated at the request made by State Minister Piyal Nishantha during a recent meeting with the High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan.

Covid-19 relief supplies were also provided to police affected, which were received by the SSP, the High Commission said.

During the visit, High Commissioner emphasized on the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two brotherly countries for the uplift of the two countries’ people. He further said that Pakistan is committed to provide continued support to Sri Lanka.","Sat, 22 May 2021 06:58:00 GMT",http://www.colombopage.com/CGImgs_Politics/PK05222021_1.jpg,"['lanka', 'high', 'relief', 'rations', 'pakistan', 'state', 'dry', 'donates', 'sri', 'flood', 'commissioner', 'affected']", ,flood
1,1,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Parents of Pakistani man who died in NSW floods forced to watch burial through car window - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/05/parents-of-pakistani-man-who-died-in-nsw-floods-forced-to-watch-burial-through-car-window,"The parents of a man who died when his car was trapped in New South Wales flood waters have farewelled their son at a prayer service in Sydney after flying in from Pakistan.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son’s body or coffin and were kept apart from Younus’s friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younus’s father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

“When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,” the grieving father said.

“I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didn’t happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.”

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

“Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me,” he said.

“One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.”

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

“I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.”

Younus had three siblings – two older brothers and a younger sister – who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younus’s parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his son’s coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia’s mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the family’s travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younus’s coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends – Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. “We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities,” he said. “We would spend time there with friends.”

The housemate said Younus “loved going to the gym and playing volleyball – he was a very energetic person”.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younus’s parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

“They’re in quarantine at the moment and an exemption was given only after an intense negotiation, with the immigration department, for them to be released for only a very short period of time,” he said. “It was a minute-to-minute procedure.”

The funeral for Younus was delayed due to a coronial inquiry and because of the complications in obtaining permission for his parents to attend.

2,2,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistani PhD Student Calls For Replicating Chinese Flood Control Model - - Technology Times Pakistan,https://www.technologytimes.pk/2021/04/30/pakistani-phd-student-calls-for-replicating-chinese-flood-control-model/,"Pakistan Should Replicate And Implement Chinese Flood Control Model To Combat The Recurring Floods, Said Khansa Gulshad.

Pakistan Should Replicate And Implement China Sponge City Model To Combat The Recurring Floods, Said Khansa Gulshad, A Second-Year Pakistani Phd Student In Flood Control And Management At Graduate School Of China Institute Of Water Resources And Hydropower Research (Iwhr) On Friday.

The sponge city project, also known as green development interventions and green infrastructure in other countries, is a new urban construction model for flood management, strengthening ecological infrastructure and drainage systems. The model has the advantages of alleviating urban flooding and water resources shortage, two chronic ills in Pakistan, Khansa Gulshad told CEN.

The heart of the sponge city construction lies in flood mapping. According to Khansa Gulshad, the purpose of the mapping is to locate the hazard- and flood-prone areas and find the proper site based on rainfall data, information of lakes and rivers and street views. Drawing on flood mapping data, different infrastructures such as wetlands, woodlands and permeable pavements are constructed accordingly which can absorb the water during rainy days and release water in case of drought.

The model holds great potential to ease Pakistan increasingly common urban flooding, such as the Karachi floods in August 2020, which took a heavy toll on people security and property. Khansa Gulshad emphasised the need for Pakistan to draw lessons and learn the latest technologies from China. With rich experience in flood control and management, China can help Pakistan develop the monitoring system to get rainfall data and river flow data to better harness floods.

She also expected more cooperation between Chinese and Pakistani universities in this regard to enhance Pakistan research prowess and help raise awareness of the sustainable green management of floods.

Khansa Gulshad obtained her master degree in geographic information engineering at Wuhan University. Her interest in flood control was spurred by her internship at the Pakistan Meteorological Department, where she acquired first-hand experience in flood projects. After graduation from IWHR, Khansa Gulshad aims to join an organisation such as the disaster management authority or the meteorological department to combat floods along with research.

4,4,FL-2017-000017-PAK,A glacial disaster in the making - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/838236-a-glacial-disaster-in-the-making,"On August 15, 2020, a teenage girl was killed in a remote village in Chitral as a glacial flood swept away six houses, partially damaging sixteen others and inundating standing crops of wheat and beans. Another 11 people were injured as the local police station and a post of Chitral Scouts were submerged. The glacial flood washed away a stretch of more than 500 meters of road to Baroghil valley as well.

Fast-forward to February 28, 2021 and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issues a GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) warning on the Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers in Hunza. The situation is still developing and a potential GLOF event is expected in May-June 2021 which will put the population in the downstream community of Hassanabad village at risk of glacial flooding. The Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers have a history of flash flooding. The current surge of Shishper, a 25 sq kms glacier in size, has brought its snout as close as four km from the Karakoram highway, a critical route for the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) initiative in the region.

This is the new normal in the everyday life of these remote and impoverished mountain communities. Recurring loss of life, property and livelihood due to natural catastrophes, associated primarily with the changing climate in the region, is only aggravating with every passing year. Even worse, these climatic changes are altering weather patterns in the long term, which are not properly understood by these local communities. Though climate-induced changes encompass a wide range of pressing issues, water is arguably the most essential natural resource at risk.

Pakistan is a unique place: the country hosts 7,200+ glaciers in its North, spread over approximately 17,000 sq km, which is home to the mighty Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges. It has reportedly more glacial ice than anywhere on earth outside the polar regions – hence referred to as the third pole. These glaciers feed the rivers that account for around 75 percent of the stored-water supply in a country inhabited by 212+ million people.

Ironically, Pakistan contributes less than one percent to global pollutant emissions, which ranks it among the least emitters. Yet, the country is among the most vulnerable to climate-related hazards like changing monsoon patterns, rapid glacial ice melt leading to inundation and flash flooding, avalanches, landslides and extreme heatwaves. Consequently, climate-induced migration by the local population in mountain and downstream communities of this region to save lives and to look for better livelihood opportunities is a serious challenge. This is the real evidence of the direct human cost of climate change in this part of the world.

Glaciers are a source of freshwater and vital for the ecosystem. As a consequence of climate change and global warming, several glaciers around the world are shrinking in size and gradually retreating. Depending on the volume and size of the glacial lake, temperature and precipitation, and geomorphological parameters of the terrain, mechanical failures may cause a breach in the wall of an ice or moraine-dammed glacial lake. Subsequently, a sudden discharge of millions of cubic meters of meltwater and debris can occur in a short time, with a catastrophic impact on the socioeconomic life of the downstream communities. This phenomenon is referred to as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or GLOFs.

These GLOFs are a major hazard in high altitude glaciated regions of northern Pakistan. According to a UNDP report, around 3,033 glacial lakes have been identified in this region, with at least 33 critical lakes. Many recent scientific studies are projecting an increase in the frequency of GLOFs in the wake of ongoing climate change and global warming. The government of Pakistan's ‘National Climate Change Policy’ identifies the projected recession of HKH glaciers as a major climate threat, while a key finding of the Asian Development Bank, reported in 2017, is the lack of glacier monitoring infrastructure in Pakistan.

Most of the glaciers in Pakistan are at low altitude and the settlements are near the glaciers. This makes them more vulnerable. Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, the regional programme manager for River Basins & Cryosphere at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, has emphasized that even if the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions are reduced to limit the temperature rise as envisioned in the Paris Agreement, a scenario with only a two degree Celsius could still be devastating as two-third of glaciers in the HKH would melt away!

Mitigative measures at local, national and international levels in a coherent manner are immediate imperatives. Mountain and downstream communities settled in these disaster-prone areas are unceasingly at risk and their vulnerabilities are augmented by poverty, lack of awareness about the GLOF threats, increasing pressure on natural resources, and high-risk settlement patterns. At the local level, adaptation to climate change and resilience building through specific initiatives – early warning systems, promotion of clean energy in the mountains, reducing deforestation and land-use regulation – must be enforced. In a country like Pakistan, which lacks essential infrastructure for glacier monitoring, disaster management policies, risk reduction plans, early warning systems and scientific approach and equipment to deal with the new risks and vulnerabilities arising from its natural resources, it is imperative that the international community must come forward and help.

At the moment, the government of Pakistan, through the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC), and UNDP Pakistan are implementing a $37 million project named Scaling Up of GLOF Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II), a continuation of the GLOF-I pilot project, which aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs. This project is expanding weather information surveillance by installing 50 automatic weather stations at different locations in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Though these weather stations will provide information as part of a local-level early warning system, they are limited in scope and scalability for now.

The glaciated region of HKH is vast and stretches over thousands of kilometres across several countries. This third pole necessitates more engagement of the international community through development of local infrastructure, investment in building community resilience, prevention of deforestation, reduction in GHG emissions, application of scientific approach, tools and methods in their study, risk assessment and reduction planning at the regional level, continuous monitoring and integrated analysis of the evolution of glaciers.

The recent summit by US President Biden has made some headway, but there is a real urgency for stronger climate action, limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as proposed in the Paris Agreement, helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts and discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change.

Climate change doesn’t seem to recognize our borders on land and water, and Mother Nature is ruthless when it comes to punishing. Efforts beyond borders, strategic alliances and politics are essential and only an all-inclusive approach can yield desired results.

6,6,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan floods: at least 90 killed in monsoon rains - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/26/pakistan-floods-at-least-90-killed-in-monsoon-rains,"Three days of monsoon rains have killed at least 90 people and damaged at least a thousand homes across Pakistan, the country’s national disaster management agency has said.

Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the city’s outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.

Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency.

It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.

Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the country’s largest city.

According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachi’s rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.

The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.

Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.

Fallen power lines caused widespread electrical outages, adding misery to the lives of many of the city’s 15 million residents. Some workers stayed at their offices while others spent the night in open areas because there was no public transport to get home in many parts of the city.

Hundreds of vehicles were dragged along the streets by powerful flood waters.

At least eight people were killed when a wall fell on them in a residential area. The victims included children who were playing at the time.

8,8,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan slum dwellers map flood risks to stop evictions - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210412075730-4tzvi/,"Mapping of informal settlements is key to protecting residents from worsening climate change impacts with as little disruption as possible, urban experts say

By Rina Chandran

April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in the Pakistani city of Karachi have stopped the demolition of thousands of homes by mapping flood risks from clogged drains, offering a feasible solution to other informal settlements facing climate change impacts, urban experts said.

After unexpectedly heavy rains flooded much of Karachi last year, authorities said some slum settlements would be removed to allow drains to be widened, with hundreds of homes in Manzoor Colony settlement earmarked for demolition.

Residents, who had always insisted that the flooding was mainly caused by drains blocked with rubbish and sludge, teamed up with non-profit organisations to map the drainage network.

""They generated their own evidence to uncover the reasons – overlooked by authorities – why Karachi floods,"" said Arif Hasan, an architect and planner who backed the mapping project.

""The communities believed that if these obstructions are removed and the drains are cleaned and maintained, flooding will not take place,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

About 12 million people out of Karachi's 16 million population live in informal settlements, and are increasingly vulnerable as Pakistan's largest city faces worsening inundations as the South Asian monsoon brings extreme weather.

Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, has a network of 550 stormwater drains that criss-cross the city and empty into the Arabian Sea. Many are blocked by illegal construction and waste.

Authorities say they clean out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide funds. The unusually heavy rains killed dozens, submerged main roads and inundated hundreds of homes.

To map Manzoor Colony's drains, a team from the non-profit Technical Training Resource Center (TTRC) walked along them with residents, photographing, marking and mapping more than a dozen blockages.

Their map showed only about 40 houses needed to be removed to leave the drains clear, said Mohammad Sirajuddin, head of TTRC, who led the mapping project.

""The authorities said thousands of houses would need to be demolished, but our maps showed otherwise,"" he said.

In November, residents successfully halted the planned demolitions in Manzoor Colony.

While it is not certain whether authorities will use the community's flood risk map in the future, the residents now know where the choke points are and how they can tackle the dangers, Sirajuddin said.

Two other informal settlements in Karachi are being mapped, with residents - especially young people - trained, he said, adding that the model can be replicated across the country.

These maps also generate crucial data on households, said Nausheen Anwar, director of Karachi Urban Lab, a think-tank.

""The maps provide a process through which consensus can be built and inclusion of all residents can be negotiated to stave off evictions and establish a basis for just compensation and resettlement,"" she said.

By 2030, more than half of Pakistan's projected 250 million population are expected to live in cities, compared to 36% now, according to the United Nations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had pledged to build 5 million affordable homes within five years to address a chronic shortage, with housing rights groups warning that poorer residents face evictions as pressure on land increases.

""When youths in the settlements are trained in mapping, they better understand the risks they face,"" said TTRC's Sirajuddin.

""They understand their rights, and can fight evictions.""

It’s also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the country’s sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, it’s falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

“Qatar’s expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options,” said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. “It’s still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.”

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatar’s monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the world’s top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatar’s hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatar’s main advantage is that it has the world’s lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Bonds Coming

Qatar’s state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

That’s enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

“Nobody can compete with Qatari costs,” said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. “They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competition’s profits.”

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatar’s Ministry of Energy and QP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when it’s burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

We’re Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russia’s Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said it’s unperturbed by Qatar’s moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing that’s not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

“We’re not afraid,” Cheniere’s Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. “We’re part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.”

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably won’t secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatar’s wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. “Our expansion is very timely,” he said.

“The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink,” OIES’s Stern said. “It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.”

11,11,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan’s sprawling Karachi ‘broken’ by monsoon floods - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/4/pakistans-sprawling-karachi-broken-by-monsoon-floods,"Record rains inundated Pakistan’s largest city, paralysing city authorities as people were left to fend for themselves.

Karachi/Islamabad, Pakistan – For Shahzad Ahmed, there was no time to think.

“The windows broke and the door caved in, that’s how intense the water pressure was,” he said of the first night of torrential monsoon rain in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, last week.

“We didn’t even try to take the water out of the house. I just tied my rickshaw [to a pole] as tightly as I could and my family and I [got on] the rooftop.”

Ahmed, his wife and children spent more than 10 hours on that roof, in the pouring rain, as Karachi saw more than 230mm of rainfall in less than 12 hours, the most ever recorded, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed and thousands of homes washed away in flooding across the country, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) (PDF).

We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started. Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper

Karachi, a sprawling metropolis of more than 20 million people, was one of the worst-hit by the urban flooding. Streets turned to rivers, as the sheer volume of water quickly overloaded the city’s dilapidated and ill-maintained drainage systems.

In Ahmed’s working-class neighbourhood of Yousuf Goth, a video taken after the rains showed water flowing through the streets, mixing with sewage and solid waste, as residents waded through it to salvage what they can from their homes.

“What we need most right now is clean drinking water and vegetables. You can’t make a meal out of oil or just packets [of dry food],” said Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood.

Muhammad Rashid, 29, a construction worker, said his family was trapped at home, but he had to wade through the sewage periodically to try and find drinking water.

Shehzad Ansari’s aluminium door and window frame shop was inundated by the floods, and ‘everything was destroyed’, he says [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“The only thing I left the house for was water,” he said. “We slept without food on the first night. We were safe on our roof, but I kept leaving in the five feet of water just to get [drinking] water.”

The city’s main thoroughfares did not cope much better, submerged under several feet of water, leaving cars stranded or washed away in the flow. Desperate residents took to contracting agricultural tractors to try and winch their vehicles out.

Electricity supply across the city failed, or was pre-emptively cut, almost immediately, as the city’s main utility company reported its substations were being flooded. The pre-emptive cuts were aimed at limiting deaths due to electrocution if exposed wires were to come into contact with water in the streets.

Right now, it's like kicking a dead horse. They just don't have the capacity for it. Farhan Anwar, urban planner

At least six people died as a result of such electrocutions, hospital officials told Al Jazeera.

Ahmed said he had to take the risk to move his family after 48 hours spent on their rooftop without electricity, water or natural gas to cook with.

“I was worried about the [electricity] current in the waters, but when the choice is between certain death by starvation or possibly electrocution, what could I do?”

‘Governance system failure’

As the rains now begin to subside, the hard work of cleaning up the debris and rebuilding will begin. In a city as divided and administratively “broken” as Karachi, however, urban planners and researchers said that will be easier said than done.

“It is an overall governance system failure,” said Farhan Anwar, an urban planner and faculty member at Karachi’s Habib University. “You can’t isolate a particular cause for it [because] we have, over the years, allowed the city to develop and grow without planning or regulation or a framework.”

Anwar said the city was “on its knees” after the rains, and that its institutions, plagued by decades of mismanagement, a lack of planning and political contestation, simply do not have the capacity to deal with the situation.

‘I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,’ said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amid the wreckage of his store [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“These institutions of governance that are responsible for maintaining services, whether it is water, solid waste management, land, transportation or sewage, they are all totally bankrupt,” he said.

“Right now, it’s like kicking a dead horse. They just don’t have the capacity for it.”

One of the reasons for this, Anwar and others told Al Jazeera, is the complex nature of Karachi’s administrative setup. The city is administered by more than a dozen land-owning civic agencies, all of which work independently and are not beholden to a single set of policies.

The city has a mayor, elected in 2016, but he said he only controls 12 percent of the city’s overall area.

A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture Haris Gazdar, researcher

The rest of the city is managed by a mix of federal and provincial government-controlled landholding bodies, cooperative housing societies, the port authority, the railways department, industrial area authorities and military-run cantonments (PDF).

This situation, Anwar argued, has “straitjacketed” growth and development in Karachi.

“Various agencies have control over resources and management and there is no collaboration or coordination between them … Everyone is on their own.”

As political parties play out their contestations over civic institutions, analysts said, it has left most bankrupt.

“The confrontation between the Pakistan People’s Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement over the years has resulted in a tug of war that is played out within these institutions,” said Anwar.

Nazish Brohi, a social sector researcher, says Karachi’s history of violence – it was the site of brutal political violence through the 1990s and again from 2008 onwards – means there is a high price associated with any kind of reform.

“Because Karachi has been so volatile, in terms of conflict and violence in the past, no one wants to disturb the equilibrium,” she said. “The minute someone intervenes, there is fear of a conflagration.”

In 2012, Karachi was the world’s most dangerous megacity, with a homicide rate far higher than any other city of its size, as the battle for power in the city, rooted in ethnic and identity-based politics, played itself out on the city’s streets.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

A military operation targeting the MQM party, which was held responsible for much of the violence, has since reduced the number of violent deaths in the city considerably, although critics said the operation itself involved a large number of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

The scars of that violence can affect everything, even the rebuilding of the city’s drainage system, argues Brohi. She gives the example of the need to clear the city’s drainage channels of illegally built structures that have blocked them.



“The drainage channels are choked right now, and those encroachments obviously need to be cleared,” she said. “But when the city is undergirded by an ethnic grid, then questions of which drainage channel you touch first can lead to a conflagration.”

The worst-hit area

One of the largest landholding bodies in Karachi is the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), a civic authority run by the country’s powerful military that controls 5 percent of urban Karachi’s land (PDF).

This week, hundreds of residents protested outside the offices DHA’s sister body, the Clifton Cantonment Board (CCB), demanding authorities do more to drain water that had been standing in their streets and homes for days.

In a statement, DHA said its staff was “working round the clock to bring life back to normal”, adding that it would work with the protesters to address the concerns of residents.

A day later, it also registered police charges against protest organisers for “rioting [while] armed with a deadly weapon” at the angry, but peaceful protest.

The area, one of the richest in Karachi, was surprisingly some of the worst-hit, with many neighbourhoods remaining inundated a week after the worst of the rains. Video footage shared with Al Jazeera showed residents complaining of flooded roads and basements, with many forced to sleep on rooftops on in stairwells.

For the city’s urban poor, the situation has been even worse.

“A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture,” said Haris Gazdar, senior researcher at the Collective for Social Science Research. “And if you are even poorer than that, you have no assets other than maybe your [food] ration that you had stored up.”

“We live from hand to mouth and it was the end of the month,” says Kulsoom Bibi, a housekeeper in the Mehmoodabad neighbourhood. “For two days, neither my sister nor I could get out because to [leave] the … tunnel was filled to the brim.”

The impact of the floods is also continuing for many, as their livelihoods or businesses have been decimated by the water.

“How will patients reach me? They can’t. I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,” said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amidst the wreckage of his store.

Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper, returned home after having moved to a relative’s home in a drier neighbourhood for a few days.

“It’s been 12 days since we had proper electricity,” he said. “We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started.”

Climate change

On Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan directed authorities to prepare a plan within a week to reform Karachi’s administrative systems.

Experts, however, scoffed at the idea that anything will change on the ground unless the underlying political contestation and other issues are not addressed.

“It’s not that the city has not been planned for,” said Anwar, the urban planner. “There are so many plans, so many master plans, it’s just a matter of implementation and political consensus existing, and a level of sincerity of how you want to do it.”

For Gazdar, fixing Karachi’s problems goes beyond bureaucratic reshuffles – it requires both a fundamental reorganisation of administrative authority, and a clear focus on climate change.

“Flooding happens everywhere, even in cities in very advanced countries – they also suffer flooding and droughts and fires and so on,” he said.

“A lot of it is a failure to detect what the planet is trying to tell us. If you look at a global picture of the planet, [this is] a failure of the way we live our lives.”

In recent years, Karachi, and the Sindh province of which it is a part, has seen increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, leading to periods of drought and flood, and rainfall intensity changes that have badly affected agricultural practices that have stood in place for centuries.

Asked if he believes any of this will change, however, Gazdar laughs.

“What will happen in the coming weeks is that some other issue will take the spotlight,” he says. “Seven days is a nice period of time, because on the seventh day something else would have happened somewhere else in the country, and that needs another seven days, and before you know it another 70 years will go by.”

12,12,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Extreme Monsoon Rains in Pakistan - nasa.gov - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147330/extreme-monsoon-rains-in-pakistan,"A heavy monsoon season has caused fatal flooding across Pakistan in 2020. More than 400 people have died since mid-June; another 400 were injured; and more than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

The Sindh province in southeastern Pakistan, which received historic amounts of rain, has been the most affected region. The images above show a portion of Sindh on (September 21, 2020) compared to the same time last year (September 21, 2019). The false-color images, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite, use a combination of infrared and visible light (bands 7-2-1) to make it easier to see the boundary between water and land. Water appears navy blue and black; vegetation is bright green.

Sindh was hit by sporadic heavy rains in July and experienced record-breaking rainfall in August. Karachi, the provincial capital and country’s most populous city, recorded the most August rainfall in 89 years of record keeping. Karachi received around 490 millimeters (19 inches) of rain for the month—more than 200 millimeters occurred within twelve hours. According to news reports, some of the urban flooding was the result of clogged stormwater drains.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported heavy rains in late August in other parts of the province, affecting the districts of Mirpur Khas, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Larkana. The Karachi, Hyderbad, and Mirpur Khas districts were declared “calamity-affected areas.” More than 2 million people across Sindh Province have been affected by monsoon rains this year, with 68,000 residents displaced in relief camps.

The government also reported that nearly one million acres of crops have also been destroyed by the flooding. Fields of cotton, vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and sugarcane have been affected.

Monsoon season generally lasts from mid-June through September. As of September 24, the PMD reported normal flow along the Indus and several other key rivers in the country.

13,13,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"As parts of Pakistan ban water-guzzling paddy, one farmer has a solution - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/994235/as-parts-of-pakistan-ban-water-guzzling-paddy-one-farmer-has-a-solution,"The season for sowing paddy is about to kick off in Sindh. But the province in southeast Pakistan has banned rice cultivation in 10 districts on the left bank of the Indus river.

This ban is announced every year at the end of April or early May to limit the waterlogging, salinity and drought-like conditions caused by successive rice farming. By some accounts, rice cultivation has been banned in these areas for over 90 years. Similarly, the Indian government bans paddy cultivation in “dark zones” to help water aquifers.

“Dark zones” are areas of acute overexploitation of groundwater, due to the use of water exceeding its recharge. But these orders fall on deaf ears, as rice cultivation continues in large swathes of farmland in both countries.

Rasheed Channa, the spokesperson for Sindh’s chief minister, said this time will be different. The government is “dead serious” about penalising those who violate the ban, Channa said. District administrations have already been told to be on the lookout for nurseries and “raze the seedlings before they can be transplanted” to flooded fields.

The news sparked considerable anger within the farming community, with farmers saying the government’s timing and thought process were poor.

“The growers were informed just a month before sowing that paddy will not be allowed,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, senior vice-president of the Sindh Abadgar Board, an organisation formed to protect the rights of farmers in the province. “They had not prepared land or bought seeds to grow an alternative crop.”

Policymakers must realise that switching crops on more than 40,000 hectares after the season for other crops has passed is “almost impossible”, he added.

“Even if 20,000 acres [8,000 hectares] are suddenly cultivated for other crops, where will we get buyers from? The prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits will fall,” he pointed out.

Rice and water

While fears for livelihoods are valid, the ban underscores the government’s growing concerns about water scarcity. The chief minister, who is a progressive farmer himself, said one kilogramme of rice requires up to 3,000 litres of water. Officials said water standing in rice farms for long periods of time has caused waterlogging, and that the high-delta crop also uses up other crops’ share of water for irrigation. Low-delta crops need comparatively less water.

As Pakistan grapples with increased glacial melt and erratic rainfall, managing the canal-fed, water-intensive rice crop is yet another problem. The issue is exacerbated by high demand and the fact that rice generates 8% of Pakistan’s income from exports.

Zahid Bhurgri, general secretary of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a lobbying group for farmers, agrees that rice causes waterlogging and soil destruction. But he also said it is “safe”.

“It is considered a safer bet, especially as we confront climate change [because of which] too much or too little water can destroy other delicate crops, like cotton,” Bhurgri said. He added that rice is an easier crop to grow as it “requires nothing but to be submerged in three to four inches of water”.

Justifying rice ban

“There will be 30% less water this year,” said Sindh’s agriculture minister, Ismail Rahu, to The Third Pole, justifying the ban on the “water guzzler”.

Though Rahu acknowledges that “rice is the bread and butter of hundreds of farmers”, he suggested they cultivate low-delta crops, such as beans, melon and vegetables, as they are less water-intensive and detrimental to the soil.

In many of these districts, the water that is available is of poor quality.

Zarif Khero, the chief engineer at Sindh’s Irrigation Department, said the most important consideration is soil fertility, which is spoilt by rice.

“The way [rice cultivation] is done by flooding the fields causes waterlogging, which will eventually turn the soil into wasteland,” he said.

Finding alternatives

Rafique Suleman, a spokesperson for trade body the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, sees the ban as nothing short of an “atrocity”.

“Instead of providing incentives to grow more, the government is taking away our livelihood,” he said. He pointed out that rice, Pakistan’s second-biggest export after textiles, annually brings in around $2.5 billion into the country.

There is similar resistance in India. Despite depleting groundwater in paddy farming areas, farmers do not give up rice because of assured buying from the states of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana.

The only way out, some say, is to give farmers incentives to grow something else.

Farmer with solution

This is where Asif Sharif, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan in Pakistan’s Punjab province, comes in. Sharif, an online sensation within the South Asian farming community, has a solution: if the rice has to be grown, it should happen without flood irrigation. According to him, the rice plant uses 70% of its energy just to survive the inundation.

“Rice can be grown with minimal water,” said the 70-year-old. He added that the ban in parts of Sindh is “unnecessary”.

“Give it less water and the yield will be three to four times more,” he said, adding that the soil should be kept reasonably moist.

Sharif grows a variety of crops on his 200 hectares of land and has thousands of farmers listening to his every word. He engages with the virtual community and gives advice to people from across the globe.

He has more than 24,000 followers, mostly farmers, including quite a few from Punjab on the Indian side. They share videos on his Facebook page, titled Pedaver, showing how well their crops are doing after they follow his tips.

Sharif said, “everything can be grown anywhere”.

He advocates for farmers to return to doing cultivation on raised beds, without tilling and using organic mulch. Paradoxical agriculture, or “paedar qudrati nizam kashtkari” as he calls it, is a “comprehensive climate-smart production process total solution”.

“The process took several years to develop and mature,” said Sharif. “I started with the System of Rice Intensification in 2008. Then merged the crop system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Conservation Agriculture by 2011. This is how the process evolved by 2014.”

The results are impressive. “In Punjab, we have reduced the production cost of wheat from 1,500 Pakistani rupees to 400 Pakistani rupees per 40 kg,” he claimed.

And yet, he has been unable to bring about a revolution. He faults the farm munshi or manager for thwarting development. “They get huge kickbacks by creating demand for each input that increases the cost of production,” he said.

Farmers with huge landholdings are also to blame, he said. “In connivance with corporations and businesses, they keep the rural population deprived of knowledge and therefore, prosperity,” he said.

He talked of the need for a “crop production management company” that travels to different farmlands, teaching farmers how to grow certified crops that are exportable.

Zarif Khero from Sindh’s Irrigation Department supported the idea of training. “Farmers should engage with students from agricultural universities so they can transition to modern methods of sustainable farming which can result in better yields,” he suggested.

14,14,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan: Post-disaster recovery transition lessons from the 2010 floods - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77313,"Source(s): Climate Adaptation Platform (CAP)



In 2010 severe flooding hit Pakistan, inundating about 37 thousand square kilometres of the nation’s area.

Over 20 million people were affected; the number is higher than those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2005 Cyclone Katrina, or the 2008 cyclone Nargis in Myanmar.

The total loss from these massive floods totalled US$10.4 billion, or 5.7% of Pakistan’s GDP. After the flooding event, the rescue and relief activities lasted up to 8 months, which began in July 2010 until the end of March 2011.

Sindh province was one of the most affected by this event; out of the 20 million affected, 7.3 million residents were from the Sindh province. Sadly for them, the post-recovery after this unprecedented flood stopped at the rescue and relief phase.

According to the study, there was no recovery and reconstruction authority established in the province after the flooding incident – a task that belongs to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Although the institution was lauded for its well-coordinated emergency phase efforts, the recovery and reconstruction phase efforts were missing in the province.

Using Pakistan’s worst flooding in 2010 as a case study, researchers examined the disaster recovery activities after the flood. They highlighted the factors that hinder the transitions to recovery phases in Pakistan, which may also be true in other developing countries.

The three Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) phases in the study are the following –

relief phase, which is meeting the most immediate needs of the community following a disaster, rehabilitation phase or the restoration of basic service and facilities to make communities and societies function; this includes providing temporary housing or shelter, mass feeding, treatment of the injured etc. and lastly, the recovery phase is also termed as the long-term phase wherein major reconstruction, development, and capacity building through structural or non-structural measures occur.

Other PDR phase model like the one proposed by Haast and others shows 4 overlapping phases – emergency, restoration, reconstruction 1, and reconstruction 2, which is similar to the UNDRR model. These PDR models are thoroughly discussed in the study.

According to the study, the Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) in developing countries is limited to the relief and rescue operations, thus failing to transition to subsequent phases like rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery, leading to a full and long-term recovery of a community.

The study finds that the post-disaster recovery in Sindh after the 2010 floods failed to transition to the long-term recovery phase.

The factors that hindered these transitions include the following:

The lack of community-level involvement – the state and relevant institutions failed to place communities at the centre of the recovery process,

Inadequate coping capacity, resource and skills of both the community and local administration which will impede their long-term recovery actions,

Absence of any recovery and reconstruction authority after the flood

No coherence or coordination in the PDR activities among stakeholders led to confusion between stakeholders and hindered the smooth transition of recovery, and

Lack of information and data among local administration and stakeholders led to politically motivating projects and aid distributions.

Through a better understanding of the smooth transition of the various phases of the PDR, the study can help policymakers and disaster management practitioners plan and implement effective PDR strategies, especially in developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate-related and natural disasters.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,"['longterm', 'postdisaster', 'relief', 'lessons', 'pakistan', 'recovery', '2010', 'pdr', 'reconstruction', 'flooding', 'study', 'floods', 'phases', 'transition', 'phase']", ,flood
15,15,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Climate change: impending GLOFs and other disasters - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/article/97371/climate-change-impending-glofs-and-other-disasters,"The Shisper Glacier is melting again and at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk

Taus Bibi, 70, was tending to her goats in Sherabad, an area in Hassanabad, Hunza, when she heard a loud sound of something crashing into the nearby water channel. One of her grandchildren followed shortly, running and asking her to evacuate to a safe area as a flood was dangerously close to their home. Taus had no choice but to run to a nearby orchard where she and other people displaced by the flood spent over 35 hours.

Hassanabad also had one of the major power stations for the district of Hunza, which was also wiped out, depriving the villagers of electricity for many days. Such floods, resulting from glacial lake outbursts have been hitting the village of Hassanabad, (which includes Sherabad, Harum, Roshanabad and main Hassanabad) since 2010. Out of all the surging glaciers in the Karakorum Range, the Shisper Glacier is 12 kms long and has been impacting the most lives in the Hassanabad region.

Melted glacier water can form ice walls, which end up creating reservoirs for the rest of the melted ice. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) occur when these ice walls fail, unleashing entire lakes on nearby villages and roads. There are at least 7,000 glaciers in Gilgit Baltistan out of which 3,044 have formed glacial lakes while 33 are at the risk of outburst flooding. Such floods, if not mitigated, threaten at least seven million people in both Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In March 2017, in order to prevent large scale flooding, a project was started to scale up the lakes that were at the risk of bursting. The Ministry of Climate Change has been leading the project along with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and funding from the Green Climate Fund. The Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project is a part of ‘Reducing Risks and Vulnerabilities from GLOF in Northern Pakistan’, also known as GLOF I.

The Shisper Glacier is melting again with the advent of summer in Pakistan and despite the efforts by GLOF I, at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk and families have been asked to evacuate to safer locations while the Gilgit Baltistan administration has declared a state of emergency in the surrounding areas. Teams from both GLOF and the Pakistan Meteorological Department are keeping a close eye on the lake using ground penetrating radars and Differential GPS. Water levels are also being monitored. An automatic weather station has also been installed in Shisper to monitor the weather in real time.

Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committees (CBDRMC) have been formed by training locals in disaster risk reduction, they have also undergone mock drills while being trained in disaster preparedness.

It has been decided that the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) in collaboration with GLOF II will build gabion walls to protect the population in case of a flood, while irrigation channels are also on the cards along with building of shelters, where people may run to in case there is a disaster.

Emergency response equipment has also been handed out to the locals, which include generators, UPS batteries, inverters, binoculars, walkie talkies, GPS, gas cylinders, portal generators, cyber shot cameras, range finders and small solar panels.

Despite these measures, the locals stay fearful, as disaster management is not as good as living disaster free. They are waiting for permanent solutions, such as migration options to safer places that are not in the path of GLOFs, however, with the very real threat of climate change, it is only a matter of time before we have a lot more than just one village and glacier to think about.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0.jpg,"['shisper', 'climate', 'gilgit', 'disasters', 'change', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'risk', 'hassanabad', 'water', 'glofs', 'baltistan', 'impending', 'disaster', 'glof']", ,flood

According to WFP, the floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season. The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

18,18,FL-2017-000017-PAK,May 21: a day of special significance for China and Pakistan - Daily Times,https://dailytimes.com.pk/758734/may-21-a-day-of-special-significance-for-china-and-pakistan/,"May 21, 2021 is a day of special significance for the People’s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As the Chinese old saying goes, “Even mountains and seas cannot distance people with common aspirations.” 70 years ago, China and Pakistan joined hands overpass the Karakoram Mountains to formally establish diplomatic relations. The past 70 years have witnessed the two countries sharing weal and woe. The time-tested China-Pakistan friendship now sets exemplary for state-to-state relations, and is strategic asset for both countries, most dearly cherished by the two peoples.

Similar histories brought us close to each other. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries and have similar experiences in getting rid of foreign aggression and seeking independence. At such critical times, be it when New China endeavored to break the external blockade and open up a new prospect for diplomacy, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other.

Similar ideas guide us stand shoulder to shoulder. China and Pakistan are the backbones in maintaining regional peace and stability. The two countries firmly defend multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation, commit to improving the global governance system, and support increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. China and Pakistan always respect the diversity of civilizations, and advocate the vision of exchanges rather than estrangement, mutual learning rather than conflict, and coexistence rather than seeking superiority.

Common interests deepen our cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative. 46 projects have been completed or under construction, with a total investment of US$25.4 billion. The CPEC successfully helped Pakistan solve the power shortage that has plagued it for decades, established the main traffic line from north to south, and revitalized Gwadar Port to become a regional trade hub. China has been Pakistan’s largest trading partner for six consecutive years and largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years.

The tests of crisis reconfirms our common choice. The two peoples are always the first to lend a helping hand to each other when the other side is in trouble. When Wenchuan earthquake hit China in 2008, and when flood plagued Pakistan in 2010, both sides supported each other with full efforts. After the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the governments, armies and all walks of life of the two countries have rendered mutual assistance, and carried out close cooperation in fields of emergency supplies, Covid-19 prevention experiences-sharing, vaccine research and development, thus setting a model for international cooperation against the pandemic.

2021 is a year of great significance for both China and Pakistan. China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and is implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan to embark on a new journey of modernization. Pakistan is making every effort to develop its economy and realize the Naya Pakistan vision proposed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, providing us with new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation. Standing at a new historic starting point, the two countries should further implement the important consensus reached by our leaders, continue to deepen the iron-clad friendship between China and Pakistan, and jointly build a closer China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future in the New Era.

China will continue to put Pakistan on the top agenda of its diplomacy, and firmly support Pakistan to maintain sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and exert a greater constructive role in international and regional affairs. We will continue to provide Pakistan support of medical supplies and vaccines within our capacity until Pakistan completely defeats the pandemic. Following the principle of mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, opening-up and inclusiveness, China will work with Pakistan to boost high-quality development of the CPEC, focus more on industry, agriculture, science and technology and people’s livelihood, so as to develop Pakistan’s manufacturing industry and increase employment and income of its people. China will continue to work closely with Pakistan to deepen the friendship between the two peoples, especially the young generation. We will endeavor to carry forward the China-Pakistan iron-clad friendship for another 70 years, enhancing the all-weather friendship and all-dimensional cooperation, and work together to uplift China-Pakistan bilateral relations to a new level with a brighter future.

Last but not the least, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Pakistan, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and great respect to Pakistani friends from all circles who care about and support the development of our bilateral relations.

(Str/Xinhua/IANS)

Even as the country’s financial capital Karachi battles intense monsoon flood, experts have warned that Pakistan lacks modern weather forecast radars for timely prediction of flooding. Over the last one week, intense monsoon downpour over Karachi has plagued the city with waterlogging, flash floods and power cuts.

Karachi recorded a whopping 230 mm rainfall in a single day on August 27, making this August the wettest August in 89 years. Overall, at least 39 people have been killed so far in several parts of the country this week.

Monsoon death toll spike to 134

The death toll from rain-related incidents across Pakistan has increased to 134, the country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report.

Sharing the data of casualties from June 15 to August 29 on its website, the NDMA said on Saturday that rescue and relief operations were being carried out in the affected areas by concerned departments of the government, army and non-governmental organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst hit where 48 people were killed and 42 others injured, the authority said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah told a press conference on Friday that 80 people were killed in rains in the province with 47 fatalities in provincial capital Karachi alone.

He said 604-mm rainfall was recorded in Karachi during August, breaking the years-long record of heavy rains in the city during the month. The torrential rains have caused a disastrous situation in Balochistan province where scores were left homeless after their houses were swept away by flash floods triggered off by lashing rains.

The NDMA has provided tents, food items, blankets, mosquito nets, among others, in the affected areas. The authority said scattered thunderstorms and rain with isolated heavy falls are also expected in parts of the country on Sunday. More rainfall is expected later next week.

This year, the meteorological department forecast more than usual rains during the ongoing monsoon season and concerned departments have issued advisories for the general public to take self-precautionary measures.

Pakistan lacks modern flood warning system

Advertisement Despite the annual devastation caused by urban flooding in cities and flash floods in the mountainous areas of Pakistan, the country has neither an effective telemetry system nor authorities said. The monsoon winds are the major source of downpour in the country during the months of July-September.

""The country still does not have an effective aviation system to deal with flood disasters and other catastrophes,"" the National Monsoon Contingency Plan 2020 compiled by the Natural Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed on Saturday.

According to the plan, Pakistan has a medium and long term forecast system capable of accurately predicting the weather for a period of only 7 to 15 days while the seasonal weather forecast accuracy rate is also not more than 65-70 per cent, The Express Tribune reported.

The report indicated that the country is relying on old technology for the weather forecast, which makes it difficult to create standard and accurate atmospheric predictions. There is no telemetry system for flash flood warning in the mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Balochistan.

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Flash floods triggered by heavy rains killed 15 people and damaged scores of houses in Pakistan's scenic northwestern Swat Valley, a spokesman said Wednesday, as rescuers assisted residents in the port city of Karachi where last week's rains wreaked havoc that killed dozens.

The latest floods-related fatalities were reported from the Swat region, a popular tourist destination where landslides overnight blocked a key mountain road, stranding scores of tourists who were being evacuated, said Taimur Khan, spokesman for a disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy monsoon rains hit parts of Pakistan last month, triggering flash floods in the country's financial capital of Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, killing at least 47 people there. Since June, when rains began lashing Pakistan, at least 176 people have been killed across the country, according to the national disaster management agency.

Last week, Karachi's many neighborhoods were flooded and water is still being pump out from submerged streets.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was expected to visit Karachi to meet with residents and get a briefing about damages caused by the monsoon rains, which came as authorities have been trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 296,000 people and killed 6,318 since February.

Pakistan reported 18 more deaths on Wednesday from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

For several kilometres and pretty much as far as the eye could see, there were temporary camps for the flood-affected, dispossessed communities, with families living in hastily erected shelters on the roadside.

Some 136 people have been reported dead and thousands have been displaced in this year’s monsoon season, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The United Nations World Food Programme has reached 11,000 people with emergency food assistance and is calling for $500,000 (£400,000) to increase its reach, particularly in the Sindh region—up to 300,000 people are in need of food assistance.

Communities face serious health risks living in appalling conditions. Flies and mosquitos are everywhere. Getting by is a daily struggle. People walk long distances in search of fresh water—the alternative is to drink from the dirty water along the roadside that children play in. Many do just that.

Women bathe their children in the same water they wash clothes in. Limited supplies of clean water are strictly rationed.

Many farmers lost their cattle in the floods. Some built makeshift shelters for the animals and shared whatever clean water they could spare with them.

For some towns and villages, such as the ones in Mirpurkhas district, we had to travel by motorboat to reach the area. Villagers there told us that they hadn’t seen any outsiders ever since the floods devastated their homes and that all their crops were now gone and possessions lost; no more houses, and nothing to eat.

If they are left alone to fend for themselves, these communities may not able to make it. Their mud houses and fragile livelihoods as subsistence farmers cannot withstand such an onslaught.

Working closely with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in Sindh, the World Food Programme has provided them with food rations — flour, pulses, cooking oil, and nutritious edibles for children to prevent malnutrition from setting in.

At one such distribution site, in Umerkot, one villager asked, “What will happen when this runs out? And how can we rebuild our homes?”

All along the main road of the city of Badin are kilometres and kilometres of hastily erected shelters, with dispossessed families seeking refuge, not knowing when they may be able to have a proper dwelling for themselves to move into.

The devastation is equally visible in an urban slum that we visited in the city of Karachi. Amid damaged houses and roads, children were running around barefoot; mothers with babies navigated puddles of floodwater and sewage.

The effects of climate change are being increasingly felt in Sindh, and they are taking a particularly heavy toll on these communities of subsistence farmers, nomadic tribes, as well as on those living in urban slums. Urgent assistance is required now.

By Rina Saeed Khan

ISLAMABAD, Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Flood-slammed Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, could face worsening urban inundations in coming years, in part as the South Asian monsoon shifts, climate scientists have warned.

The winds that drive Pakistan's annual monsoon, which arrives from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, appear to be altering as a result of climate change, which could push more rainfall to Karachi - and less to key agricultural regions, they said.

""It's new phenomenon and we need to understand it. It hasn't rained like this in Karachi for more than half a century,"" said Shaukat Ali, a meteorologist and senior scientific officer at the Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad.

He said winds driving the monsoon from the Bay of Bengal appear to be shifting it northwards, away from its traditional core zone in the agricultural breadbasket of Punjab.

Winds from the Arabian Sea have traditionally been weak but now seem to be strengthening, Ali said.

This year monsoon winds were ""extremely erratic"", he said, with hotter temperatures in the Arabian Sea leading to monsoon depressions that dumped unexpectedly heavy rainfall on an unprepared Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.

""The sea and winds behaved very differently this monsoon,"" he noted.

RECORD RAINS

Record-breaking heavy rain in Karachi in August killed over 100 people and disrupted the lives of many of the city's more than 15 million residents as water flooded main roads and homes.

The city received its largest-ever-recorded rainfall total in a single day on August 24, when 230 mm (9 inches) of rain fall in just 12 hours, according to the Pakistan Meteorology Department.

Over the month, Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) of rain, the highest total in at least 90 years, it noted.

Heavier rainfall in Karachi this year was in part the result of a La Nina phenomenon, a regular oscillation in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can drive changes in rainfall, said Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

It was likely the larger driver of this year's shift in rainfall, he said.

But as climate change warms oceans, it is also accelerating evaporation of water, which then falls as rain - one significant additional driver of Karachi's floods, he said.

Both scientists have been part of a research effort through GCISC to better predict extreme weather in South Asia and help countries adapt to it.

A paper published by Ashfaq and a dozen international researchers in June, in the journal Climate Dynamics, predicted that unchecked climate-changing emissions could shorten Asian monsoons, with more intense rain falling in a shorter period.

The rest of the year would then have longer dry periods, it said.

These extremes could worsen floods, droughts, wildfires and other weather-related threats that already pose a problem in the region, the scientists said.

CAPTURING WATER

Malik Amin Aslam, the Pakistan prime minister's special assistant on climate change, said the reports indicate the ""frequency and intensity of climate-triggered freak events is going up in Pakistan"".

That was likely to affect not just urban communities but farmers, he said.

""The timing of rains is radically shifting without allowing an agriculture adaptation to adjust to the new reality,"" he said. In a recent trip to Pakistan's mountainous north, he said, he had seen how the shifting South Asian monsoon was accelerating glacier melt, while Karachi and Sindh province's coast were receiving heavy rains that once fell out at sea.

He said Sindh is one of the most climate-impacted regions of the country, with worsening heatwaves also making life difficult for residents.

To deal with increasing extreme rainfall and glacier melt, he said, the country needed to find ways to capture and store ""the huge amounts of water which are becoming available"" in order to recharge aquifers and provide water in dry periods.

Ashfaq agreed that more reservoirs and dams were needed to store water and for flood control. Cities and towns also needed to adapt their infrastructure for extreme rainfall events and move homes away from riverbanks, he said.

Ayaz Younus, 25, died on the way to his first day at a new job when his car became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on March 24.

The Australian resident was the first victim of the floods that ravaged parts of Sydney's west, and had been on the phone to emergency services before he died.

He was a software engineer who had recently completed his masters degree. He was to start his job as a driver for a multinational company.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed because of a coronial inquiry as well as efforts to have his family attend the funeral from Pakistan.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia has helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

It said a request for Mr Younus' three siblings to fly from Pakistan had been denied by the Australian government.

His parents arrived in Australia on Sunday and immediately went into quarantine.

The association said the man's parents had been given an exemption by the Australian government to attend part of the funeral, and it hoped it could negotiate for the parents to be able to attend the burial site.

Hamad Chaudhry, who knew Mr Younus through the association, remembers him as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

""Ayaz was a very happy and friendly person who loved his sport and was extremely community-minded. He is deeply missed,"" Mr Chaudhry told AAP.

""It's been very important to help get his parents out to Australia, and his siblings will be watching the funeral virtually.""

Mr Younus is remembered as an active volunteer, planting trees in his community in western Sydney and donating his time to various charities.

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered aid to be delivered to Parwan and other provinces, while expressing his condolences to the victims' families.

Disaster management ministry spokesman Ahmad Tameem Azimi said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces, and that teams were working to reopen the roads to traffic.

He added that at least 300 houses were destroyed in Parwan and over a thousand people displaced, and that ground and air support sent to help those trapped by the flooding had reached the provinces.

Hundreds of acres of agricultural land have been destroyed, with rain wiping out crops in eastern Nuristan province.

Mr Azimi said that houses and roads were also destroyed in northern Kapisa, Panjshir and eastern Paktia provinces.

Two people died and five others were also injured in eastern Maidan Wardak province after flooding destroyed several homes there.

And in Nangarhar, located in the eastern part of Afghanistan, two members of a family died and four others were injured on Wednesday when the wall of their house collapsed in flooding.

KARACHI, Pakistan -- Three days of heavy monsoon rains triggering flash floods killed at least 58 people in various parts of Pakistan, as troops with boats rushed Sunday to evacuate people from flood-affected districts in the country's southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.

According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, eight in Punjab province and 10 in the country's scenic northern Gligit Baltistan region in the past three days.

Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.

Heavy rains also lashed many districts in the southwestern Baluchistan province, killing eight people, damaging homes and inundating many villages in the district of Jhal Magsi, according to Saleem Zakir, spokesman for provincial disaster management authority. He said rescuers with the army’s help were still trying to evacuate people from the district's flood-hit villages.

He said floods damaged a bridge and a gas pipeline and destroyed coastal roads on the Arabian Sea, severing links to the port of Gwadar, part of China’s multi-billion dollar one-road project linking south and Central Asia to China.

According to local media reports, hundreds of people moved to nearby hills when the floodwaters entered their villages in remote areas of Baluchistan, and the military used helicopters and boats to move them to safer places. Authorities were dispatching tents and food for the flood-affected people.

Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.

According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.

In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.

29,29,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Graveyards in Rawalpindi city running out of space - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1625120,"RAWALPINDI: The shortage of space in existing graveyards of the city has been a cause for concern among residents of the city as the government continues to ignore the issue.

Almost 90pc of Rawalpindi’s graveyards are short on space to accommodate fresh requests to bury the dead. There are more than 60 small and big graveyards in the garrison city and 10 in cantonment areas.

All main graveyards of the city including Ratta Amral, Pirwadhai, Eidgah, Shan Diyan Talian, Kuri Road, Dhoke Khaba, Dhoke Illahi Buksh, Dhoke Kashmirian, Cha Sultan, Malikan Da Kabristan, and the one near Committee Chowk do not have space for new graves. Yet, grave diggers dig new graves over unattended ones to accommodate requests that cannot be turned down.

During a survey, Dawn found encroachments along graveyards whereas due to limited space, managements of graveyard committees have also been charging higher prices for new graves. All graveyards are without boundary walls and land grabbers have managed to carry out construction in their surrounding areas; the worst affected is one of the oldest graveyards of Rawalpindi whereas the Dhoke Ratta and Pirwadhai graveyards also present the same picture.

Management of the graveyards had dug new graves along the bank of the nullah passing through the area but during monsoon, flood water destroys them, creating problems for the heirs.

The Eidgah graveyard is accommodating new arrivals as the management extended limits of the graveyard along the banks of the nullah.

Racecourse graveyard in cantonment is also running out of space. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) imposed a ban on new arrivals in the graveyard and asked that limited space be allocated for only army personnel.

Mohammad Nasir, resident of Mohanpura, said that his father died two months ago and he visited all the graveyards near his locality but they refused to bury his father. He said he talked to a grave-digger in Dhoke Illahi Buksh who managed to provide a space between two graves for his deceased father.

A resident of Chaklala Scheme III, Mudassir Malik said his brother died a few weeks ago and his family faced difficulty in finding a place to bury the deceased as there was no space available in Chaklala Scheme-III graveyard.

He said he paid Rs30,000 to the graveyard near Chungi Stop adjacent to Scheme-III. The government should allocate space for a graveyard in the city. In mid-90’s, 1000 kanals of land was allocated for the purpose in Rakh Dhamial but since the last 26 years, all governments failed to develop the graveyard.

In 2017, the PML-N government had launched project Shehr-e-Khamoshan and started work to construct a funeral prayer site, mosque, ablution area and other facilities but the graveyard is still not being utilised.

On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested in burying their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamial as it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the deceased and people to attend funeral prayers.

RDA, which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and managing housing societies across the district has failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards. Under the law, every private housing society has to allocate space for graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and it has to be transferred in the name of the state.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said that the ruling party has failed to develop graveyards. “We do not expect good from them as they are snatching bread from the people. How can they provide facilities?” he said.

The PML-N government in its tenure developed the Rakh Dhamial graveyard but work on it was stopped by the present government just to get political revenge from PML-N.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi said that development of graveyards was the government’s priority. When contacted, Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) Chief officer Ali Abbas Bukhari said Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat directed to speed up work to develop Rakh Dhamial graveyard and make it functional as soon as possible.

He said that RMC purchased two funeral buses so families could transport deceased persons to the graveyard. “We are providing free of cost service to citizens in the garrison city for use of funeral buses. We will purchase two more buses soon,” he said, adding there is an acute shortage of graveyards in the city making burial of the dead a great problem for the bereaved families.

The Pakistan Red Cross Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is assessing the evolution of the current monsoon rainfalls and its impacts during the next few days.

The situation

Heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan from 6 – 7 August 2020 with intermissions. This Monsoon rains created floods situation in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu. However, Tehsil Johi of District Dadu is the area which is greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods not only damaged the houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh already declared 80 villages of District Dadu as “Calamity Affected Areas’’. The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad and Jhal Magsi.

PRCS is already working together with the government, Movement partners and other organizations for COVID19 Response. The changing Scenario of i.e. floods/flash floods may increase the risks of COVID-19 spread in the affected communities. It has been reported that due to floods, many communities are forced to live together in small camps. The initial reports suggested that District Dadu of Sindh and District Jhal Magsi, Sibi, Harnai, Naseeabad and Kachi of Baluchistan are the worst-hit areas. However, administration is still in process of damage and need assessment as most of the communication channels are also broken in some affected areas. The floods also destroyed standing crops and greatly affected the livelihood of inhabitants.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Situation Report No.13 as of 13 August 2020, heavy monsoon rainfall has caused flooding and damages in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces over the last few days. The report indicates that as of date 82 people have lost their lives and 28 injuries, while 873 houses are fully damaged while 186 partially damaged.

In Baluchistan, 13 people have died in floods in recent days, with many more reportedly missing. Over 861 homes are fully damaged and 46 partially damaged. Flooding struck in the districts of Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Gwadar, Pasni, Kachi and Dera Bugti from 7 August 2020. Severe flooding occurred in the west of the province from 8 August after flood water from Baluchistan made its way downstream along the Nai Gaj river.

Meanwhile in Sindh Province, heavy rainfall from 6 August caused flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sakrand, Tando Jam, Dadu and Thatta. The floods caused 31 death. Hundreds of people were rescued by military personnel. Formal requests by district government through Deputy Commissioners of respective districts including situation of damages possibly with numbers/figures and required support in terms of food and non-food on immediate basis is expected.

The government is responding the situation and Pakistan army is carrying the Search & Rescue and evacuation operation. Some of the steps taken by government are as follows.

• 299 persons evacuated using 10 boats in district Dadu district by Armed Forces.

• PDMA Baluchistan Emergency Operational Center and DDMAs control rooms are functional and on high alert.

• Damage assessment by district government in Baluchistan is being conducted.

There are concerns for the spread of COVID-19 and water-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, as a large-scale humanitarian operation gathers pace across Sindh province in Pakistan’s south-east.

Khuram Gondal, Save the Children’s Country Director in Pakistan, said:

“During the current monsoon, Sindh province has experienced some of the heaviest rainfall for nearly 90 years and more heavy rains are expected.

“More than 4 million people have been impacted by the monsoon floods and that’s equivalent to the population of a city the size of Rome.

“Make no mistake, this is an under-reported humanitarian catastrophe deserving of more attention, which would stretch the resources of the most powerful and richest nations on the planet.”

One of the major impacts of the floods is on crops and livestock. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmlands have been damaged, leading to fears for the supply of food.

“We are hearing that in many flood-affected communities only about three per cent of households have received food assistance, with food stocks running out in five to nine days’ time, depending on whether people live in rural or urban areas,” warned Mr Gondal.

There are worries for the disruption of children’s education, too.

“A thorough assessment of the full flood damage to schools is urgently required, but in one district of Sindh our teams found damage to scores of schools, with some destroyed completely.

“As a result, we expect long-term disruption to the education of boys and girls. We are also concerned that the damage to schools may aggravate the high school drop-out ratio of children, especially girls.

“Partially damaged schools are not safe or ready to accommodate students returning after several months of learning gaps due to COVID-19, therefore an urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction approach is needed,” said Mr Gondal.

The intense rains and floods that have battered Pakistan’s Sindh province raise the alarm for climate change, warns Save the Children.

“We know that extreme and erratic weather events pose a growing threat to children’s ability to thrive. It’s therefore never been more important for climate vulnerable communities to be supported to cope with and adapt to climate change, as well as build their resilience to hazards like floods,” added Mr Gondal.

There are fears that today’s floods could eclipse the floods from a decade ago, especially if the monsoon rains continue as predicted. But during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, international media attention led to a huge humanitarian relief effort.

“The Pakistani authorities are working very hard to support their people, but they need urgent support from the international community,” said Mr Gondal.

In response to the floods, Save the Children has mobilised humanitarian aid workers and supplies to:

Provide 400 households with emergency tents

Provide 700 of the most vulnerable households with emergency food rations

Pump water out of main roads to ensure access to school buildings and basic health units

At least two people were killed and more than a dozen were injured as torrential rains damaged houses in Panjgur district of Balochistan.

The torrential rains and hailstones started Friday afternoon caused flood and mud, debris and rainwater entered into houses in Tusp Khuda-Badan, Girmakan, Wasbod Kilag, Irap, Damb and other areas of the district.

“We did not break fast till late evening as water entered our house and we were trying to keep our stuff safe,” said Anwar Azad, a resident of Dumb. He added flood not only destroyed our valuable stuff and furniture but also damaged walls of our house.

According to locals of the area, walls of more than a hundred houses in Dumb, Irap, Qadirsbad, Saravan and adjacent areas were collapsed and dozens of livestock and two vehicles were washed away in the flash floods, while the situation compelled people to spend whole night in open sky.

Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Abdul Razzaq Sasoli, SP Captain (retd) Zuhaib Mushin, Commandant Frontier Corps (FC) Panjgur Rifles and other officials visited the flood-affected areas, examined the damages caused by flash floods and assured public of financial and manpower support.

Sasoli assured people that Levies, police and FC men were on the ground helping affected people and taking part in rescue operation, adding the government would compensate flood-affected people.

Following the situation emerged after heavy rain and flood, Panjgur Rifles FC set up an emergency cell in the town through which affectees would be assisted.

“All flood-affectees are directed to submit their claims and other details with Emergency Cell or contact officials at the helpline, 0855641240,” said Panjgur FC in a statement issued on Saturday.

35,35,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"How to detect, resist and counter the flood of fake news - Science News Magazine",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy,"From lies about election fraud to QAnon conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine falsehoods, misinformation is racing through our democracy. And it is dangerous.

Awash in bad information, people have swallowed hydroxychloroquine hoping the drug will protect them against COVID-19 — even with no evidence that it helps (SN Online: 8/2/20). Others refuse to wear masks, contrary to the best public health advice available. In January, protestors disrupted a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles, blocking life-saving shots for hundreds of people. “COVID has opened everyone’s eyes to the dangers of health misinformation,” says cognitive scientist Briony Swire-Thompson of Northeastern University in Boston.

The pandemic has made clear that bad information can kill. And scientists are struggling to stem the tide of misinformation that threatens to drown society. The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, 83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.

Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information — and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what they’re looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.

Wow factor

Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with “troll farms” in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.

Some people unwittingly share misinformation on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented — whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)

Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. “Seeing is believing,” Sundar says.

Video sells WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic — in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine. S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand. Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement T. Tibbitts T. Tibbitts Source: S.S. Sundar and E. Cho/Penn State and M. Molina/Michigan State Univ.

The findings, in press at the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. “People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form,” Sundar says. That’s especially important with the rise of deepfake technologies that feature false but visually convincing videos (SN: 9/15/18, p. 12).

One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once it’s there. We’re constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it,” she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.

Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist because of the influence of their emotions and values, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives — or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.

One such approach is to “prebunk” beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change canceled any benefit of receiving the true information. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined people’s understanding of what was true.

That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information before giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that “Charles Darwin” and “members of the Spice Girls” were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.

Here’s a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, Bad News, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called GO VIRAL! Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.

Take a breath

Sometimes it doesn’t take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what they’re doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.

In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as “Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling,” with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants’ analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, lazy thinking rather than political bias may drive people’s susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in Cognition.

When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into people’s behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm people’s reasoning skills when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.

Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to “nudge” the concept of accuracy into people’s minds, helping them resist misinformation. “It’s basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form,” he says. “We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.”

Push in the right direction Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge. Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing T. Tibbitts Source: G. Pennycook et al/Nature 2021

With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation — Breitbart and InfoWars — Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.

On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. It’s a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges — but the work, reported online March 17 in Nature, suggests that very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect.

For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as “true” or “false” after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

How to debunk Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if you’re fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers: Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.

Don’t stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or you’re more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.

Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.

When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).

Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check after someone reads a headline can be helpful, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.

Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.

Misinformation researchers have recently called for social media companies to share more of their data so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users’ privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.

Much of the work to date on misinformation’s spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.

A recent study examines the link between power structures and vulnerability to flash floods in Reshun. The vulnerable location of Reshun, a village in Upper Chitral District in the northwest of Pakistan, leaves it exposed to natural disaster hazards. It sits along the seismically active Hindu Kush mountain range—and at the base of a drainage stream for the massive Chitral glaciers. While the risk of glacial flooding is regional, the vulnerabilities among Reshun's residents are far from equal, according to study authors Ishaq Khan and Inam Ullah Leghari, a graduate student and professor at the Department of Anthropology at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.

Members of Chitral's lowest serf class, cheermuzh, have long lived in stark marginalization. Now as glacial floods in Reshun grow more frequent due to climate change, low-income residents with little access to political power are left increasingly without options. The floods disproportionately devastate cheermuzh communities, and aid has been insufficient. As Hamna Tariq, a junior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center, told GlacierHub, ""They tough it out, until they cannot.""

Outside the polar regions, Pakistan is one of the world's major centers of glacial ice. Over 7,000 known glaciers lie within its borders and more than 500 of these glaciers are in the remote Chitral valley. The entire area is at risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are outpours of meltwater caused by glacial dam failure. However, exposure to GLOFs is highly varied and determined by one's social status.

Chitral society is divided into four classes—the highest of which is ""adamzade"" (proper human), and the lowest of which is a serf class, cheermuzh, often referred to as ""beizzat"" (without respect) and ""ghalamus"" (slave). True to a serfdom-like system, upper classes grant land to cheermuzh to live and farm on, which they retain by providing services to their landlords. This hierarchy is not just functional, but reflective of social attitudes toward low-status residents; a Chitral resident of lordly descent opposed the construction of a water pipe in his village on the grounds that he could not drink the same water as cheermuzh.

Like the village's social organization, vulnerabilities to glacial lake outburst floods are unequal and hierarchized. Reshun's cheermuzh communities reside by a stream flowing between two mountains. Flash floods linked to heavy rains and GLOFs annually devastate these communities.

The impacts of the 2013 and 2015 flash floods, in particular, illustrate their disproportionate effect on low-status residents. Khan and Leghari found that the 2013 Reshun flood's damage was concentrated in three mostly cheermuzh hamlets —Panandeh, Batikandeh, and Golguch. Only families in these hamlets lost their homes or livestock, an important food source and financial asset. There were 23 fully damaged and 16 partially damaged houses. The flooding also destroyed the hamlets' drinking water supply line and the bridges connecting them to evacuation routes.

Though these low-status residents were stranded, help didn't come for days. Aid workers were even instructed not to go into the hamlets as a precautionary measure. One resident, Ashraf Khan, told the study authors how he and his family were forced to spend one week outside, unaided and unsheltered, after their home was destroyed.

Two years later, the flash floods were even worse. Nearly 100 houses were fully damaged, 86 of which belonged to low-status households, including Khan's. His family was one of 30 low-status households whose homes were destroyed twice, in both 2013 and 2015. As mentioned in the study, all of these households had rebuilt their homes in the same place, as they had nowhere else to live. On the other hand, five households whose homes were destroyed in the 2013 flood and who could afford to move elsewhere were unaffected in 2015.

The 2015 flood also completely washed away the road connecting the three hamlets to the main road. ""Flash flood isolated us from the rest of the world,"" said another resident, Sher Muhammad, who was quoted in the study. Now, not only were cheermuzh socially marginalized, but they were also physically isolated.

Muhammad is also involved in Golguch's anti-grazing movement. As glacial lake outburst floods have become more frequent, goat grazing near Reshun's nearby glaciers has become a controversial issue. According to anti-grazers, grazing intensifies flooding by breaking the soil surrounding the nearby glaciers. Khan, the graduate student who co-authored the article, wrote to GlacierHub that grazing is ""mostly supported by lordly families,"" who are not at the highest risk of flooding, while opponents of grazing are mostly from low-status backgrounds. This divide is indicative of the class-based vulnerabilities to GLOFs and the tensions that have risen as a result.

Without any prospect that GLOFs will subside in a warming climate, Reshun's cheermuzh residents are left without many options. Writing to GlacierHub, Hamna Tariq highlighted the need for government aid: ""Granted these regions are nestled between dangerous landscapes, more can still be done like providing better warning systems, immediate flood relief aid, temporary housing, and employment opportunities.""

The article's authors, Khan and Muhammad, emphasize the importance of addressing power structures in addition to the floods. They write that ""the effectiveness of mitigation and relief programs for such communities can only be achieved if the political structure of the past and its perpetual effect could be understood.""

As the study illustrates, Reshun residents like Ashraf Khan and Sher Muhammad face the severe dangers of glacial flooding due to no fault of their own, but as a result of their socioeconomic marginalization. The paper's conclusions affirm the need not only to address GLOF-related impacts, but also the class inequities that create these unequal vulnerabilities. Failing to address this two-fold crisis is to fail these residents and all others at the frontlines of climate change.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

First spell of heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan Province from 6 August and continued until 7 August 2020 with intermissions. Continuous rain over a period of 24 hours caused massive flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu districts of Sindh province, with Tehsil Johi in Dadu district as the area greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods are not only damaging infrastructures and houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh has declared 80 villages in Dadu district as “Calamity Affected Areas’’.

The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad, Jafferabad and Jhal Magsi districts where Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts as the most affected areas according to the rapid need assessment report. On 18 August 2020, the Government of Baluchistan also declared emergency in Jhal Magsi district. Besides the recent floods, COVID-19 outbreak is also a threat to the affected population. However, the number of positive cases reported so far in the targeted district are on lower side. As of 7 September 2020, Dadu district reported 1,184 positive cases, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad (Baluchistan) 328 and 71 reported positive COVID-19 cases respectively.

Another heavy spell of Monsoon rain started in most part of the country on 20 August 2020 and continued until 3 September 2020 with intervals. This resulted in urban flooding in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, while flash floods reported in district Shangla, Swat and flooding in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Karachi experienced heaviest rains in almost a century, killing at least 41 people in the city. Thousands of people were trapped due to waterlogging in low-lying slums.

2.5 million people have been affected by floods which devasted Sindh Province in late August.

71,500 people received in-kind food assistance during WFP’s first phase of the response between September and early October.

117,000 people will receive cash assistance under WFP’s second phase of the response. Among them, 26,658 people have already been reached.

Highlights

• WFP initiated a second phase of relief assistance in November 2020 to meet persistent humanitarian needs in Sindh’s flood affected districts. Cash transfers under this second phase are expected to be completed by early January.

• Following the relief phase, WFP plans to focus on recovery efforts in 2021 together with its government and development partners, to rebuild livelihoods and rehabilitate assets that can support sustainable food security.

WFP Funding Requirements

• WFP’s ongoing relief assistance is fully funded.

• WFP is currently seeking contributions to support recovery activities planned in 2021.

Situation Update

• The floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton.

• Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

• The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

WFP Response

• On 10 November, WFP started distributing unconditional cash assistance to vulnerable floodaffected households who had not yet received in-kind food assistance from WFP in September. Distributions are being carried out in the three most affected districts: Umerkot, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas.

• Each targeted household is receiving a multipurpose cash transfer of PKR 15,000 (approximately USD 90), distributed in two tranches.

• Sensitization sessions on nutrition and hygiene practices are also being carried out at distribution points and through village development committees, with a focus on pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. Sensitization sessions also cover precautionary measures against the spread of COVID19 and dengue virus.

• As of 15 December, WFP and its partners, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and Secours Islamique France (SIF) have distributed cash assistance to 26,658 people.

• WFP plans to distribute assistance to another 90,342 people by early January 2021.

• Following the completion of this relief cash assistance in January 2021, WFP is looking to support the Sindh Government’s recovery efforts. Working with Government and development partners, WFP is in the process of designing livelihoods recovery programmes, including cash-for-asset and disaster risk reduction activities, to reduce the impacts of future floods and droughts.","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549279-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%235%20%2816%20Dec%202020%29.png?itok=93hsgBQs,"['development', 'situation', 'food', 'response', 'relief', 'pakistan', '2020', 'recovery', 'assistance', 'cash', 'report', 'wfp', 'flood', 'wfps', '16', 'sindh', 'phase', 'affected']", ,flood

By Henrike Brecht and Ahsan Tehsin

Mehar Khan, 54, had poured his life’s savings into building a modest home for his family in Naya Nazimabad, a housing society in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Karachi was particularly hard hit by torrential rains in August which caused around $1 billion in national economic damage and loss. Streets across the city turned into rivers and washed away many houses. Mehar’s family was one among thousands stranded in inundated parts of the city for days.

Pakistan’s financial and economic center, Karachi with its 16 million inhabitants is home to the country's largest corporations and main ports. Its economy has grown steadily for decades - last year its GDP was nearly $164 billion. The city has also made impressive progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2015.

Now, Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success? It doesn’t have to. Moving forward, the city can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction:

Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success?

First, the sewage network needs an urgent overhaul. Karachi can reap large benefits from the development and implementation of a comprehensive Drainage and Stormwater Master Plan for the entire city. The World Bank is helping large cities implement drainage solutions for the 21st century and adapt to climate change, for example, in Yangon, Myanmar or Manila, Philippines.

Second, comprehensive solutions for solid waste management are important. Of the 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste generated each day in Karachi, 60 percent does not reach a dumpsite, and trash accumulates in drainage pipes. Across the globe, cities are employing new approaches to solid waste management, focusing on reduction and recycling. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $4.7 billion to more than 340 solid waste management programs, for instance, in Indonesia or China.

Third, moving towards sponge city concept to absorb rainwater, prioritizing green infrastructure and permeable surfaces will go a long way to counter floods and heat. Instead of carrying the water away, these sponge cities treat it as a resource that is filtered by the soil and then stored. This ensures the economic and sustainable use of the valuable natural resource that fresh water constitutes. It also helps the city cool down through evaporation. This would involve stopping encroachment into urban wetlands and increasing water infiltration through greening, which would reduce the need for costly storm water drainage systems in the city. China’s Sponge Cities Initiative provides $12 billion to more than 30 of its cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan, with the aim of re-using 70 percent of rainwater in 80 percent of the urban areas which are part of the program.

Karachi can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction.

Comprehensive policy changes would be as equally important as targeted investments to reduce flooding in Karachi. Responsibilities between agencies at national, provincial and local levels need to be clearly defined. Coordination among the different jurisdictions to develop entire-city approaches need to replace administrative fragmentation. Risk-sensitive land-use plans and their enforcement must ensure that new development takes place away from the most at-risk zones. New infrastructure and risk reduction strategies cannot be developed separately. These measures need to converge to help reduce the city’s vulnerability in the long-term, for example, through building code development and enforcement. Strengthening Karachi’s emergency management response systems through drills and equipment will also reduce the impacts of disasters.

Challenging the status quo will not be easy. For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

But changing course will be cost-effective in the long-term. Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Plan 2012–22 ranks Karachi as the country’s most vulnerable district. Karachi is not only prone to floods but also to earthquakes, cyclones and more recently, heatwaves. Pakistan is also the fifth most affected country by climate change. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, they will severely impact people’s livelihoods and Karachi’s economic competitiveness.

For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

The good news is that Karachi can benefit from existing developments and build on initial achievements. Pakistan shifted to an ex-ante disaster risk management approach after the 2005 earthquake. A National Flood Protection Plan, Pakistan’s investments in nature-based solutions and reforestation programs along with the Karachi Transformative Strategy pave the way. The World Bank continues to strengthen Karachi’s efforts to become more resilient. It committed $652 million in 2019 to reinforce the city’s infrastructure and institutions with a focus on urban management, public transport, safe water, and sanitation.

Karachi also benefits from the Sindh Resilience Project, which invests in flood protection works and integrates disaster risk reduction in planning processes. The Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project and the Hydromet and Climate Services Project also support climate sensitive and sustainable solutions.

The World Bank stands ready to assist Karachi in moving forward to become a world-class inclusive, sustainable and more livable city.","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['largest', 'city', 'building', 'management', 'climate', 'pakistan', 'need', 'economic', 'water', 'karachi', 'floods', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'world', 'risk']", ,flood

(Photo: Reuters)

Pakistan has been reeling under floods for the past three months, leading to the loss of hundreds of lives. However, leave alone its neighbours or the rest of the world, even people in Pakistan are hardly talking about it.

The first indications of the worsening flood situation were noticed when a recently established UK-based NGO called Muslim Aid started collecting funds for Pakistanis.

Latest satellite images from Sentinel were accessed by India Today OSINT team and compared with three-month-old images to understand the extent of flood damage in Pakistan.

These are false colour images taken using a combination of infrared and visible light that clearly distinguishes between land, which appears bright green, and water that appears black.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been providing situation reports that have been ignored by most government ministries. The latest NDMA report indicates 400 deaths and damages to over 2 lakh houses.

While damage to infrastructure is maximum in Sindh province, the highest deaths have been reported from Sindh and Punjab. More than 6 lakh acres of crops have suffered damage in Mirpur Khas and Dadu districts alone. The next few days are crucial as yet another spate of rains is expected by NDMA.

(Photo: India Today)

The satellite images, when compared to previous years’ data, indicate that no action has been taken by Pakistan to either resettle victims or alleviate threats since the deadly 2010 floods.

The administration has made no effort to train the rivers properly. River banks haven’t been lined and bridges across the Indus are under danger of getting washed away. Road approaches stall water overflowing the riverside, thus, endangering the complete bridge infrastructure. The Dadu Moro Bridge is a classic example of this type of possible future damage that can be assessed from satellite imagery.

(Photo: India Today)

The Indus River is clearly not trained at the bridge site with either retainer walls or embankments, thus, overflowing the divergent guide banks. The next large gush of flood waters will certainly damage this bridge’s western side severely.

Large areas in Jacobabad, including parts of Shahbaz Air Base, are also under water. Shahbaz is one of the most important air bases of Pakistan Air Force. It has fighter and transporter jets along with a huge ammunition depot. In the last decade, Pakistan suffered severe floods in 2007 and 2010 when damage to property was almost $40-$50 billion.

(Photo: India Today)

In 2010, the air base supposedly suffered the worst damage in PAF history when most of the ammunition, including air-to-surface missiles, had come under water.

Recent satellite images indicate that although water released from Guddu Barrage had entered the area, it did not cross the retainer wall constructed by PAF on the northern side of the air base.","Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202009/pak_flood_reuters-647x363.png?EISsNEMGRC6wauOuHeyf11Lzu3Ld6BRF,"['months', 'air', 'pakistan', 'satellite', 'water', 'damage', 'images', 'bridge', 'extent', 'flood', 'india', 'suffered']", ,flood

Cyclone, Weather forecast Highlights: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday said the Severe Cyclonic Storm “Tauktae” over eastcentral Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 13 kmph during past 6 hours.

It lay centred over eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 14.2°N and longitude 72.7°E at 2030 hours IST on Saturday, about 190 km southwest of Panjim-Goa, 550 km south of Mumbai, 780 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 910 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening.

As it would bring very heavy rainfall in that region, cities like Mumbai would not be affected much, the IMD added.

There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 17 over north Konkan, including Mumbai,

the IMD said.

The Maharashtra capital can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, said Shubhani Bhute, senior director (weather) IMD, Mumbai. The storm is currently 250 km south-west of Goa, she added.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated. He also called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, a statement said.","Sun, 16 May 2021 04:02:27 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/TVM-1200.jpeg,"['km', 'eastcentral', 'winds', 'mumbai', 'diu', 'imd', 'cyclonic', 'weather', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'storm', 'highlights', 'severe', 'tauktae', 'gujarat', 'cyclone', 'arabian', 'sea']", ,none

It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

“The frontline volunteers of our disaster management committees (DMCs) continued rescue efforts during heavy rains and helped in saving people and their belongings in low-lying areas.”

Father James Shamaun parish priest of St. Thomas Catholic Church in Wah Cantonment, a military city in Punjab province, shared the devastation in a Facebook Live video recorded on July 25. The priest described visiting a flooded church in Taxila, another city of the Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.

“The river is flooded. We pray here every Sunday evening. We cannot reach there in this situation. We shall pray here depending on the weather,” he said. The clip has been viewed more than 3,300 times.

Meanwhile, Caritas is developing a response plan for a flood emergency this year. The charity has inspired DMCs in all six dioceses and the apostolic prefecture, empowering disaster-prone communities to help themselves.

Amjad Gulzar, executive director of Caritas Pakistan, said the floods will worsen livelihood challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Covid-19 has changed the scenario of country. Rain-related damages have added to the losses of the poor and daily wagers struggling amid the lockdown,"" he said.

“DMCs have been especially instructed to observe social distancing and SOPs [standard operating procedures] in rescue and relief efforts. Our response plan includes food kits, hygiene kits, shelter and non-food items.”

47,47,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Unravelling the urban flood - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577689,"Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation.

Every year, natural disasters claim around 90,000 lives and affect more than 150 million around the world. Among these, floods pose the most intense threat to lives and livelihoods, bludgeoning communities large and small, and inundating large swathes of land across borders. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected nearly a third of the global population, or 2 billion people worldwide. Beyond the obvious impact on infrastructure and utilities, flooding is a harbinger of a multitude of long-term effects, including economic losses, loss of means of livelihood, ecological changes, and public health challenges.

Floods are the most damaging natural hazard in Pakistan with 26 major events having ravaged the country since 1950. The 2010 “super flood” alone affected 20 million people, and caused direct and indirect losses worth nearly $10 billion. Since then a major flood event occurred at least once each year, affecting millions more. In the past five years or so, urban flooding has gained a strong foothold in Pakistan, becoming almost synonymous with the monsoon season. It is becoming increasingly evident that current policy, planning, and implementation mechanisms for urban flood management are not effective within the context of climate change.

Emerging Climate Challenges

A growing body of research supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has established close linkages between climate change and disaster risk. Whilst climate change cannot be attributed directly to any one major disaster — for example, the urban flooding in Karachi — it does point to an alteration of the global atmosphere. These alterations, caused by human activities such as deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, and other commercial and industrial practices, coupled with the likelihood of more extreme weather events in the future, are likely to increase the frequency and scale of disasters.

Also read: Early downpour exposes Karachi’s drainage flaws

The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and socio-economic impact. The 2019 CRI ranked Pakistan as the 8th most affected country when it comes to extreme weather events. The report went on to add that “countries like….Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The same report placed India at the 14th spot in terms of impact of extreme weather events.

Between 80-90% of all documented natural disasters in the past decades have, on average, been a result of floods, heat waves, droughts, and storms.

Floods, in particular, are increasing in frequency and intensity, and extreme variations in precipitation are expected to contribute to flooding in areas that have historically remained immune.

A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) evaluated the high risk of floods and droughts during the monsoon season. The report pointed out that over eight million people would be exposed to flood risk in Pakistan this year alone.

High risk areas for floods in South Asia

The South Asian monsoon, characterised by concentrated rainfall between June and September, is the lifeline of the agricultural sector in the region, irrigating as much as 55% of cultivated land. Over the past few years, however, researchers have noticed wide temporal and spatial variations in monsoon rainfall. Erratic monsoon patterns have seen a shift of rainfall not only in geographical terms, but also onset and withdrawal. This has resulted in devastating floods throughout the region, claiming scores of lives.

Last week, at least 40 lives were lost as a result of urban flooding in Karachi. Massive cracks in the city’s administrative and operational infrastructure surfaced with every conceivable flood hazard — from cars being swept away by rainwater to collapsing houses to electrocution and even landsliding — becoming a harsh reality. Whilst this does not undermine incidences of riverine and flash flooding throughout the rest of Pakistan, it does indicate that a new, rapid phenomenon in densely populated areas is taking shape: that of urban flooding.

Urban floods are a consequence of meteorological factors, such as intense precipitation, and human actions, such as land use change, occupation of flood plains, alteration of natural water courses, and inadequate drainage and sanitation infrastructure. As soon as precipitation exceeds the capacity of an urban area’s drainage system which includes sewers, gutters, open channels, natural and manmade pathways to a receiving water body — urban flooding occurs. In the weeks leading up to perhaps what will historically be remembered as Pakistan’s biggest urban flood, it became abundantly clear that existing drainage channels were already operating below capacity. A combination of factors, including informal settlements driven by urbanisation, and poor solid waste management directly contributed to this loss of capacity.

More on this | What causes urban flooding? Hint: It’s not just rain

Stripping away land cover and vegetation in the name of “development” to make way for buildings, roads, and bridges not only alters natural water flow channels; it also greatly diminishes water absorption and storage capacity of the soil. As a result, when precipitation runoff flows rapidly across the surface, in short, intense, high-volume bursts rather than sinking into the soil. Not only does this overload a city’s drainage system, but considerably more rainwater ends up in sewers and directly flows off into water bodies, instead of recharging ground water sources. The obstruction of drainage systems, ditches, and other pathways by solid waste and refuse can block channels, causing the water to back up and spread laterally into commercial and residential areas. Many communities did not know that until they found water coursing through their houses, streets, and commercial buildings. Thus, a confluence of disorganised implementation of urban infrastructure such as bridges and embankments obstructing runoff, reduced drainage channel availability due to backfilling, deposition of sediments and refuse in canals and waterways, and archaic drainage and sanitation infrastructure, contributed to the devastation in Karachi.

Policymaking for urban flood management

A recent study in the United States on flood policy noted severe shortcomings in the ability to project the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. Given high levels of uncertainty, policy-making for flood planning & response may be even more difficult and fraught than it already is. Vulnerability of urban systems increases as population density increases, and the effects are multiplied when flooding damages electrical, transportation, communication and other support systems.

Whilst the direct impact of urban flooding — such as inundation of streets and residences, losses and damages to property and vehicles, and destruction of infrastructure — are easily visible, it is the indirect impact that leaves longer lasting effects. For example, the public health threat as a result of untreated sewage or chemical runoff from industrial areas mixing with water sources; the loss of livelihoods for certain periods of time; and the inability to travel to work. Those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale will have a lower capacity to respond and recover, placing ever greater demands on existing social and community service mechanisms.

Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation. The losses in terms of property, productivity, livelihood, and quality of life demand a socioeconomic approach to flood risk management, one that focuses not just on rescue and relief, but also the rehabilitation of communities to the same or a better state that they were in before disaster struck. Future policies should thus address:

— The challenges posed by climate change

— The major economic, environmental, financial, political and social issues likely to impact urban development and urban flood management

— Ancillary payoffs (such as environmental, economic, or social) of pursuing adaptive strategies

Infrastructure management practices for urban flooding

Flooding is the most hazardous consequence of intense precipitation, and even small increases in precipitation can have inordinately large effects on the drainage system. Research based on actual events and simulations indicates that a “20 per cent increase in precipitation in a single event leads to a 365 per cent increase in flood volume and the number of at-risk buildings increases by 120 per cent”.

Drainage and flood control infrastructure is largely designed based on 25-, 50- or 100-year flood frequencies, and historic trends. However, as is becoming increasingly evident, past history may no longer be a reliable guide to future events, especially in the context of urban flooding. Drainage systems, developed and built over decades, are only as good as the weakest connecting link. Decisions made during the scoping and early design stages, when urban sprawl and population were both limited, can have significant impact on outcomes few years down the road. Changes and modifications made at later stages are not always possible or cost effective, which makes both under-sizing and over-sizing of the infrastructure equally problematic: extensive damage in the first case; and excessive expenditures in the second.

Furthermore, focusing on technical and engineering issues in tackling flooding has become somewhat of a national trend, which discounts the influence of social characteristics and circumstances. This bias can actually encourage development in areas where hazard risk may surpass technological solutions. Similarly, efforts to manage urban floods by focusing on the flow and its transit elsewhere, akin to following the “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” approach, don’t solve the problem but merely shift it — usually to low income areas.

Uncontrolled development of informal settlements

In recent years, Pakistan, like many developing nations has witnessed massive in-migration (movement of people within the country). The 2019 Migration Snapshot published by the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) notes that nearly 13% of the Pakistani population comprises of internal migrants. Internal migration in Pakistan is usually undertaken by low skilled workers who move from the rural districts to urban areas due to marriage, family ties, and economic opportunities. A number of socioeconomic factors are at play here, but what is key is the emergence of new settlements in and around cities. These areas, characterized by population highly concentrated in a (relatively) small area runs well ahead of the planning and construction of infrastructure to cope with it.

It would be remiss not to point out that the deleterious effects of degraded environmental conditions have the most (though not exclusive) impact on low income settlements, including katchi abadis or shanties. Built atop slopes, drainage channels, and waterways subject to flash floods, these dwellings are “put together” with substandard materials in areas with poor or overloaded water and waste disposal systems. Residents of these settlements may fill natural drainage channels with dwellings or waste materials, preventing normal rainwater flow and causing the water to spread out into the residential area. Pathways and (unpaved) streets are usually impervious, affording no means for absorption of precipitation, but rather providing a free passage of precipitation and flood water into homes, buildings, and commercial establishments. As these settlements are not planned or subject to land use restrictions or whatever building codes that may or may not exist, the effects of a severe natural disaster can be greatly magnified.

Conclusion

Climate change will impact future city growth, planning and development. By 2030, at least 61% of the world’s population will be living in cities. In developing nations, cities will become home to nearly four billion residents, or a whopping 80 per cent of the global urban population. Consequently, what was once dispersed rural poverty will now be concentrated in urban informal and squatter settlements. It is not really possible to control or totally eliminate floods, and policy planners and practitioners should concentrate instead on enhancing the resilience of the population to flood risks through a combination of engineering techniques coupled with and social, economic and administrative measures. In so doing, they must work within the framework of Integrated Flood Management so as to meet the larger issues of effectiveness, socioeconomic equity, and long-term positive outcomes. This can be achieved, in part by:

— Integrating land and water management;

— Ensuring a participatory community-level approach;

— Adopting integrated hazard management approaches;

— Adopting a combination of economic, legislative, policy-based, and sociological measures to move from traditional “flood control” towards “flood management”;

— Synchronisation with the national development agenda, including measures such as the Ehsaas programme, the Green Pakistan initiative, setting up effective local governments and other poverty alleviation and social uplifting schemes;

— It must also accommodate integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) practices

The aforementioned steps can be proactively implemented in incremental stages with ad hoc tactical adjustments made as events and situations unfold. The uncertainty inherent in climate change projections means that risk-centred approaches and risk-based analysis (including cost-benefit analysis) are no longer as useful or robust as they have been. The past may no longer be a reliable guide to the future when it comes to urban flood management. The combination of climate change, increasing urbanisation, demands for housing and industrial land (often in the floodplain), economic development and rising expectations cannot be discounted in urban flood management. Rather than focusing on any one of these issues, it will be necessary to combine them — and their many stakeholders — into a comprehensive planning process for increasing adaptation and enhancing community resilience.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/09/5f505e90e296d.jpg,"['management', 'water', 'precipitation', 'flooding', 'unravelling', 'flood', 'urban', 'floods', 'impact', 'drainage', 'areas']", ,flood

1 million people are estimated to be affected in nine districts

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in nine districts

62,764 people are targeted by WFP with food assistance in three districts

Highlights

• On 28 August, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked WFP to provide food assistance to flood-affected people in Sindh Province.

• As of 9 September evening, WFP had distributed food to 669 households in Karachi (out of the total 1,780 targeted in Karachi). Distributions to 7,876 households in rural districts will start on 11 September.

• NDMA has warned of potential new flooding across the country, which could further increase the number of people in immediate need of assistance.

WFP Funding Requirements

• US$ 410,320 are needed to replenish food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations for this emergency response.

Situation Update

• The Sindh Government announced a state of emergency on 25 August, with 20 districts declared calamity-affected.

• On 2 September, at the request of the Sindh PDMA, the Sindh UN Provincial Programme Team launched a rapid needs assessment in the nine hardest-hit districts (including four in Karachi and five rural districts). The results were endorsed by the PDMA on 7 September.

• One million people are affected according to Sindh PDMA estimates; 30 percent of whom are estimated to be in need of food assistance based on the findings of the rapid needs assessment.

• In Karachi, water has receded in most parts of the city. However, the informal settlements of Malir District, located in low-lying areas and without sewage infrastructure, remain flooded.

Only 4 percent of households interviewed in Karachi said they had already received food assistance. Most of these households depend on casual labour, and their coping capacities have already been exhausted by COVID-19.

• In the rural areas assessed, only 1 percent of households had received food assistance, and the vast majority reported their food stocks would run out in less than five days. Agricultural livelihoods have been severely affected, with 93 percent of crop lost, 66 percent of irrigation infrastructure reported to be damaged, and most households reporting significant livestock losses or distress sales.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1535006-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%231%20%2810%20Sep%29.png?itok=GIgAFl8O,"['situation', 'food', 'response', 'pakistan', '2020', 'pdma', 'households', 'assistance', 'need', 'report', 'wfp', 'districts', 'rural', 'karachi', 'flood', 'sindh']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Pakistan floods: Monsoon rains expose blockages in both Karachi’s drains and politics - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistan-floods-karachi-moonsoon-rain-waseem-akhtar-a9666811.html,"C

raftsman Mohammad Zakir, who lives in a low-lying area of Karachi’s Orangi Town, does not recall the authorities ever cleaning out the storm water drain serving his neighbourhood.

Thorani Goth in West District was flooded during the fourth bout of monsoon rain this season from 6-8 August.

During that – and a previous downpour in late July – water came up 4-5ft (1.2-1.5m) inside Mr Zakir’s home, ruining furniture, electrical equipment and important documents.

It also soaked an order of 250 women’s garments he was due to decorate with sequins and beads – his first job in five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’ll put them out to dry to see if there are water stains on them,” said the informal-sector worker.

If the clothes were ruined, he would have to bear half the cost of 250,000 Pakistani rupees (£1,139), he added.

Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation people “are certainly not exaggerating when they say water comes up chest-high into their homes”.

The city has a network of 550 storm water drains which zigzag through the city and flow out into the Arabian Sea, but many are obstructed by illegal construction, waste and sludge.

Mr Akhtar said the city authorities cleaned out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide the funds for the work.

In the mayor’s four-year term, which ends this month, management of Karachi’s services has been hamstrung by disputes between different levels of government.

Meanwhile the city’s infrastructure is struggling to cope with heavy monsoon rains, as seen this year.

Sardar Sarfaraz, Karachi head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said rainfall of as little as 50mm (2 inches) could cause urban flooding in some of Karachi’s low-lying areas, with the most recent downpour easily exceeding that across the city.

Scientists are still figuring out how global warming will affect the Asian monsoon, but in many parts of the world, higher temperatures are fuelling more intense bouts of rainfall.

Mr Sarfaraz noted the trend is for more erratic weather patterns, as predicted by climate scientists.

In Karachi, the August rains killed 22 people, 11 of them by electrocution, after 10 died in July. From 2014 to 2019, the city recorded more than 70 rain-related deaths, with 2018 an exception as it was largely dry.

After the havoc this July – with main roads submerged, sewage spewing from manholes and into homes, and power cuts lasting for hours – Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, tasked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with sorting out the city’s drains.

The NDMA, helped by the military’s engineering wing, said it had cleaned three major drains in just under a week, clearing 42 choke points and removing more than 31,000 tonnes of sludge.

After touring the city, Sindh information minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper there were no floods in the city, despite the intensity of this month’s rain, as prevention policies had been effectively implemented.

But Mr Zakir’s experience does not back up that assertion.

Illegal building

Hot sun after the monsoon rain has provided some respite for Mr Zakir’s family and the 13 million city residents, out of a population of more than 17 million, who live in informal settlements that are prone to flooding.

Mr Zakir blamed illegal construction along the drainage channels, adding that “the government needs to come here and bulldoze” the buildings.

“The storm water drains, some as wide as 200ft, have over the years, due to unauthorised construction, narrowed to just 30 feet – so what do you expect?” said Mr Akhtar, the city’s mayor.

The main responsibility lies both with residents who have encroached on land along the drain, and the provincial government for letting it happen, said the outgoing mayor.

The province of Sindh has taken a larger share of control from the city authority but has not provided the budget owed, which a court ruling ordered it to pay, Mr Akhtar said.

A Sindh government spokesman said it did not owe money to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, to which it had transferred 50bn rupees (£227m) in the last three and a half years.

Solid waste dumped into storm water drains exacerbates the flooding. It is estimated that the mega-city generates 13,000 tonnes of garbage daily.

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board collects 70 per cent of that and takes it to two landfills, but told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it does not know what happens to the rest.

Sewage is also being dumped in storm drains, as little has been invested in rehabilitating the crumbling sewerage system for two decades despite the city’s expansion, officials said.

Longer-term plan?

Zubair Channa, director of the Sindh government-led Solid Waste Emergency and Efficiency Project (SWEEP), funded with $100m (£76.8m) from the World Bank, said encroachment on most of Karachi’s large drains over a long period, coupled with their uneven width, caused disturbances in the flow of water.

Drains feeding into the big water channels are also not well maintained, making the flooding worse, noted the civil engineer.

“What is needed is a comprehensive engineering solution,” he said, rather than “firefighting” each year as the city does now.

In its first year, SWEEP has hired contractors to remove about 10 million cubic ft of sludge from the drains and deposit it in landfill by the end of August, he noted.

With floods causing so much devastation year after year, Mr Akhtar said it was time “to take the firm but unpleasant decision” of pulling down illegal buildings.

Before that is done, people must be provided with an alternative, he added.

“There is enough government land that can be used for both vertical expansion as well as developing satellite towns around Karachi, where these people can be shifted,” he said.

But with Karachi run by three tiers of government dominated by three different political parties, real solutions to its problems are often lost in a war of words.

“We need the judiciary and the army to sit with experts like architects and town planners to resolve the issue,” Mr Akhtar said.

PESHAWAR: At least 16 people, including a woman and two children, were killed and eight others injured due to flash floods caused by torrential rains in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district, a disaster management official said on Friday.

Eight people died in Upper Kohistan district, six in Swat and two in Shangla district of the province due to the floods on Thursday night, an official of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said, adding that 40 houses were damaged in these areas.

The flood water inundated houses in Shahgram and Teerat area of Swat district from where six deaths and injuries to eight people were reported.

PDMA Director General Pervez Khan and Secretary of relief rushed to the affected areas to oversee rescue activities.

The rescue activities are underway in full swing in the affected areas and people are being shifted to safer places, Khan said.

Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet (three metres) from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The floodwater broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Reuters news agency by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses, and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37m in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners – the UN Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change – as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told Reuters.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with the aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

Melting glaciers

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the UN Adaptation Fund from 2011 to 2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

‘People will suffer’

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier in a helicopter recently, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier, and there was talk of an [automated] early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system is extremely urgent, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding, and people will suffer.”","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f710960554f9487aad8f63e38374bcf2_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['warning', 'millions', 'ice', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'fears', 'hassanabad', 'walls', 'raise', 'glaciers', 'outburst', 'flood', 'shishper', 'melting', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Pakistani villages located at the bank of River Sutlej have been submerged after India released water without notifying the authorities in Pakistan, displacing hundreds of people while destroying several houses and standing crops, said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday.

Over 1,200 persons were rescued from the flood-affected villages by a local administration while another 1,613 persons have been shifted to safer places, according to the NDMA.

Rescue teams along with Pakistan army personnel are taking part in the rescue operations, a local administrative official in Lahore told Xinhua, adding that more than 80 relief camps have been set up for flood affectees so far.

He said water level in the river is continuously rising, and the concerned authorities are making all-out efforts to ensure timely evacuation of people from the affected villages.

A spokesperson of the NDMA Mukhtar Ahmed told local media that three of the villages located near the bed of the river went completely underwater due to flooding, and the people from these most-affected villages have already been evacuated to safer places.

Earlier on Monday, the NDMA had warned of a flood-like situation in the areas alongside the river after India released up to 200,000 million cusecs of excessive water in the River Sutlej that flows through Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

""The flood alert was issued in order to avoid the loss of lives and properties as India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,"" Director General of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Khurram Shahzad said.

According to a water-distribution agreement between the two neighboring countries, India is bound to pre-schedule its spillway openings, but the incumbent Indian government has canceled all the meetings of Indus Water Commission, which was formed to resolve disputes over water sharing with Pakistan.

Pakistani agricultural experts believe that India is trying to destroy an agro-based economy of the country by taking such measures and using water as an instrument of war, trying to convert agricultural land of Pakistan into deserts through inundation and trickling of water.

The development came when relations between Pakistan and India have been strained after the latter decided to revoke the special status of the Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.

In its response, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade ties with India.","Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['displaces', 'hundreds', 'houses', 'local', 'pakistan', 'water', 'villages', 'notification', 'flood', 'xinhua', 'india', 'ndma', 'trying', 'river', 'told', 'releases']", ,flood

“The actual number has not been confirmed yet,” but 100 to 150 people were feared dead, Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand state where the incident occurred, told Reuters.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down a river valley.

“It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,” Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of Raini village, told Reuters by phone. “I felt that even we would be swept away.”

Locals fear that people working at a nearby hydro-power project had been swept away, as well as villagers roaming near the river looking for firewood or grazing their cattle, Rana said. “We have no idea how many people are missing.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was closely monitoring the situation.

“India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,” he said on Twitter after speaking with the state chief minister.

India’s air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, the federal government said, while Home Minister Amit Shah said disaster-response teams were being airlifted in to help with relief and rescue.

“All the concerned officers are working on a war footing,” Shah said on Twitter, referring to Uttarakhand by its nickname, the Hindi term for “land of the gods” — due to the numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres located across the state.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous, also put its riverside areas on high alert.

Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the dam as well as whatever else was in its path.

Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.

“The flow of the Alaknanda River beyond Nandprayag [stretch] has become normal,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Twitter.

“The water level of the river is now one metre above normal but the flow is decreasing.”

Meanwhile, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, also expressed sorrow over the ""loss of precious lives due to flash floods caused by glacier break-off in Uttarakhand"".

Uttarakhand in the Himalayas is prone to flash floods and landslides. In June 2013, record rainfall caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the “Himalayan tsunami” by the media due to the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi’s party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

“When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2021/02/601fbde54f47e.png,"['100', 'minister', 'chief', 'uttarakhand', 'glacier', 'feared', 'water', 'away', 'state', 'himalayan', 'floods', 'india', 'bursts', 'dam', 'river', 'twitter', 'dead']", ,flood

It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.

Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.

This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.

The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.

Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.

The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.

Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in the 9 districts covered by the joint rapid needs assessment

11,000 households (71,500 people) planned to be assisted by WFP

8,506 households (77 percent of households targeted) assisted by WFP as of 21 September

Highlights

The scale of damage and humanitarian needs caused by the floods have been significantly underreported in local and international media.

WFP started emergency food distributions on 8 September with its partners ACTED and HANDS.

Distributions in Malir (Karachi) and Umerkot districts have been completed. Distributions in Mirpur Khas and Sanghar are expected to be completed by 25 September.

WFP Funding Requirements

US$500,000 is needed to cover the costs of this emergency response and replenish the food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations.

Situation Update

The situation in rural areas is extremely worrying, both in terms of immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term impacts on livelihoods, food security and nutrition. While rains have stopped, many areas remain flooded and stagnant water is posing major health, nutrition and shelter issues.

Thousands of families displaced by the floods are still living by the side of the road, with little chance of returning home for at least another month and no employment opportunities in view given large-scale crop and livestock losses.

On 12 September, Sindh Chief Minister requested additional humanitarian assistance from the UN.

On 17-18 September, the UN Resident Coordinator and WFP Country Director visited a WFP food distribution and a UNICEF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) distribution in Mirpur Khas district. They met with the Mirpur Khas Commissioner, the Sindh Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the Sindh Chief Secretary, who expressed appreciation for WFP’s fast response.

At the request of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), UN and NGO partners are preparing to carry out a multisectoral needs assessment to inform mediumterm recovery needs, covering the 30 mostaffected districts across the country. This new assessment will complement the rapid joint needs assessment carried out during the first week of September.

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the city’s infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachi’s stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachi’s population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-’60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-’60s Karachi’s sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

Map1

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Photo by Fahim Siddiqui/White Star

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-’90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachi’s development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the women’s college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachi’s most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late ’80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and people’s investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistan’s foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachi’s sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3) — part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majesty’s government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for “capacity building.” Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at “good practices” and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established — a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, children’s play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadra’s assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Council’s annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

You need to be unbearably audacious to flaunt hypocrisy in the manner most members of the National Assembly have thoughtlessly employed for “expressing solidarity” with besieged and relentlessly bombed people of Palestine.

They took more than 90 minutes to assemble for the first sitting of another session of the National Assembly Monday evening. At the outset of it, Asad Qaisar, the Speaker, announced the decision of devoting the entire sitting to “the cause of Palestine only” and invited Shehbaz Sharif, the Opposition Leader, to initiate a yawn-inducing round of trivial speechmaking.

After spending many months in jail, the PML-N leader had reached Islamabad to attend the assembly session. He might not have been here, if the government had not stopped him from flying to London, with the permission of Lahore High Court.

Seriously suspending my cynical approach to “our representatives,” I tried hard to carefully listen to each word of his speech. Except narrating facts, which even a school going kid must know regarding the history of Palestine, he never cared to furnish anything fresh and attention-worthy.

Repeatedly, he kept urging the government to “lead from the front” in furnishing solace to constantly bombed Palestinians. How to go about it and with what strategy? He had no answer to it.

Still, he did admit that “emotional speeches” wouldn’t deliver any protection to abandoned people of Palestine. But forcefully suggested that the coming Friday should be observed as “Al Quds” day. The day of solidarity should end with a visit to UN Offices in Islamabad to handover a resolution in support of the people of Palestine, unanimously prepared by all the political parties of Pakistan. The expected resolution should also ask the United Nations Security Council to instantly move to stop Israel from vicious and barbaric attacks on Palestinian territory.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the foreign minister, on the other hand, consumed more time to reveal that Prime Minister Imran Khan had already been working around the clock to develop a workable strategy to check Israel with constant contacts with the rest of Islamic countries. Thanks to his persistence, Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was finally motivated to hold a series of SOS meetings.

While profusely welcoming the activist role of the OIC, Shah Mahmood Qureshi also recalled with a hurt heart that the US had vetoed against a UNSC resolution, which attempted to condemn Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians but failed to explain how to convince the Biden administration to behave otherwise.

He seemed quite proud in claiming that foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s concern with grateful words. Doing this, he conveniently forgot that Israel’s recent barrages of bombs were primarily targeting Gaza-confined Palestinians and so far the people living in the West Bank had been spared. And Hamas and not the Palestinian Authority is in complete control of Gaza.

Similarly, he sounded laughably naïve while stressing that after failing in getting some relief from the UN Security Council, the OIC should now force the UN to hold an urgent General Assembly sitting. To ensure the same, he would leave for Turkey Monday night and from there intends to fly on to New York, hopefully along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Sudan, to intensify lobbying for an emergency session of the UN General Assembly on Palestine.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi is not a novice to foreign affairs; he had been our foreign minister during the Gillani-led PPP government as well. He surely needs no tutor to discover that UN General Assembly has no mandate to actively engage in atrocity-stopping actions. That remains the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council.

Our Foreign Minister also felt excited about the series of protest marches in metropolitan cities like London, Paris and Berlin etc. Praising these marches, he indeed appeared completely oblivious to embarrassing indifference that many metropolitan cities of the Muslim countries were displaying these days regarding the ceaseless atrocities in Gaza.

In the end, however, he had to helplessly admit that United States of America remained the one and only country, relishing leverage vis-à-vis Israel. Keeping this in mind, he also had focused on recent events in Palestine during his telephone conversation with the US Secretary of State Sunday evening.

Referring to the same conversation, he suddenly switched to criticize the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, and began raising serious questions regarding his conduct during a critical phase of the Afghan issue, when the US and the NATO forces had already announced the intent of leaving Afghanistan by September 11, 2001.

His comments regarding Afghanistan made me suspect that the ‘end game’ in that war torn country was not moving according to the plan Pakistan might have imagined. Things rather appear heading to fear-inducing explosion in our immediate neighborhood. Yet, our foreign minister kept feeling too proud in suggesting as if Pakistan was set to play a leading role to protect Palestine from Israel’s atrocities.

Delivering bombastic speeches, our worthy members should also have done sincere soul searching. Around two years ago on August 5, 2019, Modi government of India had unilaterally revoked the ‘special status of the Occupied Kashmir. After announcing the said decision, it enforced a ruthless lockdown on the Valley of Kashmir. Its brute clamp down clearly emulated tactics, Zionists had been employing to encroach into Palestinian territories since 1948.

“Our representatives,” crowding the National Assembly miserably failed to imagine an effective strategy to ensure pushing back of the Indian onslaught on occupied Kashmir. With the start of 2021, we rather started to get a flood of credible-sounding stories, strongly suggesting that India and Pakistan were now seeking peace with each other through ‘backdoor negotiations.”

The nonstop flood of such stories never motivated our “supreme to all” pretending parliamentarians to force the Imran government and its foreign minister to stand up in the National Assembly or the Senate to explain even cursory details related to reported “negotiations.” While most of them keep boasting that the issue of Kashmir remains the core existential question for Pakistan. They remained equally clueless regarding the recent development in Afghanistan. Yet the same parliamentarians hardly felt any shame in flaunting “deep concerns” for the people of Palestine and boastfully pretending as if they have finally found a workable strategy to furnish solace to their wounds.","Mon, 17 May 2021 21:39:47 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-05-18/delivering-bombastic-speeches-1621287582-6148.jpg,"['assembly', 'minister', 'bombastic', 'strategy', 'pakistan', 'speeches', 'national', 'regarding', 'foreign', 'kashmir', 'palestinian', 'delivering', 'palestine']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Indus Water Commission (PCIW) will raise the issue of delaying flood data by India during the annual meeting of the commission on March 23-24.

The meeting is taking place after a hiatus of nearly three years, with the last being held in Lahore in August 2018.

Last year's meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.

As per the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.



Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehr Ali said the Pakistani delegation will leave for New Delhi on March 22 where the meeting would take place.

What will be discussed in the meeting?

Shah will lead the Pakistani delegation whereas the Indian side will be headed by PK Saxena.

“Controversial projects of 1000 MW Pakkal Dal and 48 MW Lower Kalnai will be discussed during the two-day meeting. Pakistan has already raised objections on the design of these projects,” he said.

The top official of the Indus Water Commission said two more water projects -Darbuk and Nemochaling – will also come under discussion, adding that the issue of delaying flood data will also be raised with New Delhi.

“India has been violating the Indus Basin Agreement in providing flood data for 2 years. Pakistan wants daily flood data from July 1 to October 10,” Mehar noted.

62,62,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag - Reuters",https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN23F03B,"ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

MELTING GLACIERS

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

DANGER AHEAD

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system can’t come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer”.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['warning', 'cut', 'surges', 'climate', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'change', 'village', 'efforts', 'outburst', 'flood', 'drag', 'walls', 'early', 'melt', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood
63,63,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Why is Karachi drowning and could we have prevented it? - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/09/07/why-is-karachi-drowning-and-could-we-have-prevented-it-,"Anmol Irfan is a writer, feminist, and founder of Perspective Magazine. Here she shares her views on how the largest city in Pakistan should not have ignored warnings about the climate crisis.

Karachi is drowning.

Over the last week, torrential rains have ravaged Pakistan’s cosmopolitan hub. Breaking records of over 90 years, the city has been flooded as its systems and infrastructure find themselves unable to cope with the unprecedented amount of rainfall.

But how much does this have to do with climate change?

The city’s inability to deal with rain isn’t exactly a revelation - previous years have seen monsoon seasons cause substantial damage. But this year, it’s a crisis like never before. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has reported 63 deaths in rain related incidents already, while entire residential areas and markets have been submerged, causing millions of rupees worth of damage to houses and businesses.

The onslaught of such a disaster has come as a shock to locals who wonder why officials didn’t put preventative measures in place, with full knowledge that the rainy season was coming.

“It’s not something that’s happened recently. This has been 30-40 years in the making,” explains Vice Chairman of the Lahore Development Authority, SM Imran. The neglect of Karachi’s development is cited as the main reason behind the city’s current crisis. Despite the city’s importance to Pakistan’s economy and development, sustainable growth of the city has never been a political priority, he adds.

As roads collapse and sewage systems overflow, questions are arising as to where years worth of taxpayers money has gone. Residents of various areas in the city are experiencing three-day long power shortages and stagnant water blocking the streets.

Did Karachi ignore the warnings?

Karachi’s situation is a glaring example of what can happen when climate change warnings and sustainable growth are neglected - in favour of political optics and superficial development.

In a country that has faced significant damage in the past due to droughts, this influx of rain could have been a game changer. But instead, a lack of preparation has turned what should have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster.

To make matters worse, the drainage system which collapsed in DHA, supposedly the posh area of the city, was built in 2007 and residents were charged for it.

A lack of preparation has turned what could have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster

Moving forward, it is imperative we understand exactly where the problem lies. The lost lives and flooding are horrific enough - but the damage they have caused may not be fixed for years to come.

Pakistan’s already debt-ridden economy will now have to face the harrowing consequences of redoing entire sewage systems, rehabilitating thousands of people and businesses and possibly risk losing their main port city.

How will the city recover?

This year’s disaster has proven that there is no time to be lost. Priorities need to be set in order for changes to be made. Instead of focusing on other aspects of infrastructure that contribute very little to the city’s growth, Imran believes the focus now needs to be on water conservation and treatment.

For Imran, Israel is a good example we can learn from. Its Ashkelon facility provided for 70 per cent of the country’s water demands through a process of seawater desalination. A city that craved rainfall is now richer in water resources. This just shows that we can harness the effects of climate change in our favour, if we know how to. What’s needed now is a complete overhaul of what we thought our future would be, explains Imran.

Karachi has been labelled “resilient” many times over the years. But as the city descends into worse conditions, its resilience is no longer a compliment but an excuse. No longer can this idea of resilience be used to ignore its exacerbating problems.

One possible solution is for local governments to do more than just pass bills. Many now believe that programmes should be put in place to teach employees how best to reuse water and treat rubbish.

Currently though, political solutions seem too little too late, and citizens are stepping up to rehabilitate the city themselves.

Citizens are coming to the rescue

Among the many initiatives taken over by relief workers and organisations, is Saturday Welfare Group (SWG). What started as a group of friends wanting to provide rehabilitation to marginalised communities in Pakistan has grown into a powerful initiative that steps up in times of crisis.

“Everyone is equal who is contributing to or working for welfare,” is their motto.

A resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) protests against failure to fix drainage pipes. AFP

It's a motto that couldn’t be more fitting with the situation Karachi now finds itself in. Both within the country and among the Pakistani diaspora, fundraising is at an all-time high. It’s a testament to the idea that there are people who want change, and are ready to work for it - they just need an opportunity. Development in Karachi should be carried out on a much more equal scale, and perhaps those truly working for change will finally get the attention they deserve.

Recovery will be a long road, and hopefully when political action begins to reflect the needs of the hour, it will be up to residents to play their role as well. Pollution and littering is a major problem the city struggles with. As trash from the streets finds its way into drainage pipes, it blocks the very waterways that are meant to save the city from such disasters. Conservation initiatives need to be better understood.

This is a responsibility that lies with the educated strata of society, who have the power and resources to implement these initiatives and make them accessible to the masses. Feigning ignorance over harmful habits and actions is no longer a valid excuse.","Mon, 07 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/93/76/44/1000x563_cmsv2_7fe7a6a1-6ce3-5379-ad73-e8d45fe149d9-4937644.jpg,"['development', 'political', 'city', 'climate', 'change', 'water', 'damage', 'worth', 'drowning', 'karachi', 'prevented', 'citys']", ,flood

Residents complained of sewage on the streets and in water tanks. Power was out in several areas for days amid sweltering heat and humidity. The outage also caused disruptions in cellphone service, interrupting emergency management and leaving citizens out of touch with loved ones.

In some cases, the electricity cables broke, causing fears of electrocution.

""Few residents located in these zones have also requested us not to power up supply since it may be a safety hazard for them,"" tweeted Karachi's electricity provider, K-Electric.

Meanwhile, authorities said another weather system was hovering over Sindh province, increasing the likelihood of more rains in the coming days.

The large metropolis, considered to be Pakistan's economic lifeline, has faced problems of overcrowding and unplanned development since the country's independence in 1947.

""[A] very large majority of its population lives in informal settlements in poorly designed housing with inadequate services,"" according to a 2017 working paper, titled, ""Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi.""

Much of the city's planning woes have been exacerbated over the decades due to corruption coupled with political rivalries among local, provincial and federal governments.

Parts of Karachi are owned by the federal government. In addition, local and provincial governments have set up parallel structures of service delivery, like trash pickup, diluting resources.

""We need to clearly understand who is responsible for what. Until the municipal functions are divided between the federal and provincial governments, problems of delivery will remain,"" Murtaza Wahab, the spokesman for Sindh government, told local news channel Geo News.

According to the working paper, bad governance and development shortcomings in Karachi ""have created vulnerabilities at different scales that are likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change-related weather events taking place within the city and elsewhere in the country.""

Development professional Zaigham Khan said overcrowding and slum developments were a result of the city absorbing the social and economic problems of the entire country.

""If there is terrorism in FATA (erstwhile tribal area), locals move to Karachi. When there is war in Afghanistan, the most refugees arrive in Karachi. When there are floods in the country, the affected go to Karachi. If there is insurgency in Balochistan, locals escape to Karachi. If there are no jobs in southern Punjab, the preferred refuge is Karachi,"" he said.

The directives were issued by the prime minister while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Floods here on Monday, according to an announcement by the PM Office.

Besides the NDMA chief, the meeting was attended by federal Minister for Information Shibli Faraz, Communications Minister Murad Saeed, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda, the director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the chairmen of the National Highways Authority and Federal Flood Commission (FFC).

The provincial chief secretaries also participated in the meeting through a video link. The chief secretaries informed the prime minister about the damages caused by recent floods and rains in their respective provinces.

The NDMA chairman briefed the prime minister on the situation in various parts of the country after the recent spells of monsoon and the damages caused by these heavy rains. He also apprised the prime minister about the relief activities being carried out by the NDMA in different parts of the country affected due to rains.

Meeting reviews relief activities being carried out in rain-affected areas

The officials of the PMD and Flood Commission informed the prime minister that most parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, had received more rains than the past. The meeting participants were informed that almost all the rivers were having medium flow of water.

The prime minister was told that there were “strong chances” that the ongoing monsoon season would come to an end by the middle of this month and the chances of more flood-like situation were very low.

The meeting’s participants were also apprised about the relief operation being carried out by the country’s armed forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister stressed the need for more coordination among all the federal and provincial departments concerned to face the challenge they were facing due to climate changes.

PM Khan was also informed that all dams in the country were full of water and the situation of water availability was satisfactory.

The country’s major reservoirs had already reached their full capacity last month following the countrywide rainfalls and both Tarbela and Mangla dams had attained their maximum conservation levels.

The FFC attributes the filling of dams to effective management of inflows and outflows of the reservoirs, especially by Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).

It has advised the dams operating authorities, including the Flood Monitoring Cell of Mangla, Irsa (Indus River System Authority) and the PMD, to take utmost care and exercise extra vigilance of the reservoirs’ operation.

The combined live storage of major reservoirs — Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — was reported at 13.425 million acre feet (MAF) on Aug 28, which accounted for 98.61 per cent of the 13.614 MAF maximum storage capacity, a record water availability during last 10 years.

According to Wapda, water available in Tarbela and Mangla dams was 2.173 MAF more when compared to last 10 years’ average. The average water availability in the two dams during the last 10 years on the day was recorded at 11.163 MAF.

This better hydrological situation will aptly fulfil the requirement of water for the country’s agriculture in the days to come. More water availability in the reservoirs will also result in more hydel generation in the coming days.

The heavy rainfall spell occurred over the past few days in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi, had caused severe urban flooding in the provincial capital.

The prime minister had visited Karachi last week and in the presence of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a package of Rs1.1 trillion at Governor House to resolve Karachi’s lingering and chronic issues, including provision of clean drinking water, cleaning of drains and sewage and solid waste disposal within three years.

Later, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stated that the Sindh government would contribute Rs800 billion to the Rs1.1tr package for Karachi, saying that they “welcome the Rs300 billion funding from the federal government for Karachi’s infrastructure development”.

On Sunday, however, federal Minister for Planning and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of PTI told a press conference that the federal government would bear 62 per cent of the total amount of Rs1,100 billion announced by the prime minister.

This news comes a day after the South Asian nation received half a million doses of coronavirus vaccines donated by China.

China had donated 500,000 doses of Sinopharm to Pakistan on February 1, enabling the country to launch a vaccination drive a day later. The country, which has reported 615,810 COVID-19 cases so far, launched COVID-19 vaccinations for the public on March 10, starting with older people.

Besides Sinopharm and AstraZeneca, Pakistan has approved Russia's Sputnik and China's CanSino Biologics Inc's (CanSinoBIO) vaccines for emergency use.","Sat, 20 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.dnaindia.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2021/03/20/965320-959791-827461-824454-imran-khan.jpg,"['sinopharm', 'covid', 'khan', 'imran', 'tested', 'positive', 'pakistan', 'chinese', '20', 'covid19', 'chinesevaccine', 'flood', 'hilarious', 'tests', 'twitter', 'vaccine', 'pak', 'memes']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country.

Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged.

The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

""River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,"" reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history.

TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding.

The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

""Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,"" it said.

""Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,"" it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the ""rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September"".

The number of those affected is expected to rise to 100,000.

Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Al Zaabi, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied by Dr. Salim Ali Al Dhanhani, UAE Consul-General in Karachi, visited Sindh province, where they met with Syed Murad Ali Shah, Chief Minister of Sindh province.

During the visit, Al Zaabi expressed to Shah his most sincere condolences for the flood victims.

Following his meetings with local officials, Al Zaabi visited some of the areas affected by flooding and participated with Shah in distributing Phase-1 of an urgent aid campaign comprising of medicines, tents, blankets and food. The first day of aid distribution benefitted more than 12,000 people, with the campaign to continue for an entire month.

In his speech delivered in the presence of Sindh Province Governor Imran Ismail during the distribution of urgent relief aid, Al Zaabi said that the humanitarian support provided to the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at the direction of the UAE’s leadership is part of the campaign’s efforts to rescue people and improve their living conditions.

Al Zaabi and Ismail also discussed ways of enhancing their ties in areas of mutual concern for both countries, most notably economic. Al Zaabi then briefed Ismail about available opportunities and the investment environment in the UAE, stressing that there are many opportunities for exchanging visits and organising commercial events, conferences and workshops.

During the meeting, Al Zaabi praised the deep overall relations between the UAE and Pakistan, whose foundations were established by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

The chief minister of Sindh praised the bilateral ties between the two countries and stressed the importance of reinforcing them in all economic, commercial and development aid areas.

The £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to many who have lost their homes. It comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks including hygiene kits and tarpaulins to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Lord Ahmad said:

Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands with Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.

The UK aid announced today will ensure life-saving clean water, sanitation and shelter gets to those who need it most. The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be - and the dangers of climate change.

During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.

British High Commissioner Christian Turner CMG said:

Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from COVID-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year. He discussed with the Government of Pakistan how the UK can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet the Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations, and trade ties, and he also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in South Punjab. The UK has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly 8 million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The Minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the COVID-19 surveillance centre. He met the Coordinator National Emergency Operations Centre Dr Rana Safdar who briefed the Minister on Pakistan’s response to COVID-19. Lastly, he was scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

Notes to editors:

In Sindh, according to data from the Meteorological Department, rainfall in August was the highest since recordkeeping began 89 years ago. In Karachi, rainwaters devastated factory stock and caused mass power outages. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected” and local disaster management teams together with NGOs, supported by the military, have been rescuing stranded people, providing medical aid, and food rations. Initial assessments by District authorities suggest that more than 2.5m people have been affected across the worst-hit districts of Badin, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal and Sanghar. In all, monsoon rains have resulted in the death of over 230 people and damaged over 2,600 houses across Pakistan, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The UK has committed at least £11.6 billion in International Climate Finance over the next five years, and will invest £13 million in Pakistan this year on tackling climate change. This will include supporting local communities adapt to climate change and improve resilience through emergency disaster planning and helping to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.

71,71,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Minar-i-Pakistan lawns flooded with water - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594825,"White Star

LAHORE: The government on Tuesday flooded the Minar-i-Pakistan lawns, the venue of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)’s Dec 13 public meeting, which the opposition termed a ‘failed effort’ to sabotage its power show.

In a related move, the Buzdar administration also rushed to enforce ‘smart lockdown’ in 45 areas of Lahore, including those close to the rally’s venue. The opposition also smells a rat in this move, saying the PTI government is taking every step to stop the opposition from holding the rally here but it will fail.

The government is also taking other measures — registering cases against those taking part in the PDM corner meetings and rallies and warning the caterers to extend their services to the PDM for its rallies — ahead of its (PDM) Dec 13 power show.

The government has not yet given permission to the PDM to hold a rally at Minar-i-Pakistan citing Covid-19 measures.

Ahead of PDM’s Multan rally on Nov 30, the government had adopted similar tactics but the opposition had held the rally on the road.

Learning about the government’s tactics, the PML-N leaders rushed to Minar-i-Pakistan and shut hosepipes.

“The PTI government released water at Minar-i-Pakistan in the early hours of Tuesday. When we learnt about it we rushed there and stopped further watering (by the administration),” PML-N lawmaker from Mohni Road Bilal Yasin told reporters at the venue.

He said Imran Khan had got so upset over Maryam Nawaz’s rallies in the city on Monday that an order was placed to flood the Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday.

“I ask Imran Khan to at least respect his office of the prime minister,” he said.

Commenting upon release of water at PDM’s rally venue, Maryam Nawaz said in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”

Special Assistant to CM Punjab for Information Firdous Ashiq Awan clarified that only three to four kanals of Minar-e-Pakistan were watered.

“The way life of plants is connected with water, similarly Rajkumari (Maryam)’s life is connected with lies,” she said in a tweet.

During the last three days the Lahore police registered over 20 FIRs booking over 2,000 PML-N workers and leaders for committing Covid-19 SOPs violation and road block.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb, Talal Chaudhry, MNA Malik Riaz and MNA Shizra Mansab are among the PML-N leaders booked.

Maryam Nawaz told reporters at Jati Umra that the FIRs had been registered against over 3,000 PML-N workers which showed how much unnerved the government had been.

The PML-N also held a convention here to mobilise workers for the Dec 13 rally.

Speaking on the occasion, Khwaja Asif said 130 MNAs of the opposition would resign and they could not be stopped from doing so.

“It is a sin to sit in the assemblies which cannot stop corruption and price hike,” he said and added the PTI had realised that these assemblies could not run any more.

Talking to reporters Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Fascist and incompetent Imran Khan is obsessed with persecuting the PML-N leadership, especially Shehbaz Sharif, while the entire nation suffers at the hands of his disastrous rule.”

She said the level of this selected prime minister was that he was threatening the vendors of chairs and tents with FIRs.

Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told Dawn that the government was taking legal action against the PDM for violating Covid-19 SOPs. “We cannot allow the opposition to violate the law,” she said and added if caterers or others provided services to the opposition for holding an assembly of more than 300 people they would also be booked under the law.

72,72,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"In Pakistan, meltwater from glaciers is causing devastating flash floods, and the dwindling of ice-shields affects the entire nation - D+C Development and Cooperation",https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pakistan-meltwater-glaciers-causing-devastating-flash-floods-and-dwindling-ice-shields,"Flash floods are becoming more common in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Local communities are most at risk – but glacier melt also affects people who live far away from the mountains.

More than a century ago, a catastrophe struck Barikan Kot. This mountain village was flooded by a sudden outburst of water from the Hinarchi glacier. The reason was the bursting of an ice wall which had held back a lake of meltwater that had formed on the glacier. About 100 families lost their homes and livelihoods as rocks, earth and debris were swept over the village and its orchards and fertile land.

In the past, this kind of flash flood occurred rarely. That has changed. The Bagrote valley in the Karakoram mountain range in northern Pakistan now suffers several of them every year. Global warming is affecting glaciers all over the world, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya is no exception. Especially in the summer months, melting ice leads to new glacial lakes which, in turn, can cause flash floods.

Aisha Khan of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC) – a private organisation working on climate change – warns that glacial lake-outburst floods are becoming ever more likely. “The impacts are catastrophic,” she points out. In recent years, several dozens of people have been killed, and many more families have lost their livelihoods. The local communities tend to be disadvantaged and poor. According to Aisha Khan, the challenge is to tell them in simple language why the environment is changing and what they can do to adapt.

The civil-society activist insists that women in particular must be prepared to respond appropriately. They have a crucial role to play in evacuation, first aid and rescue and relief operations, Aisha Khan says. She wants all risk-management measures to reflect both the social conditions in the village and the scientific insights.

Syed Zahid Hussain Shah agrees that the risks are increasing and must be controlled. He was the field manager of a project run by the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) that served this purpose from 2011 to 2016. He reports that the Hinarchi glacier is only 16 kilometres long today. It was about 12 % longer 30 years ago, and its ice-shield was higher too.

Pakistan has more than 7,000 glaciers. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 36 are dangerous. Some 7 million people are exposed to the risk of glacial lake-outburst floods, which typically occur in July and August, the warmest months.

The project Zahid worked for took several risk-mitigating initiatives in Bagrote valley. A bridge and protective walls were built. Moreover, streams were excavated and made deeper, so they can carry more water. The project set up four digitised weather stations that automatically relay information pertaining to possible glacial lake outbursts. Thanks to them, it has become possible to warn local communities early on.

The weather stations have helped to save many lives. Hussain Ali, who lives in a mountain village, appreciates them: “Early warning allows people to shift to safer places.” Nonetheless, he says that flash floods have killed more than 20 people in his area in recent years. Moreover, such extreme weather events have killed livestock and destroyed orchards and fields. Several dozen households were therefore forced to move from the mountain villages down into the valley, where it is easier, but nonetheless still quite difficult to eke out a living for people who have lost all assets.

The government of Pakistan and UNDP are now running a follow-up project in the region. It is called the “Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II)” project. GLOF stands for glacial lake-outburst flood. The budget for the years 2017 to 2021 is $ 37 million. The project will cover 15 districts and benefit approximately 29 million people.

The mountain regions of Pakistan’s neighbouring countries Afghanistan, India and China face the same kind of risk for the same reasons. Irfan Tariq, a former director general of Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change, points out that “the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range is a very sensitive ecological system”. It is very difficult to control or limit the impacts of climate change on glaciers, he says, so Pakistan’s government is closely monitoring the glaciers.



The big picture

The melting of the glaciers has impacts far beyond the mountain ranges. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas feed Asia’s most important rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtse. Hundreds of millions of people depend on these waters. Indeed, Asian civilisations have benefited from the glaciers stabilising water supply throughout the seasons for millennia (see Sheila Mysorekar in the Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/09). As the glaciers dwindle, human-built infrastructure will have to serve the functions the glaciers performed naturally in the past.

In this context, dams matter very much. Related infrastructure is vulnerable to glacial lake-outburst floods however. Should a major glacial lake outburst cause a veritable mountain tsunami, the damage may be serious. Syed Mehr Ali Shah from Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources says: “We are very much concerned with the bigger glacial lake-outburst flood events, with regards to the safety of our existing hydraulic infrastructures, which include Tarbela dam.” This dam is more than 140 metres high and serves the purposes of hydropower, irrigation and flood control.

There are several major dams in northern Pakistan, and a new one is currently being built. The wall of Diamer Bhasha dam will be more than 250 metres high. The safety of these structures is very important, says Mehr: “We need to protect them from any kind of dam-break phenomenon.” The officer expresses his confidence in the structures being strong enough to withstand typical glacial lake-outburst floods. He says the Diamer Bhasha reservoir has been designed to bear any dam-break wave that occurs due to such flood. At the same time, spillways ensure that excess water can be channelled away.

But even if dams can be built to withstand flash floods, mega dams cause environmental problems in their own right. Experts warn, moreover, that ever more sophisticated and expensive infrastructure will be needed to adapt societies to global warning. If environmental change spins out of control, adaptation will prove impossible for ever more people.

Ultimately, there is no alternative to mitigating climate change. Pakistan, however, only emits about one ton of carbon per head and year, according to Climate Analytics, an independent monitoring initiative. This comparatively small figure means that other countries which emit far more must assume responsibility and assist countries like Pakistan to build their resilience to climate change.

On Sunday 26th July-2020 weather system brought heavy rains in Karachi. According to data provided by the MET Office, the highest rainfall was recorded in Gulistan-e-Johar, at 66 millimeters (mm), while 55 mm was registered at Old Airport, 55 mm in Pehlwan Goth, 42 mm in Malir, Saddar 43 millimeters (mm), while 26 mm was registered at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Faisal Base, 22mm in Nazimabad, 12mm at PAF Masroor Base, 8.8mm at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, 3.1mm in Landhi, and 1.2mm in Surjani Town.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), city received more than 80 mm rainfall in the third spell of the monsoon and more rain is expected in this season. The heavy to moderate rainfall caused flooding in low lying areas of the city and inundated several key roads, causing problems for the commuters as administration remained helpless and even absent at some locations despite a prior warning from the met officials. Nipa Chowrangi, Gurumandir Chowrangi, Shahrai-e-Faisal, Hassan Square turned into large water pools, as motorcyclists and four-wheelers could be witnessed trapped in water high up to knee-level. According to the initial reports from media and local communities, in many areas there is still stagnant water in streets and houses that overflowed from Nullahs. Those areas included Orangi Town, Khairabad Police Ground area, Ali Garh Market, Disco Morr, Islam Chowk, Bangla Bazar, Neepa Chowrangi, Gulshan-e- Iqbal, and Hyderi in North Nazimabad.

Root causes for the urban flooding in Karachi

In the last fourty years, Karachi city has been facings severe problems due to heavy rains in monsoon season as there are serious issues with the drainage system in Karachi. Despite accepting the brutal reality of the situation, one can not blame any institution but the responsibility lied with the Provincial government, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and District Munciple Corporations (DMCs) and private housing societies to keep clean the drains of Karachi and to drain out all the rainwater from the city.

In the city, as visible to all, width of many rain water drains and Nullah have been reduced, on many construcuton have been done, and most of them are choked with garbage. Information collected through different sources revealed that there are many structures and building have been constructed over the drain of Soldier bazar incuding two banks, gold shops / market, one section of girls high school, Shaheen complex, car parking area of supreme court, district NAB office, KMC market and Aurganzeb market. In Lyari, on Muhammad Shah road, part of Kakri ground, meat market and two masjids are constructed on one of the drain.

The width of the drainage of Manzoor colony on Korangi road has been reduced and near Qayoomabad, Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has constructed bungalows over the same drainage. Drain that starts from Cantt station to Clifton has a 50 feet width but due to construction of Jamat Khana, its width has been reduced to 36 ft, which drain out in Nahar e Khayam. Drain of Madina colony and Singer chowrangi are also in the same condition.

Width of the largest drain Nullah of Oragni town, has been reduced due to encroachment on both sides, that’s why there was a flood in recent days because of heavy rains of monsoon. Width of Mianwali drainage has been reduced by soil pipe instaltions by KDA into it and now very little amount of rain water flows through it.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1529694-HANDS%20RNA%20Urban%20Flooding%20Karachi%20July%202020.png?itok=3ubSxtIF,"['mm', 'city', 'pakistan', 'need', 'assessment', '2020', 'water', 'drain', 'flooding', 'rapid', 'karachi', 'urban', 'market', 'width', 'reduced', 'drainage', 'heavy']", ,flood

The Daily Telegraph is reporting the incident occurred on the corner of Cattai Ridge Road and Hidden Valley Lane in Glenorie, with the man’s body and vehicle discovered at 1:10pm yesterday.

Police have confirmed the body found in a vehicle submerged in floodwaters north west of Sydney was a 25-year-old contractor on his way to work. The fatality is the first conf...

A Pakistani national killed in Sydney floodwaters was on the phone to emergency services and tried desperately to free himself from his car but he could not get out.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was on his first day as a contractor when his Toyota Camby became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on Sydney’s northern outskirts.

Farhat Jaffri, from the Pakistan Association of Australia, said he had spoken to the man’s father.

Mr Younus, from Malir Cantt Karachi, was studying software engineering and had two elder brothers and one younger sister, Mr Jaffri said.

“Family has requested to send the body back to Karachi,” Mr Jaffri said.

“I have requested to Consul General to take care of this matter and offered any assistance from Pakistan Association of Australia.”

“You can only just imagine somebody fighting for their life to get out of the car – that’s what the inside damage of the car looked like,” Detective Inspector Chris Laird said as he described the horrific scene on Wednesday.

Police said the man called emergency services just before 6.30am after he became trapped in floodwaters on Cattai Ridge Road in Glenorie.

He managed to stay on the phone to Triple-0 for nearly 40 minutes until the connection was lost.

His vehicle was later found just after 1pm with his body inside.

Inspector Laird said the 25-year-old man was on the first day of a new contracting job.

“We can only speculate that he may have not known the area as locals would … he may not have seen the water as he drove in given the fact that the gates across the road were completely submerged,” he told reporters.

“Sadly, in hindsight we can always say never drive into a swollen road and that will form part of our inquiries.”

Inspector Laird described the man’s death as an “absolute tragedy” and said it was a miracle no one else had been killed in Sydney’s catastrophic floods.

“We can only speculate again that, given what I have seen and the damage to the vehicle, that it could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car, which is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

“Also, the fact that he was on the phone for so long is even more tragic and is going to form part of our inquiries as to what actually went on in the car and why this tragic accident occurred.”

Inspector Laird said there were no broken windows and the man “clearly couldn’t get out”.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.

Just hours after telling reporters it was “simply a miracle” there had been no deaths in the wildly destructive floods, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told parliament the state had recorded its first fatality.

“Unfortunately, we have received news of a fatality in the northwest of Sydney flood waters,” she said during question time on Wednesday afternoon.

“Because it’s early stages, I will allow emergency services to comment at the appropriate time to ensure arrangements have been made with next of kin.”

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also addressed the tragedy in federal parliament.

“It underscores the messages everybody from the NSW Premier, the Prime Minister down have been issuing over recent days, and that is, please, do not enter these floodwaters.”



Scott Morrison expressed his deepest condolences, on behalf of the parliament to the man’s family.

“As the floodwaters recede and the clean-up begins ... their house will be dark and their grief will be great because their loss will not recede,” Mr Morrison said.

“I just pray a blessing on their family.”

He also paid tribute to the NSW police officers who responded to the incident.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese joined the Prime Minister in expressing his regret for “this tragic loss of life”.

“A family has lost a loved one, with no doubt that although the person has not been identified, his friends, his community will be feeling this loss very soon,” Mr Albanese said.

He reiterated that water and cars “don’t mix”, reminding Australians it was better to be delayed than to take risks during the significant weather event lashing the east coast.

Mr Albanese said no more lives being lost over the past few days was a credit to Australians.

The SES has completed almost 1000 flood rescues, and about 24,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f032833c82e009bdf0c8232b26aa4ae4?width=1280,"['vehicle', 'dies', 'phone', 'services', 'car', 'sydney', 'body', 'road', 'floodwaters', 'glenorie', 'floods', 'man', 'trapped', 'mr', 'mans', 'nsw', 'pakistani']", ,flood

NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

78,78,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Death toll from flooding in northwest Pakistan rises to 48 - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/death-toll-from-flooding-in-northwest-pakistan-rises-to-48-1.5091540,"PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN -- Flash floods triggered by week-long monsoon rains that have hit northwestern Pakistan, including the scenic Swat Valley, have brought the death toll to 48, a government spokesman said Thursday.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged or swept away. The army has joined relief and rescue operations across Pakistan, which has been hard hit by rains this summer.

Key roads that have been blocked by large rocks dislodged in mudslides are being cleared, according to Taimur Khan, spokesman for the disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Before Thursday's updated death toll, the province had said 15 died in the floods.

Overall, about 200 people have been killed in rain-related incidents since July, when monsoon rains began lashing many areas in Pakistan. According to government officials, 101 have died in rain-related incidents in southern Sindh province, which includes the country's financial hub of Karachi.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning.

79,79,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hits', 'infrastructure', 'climate', 'global', 'change', 'flooded', 'water', 'flooding', 'asia', 'floods', 'region', 'flood', 'river', 'hardest', 'risk']", ,flood_and_drought

He had been moving his farming equipment on Tuesday morning when his father told him that someone appeared to be stuck in flood waters near their property on Cattai Ridge Road, close to Cattai Creek.

When they went to check it out, they saw “a young man trapped inside his car with approximately 300ml of air space left”.

“The car interior was almost full with water.”

The man used his bobcat to tow the car out of the water “with the young man visibly shaken”.

When police arrived, the resident said officers told him that the p-plate driver had been on the phone with them for “at least 45 minutes”.

The 25-year-old Pakistani national who died at the location on Wednesday morning had been on the phone with emergency services for more than 40 minutes before contact was lost.

NSW police Det Insp Chris Laird suggested his hire car’s electrical system may have failed, preventing him from escaping.

“The triple zero operator did continue to maintain contact with the 25-year-old male as he was in the car. However, at 7.04am, it’s believed contact was lost with the male. Police arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to find the car.”

Police said the man was driving a new car – a Toyota Camry – and it was unclear why he could not escape in time.

Laird said the flood gate blocking the road and signage was 10 metres underwater when they found his body.

“The actual gate blocking the road was underwater by 10 metres,” Det Insp Chris Laird said at a press conference on Wednesday.

“Given the unprecedented water levels, the gates could not be seen from the roadway at all. What has happened is a complete tragedy.”

The local resident questioned why the road had not been closed or proper signage installed to prevent other drivers making the same mistake.

“This tragedy could have been avoided had the roads been properly closed or manned. In addition, existing flood gates should be positioned above the one-in-100-year flood line.”

He also said that the very shape of the road, which dips into a valley and has many sudden turns, made it extremely dangerous during floods.

“Part of the problem was that the flood gate that closes the road was submerged under the flood waters and, upon approaching the sharp bend, there was no way for a driver to realise there was water across the road, especially in the dark early hours of the morning.”

He said that there was a barricade installed before the bend, but that when the man died there on Wednesday, the lights were not working.

“There was a part barricade 1km beforehand, but the lights were not working. The flashing lights have since been installed on Wednesday and are now working correctly.”

Police have not provided a response after being reached for comment.

Emergency services across Australia have been urging people never to drive through flood water, after another man was found dead in flood waters in the Gold Coast hinterland.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received more than 11,000 calls for assistance during the floods, including 976 rescues.

It rescued a total of 62 people on Wednesday and a total of 994 since the weather event began. More than 1,600 rescue teams have been activated across the state and more than 1,500 volunteers are currently in the field.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969cd513598d77df59155cdb2b6c46022f4de0df/0_360_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f7dff4f8d12d62c805a3bb2f77edf1b,"['resident', 'place', 'driver', 'sydney', 'car', 'water', 'road', 'young', 'waters', 'flood', 'rescued', 'told', 'man', 'death', 'day']", ,flood
81,81,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Karachi business grapples with the aftermath of flooding - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576950,"KARACHI: As the water level receded, business and industry struggled to restore normalcy around the mega city. Fuel pumps ran dry, telecom towers fell out of service and many ATM machines were either not functioning or empty of cash.

Those few pumps where fuel was available were mobbed by motorbikes and cars as well as scores of people holding jerry cans to carry fuel for generators as the city-wide power outage extended beyond 24 hours.

People thronged to supermarkets and corner shops to replenish food stocks, only to find them shut or flooded, and in some cases, the large sections of the artificial ceilings had fallen in as rain water seeped through the roof.

“Fuel supplies at the terminals in Keamari are ample” an executive from a large oil marketing company told Dawn early on Friday. “But before we can start sending out tankers to replenish supplies at retail outlets, we have to test the fuel that is already there to determine whether or not it has been contaminated with flood water. If it has then the underground storage tank needs to first be emptied out before more fuel is poured into it.”

The process could take days but the executive told Dawn that fuel deliveries from the Keamari terminals to some outlets, where underground tanks were not contaminated, had begun by Friday evening and would continue overnight.

ATMs out of cash, fuel pumps dry, telecom service down

“The situation should substantially normalise by Saturday morning.”

The prolonged power outage also impacted many other services. Aisha Sarwari, spokesperson for Jazz told Dawn that “largely due to infrastructural challenges and power outages in Karachi, network disruptions are hard to contain, especially when the damage is this large-scale.”

She said knock on effects occur following prolonged power outages once the back up generators that power telecom towers start running out of fuel. Nobody from the telecom sector was willing to give an estimate for how long it will take to restore normal service, but most said it could take ‘a few working days’.

Many ATMs around the city were also not functional when people ventured out after the deluge. “ATMs work primarily on communication networks, availability of electricity and whether staff can reach the locations to replenish the cash” says Ali Habib, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at HBL.

He said his bank was able to ensure that “at least 55 per cent of our network across the city was functional” on Friday morning.

The inundation triggered the power outages and brought movement around the city to a halt, which in turn had knock on effects on communication, banking services and fuel supply across the city. It was late into the day on Friday when normalcy began to return to the life of the city as the weekend began.

Meanwhile, the city’s utility took to social media middle of the day on Friday to say that “close to 80 per cent feeders are powered up”.

“Many parts of Defence, Clifton, Bahadurabad continue to remain submerged and our substations are also badly affected in these areas due to waterlogging,” the statement said.

By Friday night, reports of power being restored were being received from a growing number of localities around the city.

By Arif Hasan

Before 27 August, this monsoon season had brought much less rainfall to Karachi than on previous occasions. Yet, streets turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, and over 30 people drowned or were electrocuted.

However, on 27 August we had more rainfall in one day than the past 92 years. Entire settlements were washed out. This has raised two questions. One, despite a lower volume of rainfall, why has Karachi been devastated? And two, was the heavy rainfall of 27 August linked to climate change?

Vast population increase and lack of investment in sewers

Karachi’s storm water drains connect to two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other, 14-20 kilometres apart. Fifty-eight storm water drains (nalas) carry water from their catchment areas to these two rivers. Over 600 smaller drains feed into these nalas.

Before independence in 1947, Karachi’s population was only 450,000; it is now over 15 million. The city’s sewage system mostly consisted of underground earthenware pipes, and sewage biologically treated at the gutter baghicha (gutter garden).

The treated effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. The gutter garden covered just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares).

With Partition and the arrival of around 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand. Formal and informal sectors developed far away from the gutter garden.

The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns some 20 kilometres from Karachi. Sewage treatment plants were planned for but never constructed and their sewage flowed (and still flows) into the sea and/or the nalas.

Informal settlements and informal drains

Due to lack of housing, informal settlements developed along the nalas – into where sewage was discharged. After the mid-1960s formal sectors also began using nalas for disposal. Sludge from sewage clogged the nalas and their tributaries, and during the heavy rains of 1978-79, much of the housing along the nalas was washed away.

After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities and compact it along the nala edges to secure them and to create land for their homes. Nala widths decreased substantially from 20-40 meters to less than ten, and four to five metres in some places.

Deterioration of the nalas

Spatially, Karachi is a large city with only two landfill sites, both over 40 kilometres from the eastern edge of the city. Due to the time and costs to get there, garbage increasingly did not reach the landfill sites. Meanwhile, a recycling industry developed, mostly in the informal sector.

Contractors pay the Karachi Metropolitan Cooperation (KMC) officials not to collect the garbage so that recyclable material can be picked from it. The non-recyclable material is then thrown into the nalas or at various informal dumping sites along the natural drainage systems.

By the mid-1990s, most of the nalas were full of compacted solid waste. And to this day children play cricket and football on some of them.

Building over the nalas

With Karachi’s development plans stalled and space pressures for commercial activity, the local government constructed bazaars over the nalas. Meanwhile, the government of Sindh constructed car parking facilities, offices, and hostels on the nalas, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

As space for disposal of solid waste in the nalas reduced over time, solid waste was and is still used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite housing. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire tractors to compact it.

A major part of Karachi’s most elite settlement – the Defence Society – has been reclaimed from the sea through use of municipal solid waste. In addition, two of Karachi’s major outlets to the sea have been considerably reduced by developing housing for high income groups and a highway. Now, water struggles to flow out into the sea especially during high tides.

Storm water drains

To overcome these problems, in the 1980s and 90s the government of Sindh arranged for old sewage treatment plants to be rehabilitated and new ones constructed along with trunk sewers along the main roads. However, these trunks remain dry because the sewage continues to flow in the storm water drains.

The Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) has long supported communities to develop lane sewers and decided to document the storm water drains. It discovered this problem could only be tackled by cleaning and covering the drains and incrementally building trunks along the nalas. This concept was accepted by the state and is being partially implemented.

Real estate development

But now, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels and water collection depressions.

When it rains, areas south of this region are completely submerged by flood waters. With more developments, the likelihood of flooding will also increase.

Serious institutional issues

The central and provincial governments are controlled by different political parties. They are at constant loggerheads making it impossible for Karachi’s infrastructure problems to be tackled rationally and with sufficient finances. It also makes it impossible to develop a decentralised city government, free from direct provincial control.

Desperate to maintain its vote bank, the federal government brought in the National Disaster Management Authority to de-silt Karachi’s nalas. So far they have removed 30,000 tonnes of solid waste from 42 choking points on three nalas.

However, desilting will once again make the edges of the nalas vulnerable to erosion and destroy an unspecified number of homes – widening just one major nala will require 5,782 houses to be removed.

If the proposal for widening all the nalas to their original width is followed, around 60,000 houses will be affected. So far, a concept for the rehabilitation plan has not been developed even though promised by the government.

Tackling these issues will require a long-term plan for Karachi that is in keeping with the finances available or that can be generated. But this cannot be done without an empowered local government and participation of people living along the nalas.

OPP-RTI’s interaction with those communities found only they knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of various smaller drains that had disappeared. But how to bring these communities into the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

Meanwhile, climate change only adds to the urgency of addressing Karachi’s worsening floods.

Two medical teams provided basic outpatient medical services to more than 4,000 patients over the course of a month.

MSF also distributed relief items including kitchen, hygiene and shelter kits to more than 2,500 families affected by the floods in five union councils of Tehsil Johi. Supporting the local authorities, the international emergency humanitarian organization has worked on restoring the main water supply sources and lines that benefit over 60,000 people in different locations. Water treatment tablets have in the meantime been distributed to over 2,000 families in the area.

“Our activities in the flood-affected areas of Sindh are part of MSF’s commitment to support the Pakistani authorities in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters,” MSF country representative in Pakistan Aymen Abdullah said in a statement. “We have also donated medicines to the local authorities to support them in meeting urgent medical needs in the area.

”More than 350 villages in Sindh’s Dadu district were affected by the floods after heavy rainfall in August 2020. Dadu was one of the worst hit areas in the province and its population of over 240,000 were declared calamity-affected by the provincial government. While the floods damaged the houses, roads were also washed away thereby further limiting people’s access to healthcare facilities.

“The post-flood period is critical as there is a high risk of outbreaks of vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as malaria. The objective of our mobile clinics was to improve people’s access to healthcare by providing them with basic care at their doorstep and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. We treated patients with acute respiratory diseases, skin infections, malaria and other illnesses,” said Anna Cilliers, MSF medical coordinator.

MSF is also supporting Sindh’s department of health in an awareness campaign on dengue fever. The cases of dengue fever in Karachi increased recently, and 12 union councils of East and South Karachi were declared hotspots. MSF is broadcasting awareness messages of prevention and protection from dengue fever through TV channels, cable networks and social media.

84,84,FL-2017-000017-PAK,"Surging glacier creates lake, floods Pakistan valley - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1563034,"Danger of another flood as water continues to flow from the lake in Hunza valley in northern Pakistan.

""A loud rumble echoed and water started trickling down with soil and rocks. Villagers immediately left their homes and fled to safety,"" recounted Manzoor Hussain. Hussain lives in Hassanabad, a village in the Hunza valley high in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in northern Pakistan.

It was siesta time on May 30 when the rumbling started. ""It was not the first time, so people in the village knew what was happening. They were aware of glacial lake outburst floods [GLOFs]. They thought it was a GLOF at the Shishper glacier,"" said Hussain.

In fact, a lake near the Machuhar glacier had burst its banks, causing a flood that submerged farms, the local power plant and part of the Karakoram Highway. Most residents had to sleep in tents afterwards.

Was this a GLOF, where the failure of an unstable natural dam releases meltwater from a glacier? The question is complicated by the Karakoram Anomaly, which describes the advance of glaciers in the region in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in the Himalayas and globally. Expert opinion is divided.

Zaheer Uddin Babar, the focal person for GLOFs in the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, said, ""We can’t interlink the recent incident with a GLOF. Satellite images received from SUPARCO [Pakistan’s Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission] are not indicating any glacial lake. It may be the water spilled out from a lake on the surface of the Machuhar glacier. The water flow was as low as 3,000 cusecs [cubic feet per second] only."" In some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, water flow after a GLOF has been recorded at around 100,000 cusecs.

The villagers thought the May 30 incident was a GLOF because they had experienced one with a water flow of 7,000 cusecs in 2019, when a 1.5 kilometre-wide lake burst its banks. That time, a large section of the Karakoram Highway, a bridge, two power plants, some offices, over 100 houses, the water supply pumphouse and most farms were submerged.

Shishper is a surging, or advancing, glacier. It formed around the beginning of the twentieth century, when what was then the Hassanabad glacier in the north of the Hunza valley split into two. Machuhar is the other glacier formed by this split. Like the overwhelming majority of glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, Machuhar is receding due to the warming caused by climate change. There are over 15,000 glaciers in this tallest and youngest mountain range of the world, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar. The number keeps changing as receding glaciers split into two or more.

The surge of one glacier while its neighbour melts is creating a strange situation. Babar said Shishper has been surging quickly; it moved forward two kilometres in 2018-19, though there has been no indication of a surge since November 2019. But the earlier surge blocked the drainage route of the Machuhar glacier. As a result, a lake has formed at the snout, or mouth, of the Machuhar glacier, and is getting bigger as climate change gathers pace and the rate of melt increases.

Blocking the water flowing down from the Machuhar glacier also means blocking this water supply to the Hunza River, a tributary of the transboundary Indus River.

There are other glacier pairs in the same situation. Zahid Hussain, a field manager in a GLOF project, said, ""Yune glacier in Bagrot valley is also extending and it has already blocked the waters of Gurgo glacier. A huge cavity has opened up on the hillside, at the intersection of the two glaciers. There is a lake forming, which can burst its banks and can create a disaster any time.""

Muhammad Riaz, director-general of Pakistan Meteorological Department, told The Third Pole, ""There are more than 3,000 glacial lakes in the Karakoram ranges and 34-36 of them have been declared to be of high GLOF potential.""

The danger of a surging glacier

""But the glacier surge is a larger menace than GLOF,"" said Sher Mohammad, a glacier specialist at the regional International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, with its headquarters in Kathmandu. ""There are more than 200 glaciers identified in the Karakoram range with surging or surge-like history and these glaciers cover more than 40% (7,700 square kilometres) of the total glacier area in the Karakoram.""

""The exact reason for some glaciers surging in the Karakoram is still unclear,"" he added. ""It has no linear correlation with snowfall anomalies and thermal changes. However, extreme weather and climate change probably affect surges and surge dynamics, such as intensification, enhance melting, creating crevasses on glacier surfaces and changing the glacier volume.""

Asif Khan, an expert on climate change and an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said, ""Surging is a short-lived event, when a glacier moves 10 to 100 times faster than its normal velocity.""

Mohammad said the flooding on May 30 was probably triggered by a rise in temperature, causing significant glacier melt and increasing the size of the lake. Meteorological data shows a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May. In the first half of June, water was still flowing down the hillside and being blocked by debris, posing a potential risk of another flood.

Shaukat Ali, a climate expert at the Islamabad-based Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), said, ""Surge is a phenomenon that can also be caused by extreme events of precipitation. The Karakoram Anomaly may cause surging and advancing of the Shishper glacier. Our research at GCISC shows that Gupis, Drosh, Chitral and Gilgit are the future hotspots of the highest increase in average temperature in the 21st century.""

Ali pointed out that this could lead to significant changes in future water availability in Pakistan, which is dependent almost totally on the Indus basin for irrigation and other uses. Pakistan’s agriculture sector contributes around 22% of Pakistan’s GDP, and over 45% of the country’s workforce is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly.

A higher glacier melting rate can also trigger GLOFs and floods downstream, leading to more infrastructure and economic losses, Ali added.

In the first installment, we looked at how advances in robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, computing, and autonomous systems could shape warfare. In our second installment, we will look at how technological, political, social, and environmental change could shape the future economy.

Much like the size and shape of future battlefields, the evolution of trade, commerce, and global marketplaces is rather difficult to predict. After all, wherever human beings are involved (and in large numbers), chaos is sure to ensue! Still, there are a few significant changes on the way that cannot be denied, and which economists are preparing for. They include, in no particular order:

Population growth (predominantly in urban centers)

Growth of non-western economies and markets

New technologies, industries, and professions

Changing temperatures, weather patterns, and water shortages

Renewable energy and sustainability

The bottom line is that the future economies will simultaneously be driven by abundance and scarcity, where more people will need to be sustained using less in the way of resources. This challenge not only has the potential for a lot of uncertainty and chaos, but it will also likely foster the development of solutions.

Growing Populations

According to a 2019 report compiled by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs — titled ""World Population Prospects 2019"" — the global population is expected to reach 9.74 billion by mid-century. However, the addition of more than 2 billion people will not be equally distributed between the world's nations.

Whereas Asia has been the greatest contributor to the global population since the mid-20th century, population growth there has been slowing since the beginning of the 21st century. By 2030, Asia's population growth is expected to plateau, and the population of the continent is expected to stay in the vicinity of 5 billion people until 2050.

From that point onward, the only continent to experience a significant increase in population growth will be Africa. Currently, Africa has a population of 1.36 billion people and is projected to reach up to 2.5 billion by mid-century (that's an increase of about 83%). Nevertheless, by 2050, Asia will still be the most populous continent, with a total population of about 5.29 billion.

Africa will be the second-most populous, with an estimated population of 2.49 billion. Latin America and the Caribbean will be third with an estimated 710 million, followed by Europe (705 million), North America (430 million), and Oceania (60 million). As always, the factors driving this growth will be economic, social, and technological in nature.

Urban Sprawl

Another important aspect of population growth in this century is where it will be concentrated. Today, roughly 56% of the global population lives in urban centers instead of rural settings, which works out to about 4.4 billion people. By 2050, the global urban population is projected to increase to 6.6 billion, or roughly 68% of humanity.

This will place additional stress on environmental systems that are already under severe stress by major cities. Urban expansion means that more land needs to be cleared to build infrastructure, more water needs to be diverted for utilities, more electricity needs to be generated, and more agricultural land needs to be set aside.

Since urban populations will be growing far beyond their rural counterparts, there will be proportionally fewer farmers in addition to less farmland. Coupled with the effects of climate change (see below), this means there will be many more mouths to feed in 2050. At the same time, the resources we'll need to do so will be in shorter supply.

However, the problem goes beyond food production. While every new child born between now and 2050 will be another mouth to feed, they'll also be another person in need of shelter, utilities, sanitation, medical care, education, and eventual employment. When these needs are not met, the end result is generally an increase in violent crime, terrorism, and humanitarian crises.

Luckily, it's not all doom and gloom. For, as the logic goes, every new life is a mouth to feed, but also a pair of working hands and a brain for problem-solving. The same holds true for urban environments, which are a big draw on natural resources but also centers for innovation and creative pursuits.

The (Shifting) Wealth of Nations

The global economic balance is expected to change significantly between now and 2050. While much of this is well underway, the pace of change is predicted to accelerate in the next three decades. According to a 2020 Bloomberg Economics forecast, the post-WWII economic stability enjoyed by the developed nations of the world will be coming to an end as new superpowers take their place on the world stage.

In short, the global economy will experience a shift in its center of gravity, moving from West to East and from advanced economies to emerging markets. The effect this will have on global politics, which is similarly already being felt, will intensify. For starters, China will have overtaken the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035 and become the world's largest economy.

By 2050, Asia's share of the global market share of GDP will grow to over 50% (driven largely by China and India). North American and Europe will account for about 20% each, while the rest of the world will account for less than 10%. In terms of which nations will be the wealthiest, the top ten today are the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, India, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, and Canada.

By 2050, this is forecast to be China, the US, India, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, the U.K., and Turkey. For the first time since the ""Age of Imperialism,"" the richest nations in the world will not all be in Europe and North America. Instead, wealth and the political influence it brings will be more evenly distributed between the continents.

Beyond the top ten spots, the largest economies will also be located outside of Europe and North America. They include Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Mexico, Poland, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

But it's not all about who has the most wealth. There's also the question of which will be the fastest-growing economies. In this respect, the countries experiencing the most significant growth in terms of GDP and per capita income by 2050 will be Nigeria, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia, Columbia, Mexico, and Thailand.

Once again, the markets of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be the greatest drivers of change. Much of this will be the result of digital technology and the access it ensures becoming more widespread, to the point where every nation and person in the world can get online.

Internet of Everything

According to a 2018 report by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), more than half of the global population now has access to the internet. By 2050, 90% of the world's people are expected to have access, owing to a combination of economic growth in the developed world, the proliferation of mobile devices, and access to broadband satellite services.

In addition to people, an exponentially greater amount of mobile devices, sensors, ""smart-home"" appliances, and gadgets will be connected to the internet by the middle of the century. In fact, individual devices may also be ""smartened"" thanks to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms, predictive algorithms, and other forms of neural-net software.

Speaking of technology that imitates how humans process information and learn, ongoing studies into human neurology could well lead to the widespread adoption of neural implants. With devices like Neuralink, people will be able to interface with computers and devices, access the internet, do online banking, blog, surf, and create content through the simple act of thinking!

These developments would further accelerate the transition from a physical to a digital economy, where growth is data-driven and the most valuable resource is content. It will also give rise to the so-called ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) — where the real world will come to resemble the internet. This will have a profound effect on society, by improving efficiency and anticipating behavior in advance.

Concordantly, information security will become far more important, as privacy becomes a thing of the past. With cameras, sensors, and digital markers everywhere, and increasingly sophisticated AI systems mining the data to anticipate patterns and spending habits, every move a person makes will be recorded and cataloged in the cloud.

If outside parties were able to gain access to this data, it could lead to new levels of identity theft, extortion, and online harassment in the near future.

New Industries & New Jobs

Perhaps most significant of all is the way that accelerating technological trends will alter the way people work, communicate, shop, and consume. This will naturally lead to all kinds of new occupations, new opportunities for investment, and a general overhaul in how people ""do business."" Four major trends will coincide to drive this change, among them:

Technological Unemployment: Automation will continue to advance and lead to a vast increase in efficiency, but at the cost of eliminating a number of jobs. This will take not only the form of robotic systems but also machine learning and software that will remove the need for human analysis and oversight.

Increasingly Flexible Work: With automated systems handling more and more in the way of physical production, job growth will be increasingly focused on the creation of content and intellectual property. Combined with wireless technology, far more people will be able to work from home or remote locations and make their own hours.

Options for the Rich and Poor: In the developing world, much industrial work will be eliminated by the introduction of robotics and automated production. This will speed a new trend, where emerging nations and markets are forced to adapt to the high-tech, data-driven economy of the future, and the problems of ""downsizing"" and redundancy shift to the developing world.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchains: The rise of the ""industrial internet"" will create new redundancies but also opportunities for entrepreneurs. As more and more economic activity takes place online, economic activity will be far more direct, peer-to-peer, and decentralized.

This trend towards decentralization will be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the blockchains used to distribute them. These are poised to replace traditional banking and monetary transactions, but they may also be programmed to represent energy, resources, investment, and ownership.

Commercial Space: By 2050, the commercial space industry is expected to grow exponentially and reach the point where it is valued in the trillions. This will be driven by the deployment of ""megaconstellations"" providing telecom and internet services, miniature satellites enabling research and development, and orbital refueling services.

Space will become more and more accessible as launch costs continue to decline, owing to space planes, reusable rockets, and commercial spaceports. By mid-century, this could result in space tourism, space hotels, and even habitats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Commercial missions to the Moon, lunar tourism, and even asteroid mining are also likely to become a reality.

The ability to prospect and mine Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) will lead to a massive influx of precious metals and building materials to the global economy. This is anticipated to lead to the world's first trillionaires, the devaluation of precious metals (which will no longer be scarce), and the creation of a space-construction industry.

A Warming Planet

For decades, scientists have known that Earth has been getting warmer since the late 19th century. This trend is the direct result of humanity's impact on the natural environment and fossil fuel consumption. This has led to increased levels of greenhouse gases — most notably, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which increase the amount of solar radiation our atmosphere absorbs.

According to the 2018 Special Report that was released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures are forecast to increase by an average of 2.7 °F to 3.6 °F (1.5 °C to 2 °C) by 2052. The 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) threshold is the target goal established by the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to mitigate climate change through the reduction of CO 2 emissions.

While this may not sound like a lot, it is important to remember that this is an average increase — which includes annual and regional variations. An increase of 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) to 3.6 °F (2 °C) will mean hotter summers, more precipitation, more instances of extreme weather, and the disruption of natural systems that humans rely on for their survival and livelihood.

These temperature increases will be felt strongly in Central and Eastern North America, Central and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In regions located nearer to the poles (Canada, Russia, South Africa, and South America), the length of the frost-free season will likely increase, as will the corresponding growing season.

Because of this, countries located closer to the poles will experience a boom in agricultural production. At the same time, countries that have the largest supplies of renewable freshwater (Brazil, Russia, and Canada) will be forced to contend with increasing demand and may face serious repercussions if they do not scale up extraction to meet it.

Closer to the equator, temperature increases will mean more precipitation in the winter, which will mean more flooding, coastal storms, and runoff. During the summer, the increased heat will mean more drought, desertification, and the lowering of water tables. The combination of these extremes will also mean more in the way of erosion, runoff, and depletion of topsoil.

Similarly, heavily-populated areas along the coasts and major rivers that empty into oceans will be subject to rising sea levels. According to recent research, an estimated 4.6 billion mi² (7.4 billion km²) of land will flood or be underwater by 2040. This will have a massive economic impact as major urban centers are forced to contend with floods that become worse with every passing year.

By mid-century, several major cities are projected to be abandoned (or significantly depopulated) due to rising tides, flooding river systems, or sinkholes (caused by groundwater extraction). This will not only trigger migrations and refugee crises but will have a major impact on global markets as financial centers are lost.

Another trend, which is already well underway, will be the loss of glaciers and polar ice caps. According to a study released in April of 2020, simulations conducted by the Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) have shown that the Arctic Circle will experience ice-free summers by 2050.

The loss of Arctic sea ice will have a profound impact on the planet, influencing ocean circulation and causing open water to absorb more heat. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in ocean temperatures, as well as the potential release of methane deposits beneath the Arctic Ocean.

A similar situation is happening in Siberia right now, where the disappearance of permafrost is allowing caches of subsurface methane to be released into the atmosphere. This creates a vicious circle, where the warming trend results in feedback mechanisms that cause even more warming, and so on.

Water Wars!

In many parts of the world, rapid industrialization and population growth have led to water shortages. In China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico, and the United States, this has led to desperate measures, and even international incidents. With the added stress caused by climate change, freshwater is projected to become increasingly scarce by 2050.

This will inevitably lead to ""Water Wars"" in parts of the world as neighboring countries fight to control access to limited supplies of freshwater — especially where international river systems are concerned. These rivers are essential for drinking water, irrigation, and sanitation wherever they flow, so neighboring countries are not likely to be in the mood to share when they begin to dry up.

In recent years, ""water futures"" have emerged and are now being traded like all precious commodities — similar to oil, precious metals, and stones. So, in addition to having a significant geopolitical and environmental impact, the disappearance of freshwater sources will also be played out in financial markets.

In the meantime, the scarcity of fresh water will continue to drive investment in desalination technology, water reclamation, and closed-loop environmental systems. This will be especially apparent in how architecture will incorporate ecology (aka. ""arcology"") in order to ensure greater sustainability in urban space.

Greener Energy

On the plus side, the impact of climate change will also lead to positive developments in the manufacturing, energy, and transportation sectors by 2050. For starters, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other ""green technologies"" will be far more common due to declining costs, competitive pricing, and the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2018, 28% of global electricity was generated from renewable energy sources — a combination of hydroelectric (45%), nuclear (28%), wind (13%), solar (6%), biofuels (5%), and other methods (3%). By 2050, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates that renewables will generate 49% of global electricity, followed by natural gas (23%), coal (23%), and nuclear (5%).

Solar will occupy the most significant share of renewable sources, accounting for 38% of all electrical generation, while wind will grow to 34%, hydro will reach 27%, and biomass and other fuels will account for the remainder. For solar and wind power, the greatest contributions are expected to be from China and India.

By mid-century, China will account for 37% of solar and 35% of wind generation worldwide, while India will account for 24% of solar and 22% of wind. Hydroelectric power use will be more evenly distributed, with China (23%), the EU (17%), Brazil (15%), and India (8%) occupying the largest share.

Renewable energy is already having a significant impact in developing nations, where access to centralized grids is limited, and utilities are considered unreliable. In these places, portable solar lights, portable wind turbines, and appliances that use alternative energy sources are providing sustainable energy for small communities.

Due to the ongoing loss of arable land, cities will also become greener as urban farming, vertical farming, aquaculture, hydroponics, community gardens, and buildings that combine architecture and ecology into a single design (arcology).

Other changes will include electronic vehicles (EVs), which will make up over half of the automobile market by 2050. Advances in Tokamak fusion reactors are also expected to lay the groundwork for fusion energy, which is projected to become commercially available by 2050 and after.

—

The economy of 2050 won't be anything most people would recognize today. Physical cash and in-person banking are already giving way to e-banking and e-commerce. By 2050, it will give way to cryptocurrencies and distribution nodes that are not subject to regulation or controlled by any centralized government or financial institution.

Between advancements in technology, more people, more connectivity, and the need to do more with less, it's hard to know how it will all play out. On the one hand, the world may find itself being dragged deeper into ecological damage and resource shortfalls, triggering all manner of crises and struggles.

On the other, it's possible that renewable energy, reduced emissions, smart living, commercial space, and a growing focus on sustainability, humanity will enter a period of ""post-scarcity"" economics. One thing is for sure, though. What we do between now and 2050 will determine what happens beyond that point. We could be headed for disaster, or destined for something better.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/y5wWd0nYOX/sizes/dubai-finance_md.jpg,"['increase', 'life', 'billion', 'growth', 'global', 'economy', 'change', 'water', 'glimpse', 'population', 'energy', '2050', 'world', 'future']", ,none

It does not always rain in Karachi during the monsoon. When it does, it floods. It was worse this year, with a three-day spell of heavy rainfall in late August leading to least 47 deaths due to drowning, electrocution, as well as house and wall collapses. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected”. Personnel from the armed forces have been called out to rescue stranded people, distribute food and medical aid.

Many parts of Karachi went without electricity for 50 hours, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ask, “What kind of service is this?”. Internet and cell phone networks were disrupted all over Pakistan’s largest city.

Women, children and the elderly waded through waist-deep sewage to reach rescue boats as rain continued to pelt down; the boats had to navigate around floating furniture, submerged cars, motorcycles, and even shipping crates pushed around by the force of the floodwater.

The meteorological department totalled August rainfall in Karachi at 484 mm (19 inches), with the highest daily rainfall of 130 mm at PAF Faisal Base on August 28.

“Last year, through the three monsoon months, the PAF Faisal Base recorded a total of 345 mm of rains; this year in just two months, over 600 mm rain has been recorded there,” Sardar Sarfaraz, the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s Karachi head told The Third Pole.

“The rains are unprecedented; and in all likelihood, this seems like an erratic event, with the last such intense rain recorded in 1931,” said Sarfaraz. “I cannot say with finality that this rainfall can definitively be attributed to climate change.”

“Due to the effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle, we will see a continued intensification of monsoons in the coming years,” predicted climate expert Imran Khalid, who heads the Environment and Climate Change section of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute.

Where will the water go?

Khalid wondered, though, if Karachi would have been any better off if there was no climate change? According to him, Karachi’s woes have their roots in poor governance and planning.

“By encroaching and blocking the streams that form the natural watershed, over many decades, the authorities have set us up to fail,” he pointed out, terming the flood footage on television a manifestation of “decades of apathy and ignorance about the laws of nature”.

“If you block the flow of water, it will go around you; if it can’t go around you, it will continue to rise until it envelopes you.” The crises were “of our own making”, Khalid added, emphasising the need to incorporate laws of nature into urban planning.

Karachi has over 550 big and small storm water drains. “But over the years, some as wide as 200 feet have narrowed down to just 30 feet today, due to unauthorised construction,” admitted Karachi’s outgoing mayor Waseem Akhtar, head of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). As he left office on August 30, he said, “Karachi is for everyone but nobody is for Karachi.”

Going about town to inspect the damage, Chief Minister Shah chided people for “building houses in the belly of the Malir river”, according to media reports. “The entire city is sinking because of your encroachments,” he reportedly said.

Noman Ahmed, dean of Architecture and Management Sciences department at Karachi’s NED University, said some encroachments happened in connivance with different government agencies, while some were “organic”.

“For example, the encroachments on Gujjar Nala was facilitated by the KMC functionaries by providing inappropriate leases,” on its edges, in areas that were not supposed to be inhabited in the first place.

“The alignment of the nalas [drains] have clearly been demarcated in all land use plans available with the different civic agencies,” said Ahmed, and therefore selling plots of land was nothing less than a “criminal act”.

He would not blame those who had bought the plots. Ahmed felt people had started building on the dry bed of Gujjar Nala because for decades there was nothing more than a thin stream. “They occupied the land without knowing how vulnerable they were to sudden inundation, and this is what happened in recent rains.”

Architect and heritage consultant Marvi Mazhar also termed “unplanned and unregulated growth, lack of monitoring and corruption” as major reasons for the havoc the rains wrought on the city of 16 million that had been heavily “concretised, with not enough soft ground left for water to be absorbed”.

The problem has persisted despite court judgments, including an order from the country’s chief justice that all illegal construction be removed from Karachi — whether on or off the drains.

Terming removal of encroachments “a very tricky affair”, Ahmed said very often debris left behind by a demolition crew caused more obstruction to water flow than the original buildings had done.

What is to be done?

“These drains can actually be added into beautification plans with plantations on either side, and run across the city like in Amsterdam,” said Mazhar. Instead, she said, they are seen and treated as an eyesore with garbage thrown alongside them, which invariably slips into the drain thereby choking it. She held both residents and the government responsible for the indifference shown towards Karachi’s garbage.

Now Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he wants a “permanent solution” to problems associated with drains, the sewage system and water supply.

Ahmed said the government should come up with a “comprehensive policy for not just all the drains but other waterways and spaces where water accumulates. Just working on a piecemeal basis will not get the desired results.”

He also pointed out that those evicted in this process must be rehabilitated. “The Sindh government has ample land in Karachi’s suburbs. If done in a step by step manner, not everyone will need to be evicted at one go or at least till the re-demarcation of the nalas takes place.”

Many residents feel the collapse of municipal services and consequent problems such as the recent flooding is because Karachi has become too unwieldy to be governed. With 19 different land-owning agencies under the three tiers of government — the city government in the hands of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party that holds the purse strings and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the centre — the city’s problems only get bounced around and the blame game continues.

Same situation all over South Asia

Substitute the names of the rivers, drains and political parties, and the same story is repeated in varying degrees across all the cities of South Asia — Rawalpindi, Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and on and on. For years, residents have been resigned to the mess and vented their ire on social media. Now they have started coming out on the streets — it happened in Kolkata after weeklong power failures in some suburbs following Cyclone Amphan; and it is happening in Karachi now. Perhaps the fact that the hardships have now spread from slums to tony neighbourhoods has something to do with it. The internet is back now, and the phones are working, but the protests continue. Their effect remains to be seen.

The Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a significant flood warning for the northern parts of the country, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in catchment areas of river Kabul River along with hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan division.

""According to latest hydro-meteorological situation, monsoon has become active over Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir producing widespread thunderstorm/rains,"" an alert issued by the PMD's Flood Forecasting Division said. The advisory was shared on Twitter by Azhar Mashwani, the focal person on digital media to the Punjab chief minister.

The alert warned that the existing weather system is likely to persist over those areas during the next 48 hours ""with [a] high probability of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of River Kabul and its tributaries along with hill torrents of DG Khan division which may cause medium to high flood situation"".

Around 872 people were evacuated last week owing to a threat of flood, with several points along the Chenab and Jhelum swelling. At least 60 rescue teams and 326 rescuers saved villagers and their belongings, and still many areas were under the threat of flood.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2020-08-31/pakistan-met-deptt-issues-significant-flood-warning-1598887077-5088.jpg,"['warning', 'khan', 'torrents', 'rainfall', 'punjab', 'significant', 'pakistan', 'issues', 'threat', 'flood', 'kabul', 'met', 'river', 'deptt', 'areas', 'heavy']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: A red alert was issued Tuesday by the federal capital's administration over possible flooding caused by rains expected to lash the city this week.



The Islamabad administration said Ghauri Town, Soan Gardens, and Sectors I-8 and I-9 were forecast to be inundated with rainwater following the heavy rains.

It further underlined that the Soan and Korang rivers, as well as the Simly and Rawal dams, near Islamabad and Rawalpindi were expected to flood during the ongoing week

Flooding was also feared to occur in the kutchi abaadis (slums) in Sectors F-9, G-6, G-8, H-9, and I-9, as well as Khanna Pul, Ghauri Town, and Soan, the administration said.

It warned that opening the Simly and Rawal dams' spillways would likely inundate the Soan and Korang rivers and disrupt electricity, water, and sewerage services in the areas.

The Islamabad administration has imposed an emergency in the federal capital's hospitals ahead of possible destruction due to the rains forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and noted that local schools would be used as relief camps in case of flooding.","Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-09-01/l_708593_054541_updates.jpg,"['rivers', 'flash', 'schools', 'simly', 'possible', 'issues', 'soan', 'flooding', 'sectors', 'islamabad', 'administration', 'alert', 'used', 'town', 'red']", ,flood

Floods symbolise miseries and destruction and their effects can be felt for a very long time, like wrong decisions by politicians drive nations backward and derail them from the path of progress and growth. I am worried to see the way politics is being played on floods where the governments, at both the federal and provincial levels are fighting on percentage sharing. The federal government represents the state and the state is the mother which has to be looked after by each and every citizen of the land.

I wish and hope that Imran khan should have been more tactful and gracious in working with CM Sindh, and CM Sindh should also have cooperated for the sake of the people of Karachi.

The media teams on both sides fight like kids and it looks as if both sides’ media teams are indulging in competition where they are winning at the cost of the public of Karachi who are already crushed with ethnic and poverty storms.

I hope my observations will be taken positively as Karachi is my city too, where I studied and started my civil service; I know the problems of Karachi.

My appeal to fellow politicians is to stop playing politics on floods and other natural disasters at the cost of your own poor masses.

Floods destroy everything that comes in their way and as a poor nation, we keep looking for support and help from rich countries at the cost of our self-respect.

Is it not the duty of the federal or provincial governments to sit with the map of Pakistan, analyse past destruction of the floods and design ways to channel flood water by creating channels based on surveys and hold this water in dams in all provinces?

We should know who is in the charge of it and which authority can take up with provincial authorities. Let me point out that it is the duty of “water board” which needs to be converted into Water board authority which should be empowered with adequate funding to manage the flood water and river water in such a way that each and every drop of water falls in the sea and every drop is used for agriculture to enhance our agricultural proceeds.

Despite being rich in water resources, we Pakistanis continue to face water scarcity every year because of the inability of authorities to properly use and manage these water resources for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability.

Poor water management is costing our country around 4-5 percent of GDP each year. These costs are caused by the floods and droughts that we face due to poor water supply and sanitation. We are endowed with water yet we do not make the best use of this.

The most alarming thing here is that the water crisis was rated as the biggest risk to Pakistan by the World Economic Forum and the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. They also warned that the country could “run dry” by 2025.

Half of the annual rainfall in our country occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimetres in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimetres per month.

This year in August, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall recorded over the last 90 years.

Pakistan receives 145 million-acre feet of water every year. However, only 14m acre-feet of water are preserved and we can meet the shortage if we have proper storage of rainwater and floodwater.

We have rivers and small streams coming from mountains finally meeting at “Sutledge”. The flows and diversions need to be examined scientifically with proper measurements to ensure the use of water for the betterment of local people; it is also important to analyse its miserable effects on the public and crops.

Let every town build a local rain pond which can store all the rainwater which can be used by them later for agricultural and irrigation purposes. Once a storage capacity is built, then a sprinkler irrigation system can be designed and introduced to better store and manage this precious water.

The water can also be converted into clean drinking water by using small plants. This sweet water can be used in multiple ways if properly managed by the local bodies.

We may also let the DC be the Head of a Rainwater Authority to ensure the government’s indulgence and control. It is an extensive but very simple exercise and this should be opted for on a priority.

On one hand, we are facing water scarcity due to floods and poor water management while on the other, we are also facing water terrorism from India as it wants to either just stop/block our share of water with ulterior motives when we need it, or release extra water into our rivers to increase the flow causing floods in Pakistan and we know that both of these are dangerous for Pakistan.

As we are dependent on India for water, Modi, by blocking water, wants to deprive Pakistan of water to convert her into a desert. In fact, Modi is following a full-fledged anti-Pakistan agenda.

India has worked out that the one of the national key quotients is water and hence, India will continue to block water flow from India to Pakistan. PM Modi had already thrown the first water bomb on Pakistan in 2018 by blocking our legitimate natural watercourse. India had completed its construction of Kishanganga hydropower project on the Neelam River by diverting the watercourse through a 16 km tunnel, which is a clear violation of the Indus Water Treaty between the two countries.

The Kishanganga River, upon entering Pakistani territory is recognised as Neelam River that originates from Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and flows through the Gurez Valley to join Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad, at Domail, in Azad Jammu Kashmir. The construction of Kishanganga Dam is also in violation of Article III (4) of the Indus Water Treaty, which places an obligation or restriction on India not to construct any similar projects on western rivers, that is, on Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. Also, the construction of the Kishanganga project will adversely affect the Neelum-Jhelum project, as its power generation capacity will be reduced radically. In accordance with Article III (2) of Indus Water Treaty, India is also prohibited from developing any human made obstructions that shall have or may cause a change in the volume of the natural flow of western rivers.

The project includes a 121 feet tall concrete-face rock-fill dam, which will divert a portion of the river to the south through a 24 km tunnel. The diversion reduced the flow of water into Pakistan by about 11 percent in the summer and about 27 percent in the winter, which would be contrary to the Indus Water Treaty as the western rivers belong to Pakistan. It also contends that the diversion would result in an ecological disaster for the area.

India had signed all the important Conventions that, with complete effect, would ruin our valley totally. It is sad to note that neither our previous government nor the present one ever took this matter seriously whereas the water issue is supposed to be an issue of life and death.

My above suggestions are better in both ways to use the extra water for irrigation. In this way, induction terrorism by India via water flow can be controlled and we can convert this misery into success by irrigating barren land.

We need to bring an enactment/bill or a “rainfall act” to get these activities regulated as a national priority. I am confident that this law will be of great benefit for the nation.

As per many predictions, the next wars will be over sweetwater.

I wish our defence sector takes initiatives to take help of our soldiers to develop these water channels during peacetime with the help of the local public on a volunteer basis.

Let all the provinces and the federation give serious thought to my above proposals.

I will, however, move a bill on “The Flood Control Act” in order to store rainwater throughout the country, fixing the responsibility on concerned authorities.

We have water, all types of minerals, a fertile landscape, the best brains, four seasons, the best beaches, natural gas, green mountains with blue waters and lakes, deserts and forests, but we do not have the command of unity and the skills of governance. We are still slaves of false egos and are masters of self-destruction.

It is time for the leadership to wake up and not flood their national cause and interest. Lead your nation to drive to the valley of love and not hate to protect your future generations.

“National unity Zindabad”.

91,91,FL-2017-000017-PAK,UK pledges support for flood victims in Pakistan - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1578640,"ISLAMABAD: The United Kingdom has decided to provide life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter to over 55,000 vulnerable people in Pakistan to help them recover from devastating floods.

The announcement was made by Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, minister of state for South Asia at the UK’s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, during a virtual visit to Pakistan where he also discussed how Britain could work with the Pakistan government to tackle climate change.

According to a statement issued by the National Emergency Operations Centre on Polio, the £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to the people who have lost their homes.

This comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks, including hygiene kits and tarpaulins, to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Over 55,000 people will get life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter

Lord Ahmad said: “Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands by Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.”

He added: “The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be — and the dangers of climate change. During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.”

British High Commissioner Christian Turner said: “Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.”

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from Covid-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year.

Lord Ahmad discussed with the government of Pakistan how Britain can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations and trade ties.

He also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in south Punjab.

Britain has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly eight million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The UK minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the Covid-19 surveillance centre. He met National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr Rana Safdar who briefed him on Pakistan’s response to Covid-19.

He is scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

92,92,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistan’s flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to “manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle”, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this ‘annual surprise’ presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bang­la­desh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacue­­es, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

93,93,FL-2017-000017-PAK,Karachi: flood management and governance - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2259093/karachi-flood-management-and-governance,"A new debate has erupted over managing floods in Karachi and the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to clear waste from the drains of Karachi due to heavy rainfall. Acrimonious discussions with a blame game against each other were witnessed on TV talk shows between the representatives of the PTI government, the PPP government in Sindh as well as the MQM.

The PPP sees sinister design behind the move to undermine the authority and image of the Sindh government, portraying it as an example of poor governance. Their contention was that Lahore had also been inundated with floods but neither hue and cry was created nor was FWO sent there. Their argument had been that whatever and wherever something goes wrong, the federal government finds the Sindh government as a punching bag to divert people’s attention from their own failures. Be it the sugar crisis, wheat shortage, fuel shortage, rising food inflation or the postings and transfers, the federal government tries to pass the buck to the Sindh government.

The general public is watching all the melodrama with anguish and anxiety. The intervention of the federal government would have gone unnoticed, had it not been with a political motive, belittling the Sindh government. The federal government and provinces do not work in tight compartments, rather they supplement each other within the contours of the Constitution and law. But, when the Governor of Sindh — instead of acting as a representative of the federal government and constitutional head of the province bound to act on the advice of the Chief Executive of the province — starts issuing statements to browbeat the Chief Minister, then it certainly develops irritation and is not taken in a normal course.

No doubt, Karachi, being a metropolitan city has its own problems, but similar problems also exist in all cities of Pakistan. Karachi being the biggest city and economic hub attracts migrants from all over the country and has expanded in all directions without proper town planning. Therefor the problems of Karachi are of a greater magnitude.

Within the ambit of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh and the local government to provide civic amenities to their citizens, which of course include waste management, desilting and clearance of drains. Rainfall in Karachi causing floods is not a rare phenomenon, it happens with recurrence. This nature of problem may be described as a calamity, hence falling within the purview of the NDMA. In this context, preparedness is one of the essentials of disaster management followed by prevention, mitigation of sufferings and community awareness. But, unfortunately governments have been found negligent in their preparation to deal with such crises.

Disaster management or crisis management has a direct co-relation with governance. Governance is all about delivery within time and action of all tiers of government in unison to add synergy to their efforts. In such a situation KMC, DHA, Cantonments, Port Qasim Authority, Irrigation Department and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) with a lead role of the provincial government should have set a strategy to deal with such an eventuality.

The Sindh government could have easily managed excavators, dumpers or other machinery available on rent in the market. Roughly the rent of an excavator is not more than Rs500,000 per week. If the funds were not available with the respective departments, the Chief Minister should have set aside the funds from his own discretionary grant or re-appropriated in order to escape criticism.

While the Sindh government has its own share of blame, the NDMA has its own role to play. The authority has its own National Disaster and Risk Management plan. According to the Act and plan, the PDMA and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are the coordinating units. Therefore, NDMA has to work through those bodies. In such a scenario, NDMA should have shifted all the resources to PDMA and FWO should have also been at the disposal of the provincial government to avoid political point scoring.

Although with a knee-jerk reaction to the malaise symptomatic treatment has been meted out, the main cause has not been removed. This problem has erupted due to massive encroachments in the nullahs, drains, riverbed, poor designing and construction of roads and bridges. This again is a reflection of poor governance. Rule of law is the foundation of governance. We have all kinds of laws but implementation is missing, hence this mess. As the saying goes, “nip the evil in the bud” but the departments assigned to do the task close their eyes to the initial violation and with the passage of time the problem grows such magnitude that all wonder what to do.

Karachi being a port city is now considered to be a city of all. The population of the city is growing at a fast pace, so are the problems. Governments, particularly city governments in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have been managing well. Why not we? A deeper study of their governance reveals the underlying factor: adherence to the rule of law. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the federal government, to implement the law and remove all encroachments done in violation of the law and set aside funds ahead of the monsoon rains. This is the only way out and a permanent solution. This applies to all cities of Pakistan, including the federal capital.

According to a report published in Dawn, the takeover of the local market share by a Chinese product is not uncanny and is similar to several Made in China products that have flooded local markets.

Earlier, the Chinese car tyres held 40 per cent of the market share in 2018. The share now has since increased to 85 per cent. ""In the light truck category tyres, China held a share of 30-40 per cent two years ago which has now gone up to 65-70 per cent,"" the report said.

Moreover, Beijing also dominates in truck/bus tyres with over 75 per cent market share which was merely 40 per cent two years back.



""Mushroom growth has been noted in the number of dealers who are regularly flooding the market with Chinese tyres,"" former chairman of the Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) Azim K. Yousufzai told Dawn.

The association leader said the low prices were the main reason for the surging market share of Chinese tyres. They are cheaper than European, Korean, Thai and American tyres.

On the smuggling of tyres, Yousufzai said the illegal arrival of different types of tyres has slowed down drastically owing to strict vigil at the border areas.

""Strict monitoring at the borders has brought down informal arrival of tyres from 50-60 pc to 20pc,"" he claimed.

Over the decrease in sales of Pakistani tyres, the association leader said that the government has reduced the regulatory duty (RD) to 10-20 per cent for various categories of imported tyres which is among the factors encouraging legal imports. (ANI)

1.1. Background

During the current monsoon, Sindh faced seven spells of moderate to heavy rains. These heavy rains affected several districts of Sindh including different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Sanghar, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Tando Muhamamd Khan Jacobabad and Umerkot.

According to Pakistan Meteorological Department Karachi received the heaviest rain in a single day ever in its history when 231 mm rain lashed out in just 12 hours. Maximum rain recorded in millimetres Karachi (Surjani Town 195, Kemari 170, North Karachi 168, Nazimabad 162, Masroor Base 154, Saddar 142, Landhi 126, Airport Old Area 122, University Road & Saadi Town 105, Jinnah Terminal 104, Gulshan-e-Hadid 49) Moen Jo Daro 44, Shaheed Benazirabad 34, Sukkur 15, Larkana 07, Jacobabad 06, Chor and Hyderabad 02. Hub Dam water level crossed 338.5 feet’ after 13 years of history.

During August 2020, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall record over the last 90 years. In recent most 7th spell that started on August 27 and continued, heavy rainfalls are recorded that turns the Karachi and many districts in Shambles. Karachi alone received 223 mm. of rain over 12 hours, and it caused more devastation to Karachi. Rainwater and overflowed water from nullahs and drains flooded most of the main roads and streets in residential locations, a significant number of residential areas including urban slums and villages in peri-urban areas, that gravely disrupted the people’s lives.

The misery of the people increases many folds due to long power outages and gushing flooded water on streets which causes traffic jams, resulted in difficult access for relief or rescue work in affected areas. The inundated roads caused massive traffic jams in Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Sarjani, Sohrab Goth, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, Nagin Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, Orangi Town, Haideri, Liaqatabad, Gulshan Iqbal, Hussain Abad, Kareem Abad, Shahrah-e-Faisal, Quaidabad, Malir National Highway, Hassan Squire, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Defence, Clifton, Gulberg, Kashmir Colony, Saudabad, Golimar, Rizwia, Patel Para, Pak Colony, Shah Latif Town, Lyari, Sakhi Hassan, Shadman, Anda Mor and other parts of the city.

On 29th August 2020, 6 districts of Karachi are declared as “Calamity hit areas” by the Relief Commissioner - Government Sindh under Sindh National Calamities (P&R) Act 1958. According to RNA the two districts respectively Karachi East and Malir are most affected.

An eight-member official delegation from Islamabad will interact with Indian officials at the 116th Permanent Indus Commission meet during March 23-24 in the first face-to-face formal meeting since the intensification of political tension following India’s decision to change the special status of J&K and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Pakistan is likely to bring up its concerns related to the two hydroelectric plants over two tributaries of the Chenab river. Indian officials are prepared to allay all worries by supplying all necessary information,” the source said.

At the last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission meeting in 2018, Pakistan had reportedly raised objections to some design aspects of the 1,000 MW Pakul Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai plants, including the height of the reservoir, and water storage and releases that are yet to be sorted out.

As per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the eastern rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi are under India’s control, while Pakistan controls the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.

India and Pakistan are also likely to discuss the two new run-of-river hydroelectric plants — Durbuk Shyok (19 MW) and Nimu-Chilling (24 MW) — in Ladakh.

The two sides may also talk about flood data arrangements with the view of the forthcoming flood season, the source added.

The Indus Commission meet, which is supposed to be held annually, got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political tension caused by the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories was also a likely reason for delay.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/x71po4/article34130994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bl23indiapak,"['officials', 'plants', 'meet', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'watersharing', 'mw', 'indus', 'hydroelectric', 'discuss', 'likely', 'commission', 'flood', 'india', 'project', 'exchange']", ,flood

* Pakistan donates dry rations to flood affected in Sri Lanka

Sat, May 22, 2021, 12:28 pm SL Time, ColomboPage News Desk, Sri Lanka.

May 22, Colombo: The government of Pakistan has donated over Rs. 700,000 worth of dry rations to Sri Lanka to provide relief to those affected by the country-wide Covid epidemic and floods.

The High Commissioner of Pakistan, Maj. Gen. (Retd) Muhammad Saad Khattak and Deputy High Commissioner Tanvir Ahmad visited Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo Friday (21) and handed over the donation to Piyal Nishantha De Silva, State Minister of Women and Child Development, Pre-School & Primary Education, for distribution in flood relief areas of Sri Lanka.

The dry rations were donated at the request made by State Minister Piyal Nishantha during a recent meeting with the High Commissioner and Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan.

Covid-19 relief supplies were also provided to police affected, which were received by the SSP, the High Commission said.

During the visit, High Commissioner emphasized on the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two brotherly countries for the uplift of the two countries’ people. He further said that Pakistan is committed to provide continued support to Sri Lanka.","Sat, 22 May 2021 06:58:00 GMT",http://www.colombopage.com/CGImgs_Politics/PK05222021_1.jpg,"['lanka', 'high', 'relief', 'rations', 'pakistan', 'state', 'dry', 'donates', 'sri', 'flood', 'commissioner', 'affected']", ,flood

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son’s body or coffin and were kept apart from Younus’s friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younus’s father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

“When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,” the grieving father said.

“I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didn’t happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.”

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

“Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me,” he said.

“One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.”

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

“I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.”

Younus had three siblings – two older brothers and a younger sister – who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younus’s parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his son’s coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia’s mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the family’s travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younus’s coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends – Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. “We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities,” he said. “We would spend time there with friends.”

The housemate said Younus “loved going to the gym and playing volleyball – he was a very energetic person”.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younus’s parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

“They’re in quarantine at the moment and an exemption was given only after an intense negotiation, with the immigration department, for them to be released for only a very short period of time,” he said. “It was a minute-to-minute procedure.”

The funeral for Younus was delayed due to a coronial inquiry and because of the complications in obtaining permission for his parents to attend.

4,4,FL-2017-000115-PAK,A glacial disaster in the making - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/838236-a-glacial-disaster-in-the-making,"On August 15, 2020, a teenage girl was killed in a remote village in Chitral as a glacial flood swept away six houses, partially damaging sixteen others and inundating standing crops of wheat and beans. Another 11 people were injured as the local police station and a post of Chitral Scouts were submerged. The glacial flood washed away a stretch of more than 500 meters of road to Baroghil valley as well.

Fast-forward to February 28, 2021 and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issues a GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) warning on the Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers in Hunza. The situation is still developing and a potential GLOF event is expected in May-June 2021 which will put the population in the downstream community of Hassanabad village at risk of glacial flooding. The Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers have a history of flash flooding. The current surge of Shishper, a 25 sq kms glacier in size, has brought its snout as close as four km from the Karakoram highway, a critical route for the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) initiative in the region.

This is the new normal in the everyday life of these remote and impoverished mountain communities. Recurring loss of life, property and livelihood due to natural catastrophes, associated primarily with the changing climate in the region, is only aggravating with every passing year. Even worse, these climatic changes are altering weather patterns in the long term, which are not properly understood by these local communities. Though climate-induced changes encompass a wide range of pressing issues, water is arguably the most essential natural resource at risk.

Pakistan is a unique place: the country hosts 7,200+ glaciers in its North, spread over approximately 17,000 sq km, which is home to the mighty Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges. It has reportedly more glacial ice than anywhere on earth outside the polar regions – hence referred to as the third pole. These glaciers feed the rivers that account for around 75 percent of the stored-water supply in a country inhabited by 212+ million people.

Ironically, Pakistan contributes less than one percent to global pollutant emissions, which ranks it among the least emitters. Yet, the country is among the most vulnerable to climate-related hazards like changing monsoon patterns, rapid glacial ice melt leading to inundation and flash flooding, avalanches, landslides and extreme heatwaves. Consequently, climate-induced migration by the local population in mountain and downstream communities of this region to save lives and to look for better livelihood opportunities is a serious challenge. This is the real evidence of the direct human cost of climate change in this part of the world.

Glaciers are a source of freshwater and vital for the ecosystem. As a consequence of climate change and global warming, several glaciers around the world are shrinking in size and gradually retreating. Depending on the volume and size of the glacial lake, temperature and precipitation, and geomorphological parameters of the terrain, mechanical failures may cause a breach in the wall of an ice or moraine-dammed glacial lake. Subsequently, a sudden discharge of millions of cubic meters of meltwater and debris can occur in a short time, with a catastrophic impact on the socioeconomic life of the downstream communities. This phenomenon is referred to as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or GLOFs.

These GLOFs are a major hazard in high altitude glaciated regions of northern Pakistan. According to a UNDP report, around 3,033 glacial lakes have been identified in this region, with at least 33 critical lakes. Many recent scientific studies are projecting an increase in the frequency of GLOFs in the wake of ongoing climate change and global warming. The government of Pakistan's ‘National Climate Change Policy’ identifies the projected recession of HKH glaciers as a major climate threat, while a key finding of the Asian Development Bank, reported in 2017, is the lack of glacier monitoring infrastructure in Pakistan.

Most of the glaciers in Pakistan are at low altitude and the settlements are near the glaciers. This makes them more vulnerable. Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, the regional programme manager for River Basins & Cryosphere at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, has emphasized that even if the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions are reduced to limit the temperature rise as envisioned in the Paris Agreement, a scenario with only a two degree Celsius could still be devastating as two-third of glaciers in the HKH would melt away!

Mitigative measures at local, national and international levels in a coherent manner are immediate imperatives. Mountain and downstream communities settled in these disaster-prone areas are unceasingly at risk and their vulnerabilities are augmented by poverty, lack of awareness about the GLOF threats, increasing pressure on natural resources, and high-risk settlement patterns. At the local level, adaptation to climate change and resilience building through specific initiatives – early warning systems, promotion of clean energy in the mountains, reducing deforestation and land-use regulation – must be enforced. In a country like Pakistan, which lacks essential infrastructure for glacier monitoring, disaster management policies, risk reduction plans, early warning systems and scientific approach and equipment to deal with the new risks and vulnerabilities arising from its natural resources, it is imperative that the international community must come forward and help.

At the moment, the government of Pakistan, through the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC), and UNDP Pakistan are implementing a $37 million project named Scaling Up of GLOF Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II), a continuation of the GLOF-I pilot project, which aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs. This project is expanding weather information surveillance by installing 50 automatic weather stations at different locations in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Though these weather stations will provide information as part of a local-level early warning system, they are limited in scope and scalability for now.

The glaciated region of HKH is vast and stretches over thousands of kilometres across several countries. This third pole necessitates more engagement of the international community through development of local infrastructure, investment in building community resilience, prevention of deforestation, reduction in GHG emissions, application of scientific approach, tools and methods in their study, risk assessment and reduction planning at the regional level, continuous monitoring and integrated analysis of the evolution of glaciers.

The recent summit by US President Biden has made some headway, but there is a real urgency for stronger climate action, limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as proposed in the Paris Agreement, helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts and discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change.

Climate change doesn’t seem to recognize our borders on land and water, and Mother Nature is ruthless when it comes to punishing. Efforts beyond borders, strategic alliances and politics are essential and only an all-inclusive approach can yield desired results.

Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the city’s outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.

Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency.

It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.

Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the country’s largest city.

According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachi’s rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.

The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.

Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.

Fallen power lines caused widespread electrical outages, adding misery to the lives of many of the city’s 15 million residents. Some workers stayed at their offices while others spent the night in open areas because there was no public transport to get home in many parts of the city.

Hundreds of vehicles were dragged along the streets by powerful flood waters.

At least eight people were killed when a wall fell on them in a residential area. The victims included children who were playing at the time. Other casualties were also reported in various parts of Karachi in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from rain-related incidents to more than 40 in recent weeks.

8,8,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Pakistan slum dwellers map flood risks to stop evictions - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210412075730-4tzvi/,"Mapping of informal settlements is key to protecting residents from worsening climate change impacts with as little disruption as possible, urban experts say

By Rina Chandran

April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in the Pakistani city of Karachi have stopped the demolition of thousands of homes by mapping flood risks from clogged drains, offering a feasible solution to other informal settlements facing climate change impacts, urban experts said.

After unexpectedly heavy rains flooded much of Karachi last year, authorities said some slum settlements would be removed to allow drains to be widened, with hundreds of homes in Manzoor Colony settlement earmarked for demolition.

Residents, who had always insisted that the flooding was mainly caused by drains blocked with rubbish and sludge, teamed up with non-profit organisations to map the drainage network.

""They generated their own evidence to uncover the reasons – overlooked by authorities – why Karachi floods,"" said Arif Hasan, an architect and planner who backed the mapping project.

""The communities believed that if these obstructions are removed and the drains are cleaned and maintained, flooding will not take place,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

About 12 million people out of Karachi's 16 million population live in informal settlements, and are increasingly vulnerable as Pakistan's largest city faces worsening inundations as the South Asian monsoon brings extreme weather.

Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, has a network of 550 stormwater drains that criss-cross the city and empty into the Arabian Sea. Many are blocked by illegal construction and waste.

Authorities say they clean out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide funds. The unusually heavy rains killed dozens, submerged main roads and inundated hundreds of homes.

To map Manzoor Colony's drains, a team from the non-profit Technical Training Resource Center (TTRC) walked along them with residents, photographing, marking and mapping more than a dozen blockages.

Their map showed only about 40 houses needed to be removed to leave the drains clear, said Mohammad Sirajuddin, head of TTRC, who led the mapping project.

""The authorities said thousands of houses would need to be demolished, but our maps showed otherwise,"" he said.

In November, residents successfully halted the planned demolitions in Manzoor Colony.

While it is not certain whether authorities will use the community's flood risk map in the future, the residents now know where the choke points are and how they can tackle the dangers, Sirajuddin said.

Two other informal settlements in Karachi are being mapped, with residents - especially young people - trained, he said, adding that the model can be replicated across the country.

These maps also generate crucial data on households, said Nausheen Anwar, director of Karachi Urban Lab, a think-tank.

""The maps provide a process through which consensus can be built and inclusion of all residents can be negotiated to stave off evictions and establish a basis for just compensation and resettlement,"" she said.

By 2030, more than half of Pakistan's projected 250 million population are expected to live in cities, compared to 36% now, according to the United Nations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had pledged to build 5 million affordable homes within five years to address a chronic shortage, with housing rights groups warning that poorer residents face evictions as pressure on land increases.

""When youths in the settlements are trained in mapping, they better understand the risks they face,"" said TTRC's Sirajuddin.

""They understand their rights, and can fight evictions.""

9,9,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Qatar LNG Plans To Flood World Market – gCaptain - gcaptain.com - gcaptain.com,https://gcaptain.com/qatar-lng-world-market-exports/,"By Anna Shiryaevskaya (Bloomberg) The world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas is ramping up production dramatically and undercutting competitors in a bid to squeeze them out the market.

Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. It’s also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the country’s sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, it’s falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

“Qatar’s expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options,” said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. “It’s still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.”

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatar’s monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the world’s top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatar’s hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatar’s main advantage is that it has the world’s lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Qatar’s state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

That’s enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

“Nobody can compete with Qatari costs,” said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. “They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competition’s profits.”

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatar’s Ministry of Energy and QP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when it’s burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

We’re Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russia’s Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said it’s unperturbed by Qatar’s moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing that’s not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

“We’re not afraid,” Cheniere’s Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. “We’re part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.”

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably won’t secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatar’s wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. “Our expansion is very timely,” he said.

“The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink,” OIES’s Stern said. “It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.”

11,11,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Pakistan’s sprawling Karachi ‘broken’ by monsoon floods - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/4/pakistans-sprawling-karachi-broken-by-monsoon-floods,"Record rains inundated Pakistan’s largest city, paralysing city authorities as people were left to fend for themselves.

Karachi/Islamabad, Pakistan – For Shahzad Ahmed, there was no time to think.

“The windows broke and the door caved in, that’s how intense the water pressure was,” he said of the first night of torrential monsoon rain in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, last week.

“We didn’t even try to take the water out of the house. I just tied my rickshaw [to a pole] as tightly as I could and my family and I [got on] the rooftop.”

Ahmed, his wife and children spent more than 10 hours on that roof, in the pouring rain, as Karachi saw more than 230mm of rainfall in less than 12 hours, the most ever recorded, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed and thousands of homes washed away in flooding across the country, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) (PDF).

We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started. Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper

Karachi, a sprawling metropolis of more than 20 million people, was one of the worst-hit by the urban flooding. Streets turned to rivers, as the sheer volume of water quickly overloaded the city’s dilapidated and ill-maintained drainage systems.

In Ahmed’s working-class neighbourhood of Yousuf Goth, a video taken after the rains showed water flowing through the streets, mixing with sewage and solid waste, as residents waded through it to salvage what they can from their homes.

“What we need most right now is clean drinking water and vegetables. You can’t make a meal out of oil or just packets [of dry food],” said Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood.

Muhammad Rashid, 29, a construction worker, said his family was trapped at home, but he had to wade through the sewage periodically to try and find drinking water.

Shehzad Ansari’s aluminium door and window frame shop was inundated by the floods, and ‘everything was destroyed’, he says [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“The only thing I left the house for was water,” he said. “We slept without food on the first night. We were safe on our roof, but I kept leaving in the five feet of water just to get [drinking] water.”

The city’s main thoroughfares did not cope much better, submerged under several feet of water, leaving cars stranded or washed away in the flow. Desperate residents took to contracting agricultural tractors to try and winch their vehicles out.

Electricity supply across the city failed, or was pre-emptively cut, almost immediately, as the city’s main utility company reported its substations were being flooded. The pre-emptive cuts were aimed at limiting deaths due to electrocution if exposed wires were to come into contact with water in the streets.

Right now, it's like kicking a dead horse. They just don't have the capacity for it. Farhan Anwar, urban planner

At least six people died as a result of such electrocutions, hospital officials told Al Jazeera.

Ahmed said he had to take the risk to move his family after 48 hours spent on their rooftop without electricity, water or natural gas to cook with.

“I was worried about the [electricity] current in the waters, but when the choice is between certain death by starvation or possibly electrocution, what could I do?”

‘Governance system failure’

As the rains now begin to subside, the hard work of cleaning up the debris and rebuilding will begin. In a city as divided and administratively “broken” as Karachi, however, urban planners and researchers said that will be easier said than done.

“It is an overall governance system failure,” said Farhan Anwar, an urban planner and faculty member at Karachi’s Habib University. “You can’t isolate a particular cause for it [because] we have, over the years, allowed the city to develop and grow without planning or regulation or a framework.”

Anwar said the city was “on its knees” after the rains, and that its institutions, plagued by decades of mismanagement, a lack of planning and political contestation, simply do not have the capacity to deal with the situation.

‘I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,’ said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amid the wreckage of his store [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“These institutions of governance that are responsible for maintaining services, whether it is water, solid waste management, land, transportation or sewage, they are all totally bankrupt,” he said.

“Right now, it’s like kicking a dead horse. They just don’t have the capacity for it.”

One of the reasons for this, Anwar and others told Al Jazeera, is the complex nature of Karachi’s administrative setup. The city is administered by more than a dozen land-owning civic agencies, all of which work independently and are not beholden to a single set of policies.

The city has a mayor, elected in 2016, but he said he only controls 12 percent of the city’s overall area.

A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture Haris Gazdar, researcher

The rest of the city is managed by a mix of federal and provincial government-controlled landholding bodies, cooperative housing societies, the port authority, the railways department, industrial area authorities and military-run cantonments (PDF).

This situation, Anwar argued, has “straitjacketed” growth and development in Karachi.

“Various agencies have control over resources and management and there is no collaboration or coordination between them … Everyone is on their own.”

As political parties play out their contestations over civic institutions, analysts said, it has left most bankrupt.

“The confrontation between the Pakistan People’s Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement over the years has resulted in a tug of war that is played out within these institutions,” said Anwar.

Nazish Brohi, a social sector researcher, says Karachi’s history of violence – it was the site of brutal political violence through the 1990s and again from 2008 onwards – means there is a high price associated with any kind of reform.

“Because Karachi has been so volatile, in terms of conflict and violence in the past, no one wants to disturb the equilibrium,” she said. “The minute someone intervenes, there is fear of a conflagration.”

In 2012, Karachi was the world’s most dangerous megacity, with a homicide rate far higher than any other city of its size, as the battle for power in the city, rooted in ethnic and identity-based politics, played itself out on the city’s streets.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

A military operation targeting the MQM party, which was held responsible for much of the violence, has since reduced the number of violent deaths in the city considerably, although critics said the operation itself involved a large number of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

The scars of that violence can affect everything, even the rebuilding of the city’s drainage system, argues Brohi. She gives the example of the need to clear the city’s drainage channels of illegally built structures that have blocked them.



“The drainage channels are choked right now, and those encroachments obviously need to be cleared,” she said. “But when the city is undergirded by an ethnic grid, then questions of which drainage channel you touch first can lead to a conflagration.”

The worst-hit area

One of the largest landholding bodies in Karachi is the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), a civic authority run by the country’s powerful military that controls 5 percent of urban Karachi’s land (PDF).

This week, hundreds of residents protested outside the offices DHA’s sister body, the Clifton Cantonment Board (CCB), demanding authorities do more to drain water that had been standing in their streets and homes for days.

In a statement, DHA said its staff was “working round the clock to bring life back to normal”, adding that it would work with the protesters to address the concerns of residents.

A day later, it also registered police charges against protest organisers for “rioting [while] armed with a deadly weapon” at the angry, but peaceful protest.

The area, one of the richest in Karachi, was surprisingly some of the worst-hit, with many neighbourhoods remaining inundated a week after the worst of the rains. Video footage shared with Al Jazeera showed residents complaining of flooded roads and basements, with many forced to sleep on rooftops on in stairwells.

For the city’s urban poor, the situation has been even worse.

“A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture,” said Haris Gazdar, senior researcher at the Collective for Social Science Research. “And if you are even poorer than that, you have no assets other than maybe your [food] ration that you had stored up.”

“We live from hand to mouth and it was the end of the month,” says Kulsoom Bibi, a housekeeper in the Mehmoodabad neighbourhood. “For two days, neither my sister nor I could get out because to [leave] the … tunnel was filled to the brim.”

The impact of the floods is also continuing for many, as their livelihoods or businesses have been decimated by the water.

“How will patients reach me? They can’t. I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,” said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amidst the wreckage of his store.

Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper, returned home after having moved to a relative’s home in a drier neighbourhood for a few days.

“It’s been 12 days since we had proper electricity,” he said. “We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started.”

Climate change

On Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan directed authorities to prepare a plan within a week to reform Karachi’s administrative systems.

Experts, however, scoffed at the idea that anything will change on the ground unless the underlying political contestation and other issues are not addressed.

“It’s not that the city has not been planned for,” said Anwar, the urban planner. “There are so many plans, so many master plans, it’s just a matter of implementation and political consensus existing, and a level of sincerity of how you want to do it.”

For Gazdar, fixing Karachi’s problems goes beyond bureaucratic reshuffles – it requires both a fundamental reorganisation of administrative authority, and a clear focus on climate change.

“Flooding happens everywhere, even in cities in very advanced countries – they also suffer flooding and droughts and fires and so on,” he said.

“A lot of it is a failure to detect what the planet is trying to tell us. If you look at a global picture of the planet, [this is] a failure of the way we live our lives.”

In recent years, Karachi, and the Sindh province of which it is a part, has seen increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, leading to periods of drought and flood, and rainfall intensity changes that have badly affected agricultural practices that have stood in place for centuries.

Asked if he believes any of this will change, however, Gazdar laughs.

“What will happen in the coming weeks is that some other issue will take the spotlight,” he says. “Seven days is a nice period of time, because on the seventh day something else would have happened somewhere else in the country, and that needs another seven days, and before you know it another 70 years will go by.”

12,12,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Extreme Monsoon Rains in Pakistan - nasa.gov - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147330/extreme-monsoon-rains-in-pakistan,"A heavy monsoon season has caused fatal flooding across Pakistan in 2020. More than 400 people have died since mid-June; another 400 were injured; and more than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

The Sindh province in southeastern Pakistan, which received historic amounts of rain, has been the most affected region. The images above show a portion of Sindh on (September 21, 2020) compared to the same time last year (September 21, 2019). The false-color images, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite, use a combination of infrared and visible light (bands 7-2-1) to make it easier to see the boundary between water and land. Water appears navy blue and black; vegetation is bright green.

Sindh was hit by sporadic heavy rains in July and experienced record-breaking rainfall in August. Karachi, the provincial capital and country’s most populous city, recorded the most August rainfall in 89 years of record keeping. Karachi received around 490 millimeters (19 inches) of rain for the month—more than 200 millimeters occurred within twelve hours. According to news reports, some of the urban flooding was the result of clogged stormwater drains.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported heavy rains in late August in other parts of the province, affecting the districts of Mirpur Khas, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Larkana. The Karachi, Hyderbad, and Mirpur Khas districts were declared “calamity-affected areas.” More than 2 million people across Sindh Province have been affected by monsoon rains this year, with 68,000 residents displaced in relief camps.

The government also reported that nearly one million acres of crops have also been destroyed by the flooding. Fields of cotton, vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and sugarcane have been affected.

Monsoon season generally lasts from mid-June through September. As of September 24, the PMD reported normal flow along the Indus and several other key rivers in the country.

13,13,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"As parts of Pakistan ban water-guzzling paddy, one farmer has a solution - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/994235/as-parts-of-pakistan-ban-water-guzzling-paddy-one-farmer-has-a-solution,"The season for sowing paddy is about to kick off in Sindh. But the province in southeast Pakistan has banned rice cultivation in 10 districts on the left bank of the Indus river.

This ban is announced every year at the end of April or early May to limit the waterlogging, salinity and drought-like conditions caused by successive rice farming. By some accounts, rice cultivation has been banned in these areas for over 90 years. Similarly, the Indian government bans paddy cultivation in “dark zones” to help water aquifers.

“Dark zones” are areas of acute overexploitation of groundwater, due to the use of water exceeding its recharge. But these orders fall on deaf ears, as rice cultivation continues in large swathes of farmland in both countries.

Rasheed Channa, the spokesperson for Sindh’s chief minister, said this time will be different. The government is “dead serious” about penalising those who violate the ban, Channa said. District administrations have already been told to be on the lookout for nurseries and “raze the seedlings before they can be transplanted” to flooded fields.

The news sparked considerable anger within the farming community, with farmers saying the government’s timing and thought process were poor.

“The growers were informed just a month before sowing that paddy will not be allowed,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, senior vice-president of the Sindh Abadgar Board, an organisation formed to protect the rights of farmers in the province. “They had not prepared land or bought seeds to grow an alternative crop.”

Policymakers must realise that switching crops on more than 40,000 hectares after the season for other crops has passed is “almost impossible”, he added.

“Even if 20,000 acres [8,000 hectares] are suddenly cultivated for other crops, where will we get buyers from? The prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits will fall,” he pointed out.

Rice and water

While fears for livelihoods are valid, the ban underscores the government’s growing concerns about water scarcity. The chief minister, who is a progressive farmer himself, said one kilogramme of rice requires up to 3,000 litres of water. Officials said water standing in rice farms for long periods of time has caused waterlogging, and that the high-delta crop also uses up other crops’ share of water for irrigation. Low-delta crops need comparatively less water.

As Pakistan grapples with increased glacial melt and erratic rainfall, managing the canal-fed, water-intensive rice crop is yet another problem. The issue is exacerbated by high demand and the fact that rice generates 8% of Pakistan’s income from exports.

Zahid Bhurgri, general secretary of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a lobbying group for farmers, agrees that rice causes waterlogging and soil destruction. But he also said it is “safe”.

“It is considered a safer bet, especially as we confront climate change [because of which] too much or too little water can destroy other delicate crops, like cotton,” Bhurgri said. He added that rice is an easier crop to grow as it “requires nothing but to be submerged in three to four inches of water”.

Justifying rice ban

“There will be 30% less water this year,” said Sindh’s agriculture minister, Ismail Rahu, to The Third Pole, justifying the ban on the “water guzzler”.

Though Rahu acknowledges that “rice is the bread and butter of hundreds of farmers”, he suggested they cultivate low-delta crops, such as beans, melon and vegetables, as they are less water-intensive and detrimental to the soil.

In many of these districts, the water that is available is of poor quality.

Zarif Khero, the chief engineer at Sindh’s Irrigation Department, said the most important consideration is soil fertility, which is spoilt by rice.

“The way [rice cultivation] is done by flooding the fields causes waterlogging, which will eventually turn the soil into wasteland,” he said.

Finding alternatives

Rafique Suleman, a spokesperson for trade body the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, sees the ban as nothing short of an “atrocity”.

“Instead of providing incentives to grow more, the government is taking away our livelihood,” he said. He pointed out that rice, Pakistan’s second-biggest export after textiles, annually brings in around $2.5 billion into the country.

There is similar resistance in India. Despite depleting groundwater in paddy farming areas, farmers do not give up rice because of assured buying from the states of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana.

The only way out, some say, is to give farmers incentives to grow something else.

Farmer with solution

This is where Asif Sharif, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan in Pakistan’s Punjab province, comes in. Sharif, an online sensation within the South Asian farming community, has a solution: if the rice has to be grown, it should happen without flood irrigation. According to him, the rice plant uses 70% of its energy just to survive the inundation.

“Rice can be grown with minimal water,” said the 70-year-old. He added that the ban in parts of Sindh is “unnecessary”.

“Give it less water and the yield will be three to four times more,” he said, adding that the soil should be kept reasonably moist.

Sharif grows a variety of crops on his 200 hectares of land and has thousands of farmers listening to his every word. He engages with the virtual community and gives advice to people from across the globe.

He has more than 24,000 followers, mostly farmers, including quite a few from Punjab on the Indian side. They share videos on his Facebook page, titled Pedaver, showing how well their crops are doing after they follow his tips.

Sharif said, “everything can be grown anywhere”.

He advocates for farmers to return to doing cultivation on raised beds, without tilling and using organic mulch. Paradoxical agriculture, or “paedar qudrati nizam kashtkari” as he calls it, is a “comprehensive climate-smart production process total solution”.

“The process took several years to develop and mature,” said Sharif. “I started with the System of Rice Intensification in 2008. Then merged the crop system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Conservation Agriculture by 2011. This is how the process evolved by 2014.”

The results are impressive. “In Punjab, we have reduced the production cost of wheat from 1,500 Pakistani rupees to 400 Pakistani rupees per 40 kg,” he claimed.

And yet, he has been unable to bring about a revolution. He faults the farm munshi or manager for thwarting development. “They get huge kickbacks by creating demand for each input that increases the cost of production,” he said.

Farmers with huge landholdings are also to blame, he said. “In connivance with corporations and businesses, they keep the rural population deprived of knowledge and therefore, prosperity,” he said.

He talked of the need for a “crop production management company” that travels to different farmlands, teaching farmers how to grow certified crops that are exportable.

Zarif Khero from Sindh’s Irrigation Department supported the idea of training. “Farmers should engage with students from agricultural universities so they can transition to modern methods of sustainable farming which can result in better yields,” he suggested.

14,14,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Pakistan: Post-disaster recovery transition lessons from the 2010 floods - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77313,"Source(s): Climate Adaptation Platform (CAP)



In 2010 severe flooding hit Pakistan, inundating about 37 thousand square kilometres of the nation’s area.

Over 20 million people were affected; the number is higher than those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2005 Cyclone Katrina, or the 2008 cyclone Nargis in Myanmar.

The total loss from these massive floods totalled US$10.4 billion, or 5.7% of Pakistan’s GDP. After the flooding event, the rescue and relief activities lasted up to 8 months, which began in July 2010 until the end of March 2011.

Sindh province was one of the most affected by this event; out of the 20 million affected, 7.3 million residents were from the Sindh province. Sadly for them, the post-recovery after this unprecedented flood stopped at the rescue and relief phase.

According to the study, there was no recovery and reconstruction authority established in the province after the flooding incident – a task that belongs to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Although the institution was lauded for its well-coordinated emergency phase efforts, the recovery and reconstruction phase efforts were missing in the province.

Using Pakistan’s worst flooding in 2010 as a case study, researchers examined the disaster recovery activities after the flood. They highlighted the factors that hinder the transitions to recovery phases in Pakistan, which may also be true in other developing countries.

The three Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) phases in the study are the following –

relief phase, which is meeting the most immediate needs of the community following a disaster, rehabilitation phase or the restoration of basic service and facilities to make communities and societies function; this includes providing temporary housing or shelter, mass feeding, treatment of the injured etc. and lastly, the recovery phase is also termed as the long-term phase wherein major reconstruction, development, and capacity building through structural or non-structural measures occur.

Other PDR phase model like the one proposed by Haast and others shows 4 overlapping phases – emergency, restoration, reconstruction 1, and reconstruction 2, which is similar to the UNDRR model. These PDR models are thoroughly discussed in the study.

According to the study, the Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) in developing countries is limited to the relief and rescue operations, thus failing to transition to subsequent phases like rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery, leading to a full and long-term recovery of a community.

The study finds that the post-disaster recovery in Sindh after the 2010 floods failed to transition to the long-term recovery phase.

The factors that hindered these transitions include the following:

The lack of community-level involvement – the state and relevant institutions failed to place communities at the centre of the recovery process,

Inadequate coping capacity, resource and skills of both the community and local administration which will impede their long-term recovery actions,

Absence of any recovery and reconstruction authority after the flood

No coherence or coordination in the PDR activities among stakeholders led to confusion between stakeholders and hindered the smooth transition of recovery, and

Lack of information and data among local administration and stakeholders led to politically motivating projects and aid distributions.

Through a better understanding of the smooth transition of the various phases of the PDR, the study can help policymakers and disaster management practitioners plan and implement effective PDR strategies, especially in developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate-related and natural disasters.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,"['longterm', 'postdisaster', 'relief', 'lessons', 'pakistan', 'recovery', '2010', 'pdr', 'reconstruction', 'flooding', 'study', 'floods', 'phases', 'transition', 'phase']", ,flood

Taus Bibi, 70, was tending to her goats in Sherabad, an area in Hassanabad, Hunza, when she heard a loud sound of something crashing into the nearby water channel. One of her grandchildren followed shortly, running and asking her to evacuate to a safe area as a flood was dangerously close to their home. Taus had no choice but to run to a nearby orchard where she and other people displaced by the flood spent over 35 hours.

Hassanabad also had one of the major power stations for the district of Hunza, which was also wiped out, depriving the villagers of electricity for many days. Such floods, resulting from glacial lake outbursts have been hitting the village of Hassanabad, (which includes Sherabad, Harum, Roshanabad and main Hassanabad) since 2010. Out of all the surging glaciers in the Karakorum Range, the Shisper Glacier is 12 kms long and has been impacting the most lives in the Hassanabad region.

Melted glacier water can form ice walls, which end up creating reservoirs for the rest of the melted ice. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) occur when these ice walls fail, unleashing entire lakes on nearby villages and roads. There are at least 7,000 glaciers in Gilgit Baltistan out of which 3,044 have formed glacial lakes while 33 are at the risk of outburst flooding. Such floods, if not mitigated, threaten at least seven million people in both Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In March 2017, in order to prevent large scale flooding, a project was started to scale up the lakes that were at the risk of bursting. The Ministry of Climate Change has been leading the project along with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and funding from the Green Climate Fund. The Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project is a part of ‘Reducing Risks and Vulnerabilities from GLOF in Northern Pakistan’, also known as GLOF I.

The Shisper Glacier is melting again with the advent of summer in Pakistan and despite the efforts by GLOF I, at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk and families have been asked to evacuate to safer locations while the Gilgit Baltistan administration has declared a state of emergency in the surrounding areas. Teams from both GLOF and the Pakistan Meteorological Department are keeping a close eye on the lake using ground penetrating radars and Differential GPS. Water levels are also being monitored. An automatic weather station has also been installed in Shisper to monitor the weather in real time.

Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committees (CBDRMC) have been formed by training locals in disaster risk reduction, they have also undergone mock drills while being trained in disaster preparedness.

It has been decided that the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) in collaboration with GLOF II will build gabion walls to protect the population in case of a flood, while irrigation channels are also on the cards along with building of shelters, where people may run to in case there is a disaster.

Emergency response equipment has also been handed out to the locals, which include generators, UPS batteries, inverters, binoculars, walkie talkies, GPS, gas cylinders, portal generators, cyber shot cameras, range finders and small solar panels.

Despite these measures, the locals stay fearful, as disaster management is not as good as living disaster free. They are waiting for permanent solutions, such as migration options to safer places that are not in the path of GLOFs, however, with the very real threat of climate change, it is only a matter of time before we have a lot more than just one village and glacier to think about.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0.jpg,"['shisper', 'climate', 'gilgit', 'disasters', 'change', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'risk', 'hassanabad', 'water', 'glofs', 'baltistan', 'impending', 'disaster', 'glof']", ,flood

This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season. The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

18,18,FL-2017-000115-PAK,May 21: a day of special significance for China and Pakistan - Daily Times,https://dailytimes.com.pk/758734/may-21-a-day-of-special-significance-for-china-and-pakistan/,"May 21, 2021 is a day of special significance for the People’s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As the Chinese old saying goes, “Even mountains and seas cannot distance people with common aspirations.” 70 years ago, China and Pakistan joined hands overpass the Karakoram Mountains to formally establish diplomatic relations. The past 70 years have witnessed the two countries sharing weal and woe. The time-tested China-Pakistan friendship now sets exemplary for state-to-state relations, and is strategic asset for both countries, most dearly cherished by the two peoples.

Similar histories brought us close to each other. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries and have similar experiences in getting rid of foreign aggression and seeking independence. At such critical times, be it when New China endeavored to break the external blockade and open up a new prospect for diplomacy, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other.

Similar ideas guide us stand shoulder to shoulder. China and Pakistan are the backbones in maintaining regional peace and stability. The two countries firmly defend multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation, commit to improving the global governance system, and support increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. China and Pakistan always respect the diversity of civilizations, and advocate the vision of exchanges rather than estrangement, mutual learning rather than conflict, and coexistence rather than seeking superiority.

Common interests deepen our cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative. 46 projects have been completed or under construction, with a total investment of US$25.4 billion. The CPEC successfully helped Pakistan solve the power shortage that has plagued it for decades, established the main traffic line from north to south, and revitalized Gwadar Port to become a regional trade hub. China has been Pakistan’s largest trading partner for six consecutive years and largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years.

The tests of crisis reconfirms our common choice. The two peoples are always the first to lend a helping hand to each other when the other side is in trouble. When Wenchuan earthquake hit China in 2008, and when flood plagued Pakistan in 2010, both sides supported each other with full efforts. After the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the governments, armies and all walks of life of the two countries have rendered mutual assistance, and carried out close cooperation in fields of emergency supplies, Covid-19 prevention experiences-sharing, vaccine research and development, thus setting a model for international cooperation against the pandemic.

2021 is a year of great significance for both China and Pakistan. China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and is implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan to embark on a new journey of modernization. Pakistan is making every effort to develop its economy and realize the Naya Pakistan vision proposed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, providing us with new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation. Standing at a new historic starting point, the two countries should further implement the important consensus reached by our leaders, continue to deepen the iron-clad friendship between China and Pakistan, and jointly build a closer China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future in the New Era.

China will continue to put Pakistan on the top agenda of its diplomacy, and firmly support Pakistan to maintain sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and exert a greater constructive role in international and regional affairs. We will continue to provide Pakistan support of medical supplies and vaccines within our capacity until Pakistan completely defeats the pandemic. Following the principle of mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, opening-up and inclusiveness, China will work with Pakistan to boost high-quality development of the CPEC, focus more on industry, agriculture, science and technology and people’s livelihood, so as to develop Pakistan’s manufacturing industry and increase employment and income of its people. China will continue to work closely with Pakistan to deepen the friendship between the two peoples, especially the young generation. We will endeavor to carry forward the China-Pakistan iron-clad friendship for another 70 years, enhancing the all-weather friendship and all-dimensional cooperation, and work together to uplift China-Pakistan bilateral relations to a new level with a brighter future.

Last but not the least, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Pakistan, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and great respect to Pakistani friends from all circles who care about and support the development of our bilateral relations.

(Str/Xinhua/IANS)

Even as the country’s financial capital Karachi battles intense monsoon flood, experts have warned that Pakistan lacks modern weather forecast radars for timely prediction of flooding. Over the last one week, intense monsoon downpour over Karachi has plagued the city with waterlogging, flash floods and power cuts.

Karachi recorded a whopping 230 mm rainfall in a single day on August 27, making this August the wettest August in 89 years. Overall, at least 39 people have been killed so far in several parts of the country this week.

Monsoon death toll spike to 134

The death toll from rain-related incidents across Pakistan has increased to 134, the country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report.

Sharing the data of casualties from June 15 to August 29 on its website, the NDMA said on Saturday that rescue and relief operations were being carried out in the affected areas by concerned departments of the government, army and non-governmental organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst hit where 48 people were killed and 42 others injured, the authority said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah told a press conference on Friday that 80 people were killed in rains in the province with 47 fatalities in provincial capital Karachi alone.

He said 604-mm rainfall was recorded in Karachi during August, breaking the years-long record of heavy rains in the city during the month. The torrential rains have caused a disastrous situation in Balochistan province where scores were left homeless after their houses were swept away by flash floods triggered off by lashing rains.

The NDMA has provided tents, food items, blankets, mosquito nets, among others, in the affected areas. The authority said scattered thunderstorms and rain with isolated heavy falls are also expected in parts of the country on Sunday. More rainfall is expected later next week.

This year, the meteorological department forecast more than usual rains during the ongoing monsoon season and concerned departments have issued advisories for the general public to take self-precautionary measures.

Pakistan lacks modern flood warning system

Advertisement Despite the annual devastation caused by urban flooding in cities and flash floods in the mountainous areas of Pakistan, the country has neither an effective telemetry system nor authorities said. The monsoon winds are the major source of downpour in the country during the months of July-September.

""The country still does not have an effective aviation system to deal with flood disasters and other catastrophes,"" the National Monsoon Contingency Plan 2020 compiled by the Natural Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed on Saturday.

According to the plan, Pakistan has a medium and long term forecast system capable of accurately predicting the weather for a period of only 7 to 15 days while the seasonal weather forecast accuracy rate is also not more than 65-70 per cent, The Express Tribune reported.

The report indicated that the country is relying on old technology for the weather forecast, which makes it difficult to create standard and accurate atmospheric predictions. There is no telemetry system for flash flood warning in the mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Balochistan.

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Flash floods triggered by heavy rains killed 15 people and damaged scores of houses in Pakistan's scenic northwestern Swat Valley, a spokesman said Wednesday, as rescuers assisted residents in the port city of Karachi where last week's rains wreaked havoc that killed dozens.

The latest floods-related fatalities were reported from the Swat region, a popular tourist destination where landslides overnight blocked a key mountain road, stranding scores of tourists who were being evacuated, said Taimur Khan, spokesman for a disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy monsoon rains hit parts of Pakistan last month, triggering flash floods in the country's financial capital of Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, killing at least 47 people there. Since June, when rains began lashing Pakistan, at least 176 people have been killed across the country, according to the national disaster management agency.

Last week, Karachi's many neighborhoods were flooded and water is still being pump out from submerged streets.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was expected to visit Karachi to meet with residents and get a briefing about damages caused by the monsoon rains, which came as authorities have been trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 296,000 people and killed 6,318 since February.

Pakistan reported 18 more deaths on Wednesday from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

For several kilometres and pretty much as far as the eye could see, there were temporary camps for the flood-affected, dispossessed communities, with families living in hastily erected shelters on the roadside.

Some 136 people have been reported dead and thousands have been displaced in this year’s monsoon season, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The United Nations World Food Programme has reached 11,000 people with emergency food assistance and is calling for $500,000 (£400,000) to increase its reach, particularly in the Sindh region—up to 300,000 people are in need of food assistance.

Communities face serious health risks living in appalling conditions. Flies and mosquitos are everywhere. Getting by is a daily struggle. People walk long distances in search of fresh water—the alternative is to drink from the dirty water along the roadside that children play in. Many do just that.

Women bathe their children in the same water they wash clothes in. Limited supplies of clean water are strictly rationed.

Many farmers lost their cattle in the floods. Some built makeshift shelters for the animals and shared whatever clean water they could spare with them.

For some towns and villages, such as the ones in Mirpurkhas district, we had to travel by motorboat to reach the area. Villagers there told us that they hadn’t seen any outsiders ever since the floods devastated their homes and that all their crops were now gone and possessions lost; no more houses, and nothing to eat.

If they are left alone to fend for themselves, these communities may not able to make it. Their mud houses and fragile livelihoods as subsistence farmers cannot withstand such an onslaught.

Working closely with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in Sindh, the World Food Programme has provided them with food rations — flour, pulses, cooking oil, and nutritious edibles for children to prevent malnutrition from setting in.

The devastation is equally visible in an urban slum that we visited in the city of Karachi. Amid damaged houses and roads, children were running around barefoot; mothers with babies navigated puddles of floodwater and sewage.

The effects of climate change are being increasingly felt in Sindh, and they are taking a particularly heavy toll on these communities of subsistence farmers, nomadic tribes, as well as on those living in urban slums. Urgent assistance is required now.

Long lines and shortages plagued the government’s free vaccine campaign. The newspaper was full of reports that connected people were lined up for free.

Later, 35-year-old government consultant Chaudhry discovered that he could afford to jump over long lines on his own. He registered from a private hospital to receive two Russian-made Sputnik V vaccines for about $ 80. In a country where the average worker earns about $ 110 a month, that’s a lot of money, but Chaudhry was ready to make a promise.

By Rina Saeed Khan

ISLAMABAD, Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Flood-slammed Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, could face worsening urban inundations in coming years, in part as the South Asian monsoon shifts, climate scientists have warned.

The winds that drive Pakistan's annual monsoon, which arrives from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, appear to be altering as a result of climate change, which could push more rainfall to Karachi - and less to key agricultural regions, they said.

""It's new phenomenon and we need to understand it. It hasn't rained like this in Karachi for more than half a century,"" said Shaukat Ali, a meteorologist and senior scientific officer at the Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad.

He said winds driving the monsoon from the Bay of Bengal appear to be shifting it northwards, away from its traditional core zone in the agricultural breadbasket of Punjab.

Winds from the Arabian Sea have traditionally been weak but now seem to be strengthening, Ali said.

This year monsoon winds were ""extremely erratic"", he said, with hotter temperatures in the Arabian Sea leading to monsoon depressions that dumped unexpectedly heavy rainfall on an unprepared Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.

""The sea and winds behaved very differently this monsoon,"" he noted.

RECORD RAINS

Record-breaking heavy rain in Karachi in August killed over 100 people and disrupted the lives of many of the city's more than 15 million residents as water flooded main roads and homes.

The city received its largest-ever-recorded rainfall total in a single day on August 24, when 230 mm (9 inches) of rain fall in just 12 hours, according to the Pakistan Meteorology Department.

Over the month, Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) of rain, the highest total in at least 90 years, it noted.

Heavier rainfall in Karachi this year was in part the result of a La Nina phenomenon, a regular oscillation in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can drive changes in rainfall, said Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

It was likely the larger driver of this year's shift in rainfall, he said.

But as climate change warms oceans, it is also accelerating evaporation of water, which then falls as rain - one significant additional driver of Karachi's floods, he said.

Both scientists have been part of a research effort through GCISC to better predict extreme weather in South Asia and help countries adapt to it.

A paper published by Ashfaq and a dozen international researchers in June, in the journal Climate Dynamics, predicted that unchecked climate-changing emissions could shorten Asian monsoons, with more intense rain falling in a shorter period.

The rest of the year would then have longer dry periods, it said.

These extremes could worsen floods, droughts, wildfires and other weather-related threats that already pose a problem in the region, the scientists said.

CAPTURING WATER

Malik Amin Aslam, the Pakistan prime minister's special assistant on climate change, said the reports indicate the ""frequency and intensity of climate-triggered freak events is going up in Pakistan"".

That was likely to affect not just urban communities but farmers, he said.

""The timing of rains is radically shifting without allowing an agriculture adaptation to adjust to the new reality,"" he said. In a recent trip to Pakistan's mountainous north, he said, he had seen how the shifting South Asian monsoon was accelerating glacier melt, while Karachi and Sindh province's coast were receiving heavy rains that once fell out at sea.

He said Sindh is one of the most climate-impacted regions of the country, with worsening heatwaves also making life difficult for residents.

To deal with increasing extreme rainfall and glacier melt, he said, the country needed to find ways to capture and store ""the huge amounts of water which are becoming available"" in order to recharge aquifers and provide water in dry periods.

Ashfaq agreed that more reservoirs and dams were needed to store water and for flood control. Cities and towns also needed to adapt their infrastructure for extreme rainfall events and move homes away from riverbanks, he said.

Ayaz Younus, 25, died on the way to his first day at a new job when his car became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on March 24.

The Australian resident was the first victim of the floods that ravaged parts of Sydney's west, and had been on the phone to emergency services before he died.

He was a software engineer who had recently completed his masters degree. He was to start his job as a driver for a multinational company.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed because of a coronial inquiry as well as efforts to have his family attend the funeral from Pakistan.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia has helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

It said a request for Mr Younus' three siblings to fly from Pakistan had been denied by the Australian government.

His parents arrived in Australia on Sunday and immediately went into quarantine.

The association said the man's parents had been given an exemption by the Australian government to attend part of the funeral, and it hoped it could negotiate for the parents to be able to attend the burial site.

Hamad Chaudhry, who knew Mr Younus through the association, remembers him as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

""Ayaz was a very happy and friendly person who loved his sport and was extremely community-minded. He is deeply missed,"" Mr Chaudhry told AAP.

""It's been very important to help get his parents out to Australia, and his siblings will be watching the funeral virtually.""

Mr Younus is remembered as an active volunteer, planting trees in his community in western Sydney and donating his time to various charities.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Pakistan, the military said it would deploy rescue helicopters to the city of Karachi to transport some 200 families to safety after canal waters flooded the city during monsoon rains.

A total of 90 people have died in rain-related incidents across Pakistan since Sunday, the country's national disaster management agency said.

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered aid to be delivered to Parwan and other provinces, while expressing his condolences to the victims' families.

Disaster management ministry spokesman Ahmad Tameem Azimi said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces, and that teams were working to reopen the roads to traffic.

He added that at least 300 houses were destroyed in Parwan and over a thousand people displaced, and that ground and air support sent to help those trapped by the flooding had reached the provinces.

Hundreds of acres of agricultural land have been destroyed, with rain wiping out crops in eastern Nuristan province.

Mr Azimi said that houses and roads were also destroyed in northern Kapisa, Panjshir and eastern Paktia provinces.

Two people died and five others were also injured in eastern Maidan Wardak province after flooding destroyed several homes there.

And in Nangarhar, located in the eastern part of Afghanistan, two members of a family died and four others were injured on Wednesday when the wall of their house collapsed in flooding.

KARACHI, Pakistan -- Three days of heavy monsoon rains triggering flash floods killed at least 58 people in various parts of Pakistan, as troops with boats rushed Sunday to evacuate people from flood-affected districts in the country's southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.

According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, eight in Punjab province and 10 in the country's scenic northern Gligit Baltistan region in the past three days.

Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.

Heavy rains also lashed many districts in the southwestern Baluchistan province, killing eight people, damaging homes and inundating many villages in the district of Jhal Magsi, according to Saleem Zakir, spokesman for provincial disaster management authority. He said rescuers with the army’s help were still trying to evacuate people from the district's flood-hit villages.

He said floods damaged a bridge and a gas pipeline and destroyed coastal roads on the Arabian Sea, severing links to the port of Gwadar, part of China’s multi-billion dollar one-road project linking south and Central Asia to China.

According to local media reports, hundreds of people moved to nearby hills when the floodwaters entered their villages in remote areas of Baluchistan, and the military used helicopters and boats to move them to safer places. Authorities were dispatching tents and food for the flood-affected people.

Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.

According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.

In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.

29,29,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Graveyards in Rawalpindi city running out of space - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1625120,"RAWALPINDI: The shortage of space in existing graveyards of the city has been a cause for concern among residents of the city as the government continues to ignore the issue.

Almost 90pc of Rawalpindi’s graveyards are short on space to accommodate fresh requests to bury the dead. There are more than 60 small and big graveyards in the garrison city and 10 in cantonment areas.

All main graveyards of the city including Ratta Amral, Pirwadhai, Eidgah, Shan Diyan Talian, Kuri Road, Dhoke Khaba, Dhoke Illahi Buksh, Dhoke Kashmirian, Cha Sultan, Malikan Da Kabristan, and the one near Committee Chowk do not have space for new graves. Yet, grave diggers dig new graves over unattended ones to accommodate requests that cannot be turned down.

During a survey, Dawn found encroachments along graveyards whereas due to limited space, managements of graveyard committees have also been charging higher prices for new graves. All graveyards are without boundary walls and land grabbers have managed to carry out construction in their surrounding areas; the worst affected is one of the oldest graveyards of Rawalpindi whereas the Dhoke Ratta and Pirwadhai graveyards also present the same picture.

Management of the graveyards had dug new graves along the bank of the nullah passing through the area but during monsoon, flood water destroys them, creating problems for the heirs.

The Eidgah graveyard is accommodating new arrivals as the management extended limits of the graveyard along the banks of the nullah.

Racecourse graveyard in cantonment is also running out of space. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) imposed a ban on new arrivals in the graveyard and asked that limited space be allocated for only army personnel.

Mohammad Nasir, resident of Mohanpura, said that his father died two months ago and he visited all the graveyards near his locality but they refused to bury his father. He said he talked to a grave-digger in Dhoke Illahi Buksh who managed to provide a space between two graves for his deceased father.

A resident of Chaklala Scheme III, Mudassir Malik said his brother died a few weeks ago and his family faced difficulty in finding a place to bury the deceased as there was no space available in Chaklala Scheme-III graveyard.

He said he paid Rs30,000 to the graveyard near Chungi Stop adjacent to Scheme-III. The government should allocate space for a graveyard in the city. In mid-90’s, 1000 kanals of land was allocated for the purpose in Rakh Dhamial but since the last 26 years, all governments failed to develop the graveyard.

In 2017, the PML-N government had launched project Shehr-e-Khamoshan and started work to construct a funeral prayer site, mosque, ablution area and other facilities but the graveyard is still not being utilised.

On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested in burying their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamial as it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the deceased and people to attend funeral prayers.

RDA, which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and managing housing societies across the district has failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards. Under the law, every private housing society has to allocate space for graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and it has to be transferred in the name of the state.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said that the ruling party has failed to develop graveyards. “We do not expect good from them as they are snatching bread from the people. How can they provide facilities?” he said.

The PML-N government in its tenure developed the Rakh Dhamial graveyard but work on it was stopped by the present government just to get political revenge from PML-N.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi said that development of graveyards was the government’s priority. When contacted, Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) Chief officer Ali Abbas Bukhari said Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat directed to speed up work to develop Rakh Dhamial graveyard and make it functional as soon as possible.

He said that RMC purchased two funeral buses so families could transport deceased persons to the graveyard. “We are providing free of cost service to citizens in the garrison city for use of funeral buses. We will purchase two more buses soon,” he said, adding there is an acute shortage of graveyards in the city making burial of the dead a great problem for the bereaved families.

The Pakistan Red Cross Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is assessing the evolution of the current monsoon rainfalls and its impacts during the next few days.

The situation

Heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan from 6 – 7 August 2020 with intermissions. This Monsoon rains created floods situation in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu. However, Tehsil Johi of District Dadu is the area which is greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods not only damaged the houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh already declared 80 villages of District Dadu as “Calamity Affected Areas’’. The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad and Jhal Magsi.

PRCS is already working together with the government, Movement partners and other organizations for COVID19 Response. The changing Scenario of i.e. floods/flash floods may increase the risks of COVID-19 spread in the affected communities. It has been reported that due to floods, many communities are forced to live together in small camps. The initial reports suggested that District Dadu of Sindh and District Jhal Magsi, Sibi, Harnai, Naseeabad and Kachi of Baluchistan are the worst-hit areas. However, administration is still in process of damage and need assessment as most of the communication channels are also broken in some affected areas. The floods also destroyed standing crops and greatly affected the livelihood of inhabitants.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Situation Report No.13 as of 13 August 2020, heavy monsoon rainfall has caused flooding and damages in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces over the last few days. The report indicates that as of date 82 people have lost their lives and 28 injuries, while 873 houses are fully damaged while 186 partially damaged.

In Baluchistan, 13 people have died in floods in recent days, with many more reportedly missing. Over 861 homes are fully damaged and 46 partially damaged. Flooding struck in the districts of Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Gwadar, Pasni, Kachi and Dera Bugti from 7 August 2020. Severe flooding occurred in the west of the province from 8 August after flood water from Baluchistan made its way downstream along the Nai Gaj river.

Meanwhile in Sindh Province, heavy rainfall from 6 August caused flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sakrand, Tando Jam, Dadu and Thatta. The floods caused 31 death. Hundreds of people were rescued by military personnel. Formal requests by district government through Deputy Commissioners of respective districts including situation of damages possibly with numbers/figures and required support in terms of food and non-food on immediate basis is expected.

The government is responding the situation and Pakistan army is carrying the Search & Rescue and evacuation operation. Some of the steps taken by government are as follows.

• 299 persons evacuated using 10 boats in district Dadu district by Armed Forces.

• PDMA Baluchistan Emergency Operational Center and DDMAs control rooms are functional and on high alert.

• Damage assessment by district government in Baluchistan is being conducted.

• Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) is providing relief items to Dadu District Administration including 1,000 boats with motors, 1,000 units of tents, 1,000 sets of kitchen sets, 1,000 units of mosquito nets, 1,000 units of jerry cans and 1,000 units of water coolers.

33,33,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Pakistan floods: 1.4 million children at risk of homelessness and disease - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-14-million-children-risk-homelessness-and-disease,"As many as 1.4 million children[i] face homelessness and disease following some of the worst ever floods in Pakistan, warns Save the Children.

In scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods that swept parts of the country in 2010, children are living outdoors, schools have been destroyed or damaged and agricultural crops have been lost. In many rural districts, people have only five days’ worth of food stock left.

There are concerns for the spread of COVID-19 and water-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, as a large-scale humanitarian operation gathers pace across Sindh province in Pakistan’s south-east.

Khuram Gondal, Save the Children’s Country Director in Pakistan, said:

“During the current monsoon, Sindh province has experienced some of the heaviest rainfall for nearly 90 years and more heavy rains are expected.

“More than 4 million people have been impacted by the monsoon floods and that’s equivalent to the population of a city the size of Rome.

“Make no mistake, this is an under-reported humanitarian catastrophe deserving of more attention, which would stretch the resources of the most powerful and richest nations on the planet.”

One of the major impacts of the floods is on crops and livestock. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmlands have been damaged, leading to fears for the supply of food.

“We are hearing that in many flood-affected communities only about three per cent of households have received food assistance, with food stocks running out in five to nine days’ time, depending on whether people live in rural or urban areas,” warned Mr Gondal.

There are worries for the disruption of children’s education, too.

“A thorough assessment of the full flood damage to schools is urgently required, but in one district of Sindh our teams found damage to scores of schools, with some destroyed completely.

“As a result, we expect long-term disruption to the education of boys and girls. We are also concerned that the damage to schools may aggravate the high school drop-out ratio of children, especially girls.

“Partially damaged schools are not safe or ready to accommodate students returning after several months of learning gaps due to COVID-19, therefore an urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction approach is needed,” said Mr Gondal.

The intense rains and floods that have battered Pakistan’s Sindh province raise the alarm for climate change, warns Save the Children.

“We know that extreme and erratic weather events pose a growing threat to children’s ability to thrive. It’s therefore never been more important for climate vulnerable communities to be supported to cope with and adapt to climate change, as well as build their resilience to hazards like floods,” added Mr Gondal.

There are fears that today’s floods could eclipse the floods from a decade ago, especially if the monsoon rains continue as predicted. But during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, international media attention led to a huge humanitarian relief effort.

“The Pakistani authorities are working very hard to support their people, but they need urgent support from the international community,” said Mr Gondal.

In response to the floods, Save the Children has mobilised humanitarian aid workers and supplies to:

Provide 400 households with emergency tents

Provide 700 of the most vulnerable households with emergency food rations

Pump water out of main roads to ensure access to school buildings and basic health units

At least two people were killed and more than a dozen were injured as torrential rains damaged houses in Panjgur district of Balochistan.

The torrential rains and hailstones started Friday afternoon caused flood and mud, debris and rainwater entered into houses in Tusp Khuda-Badan, Girmakan, Wasbod Kilag, Irap, Damb and other areas of the district.

“We did not break fast till late evening as water entered our house and we were trying to keep our stuff safe,” said Anwar Azad, a resident of Dumb. He added flood not only destroyed our valuable stuff and furniture but also damaged walls of our house.

According to locals of the area, walls of more than a hundred houses in Dumb, Irap, Qadirsbad, Saravan and adjacent areas were collapsed and dozens of livestock and two vehicles were washed away in the flash floods, while the situation compelled people to spend whole night in open sky.

Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Abdul Razzaq Sasoli, SP Captain (retd) Zuhaib Mushin, Commandant Frontier Corps (FC) Panjgur Rifles and other officials visited the flood-affected areas, examined the damages caused by flash floods and assured public of financial and manpower support.

Sasoli assured people that Levies, police and FC men were on the ground helping affected people and taking part in rescue operation, adding the government would compensate flood-affected people.

Following the situation emerged after heavy rain and flood, Panjgur Rifles FC set up an emergency cell in the town through which affectees would be assisted.

“All flood-affectees are directed to submit their claims and other details with Emergency Cell or contact officials at the helpline, 0855641240,” said Panjgur FC in a statement issued on Saturday.

And it is dangerous.

Awash in bad information, people have swallowed hydroxychloroquine hoping the drug will protect them against COVID-19 — even with no evidence that it helps (SN Online: 8/2/20). Others refuse to wear masks, contrary to the best public health advice available. In January, protestors disrupted a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles, blocking life-saving shots for hundreds of people. “COVID has opened everyone’s eyes to the dangers of health misinformation,” says cognitive scientist Briony Swire-Thompson of Northeastern University in Boston.

The pandemic has made clear that bad information can kill. And scientists are struggling to stem the tide of misinformation that threatens to drown society. The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, 83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.

Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information — and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what they’re looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.

Wow factor

Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with “troll farms” in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.

Some people unwittingly share misinformation on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented — whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)

Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. “Seeing is believing,” Sundar says.

Video sells WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic — in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine. S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand. Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement T. Tibbitts T. Tibbitts Source: S.S. Sundar and E. Cho/Penn State and M. Molina/Michigan State Univ.

The findings, in press at the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. “People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form,” Sundar says. That’s especially important with the rise of deepfake technologies that feature false but visually convincing videos (SN: 9/15/18, p. 12).

One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once it’s there. We’re constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it,” she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.

Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist because of the influence of their emotions and values, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives — or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.

One such approach is to “prebunk” beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change canceled any benefit of receiving the true information. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined people’s understanding of what was true.

That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information before giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that “Charles Darwin” and “members of the Spice Girls” were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.

Here’s a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, Bad News, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called GO VIRAL! Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.

Take a breath

Sometimes it doesn’t take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what they’re doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.

In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as “Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling,” with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants’ analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, lazy thinking rather than political bias may drive people’s susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in Cognition.

When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into people’s behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm people’s reasoning skills when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.

Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to “nudge” the concept of accuracy into people’s minds, helping them resist misinformation. “It’s basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form,” he says. “We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.”

Push in the right direction Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge. Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing T. Tibbitts Source: G. Pennycook et al/Nature 2021

With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation — Breitbart and InfoWars — Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.

On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. It’s a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges — but the work, reported online March 17 in Nature, suggests that very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect.

For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as “true” or “false” after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

How to debunk Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if you’re fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers: Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.

Don’t stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or you’re more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.

Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.

When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).

Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check after someone reads a headline can be helpful, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.

Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.

Misinformation researchers have recently called for social media companies to share more of their data so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users’ privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.

Much of the work to date on misinformation’s spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.

The flood situation in Pakistan is a complete disaster. In the north-west heavy downpour has overwhelmed the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A total of 23 lives have been lost in this province alone. In the north-east, the province of Punjab is no better, eight lives have been lost to incessant rains and flooding.In the south-west Balochistan too is reeling with flood and at least 15 people have died.

Right next to Balochistan is Sindh. The worst affected province in Pakistan, where 31 people have died here due to the annual monsoon deluge.

Karachi is the capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's financial hub. Karachi is now a submerged city. The residents say they are losing everything to rainwater.

At least eight people have died in Karachi alone. Mostly due to electrocution and drowning. Now, sewage water is flooding homes in low-lying areas and disaster relief is yet to arrive.

A recent study examines the link between power structures and vulnerability to flash floods in Reshun. The vulnerable location of Reshun, a village in Upper Chitral District in the northwest of Pakistan, leaves it exposed to natural disaster hazards. It sits along the seismically active Hindu Kush mountain range—and at the base of a drainage stream for the massive Chitral glaciers. While the risk of glacial flooding is regional, the vulnerabilities among Reshun's residents are far from equal, according to study authors Ishaq Khan and Inam Ullah Leghari, a graduate student and professor at the Department of Anthropology at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.

Members of Chitral's lowest serf class, cheermuzh, have long lived in stark marginalization. Now as glacial floods in Reshun grow more frequent due to climate change, low-income residents with little access to political power are left increasingly without options. The floods disproportionately devastate cheermuzh communities, and aid has been insufficient. As Hamna Tariq, a junior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center, told GlacierHub, ""They tough it out, until they cannot.""

Outside the polar regions, Pakistan is one of the world's major centers of glacial ice. Over 7,000 known glaciers lie within its borders and more than 500 of these glaciers are in the remote Chitral valley. The entire area is at risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are outpours of meltwater caused by glacial dam failure. However, exposure to GLOFs is highly varied and determined by one's social status.

Chitral society is divided into four classes—the highest of which is ""adamzade"" (proper human), and the lowest of which is a serf class, cheermuzh, often referred to as ""beizzat"" (without respect) and ""ghalamus"" (slave). True to a serfdom-like system, upper classes grant land to cheermuzh to live and farm on, which they retain by providing services to their landlords. This hierarchy is not just functional, but reflective of social attitudes toward low-status residents; a Chitral resident of lordly descent opposed the construction of a water pipe in his village on the grounds that he could not drink the same water as cheermuzh.

Like the village's social organization, vulnerabilities to glacial lake outburst floods are unequal and hierarchized. Reshun's cheermuzh communities reside by a stream flowing between two mountains. Flash floods linked to heavy rains and GLOFs annually devastate these communities.

The impacts of the 2013 and 2015 flash floods, in particular, illustrate their disproportionate effect on low-status residents. Khan and Leghari found that the 2013 Reshun flood's damage was concentrated in three mostly cheermuzh hamlets —Panandeh, Batikandeh, and Golguch. Only families in these hamlets lost their homes or livestock, an important food source and financial asset. There were 23 fully damaged and 16 partially damaged houses. The flooding also destroyed the hamlets' drinking water supply line and the bridges connecting them to evacuation routes.

Though these low-status residents were stranded, help didn't come for days. Aid workers were even instructed not to go into the hamlets as a precautionary measure. One resident, Ashraf Khan, told the study authors how he and his family were forced to spend one week outside, unaided and unsheltered, after their home was destroyed.

Two years later, the flash floods were even worse. Nearly 100 houses were fully damaged, 86 of which belonged to low-status households, including Khan's. His family was one of 30 low-status households whose homes were destroyed twice, in both 2013 and 2015. As mentioned in the study, all of these households had rebuilt their homes in the same place, as they had nowhere else to live. On the other hand, five households whose homes were destroyed in the 2013 flood and who could afford to move elsewhere were unaffected in 2015.

The 2015 flood also completely washed away the road connecting the three hamlets to the main road. ""Flash flood isolated us from the rest of the world,"" said another resident, Sher Muhammad, who was quoted in the study. Now, not only were cheermuzh socially marginalized, but they were also physically isolated.

Muhammad is also involved in Golguch's anti-grazing movement. As glacial lake outburst floods have become more frequent, goat grazing near Reshun's nearby glaciers has become a controversial issue. According to anti-grazers, grazing intensifies flooding by breaking the soil surrounding the nearby glaciers. Khan, the graduate student who co-authored the article, wrote to GlacierHub that grazing is ""mostly supported by lordly families,"" who are not at the highest risk of flooding, while opponents of grazing are mostly from low-status backgrounds. This divide is indicative of the class-based vulnerabilities to GLOFs and the tensions that have risen as a result.

Without any prospect that GLOFs will subside in a warming climate, Reshun's cheermuzh residents are left without many options. Writing to GlacierHub, Hamna Tariq highlighted the need for government aid: ""Granted these regions are nestled between dangerous landscapes, more can still be done like providing better warning systems, immediate flood relief aid, temporary housing, and employment opportunities.""

The article's authors, Khan and Muhammad, emphasize the importance of addressing power structures in addition to the floods. They write that ""the effectiveness of mitigation and relief programs for such communities can only be achieved if the political structure of the past and its perpetual effect could be understood.""

As the study illustrates, Reshun residents like Ashraf Khan and Sher Muhammad face the severe dangers of glacial flooding due to no fault of their own, but as a result of their socioeconomic marginalization. The paper's conclusions affirm the need not only to address GLOF-related impacts, but also the class inequities that create these unequal vulnerabilities. Failing to address this two-fold crisis is to fail these residents and all others at the frontlines of climate change.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

First spell of heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan Province from 6 August and continued until 7 August 2020 with intermissions. Continuous rain over a period of 24 hours caused massive flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu districts of Sindh province, with Tehsil Johi in Dadu district as the area greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods are not only damaging infrastructures and houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh has declared 80 villages in Dadu district as “Calamity Affected Areas’’.

The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad, Jafferabad and Jhal Magsi districts where Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts as the most affected areas according to the rapid need assessment report. On 18 August 2020, the Government of Baluchistan also declared emergency in Jhal Magsi district. Besides the recent floods, COVID-19 outbreak is also a threat to the affected population. However, the number of positive cases reported so far in the targeted district are on lower side. As of 7 September 2020, Dadu district reported 1,184 positive cases, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad (Baluchistan) 328 and 71 reported positive COVID-19 cases respectively.

Another heavy spell of Monsoon rain started in most part of the country on 20 August 2020 and continued until 3 September 2020 with intervals. This resulted in urban flooding in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, while flash floods reported in district Shangla, Swat and flooding in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Karachi experienced heaviest rains in almost a century, killing at least 41 people in the city. Thousands of people were trapped due to waterlogging in low-lying slums. In some part of the city people were without electricity for days as urban flooding badly affected infrastructure. The second spell of flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Despite the best efforts of the government, the living conditions of the displaced are appalling, with very limited access to safe water and food and with limited shelter. In the meantime, they have no safe water or livelihoods.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538276-MDRPK019du1.png?itok=ikFPghHy,"['n', 'dref', 'monsoon', 'mdrpk019', 'pakistan', '2020', 'water', 'operation', 'report', 'province', 'flooding', 'updates', 'karachi', 'floods', 'district', 'sindh', 'affected', 'reported']", ,flood

2.5 million people have been affected by floods which devasted Sindh Province in late August.

71,500 people received in-kind food assistance during WFP’s first phase of the response between September and early October.

117,000 people will receive cash assistance under WFP’s second phase of the response. Among them, 26,658 people have already been reached.

Highlights

• WFP initiated a second phase of relief assistance in November 2020 to meet persistent humanitarian needs in Sindh’s flood affected districts. Cash transfers under this second phase are expected to be completed by early January.

• Following the relief phase, WFP plans to focus on recovery efforts in 2021 together with its government and development partners, to rebuild livelihoods and rehabilitate assets that can support sustainable food security.

WFP Funding Requirements

• WFP’s ongoing relief assistance is fully funded.

• WFP is currently seeking contributions to support recovery activities planned in 2021.

Situation Update

• The floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton.

• Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

• The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

• On 10 November, WFP started distributing unconditional cash assistance to vulnerable floodaffected households who had not yet received in-kind food assistance from WFP in September. Distributions are being carried out in the three most affected districts: Umerkot, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas.

• Each targeted household is receiving a multipurpose cash transfer of PKR 15,000 (approximately USD 90), distributed in two tranches.

• Sensitization sessions on nutrition and hygiene practices are also being carried out at distribution points and through village development committees, with a focus on pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. Sensitization sessions also cover precautionary measures against the spread of COVID19 and dengue virus.

• As of 15 December, WFP and its partners, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and Secours Islamique France (SIF) have distributed cash assistance to 26,658 people.

• WFP plans to distribute assistance to another 90,342 people by early January 2021.

• Following the completion of this relief cash assistance in January 2021, WFP is looking to support the Sindh Government’s recovery efforts. Working with Government and development partners, WFP is in the process of designing livelihoods recovery programmes, including cash-for-asset and disaster risk reduction activities, to reduce the impacts of future floods and droughts.","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549279-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%235%20%2816%20Dec%202020%29.png?itok=93hsgBQs,"['development', 'situation', 'food', 'response', 'relief', 'pakistan', '2020', 'recovery', 'assistance', 'cash', 'report', 'wfp', 'flood', 'wfps', '16', 'sindh', 'phase', 'affected']", ,flood

By Henrike Brecht and Ahsan Tehsin

Mehar Khan, 54, had poured his life’s savings into building a modest home for his family in Naya Nazimabad, a housing society in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Karachi was particularly hard hit by torrential rains in August which caused around $1 billion in national economic damage and loss. Streets across the city turned into rivers and washed away many houses. Mehar’s family was one among thousands stranded in inundated parts of the city for days.

Pakistan’s financial and economic center, Karachi with its 16 million inhabitants is home to the country's largest corporations and main ports. Its economy has grown steadily for decades - last year its GDP was nearly $164 billion. The city has also made impressive progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2015.

Now, Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success? It doesn’t have to. Moving forward, the city can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction:

Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success?

First, the sewage network needs an urgent overhaul. Karachi can reap large benefits from the development and implementation of a comprehensive Drainage and Stormwater Master Plan for the entire city. The World Bank is helping large cities implement drainage solutions for the 21st century and adapt to climate change, for example, in Yangon, Myanmar or Manila, Philippines.

Second, comprehensive solutions for solid waste management are important. Of the 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste generated each day in Karachi, 60 percent does not reach a dumpsite, and trash accumulates in drainage pipes. Across the globe, cities are employing new approaches to solid waste management, focusing on reduction and recycling. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $4.7 billion to more than 340 solid waste management programs, for instance, in Indonesia or China.

Third, moving towards sponge city concept to absorb rainwater, prioritizing green infrastructure and permeable surfaces will go a long way to counter floods and heat. Instead of carrying the water away, these sponge cities treat it as a resource that is filtered by the soil and then stored. This ensures the economic and sustainable use of the valuable natural resource that fresh water constitutes. It also helps the city cool down through evaporation. This would involve stopping encroachment into urban wetlands and increasing water infiltration through greening, which would reduce the need for costly storm water drainage systems in the city. China’s Sponge Cities Initiative provides $12 billion to more than 30 of its cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan, with the aim of re-using 70 percent of rainwater in 80 percent of the urban areas which are part of the program.

Karachi can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction.

Comprehensive policy changes would be as equally important as targeted investments to reduce flooding in Karachi. Responsibilities between agencies at national, provincial and local levels need to be clearly defined. Coordination among the different jurisdictions to develop entire-city approaches need to replace administrative fragmentation. Risk-sensitive land-use plans and their enforcement must ensure that new development takes place away from the most at-risk zones. New infrastructure and risk reduction strategies cannot be developed separately. These measures need to converge to help reduce the city’s vulnerability in the long-term, for example, through building code development and enforcement. Strengthening Karachi’s emergency management response systems through drills and equipment will also reduce the impacts of disasters.

Challenging the status quo will not be easy. For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

But changing course will be cost-effective in the long-term. Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Plan 2012–22 ranks Karachi as the country’s most vulnerable district. Karachi is not only prone to floods but also to earthquakes, cyclones and more recently, heatwaves. Pakistan is also the fifth most affected country by climate change. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, they will severely impact people’s livelihoods and Karachi’s economic competitiveness.

For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

The good news is that Karachi can benefit from existing developments and build on initial achievements. Pakistan shifted to an ex-ante disaster risk management approach after the 2005 earthquake. A National Flood Protection Plan, Pakistan’s investments in nature-based solutions and reforestation programs along with the Karachi Transformative Strategy pave the way. The World Bank continues to strengthen Karachi’s efforts to become more resilient. It committed $652 million in 2019 to reinforce the city’s infrastructure and institutions with a focus on urban management, public transport, safe water, and sanitation.

Karachi also benefits from the Sindh Resilience Project, which invests in flood protection works and integrates disaster risk reduction in planning processes. The Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project and the Hydromet and Climate Services Project also support climate sensitive and sustainable solutions.

The World Bank stands ready to assist Karachi in moving forward to become a world-class inclusive, sustainable and more livable city.","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['largest', 'city', 'building', 'management', 'climate', 'pakistan', 'need', 'economic', 'water', 'karachi', 'floods', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'world', 'risk']", ,flood

(Photo: Reuters)

Pakistan has been reeling under floods for the past three months, leading to the loss of hundreds of lives. However, leave alone its neighbours or the rest of the world, even people in Pakistan are hardly talking about it.

The first indications of the worsening flood situation were noticed when a recently established UK-based NGO called Muslim Aid started collecting funds for Pakistanis.

Latest satellite images from Sentinel were accessed by India Today OSINT team and compared with three-month-old images to understand the extent of flood damage in Pakistan.

These are false colour images taken using a combination of infrared and visible light that clearly distinguishes between land, which appears bright green, and water that appears black.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been providing situation reports that have been ignored by most government ministries. The latest NDMA report indicates 400 deaths and damages to over 2 lakh houses.

While damage to infrastructure is maximum in Sindh province, the highest deaths have been reported from Sindh and Punjab. More than 6 lakh acres of crops have suffered damage in Mirpur Khas and Dadu districts alone. The next few days are crucial as yet another spate of rains is expected by NDMA.

(Photo: India Today)

The satellite images, when compared to previous years’ data, indicate that no action has been taken by Pakistan to either resettle victims or alleviate threats since the deadly 2010 floods.

The administration has made no effort to train the rivers properly. River banks haven’t been lined and bridges across the Indus are under danger of getting washed away. Road approaches stall water overflowing the riverside, thus, endangering the complete bridge infrastructure. The Dadu Moro Bridge is a classic example of this type of possible future damage that can be assessed from satellite imagery.

(Photo: India Today)

The Indus River is clearly not trained at the bridge site with either retainer walls or embankments, thus, overflowing the divergent guide banks. The next large gush of flood waters will certainly damage this bridge’s western side severely.

Large areas in Jacobabad, including parts of Shahbaz Air Base, are also under water. Shahbaz is one of the most important air bases of Pakistan Air Force. It has fighter and transporter jets along with a huge ammunition depot. In the last decade, Pakistan suffered severe floods in 2007 and 2010 when damage to property was almost $40-$50 billion.

(Photo: India Today)

In 2010, the air base supposedly suffered the worst damage in PAF history when most of the ammunition, including air-to-surface missiles, had come under water.

Recent satellite images indicate that although water released from Guddu Barrage had entered the area, it did not cross the retainer wall constructed by PAF on the northern side of the air base.","Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202009/pak_flood_reuters-647x363.png?EISsNEMGRC6wauOuHeyf11Lzu3Ld6BRF,"['months', 'air', 'pakistan', 'satellite', 'water', 'damage', 'images', 'bridge', 'extent', 'flood', 'india', 'suffered']", ,flood

Cyclone, Weather forecast Highlights: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday said the Severe Cyclonic Storm “Tauktae” over eastcentral Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 13 kmph during past 6 hours.

It lay centred over eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 14.2°N and longitude 72.7°E at 2030 hours IST on Saturday, about 190 km southwest of Panjim-Goa, 550 km south of Mumbai, 780 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 910 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening.

As it would bring very heavy rainfall in that region, cities like Mumbai would not be affected much, the IMD added.

There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 17 over north Konkan, including Mumbai,

the IMD said.

The Maharashtra capital can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, said Shubhani Bhute, senior director (weather) IMD, Mumbai. The storm is currently 250 km south-west of Goa, she added.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated. He also called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, a statement said.","Sun, 16 May 2021 04:02:27 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/TVM-1200.jpeg,"['km', 'eastcentral', 'winds', 'mumbai', 'diu', 'imd', 'cyclonic', 'weather', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'storm', 'highlights', 'severe', 'tauktae', 'gujarat', 'cyclone', 'arabian', 'sea']", ,none

It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

“The frontline volunteers of our disaster management committees (DMCs) continued rescue efforts during heavy rains and helped in saving people and their belongings in low-lying areas.”

Father James Shamaun parish priest of St. Thomas Catholic Church in Wah Cantonment, a military city in Punjab province, shared the devastation in a Facebook Live video recorded on July 25.

47,47,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Unravelling the urban flood - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577689,"Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation.

Every year, natural disasters claim around 90,000 lives and affect more than 150 million around the world. Among these, floods pose the most intense threat to lives and livelihoods, bludgeoning communities large and small, and inundating large swathes of land across borders. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected nearly a third of the global population, or 2 billion people worldwide. Beyond the obvious impact on infrastructure and utilities, flooding is a harbinger of a multitude of long-term effects, including economic losses, loss of means of livelihood, ecological changes, and public health challenges.

Floods are the most damaging natural hazard in Pakistan with 26 major events having ravaged the country since 1950. The 2010 “super flood” alone affected 20 million people, and caused direct and indirect losses worth nearly $10 billion. Since then a major flood event occurred at least once each year, affecting millions more. In the past five years or so, urban flooding has gained a strong foothold in Pakistan, becoming almost synonymous with the monsoon season. It is becoming increasingly evident that current policy, planning, and implementation mechanisms for urban flood management are not effective within the context of climate change.

Emerging Climate Challenges

A growing body of research supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has established close linkages between climate change and disaster risk. Whilst climate change cannot be attributed directly to any one major disaster — for example, the urban flooding in Karachi — it does point to an alteration of the global atmosphere. These alterations, caused by human activities such as deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, and other commercial and industrial practices, coupled with the likelihood of more extreme weather events in the future, are likely to increase the frequency and scale of disasters.

Also read: Early downpour exposes Karachi’s drainage flaws

The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and socio-economic impact. The 2019 CRI ranked Pakistan as the 8th most affected country when it comes to extreme weather events. The report went on to add that “countries like….Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The same report placed India at the 14th spot in terms of impact of extreme weather events.

Between 80-90% of all documented natural disasters in the past decades have, on average, been a result of floods, heat waves, droughts, and storms.

Floods, in particular, are increasing in frequency and intensity, and extreme variations in precipitation are expected to contribute to flooding in areas that have historically remained immune.

A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) evaluated the high risk of floods and droughts during the monsoon season. The report pointed out that over eight million people would be exposed to flood risk in Pakistan this year alone.

High risk areas for floods in South Asia

The South Asian monsoon, characterised by concentrated rainfall between June and September, is the lifeline of the agricultural sector in the region, irrigating as much as 55% of cultivated land. Over the past few years, however, researchers have noticed wide temporal and spatial variations in monsoon rainfall. Erratic monsoon patterns have seen a shift of rainfall not only in geographical terms, but also onset and withdrawal. This has resulted in devastating floods throughout the region, claiming scores of lives.

Last week, at least 40 lives were lost as a result of urban flooding in Karachi. Massive cracks in the city’s administrative and operational infrastructure surfaced with every conceivable flood hazard — from cars being swept away by rainwater to collapsing houses to electrocution and even landsliding — becoming a harsh reality. Whilst this does not undermine incidences of riverine and flash flooding throughout the rest of Pakistan, it does indicate that a new, rapid phenomenon in densely populated areas is taking shape: that of urban flooding.

Urban floods are a consequence of meteorological factors, such as intense precipitation, and human actions, such as land use change, occupation of flood plains, alteration of natural water courses, and inadequate drainage and sanitation infrastructure. As soon as precipitation exceeds the capacity of an urban area’s drainage system which includes sewers, gutters, open channels, natural and manmade pathways to a receiving water body — urban flooding occurs. In the weeks leading up to perhaps what will historically be remembered as Pakistan’s biggest urban flood, it became abundantly clear that existing drainage channels were already operating below capacity. A combination of factors, including informal settlements driven by urbanisation, and poor solid waste management directly contributed to this loss of capacity.

More on this | What causes urban flooding? Hint: It’s not just rain

Stripping away land cover and vegetation in the name of “development” to make way for buildings, roads, and bridges not only alters natural water flow channels; it also greatly diminishes water absorption and storage capacity of the soil. As a result, when precipitation runoff flows rapidly across the surface, in short, intense, high-volume bursts rather than sinking into the soil. Not only does this overload a city’s drainage system, but considerably more rainwater ends up in sewers and directly flows off into water bodies, instead of recharging ground water sources. The obstruction of drainage systems, ditches, and other pathways by solid waste and refuse can block channels, causing the water to back up and spread laterally into commercial and residential areas. Many communities did not know that until they found water coursing through their houses, streets, and commercial buildings. Thus, a confluence of disorganised implementation of urban infrastructure such as bridges and embankments obstructing runoff, reduced drainage channel availability due to backfilling, deposition of sediments and refuse in canals and waterways, and archaic drainage and sanitation infrastructure, contributed to the devastation in Karachi.

Policymaking for urban flood management

A recent study in the United States on flood policy noted severe shortcomings in the ability to project the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. Given high levels of uncertainty, policy-making for flood planning & response may be even more difficult and fraught than it already is. Vulnerability of urban systems increases as population density increases, and the effects are multiplied when flooding damages electrical, transportation, communication and other support systems.

Whilst the direct impact of urban flooding — such as inundation of streets and residences, losses and damages to property and vehicles, and destruction of infrastructure — are easily visible, it is the indirect impact that leaves longer lasting effects. For example, the public health threat as a result of untreated sewage or chemical runoff from industrial areas mixing with water sources; the loss of livelihoods for certain periods of time; and the inability to travel to work. Those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale will have a lower capacity to respond and recover, placing ever greater demands on existing social and community service mechanisms.

Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation. The losses in terms of property, productivity, livelihood, and quality of life demand a socioeconomic approach to flood risk management, one that focuses not just on rescue and relief, but also the rehabilitation of communities to the same or a better state that they were in before disaster struck. Future policies should thus address:

— The challenges posed by climate change

— The major economic, environmental, financial, political and social issues likely to impact urban development and urban flood management

— Ancillary payoffs (such as environmental, economic, or social) of pursuing adaptive strategies

Infrastructure management practices for urban flooding

Flooding is the most hazardous consequence of intense precipitation, and even small increases in precipitation can have inordinately large effects on the drainage system. Research based on actual events and simulations indicates that a “20 per cent increase in precipitation in a single event leads to a 365 per cent increase in flood volume and the number of at-risk buildings increases by 120 per cent”.

Drainage and flood control infrastructure is largely designed based on 25-, 50- or 100-year flood frequencies, and historic trends. However, as is becoming increasingly evident, past history may no longer be a reliable guide to future events, especially in the context of urban flooding. Drainage systems, developed and built over decades, are only as good as the weakest connecting link. Decisions made during the scoping and early design stages, when urban sprawl and population were both limited, can have significant impact on outcomes few years down the road. Changes and modifications made at later stages are not always possible or cost effective, which makes both under-sizing and over-sizing of the infrastructure equally problematic: extensive damage in the first case; and excessive expenditures in the second.

Furthermore, focusing on technical and engineering issues in tackling flooding has become somewhat of a national trend, which discounts the influence of social characteristics and circumstances. This bias can actually encourage development in areas where hazard risk may surpass technological solutions. Similarly, efforts to manage urban floods by focusing on the flow and its transit elsewhere, akin to following the “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” approach, don’t solve the problem but merely shift it — usually to low income areas.

Uncontrolled development of informal settlements

In recent years, Pakistan, like many developing nations has witnessed massive in-migration (movement of people within the country). The 2019 Migration Snapshot published by the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) notes that nearly 13% of the Pakistani population comprises of internal migrants. Internal migration in Pakistan is usually undertaken by low skilled workers who move from the rural districts to urban areas due to marriage, family ties, and economic opportunities. A number of socioeconomic factors are at play here, but what is key is the emergence of new settlements in and around cities. These areas, characterized by population highly concentrated in a (relatively) small area runs well ahead of the planning and construction of infrastructure to cope with it.

It would be remiss not to point out that the deleterious effects of degraded environmental conditions have the most (though not exclusive) impact on low income settlements, including katchi abadis or shanties. Built atop slopes, drainage channels, and waterways subject to flash floods, these dwellings are “put together” with substandard materials in areas with poor or overloaded water and waste disposal systems. Residents of these settlements may fill natural drainage channels with dwellings or waste materials, preventing normal rainwater flow and causing the water to spread out into the residential area. Pathways and (unpaved) streets are usually impervious, affording no means for absorption of precipitation, but rather providing a free passage of precipitation and flood water into homes, buildings, and commercial establishments. As these settlements are not planned or subject to land use restrictions or whatever building codes that may or may not exist, the effects of a severe natural disaster can be greatly magnified.

Conclusion

Climate change will impact future city growth, planning and development. By 2030, at least 61% of the world’s population will be living in cities. In developing nations, cities will become home to nearly four billion residents, or a whopping 80 per cent of the global urban population. Consequently, what was once dispersed rural poverty will now be concentrated in urban informal and squatter settlements. It is not really possible to control or totally eliminate floods, and policy planners and practitioners should concentrate instead on enhancing the resilience of the population to flood risks through a combination of engineering techniques coupled with and social, economic and administrative measures. In so doing, they must work within the framework of Integrated Flood Management so as to meet the larger issues of effectiveness, socioeconomic equity, and long-term positive outcomes. This can be achieved, in part by:

— Integrating land and water management;

— Ensuring a participatory community-level approach;

— Adopting integrated hazard management approaches;

— Adopting a combination of economic, legislative, policy-based, and sociological measures to move from traditional “flood control” towards “flood management”;

— Synchronisation with the national development agenda, including measures such as the Ehsaas programme, the Green Pakistan initiative, setting up effective local governments and other poverty alleviation and social uplifting schemes;

— It must also accommodate integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) practices

The aforementioned steps can be proactively implemented in incremental stages with ad hoc tactical adjustments made as events and situations unfold. The uncertainty inherent in climate change projections means that risk-centred approaches and risk-based analysis (including cost-benefit analysis) are no longer as useful or robust as they have been. The past may no longer be a reliable guide to the future when it comes to urban flood management. The combination of climate change, increasing urbanisation, demands for housing and industrial land (often in the floodplain), economic development and rising expectations cannot be discounted in urban flood management. Rather than focusing on any one of these issues, it will be necessary to combine them — and their many stakeholders — into a comprehensive planning process for increasing adaptation and enhancing community resilience.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/09/5f505e90e296d.jpg,"['management', 'water', 'precipitation', 'flooding', 'unravelling', 'flood', 'urban', 'floods', 'impact', 'drainage', 'areas']", ,flood

1 million people are estimated to be affected in nine districts

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in nine districts

62,764 people are targeted by WFP with food assistance in three districts

Highlights

• On 28 August, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked WFP to provide food assistance to flood-affected people in Sindh Province.

• As of 9 September evening, WFP had distributed food to 669 households in Karachi (out of the total 1,780 targeted in Karachi). Distributions to 7,876 households in rural districts will start on 11 September.

• NDMA has warned of potential new flooding across the country, which could further increase the number of people in immediate need of assistance.

WFP Funding Requirements

• US$ 410,320 are needed to replenish food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations for this emergency response.

Situation Update

• The Sindh Government announced a state of emergency on 25 August, with 20 districts declared calamity-affected.

• On 2 September, at the request of the Sindh PDMA, the Sindh UN Provincial Programme Team launched a rapid needs assessment in the nine hardest-hit districts (including four in Karachi and five rural districts). The results were endorsed by the PDMA on 7 September.

• One million people are affected according to Sindh PDMA estimates; 30 percent of whom are estimated to be in need of food assistance based on the findings of the rapid needs assessment.

• In Karachi, water has receded in most parts of the city. However, the informal settlements of Malir District, located in low-lying areas and without sewage infrastructure, remain flooded.

Only 4 percent of households interviewed in Karachi said they had already received food assistance. Most of these households depend on casual labour, and their coping capacities have already been exhausted by COVID-19.

• In the rural areas assessed, only 1 percent of households had received food assistance, and the vast majority reported their food stocks would run out in less than five days. Agricultural livelihoods have been severely affected, with 93 percent of crop lost, 66 percent of irrigation infrastructure reported to be damaged, and most households reporting significant livestock losses or distress sales.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1535006-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%231%20%2810%20Sep%29.png?itok=GIgAFl8O,"['situation', 'food', 'response', 'pakistan', '2020', 'pdma', 'households', 'assistance', 'need', 'report', 'wfp', 'districts', 'rural', 'karachi', 'flood', 'sindh']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Pakistan floods: Monsoon rains expose blockages in both Karachi’s drains and politics - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistan-floods-karachi-moonsoon-rain-waseem-akhtar-a9666811.html,"C

raftsman Mohammad Zakir, who lives in a low-lying area of Karachi’s Orangi Town, does not recall the authorities ever cleaning out the storm water drain serving his neighbourhood.

Thorani Goth in West District was flooded during the fourth bout of monsoon rain this season from 6-8 August.

During that – and a previous downpour in late July – water came up 4-5ft (1.2-1.5m) inside Mr Zakir’s home, ruining furniture, electrical equipment and important documents.

It also soaked an order of 250 women’s garments he was due to decorate with sequins and beads – his first job in five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’ll put them out to dry to see if there are water stains on them,” said the informal-sector worker.

If the clothes were ruined, he would have to bear half the cost of 250,000 Pakistani rupees (£1,139), he added.

Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation people “are certainly not exaggerating when they say water comes up chest-high into their homes”.

The city has a network of 550 storm water drains which zigzag through the city and flow out into the Arabian Sea, but many are obstructed by illegal construction, waste and sludge.

Mr Akhtar said the city authorities cleaned out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide the funds for the work.

In the mayor’s four-year term, which ends this month, management of Karachi’s services has been hamstrung by disputes between different levels of government.

Meanwhile the city’s infrastructure is struggling to cope with heavy monsoon rains, as seen this year.

Sardar Sarfaraz, Karachi head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said rainfall of as little as 50mm (2 inches) could cause urban flooding in some of Karachi’s low-lying areas, with the most recent downpour easily exceeding that across the city.

Scientists are still figuring out how global warming will affect the Asian monsoon, but in many parts of the world, higher temperatures are fuelling more intense bouts of rainfall.

Mr Sarfaraz noted the trend is for more erratic weather patterns, as predicted by climate scientists.

In Karachi, the August rains killed 22 people, 11 of them by electrocution, after 10 died in July. From 2014 to 2019, the city recorded more than 70 rain-related deaths, with 2018 an exception as it was largely dry.

After the havoc this July – with main roads submerged, sewage spewing from manholes and into homes, and power cuts lasting for hours – Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, tasked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with sorting out the city’s drains.

The NDMA, helped by the military’s engineering wing, said it had cleaned three major drains in just under a week, clearing 42 choke points and removing more than 31,000 tonnes of sludge.

After touring the city, Sindh information minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper there were no floods in the city, despite the intensity of this month’s rain, as prevention policies had been effectively implemented.

But Mr Zakir’s experience does not back up that assertion.

Illegal building

Hot sun after the monsoon rain has provided some respite for Mr Zakir’s family and the 13 million city residents, out of a population of more than 17 million, who live in informal settlements that are prone to flooding.

Mr Zakir blamed illegal construction along the drainage channels, adding that “the government needs to come here and bulldoze” the buildings.

“The storm water drains, some as wide as 200ft, have over the years, due to unauthorised construction, narrowed to just 30 feet – so what do you expect?” said Mr Akhtar, the city’s mayor.

The main responsibility lies both with residents who have encroached on land along the drain, and the provincial government for letting it happen, said the outgoing mayor.

The province of Sindh has taken a larger share of control from the city authority but has not provided the budget owed, which a court ruling ordered it to pay, Mr Akhtar said.

A Sindh government spokesman said it did not owe money to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, to which it had transferred 50bn rupees (£227m) in the last three and a half years.

Solid waste dumped into storm water drains exacerbates the flooding. It is estimated that the mega-city generates 13,000 tonnes of garbage daily.

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board collects 70 per cent of that and takes it to two landfills, but told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it does not know what happens to the rest.

Sewage is also being dumped in storm drains, as little has been invested in rehabilitating the crumbling sewerage system for two decades despite the city’s expansion, officials said.

Longer-term plan?

Zubair Channa, director of the Sindh government-led Solid Waste Emergency and Efficiency Project (SWEEP), funded with $100m (£76.8m) from the World Bank, said encroachment on most of Karachi’s large drains over a long period, coupled with their uneven width, caused disturbances in the flow of water.

Drains feeding into the big water channels are also not well maintained, making the flooding worse, noted the civil engineer.

“What is needed is a comprehensive engineering solution,” he said, rather than “firefighting” each year as the city does now.

In its first year, SWEEP has hired contractors to remove about 10 million cubic ft of sludge from the drains and deposit it in landfill by the end of August, he noted.

With floods causing so much devastation year after year, Mr Akhtar said it was time “to take the firm but unpleasant decision” of pulling down illegal buildings.

Before that is done, people must be provided with an alternative, he added.

“There is enough government land that can be used for both vertical expansion as well as developing satellite towns around Karachi, where these people can be shifted,” he said.

But with Karachi run by three tiers of government dominated by three different political parties, real solutions to its problems are often lost in a war of words.

“We need the judiciary and the army to sit with experts like architects and town planners to resolve the issue,” Mr Akhtar said.

PESHAWAR: At least 16 people, including a woman and two children, were killed and eight others injured due to flash floods caused by torrential rains in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district, a disaster management official said on Friday.

Eight people died in Upper Kohistan district, six in Swat and two in Shangla district of the province due to the floods on Thursday night, an official of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said, adding that 40 houses were damaged in these areas.

The flood water inundated houses in Shahgram and Teerat area of Swat district from where six deaths and injuries to eight people were reported.

PDMA Director General Pervez Khan and Secretary of relief rushed to the affected areas to oversee rescue activities.

The rescue activities are underway in full swing in the affected areas and people are being shifted to safer places, Khan said.

Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet (three metres) from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The floodwater broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Reuters news agency by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses, and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37m in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners – the UN Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change – as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told Reuters.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with the aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

Melting glaciers

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the UN Adaptation Fund from 2011 to 2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

‘People will suffer’

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier in a helicopter recently, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier, and there was talk of an [automated] early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system is extremely urgent, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding, and people will suffer.”","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f710960554f9487aad8f63e38374bcf2_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['warning', 'millions', 'ice', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'fears', 'hassanabad', 'walls', 'raise', 'glaciers', 'outburst', 'flood', 'shishper', 'melting', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Pakistani villages located at the bank of River Sutlej have been submerged after India released water without notifying the authorities in Pakistan, displacing hundreds of people while destroying several houses and standing crops, said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday.

Over 1,200 persons were rescued from the flood-affected villages by a local administration while another 1,613 persons have been shifted to safer places, according to the NDMA.

Rescue teams along with Pakistan army personnel are taking part in the rescue operations, a local administrative official in Lahore told Xinhua, adding that more than 80 relief camps have been set up for flood affectees so far.

He said water level in the river is continuously rising, and the concerned authorities are making all-out efforts to ensure timely evacuation of people from the affected villages.

A spokesperson of the NDMA Mukhtar Ahmed told local media that three of the villages located near the bed of the river went completely underwater due to flooding, and the people from these most-affected villages have already been evacuated to safer places.

Earlier on Monday, the NDMA had warned of a flood-like situation in the areas alongside the river after India released up to 200,000 million cusecs of excessive water in the River Sutlej that flows through Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

""The flood alert was issued in order to avoid the loss of lives and properties as India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,"" Director General of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Khurram Shahzad said.

According to a water-distribution agreement between the two neighboring countries, India is bound to pre-schedule its spillway openings, but the incumbent Indian government has canceled all the meetings of Indus Water Commission, which was formed to resolve disputes over water sharing with Pakistan.

Pakistani agricultural experts believe that India is trying to destroy an agro-based economy of the country by taking such measures and using water as an instrument of war, trying to convert agricultural land of Pakistan into deserts through inundation and trickling of water.

The development came when relations between Pakistan and India have been strained after the latter decided to revoke the special status of the Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.

In its response, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade ties with India.","Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['displaces', 'hundreds', 'houses', 'local', 'pakistan', 'water', 'villages', 'notification', 'flood', 'xinhua', 'india', 'ndma', 'trying', 'river', 'told', 'releases']", ,flood

“The actual number has not been confirmed yet,” but 100 to 150 people were feared dead, Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand state where the incident occurred, told Reuters.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down a river valley.

“It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,” Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of Raini village, told Reuters by phone. “I felt that even we would be swept away.”

Locals fear that people working at a nearby hydro-power project had been swept away, as well as villagers roaming near the river looking for firewood or grazing their cattle, Rana said. “We have no idea how many people are missing.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was closely monitoring the situation.

“India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,” he said on Twitter after speaking with the state chief minister.

India’s air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, the federal government said, while Home Minister Amit Shah said disaster-response teams were being airlifted in to help with relief and rescue.

“All the concerned officers are working on a war footing,” Shah said on Twitter, referring to Uttarakhand by its nickname, the Hindi term for “land of the gods” — due to the numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres located across the state.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous, also put its riverside areas on high alert.

Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the dam as well as whatever else was in its path.

Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.

“The flow of the Alaknanda River beyond Nandprayag [stretch] has become normal,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Twitter.

“The water level of the river is now one metre above normal but the flow is decreasing.”

Meanwhile, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, also expressed sorrow over the ""loss of precious lives due to flash floods caused by glacier break-off in Uttarakhand"".

Uttarakhand in the Himalayas is prone to flash floods and landslides. In June 2013, record rainfall caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the “Himalayan tsunami” by the media due to the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi’s party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

“When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2021/02/601fbde54f47e.png,"['100', 'minister', 'chief', 'uttarakhand', 'glacier', 'feared', 'water', 'away', 'state', 'himalayan', 'floods', 'india', 'bursts', 'dam', 'river', 'twitter', 'dead']", ,flood

It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.

Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.

This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.

The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.

Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.

The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.

Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in the 9 districts covered by the joint rapid needs assessment

11,000 households (71,500 people) planned to be assisted by WFP

8,506 households (77 percent of households targeted) assisted by WFP as of 21 September

Highlights

The scale of damage and humanitarian needs caused by the floods have been significantly underreported in local and international media.

WFP started emergency food distributions on 8 September with its partners ACTED and HANDS.

Distributions in Malir (Karachi) and Umerkot districts have been completed. Distributions in Mirpur Khas and Sanghar are expected to be completed by 25 September.

WFP Funding Requirements

US$500,000 is needed to cover the costs of this emergency response and replenish the food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations.

Situation Update

The situation in rural areas is extremely worrying, both in terms of immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term impacts on livelihoods, food security and nutrition. While rains have stopped, many areas remain flooded and stagnant water is posing major health, nutrition and shelter issues.

Thousands of families displaced by the floods are still living by the side of the road, with little chance of returning home for at least another month and no employment opportunities in view given large-scale crop and livestock losses.

On 12 September, Sindh Chief Minister requested additional humanitarian assistance from the UN.

On 17-18 September, the UN Resident Coordinator and WFP Country Director visited a WFP food distribution and a UNICEF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) distribution in Mirpur Khas district. They met with the Mirpur Khas Commissioner, the Sindh Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the Sindh Chief Secretary, who expressed appreciation for WFP’s fast response.

At the request of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), UN and NGO partners are preparing to carry out a multisectoral needs assessment to inform mediumterm recovery needs, covering the 30 mostaffected districts across the country. This new assessment will complement the rapid joint needs assessment carried out during the first week of September.

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the city’s infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachi’s stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachi’s population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-’60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-’60s Karachi’s sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

Map1

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Photo by Fahim Siddiqui/White Star

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-’90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachi’s development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the women’s college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachi’s most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late ’80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and people’s investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistan’s foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachi’s sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3) — part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majesty’s government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for “capacity building.” Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at “good practices” and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established — a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, children’s play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadra’s assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Council’s annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

You need to be unbearably audacious to flaunt hypocrisy in the manner most members of the National Assembly have thoughtlessly employed for “expressing solidarity” with besieged and relentlessly bombed people of Palestine.

They took more than 90 minutes to assemble for the first sitting of another session of the National Assembly Monday evening. At the outset of it, Asad Qaisar, the Speaker, announced the decision of devoting the entire sitting to “the cause of Palestine only” and invited Shehbaz Sharif, the Opposition Leader, to initiate a yawn-inducing round of trivial speechmaking.

After spending many months in jail, the PML-N leader had reached Islamabad to attend the assembly session. He might not have been here, if the government had not stopped him from flying to London, with the permission of Lahore High Court.

Seriously suspending my cynical approach to “our representatives,” I tried hard to carefully listen to each word of his speech. Except narrating facts, which even a school going kid must know regarding the history of Palestine, he never cared to furnish anything fresh and attention-worthy.

Repeatedly, he kept urging the government to “lead from the front” in furnishing solace to constantly bombed Palestinians. How to go about it and with what strategy? He had no answer to it.

Still, he did admit that “emotional speeches” wouldn’t deliver any protection to abandoned people of Palestine. But forcefully suggested that the coming Friday should be observed as “Al Quds” day. The day of solidarity should end with a visit to UN Offices in Islamabad to handover a resolution in support of the people of Palestine, unanimously prepared by all the political parties of Pakistan. The expected resolution should also ask the United Nations Security Council to instantly move to stop Israel from vicious and barbaric attacks on Palestinian territory.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the foreign minister, on the other hand, consumed more time to reveal that Prime Minister Imran Khan had already been working around the clock to develop a workable strategy to check Israel with constant contacts with the rest of Islamic countries. Thanks to his persistence, Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was finally motivated to hold a series of SOS meetings.

While profusely welcoming the activist role of the OIC, Shah Mahmood Qureshi also recalled with a hurt heart that the US had vetoed against a UNSC resolution, which attempted to condemn Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians but failed to explain how to convince the Biden administration to behave otherwise.

He seemed quite proud in claiming that foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s concern with grateful words. Doing this, he conveniently forgot that Israel’s recent barrages of bombs were primarily targeting Gaza-confined Palestinians and so far the people living in the West Bank had been spared. And Hamas and not the Palestinian Authority is in complete control of Gaza.

Similarly, he sounded laughably naïve while stressing that after failing in getting some relief from the UN Security Council, the OIC should now force the UN to hold an urgent General Assembly sitting. To ensure the same, he would leave for Turkey Monday night and from there intends to fly on to New York, hopefully along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Sudan, to intensify lobbying for an emergency session of the UN General Assembly on Palestine.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi is not a novice to foreign affairs; he had been our foreign minister during the Gillani-led PPP government as well. He surely needs no tutor to discover that UN General Assembly has no mandate to actively engage in atrocity-stopping actions. That remains the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council.

Our Foreign Minister also felt excited about the series of protest marches in metropolitan cities like London, Paris and Berlin etc. Praising these marches, he indeed appeared completely oblivious to embarrassing indifference that many metropolitan cities of the Muslim countries were displaying these days regarding the ceaseless atrocities in Gaza.

In the end, however, he had to helplessly admit that United States of America remained the one and only country, relishing leverage vis-à-vis Israel. Keeping this in mind, he also had focused on recent events in Palestine during his telephone conversation with the US Secretary of State Sunday evening.

Referring to the same conversation, he suddenly switched to criticize the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, and began raising serious questions regarding his conduct during a critical phase of the Afghan issue, when the US and the NATO forces had already announced the intent of leaving Afghanistan by September 11, 2001.

His comments regarding Afghanistan made me suspect that the ‘end game’ in that war torn country was not moving according to the plan Pakistan might have imagined. Things rather appear heading to fear-inducing explosion in our immediate neighborhood. Yet, our foreign minister kept feeling too proud in suggesting as if Pakistan was set to play a leading role to protect Palestine from Israel’s atrocities.

Delivering bombastic speeches, our worthy members should also have done sincere soul searching. Around two years ago on August 5, 2019, Modi government of India had unilaterally revoked the ‘special status of the Occupied Kashmir. After announcing the said decision, it enforced a ruthless lockdown on the Valley of Kashmir. Its brute clamp down clearly emulated tactics, Zionists had been employing to encroach into Palestinian territories since 1948.

“Our representatives,” crowding the National Assembly miserably failed to imagine an effective strategy to ensure pushing back of the Indian onslaught on occupied Kashmir. With the start of 2021, we rather started to get a flood of credible-sounding stories, strongly suggesting that India and Pakistan were now seeking peace with each other through ‘backdoor negotiations.”

The nonstop flood of such stories never motivated our “supreme to all” pretending parliamentarians to force the Imran government and its foreign minister to stand up in the National Assembly or the Senate to explain even cursory details related to reported “negotiations.” While most of them keep boasting that the issue of Kashmir remains the core existential question for Pakistan. They remained equally clueless regarding the recent development in Afghanistan. Yet the same parliamentarians hardly felt any shame in flaunting “deep concerns” for the people of Palestine and boastfully pretending as if they have finally found a workable strategy to furnish solace to their wounds.","Mon, 17 May 2021 21:39:47 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-05-18/delivering-bombastic-speeches-1621287582-6148.jpg,"['assembly', 'minister', 'bombastic', 'strategy', 'pakistan', 'speeches', 'national', 'regarding', 'foreign', 'kashmir', 'palestinian', 'delivering', 'palestine']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Indus Water Commission (PCIW) will raise the issue of delaying flood data by India during the annual meeting of the commission on March 23-24.

The meeting is taking place after a hiatus of nearly three years, with the last being held in Lahore in August 2018.

Last year's meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.

As per the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.



Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehr Ali said the Pakistani delegation will leave for New Delhi on March 22 where the meeting would take place.

What will be discussed in the meeting?

Shah will lead the Pakistani delegation whereas the Indian side will be headed by PK Saxena.

“Controversial projects of 1000 MW Pakkal Dal and 48 MW Lower Kalnai will be discussed during the two-day meeting. Pakistan has already raised objections on the design of these projects,” he said.

The top official of the Indus Water Commission said two more water projects -Darbuk and Nemochaling – will also come under discussion, adding that the issue of delaying flood data will also be raised with New Delhi.

“India has been violating the Indus Basin Agreement in providing flood data for 2 years. Pakistan wants daily flood data from July 1 to October 10,” Mehar noted.

The Pakistani delegation will include representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, WAPDA, Meteorology, Attorney General's Office, and Irrigation Department.","Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2021-03-16/l_805235_014603_updates.jpg,"['projects', 'delaying', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'water', 'indus', 'raise', 'commission', 'flood', 'delegation', 'india', 'data', 'issue', 'pakistani']", ,flood
62,62,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag - Reuters",https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN23F03B,"ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

MELTING GLACIERS

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

DANGER AHEAD

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system can’t come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer”.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['warning', 'cut', 'surges', 'climate', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'change', 'village', 'efforts', 'outburst', 'flood', 'drag', 'walls', 'early', 'melt', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood
63,63,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Why is Karachi drowning and could we have prevented it? - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/09/07/why-is-karachi-drowning-and-could-we-have-prevented-it-,"Anmol Irfan is a writer, feminist, and founder of Perspective Magazine. Here she shares her views on how the largest city in Pakistan should not have ignored warnings about the climate crisis.

Karachi is drowning.

Over the last week, torrential rains have ravaged Pakistan’s cosmopolitan hub. Breaking records of over 90 years, the city has been flooded as its systems and infrastructure find themselves unable to cope with the unprecedented amount of rainfall.

But how much does this have to do with climate change?

The city’s inability to deal with rain isn’t exactly a revelation - previous years have seen monsoon seasons cause substantial damage. But this year, it’s a crisis like never before. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has reported 63 deaths in rain related incidents already, while entire residential areas and markets have been submerged, causing millions of rupees worth of damage to houses and businesses.

The onslaught of such a disaster has come as a shock to locals who wonder why officials didn’t put preventative measures in place, with full knowledge that the rainy season was coming.

“It’s not something that’s happened recently. This has been 30-40 years in the making,” explains Vice Chairman of the Lahore Development Authority, SM Imran. The neglect of Karachi’s development is cited as the main reason behind the city’s current crisis. Despite the city’s importance to Pakistan’s economy and development, sustainable growth of the city has never been a political priority, he adds.

As roads collapse and sewage systems overflow, questions are arising as to where years worth of taxpayers money has gone. Residents of various areas in the city are experiencing three-day long power shortages and stagnant water blocking the streets.

Did Karachi ignore the warnings?

Karachi’s situation is a glaring example of what can happen when climate change warnings and sustainable growth are neglected - in favour of political optics and superficial development.

In a country that has faced significant damage in the past due to droughts, this influx of rain could have been a game changer. But instead, a lack of preparation has turned what should have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster.

To make matters worse, the drainage system which collapsed in DHA, supposedly the posh area of the city, was built in 2007 and residents were charged for it.

A lack of preparation has turned what could have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster

Moving forward, it is imperative we understand exactly where the problem lies. The lost lives and flooding are horrific enough - but the damage they have caused may not be fixed for years to come.

Pakistan’s already debt-ridden economy will now have to face the harrowing consequences of redoing entire sewage systems, rehabilitating thousands of people and businesses and possibly risk losing their main port city.

How will the city recover?

This year’s disaster has proven that there is no time to be lost. Priorities need to be set in order for changes to be made. Instead of focusing on other aspects of infrastructure that contribute very little to the city’s growth, Imran believes the focus now needs to be on water conservation and treatment.

For Imran, Israel is a good example we can learn from. Its Ashkelon facility provided for 70 per cent of the country’s water demands through a process of seawater desalination. A city that craved rainfall is now richer in water resources. This just shows that we can harness the effects of climate change in our favour, if we know how to. What’s needed now is a complete overhaul of what we thought our future would be, explains Imran.

Karachi has been labelled “resilient” many times over the years. But as the city descends into worse conditions, its resilience is no longer a compliment but an excuse. No longer can this idea of resilience be used to ignore its exacerbating problems.

One possible solution is for local governments to do more than just pass bills. Many now believe that programmes should be put in place to teach employees how best to reuse water and treat rubbish.

Currently though, political solutions seem too little too late, and citizens are stepping up to rehabilitate the city themselves.

Citizens are coming to the rescue

Among the many initiatives taken over by relief workers and organisations, is Saturday Welfare Group (SWG). What started as a group of friends wanting to provide rehabilitation to marginalised communities in Pakistan has grown into a powerful initiative that steps up in times of crisis.

“Everyone is equal who is contributing to or working for welfare,” is their motto.

A resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) protests against failure to fix drainage pipes. AFP

It's a motto that couldn’t be more fitting with the situation Karachi now finds itself in. Both within the country and among the Pakistani diaspora, fundraising is at an all-time high. It’s a testament to the idea that there are people who want change, and are ready to work for it - they just need an opportunity. Development in Karachi should be carried out on a much more equal scale, and perhaps those truly working for change will finally get the attention they deserve.

Recovery will be a long road, and hopefully when political action begins to reflect the needs of the hour, it will be up to residents to play their role as well. Pollution and littering is a major problem the city struggles with. As trash from the streets finds its way into drainage pipes, it blocks the very waterways that are meant to save the city from such disasters. Conservation initiatives need to be better understood.

This is a responsibility that lies with the educated strata of society, who have the power and resources to implement these initiatives and make them accessible to the masses. Feigning ignorance over harmful habits and actions is no longer a valid excuse.","Mon, 07 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/93/76/44/1000x563_cmsv2_7fe7a6a1-6ce3-5379-ad73-e8d45fe149d9-4937644.jpg,"['development', 'political', 'city', 'climate', 'change', 'water', 'damage', 'worth', 'drowning', 'karachi', 'prevented', 'citys']", ,flood

Residents complained of sewage on the streets and in water tanks. Power was out in several areas for days amid sweltering heat and humidity. The outage also caused disruptions in cellphone service, interrupting emergency management and leaving citizens out of touch with loved ones.

In some cases, the electricity cables broke, causing fears of electrocution.

""Few residents located in these zones have also requested us not to power up supply since it may be a safety hazard for them,"" tweeted Karachi's electricity provider, K-Electric.

Meanwhile, authorities said another weather system was hovering over Sindh province, increasing the likelihood of more rains in the coming days.

The large metropolis, considered to be Pakistan's economic lifeline, has faced problems of overcrowding and unplanned development since the country's independence in 1947.

""[A] very large majority of its population lives in informal settlements in poorly designed housing with inadequate services,"" according to a 2017 working paper, titled, ""Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi.""

Much of the city's planning woes have been exacerbated over the decades due to corruption coupled with political rivalries among local, provincial and federal governments.

Parts of Karachi are owned by the federal government. In addition, local and provincial governments have set up parallel structures of service delivery, like trash pickup, diluting resources.

""We need to clearly understand who is responsible for what. Until the municipal functions are divided between the federal and provincial governments, problems of delivery will remain,"" Murtaza Wahab, the spokesman for Sindh government, told local news channel Geo News.

According to the working paper, bad governance and development shortcomings in Karachi ""have created vulnerabilities at different scales that are likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change-related weather events taking place within the city and elsewhere in the country.""

Development professional Zaigham Khan said overcrowding and slum developments were a result of the city absorbing the social and economic problems of the entire country.

""If there is terrorism in FATA (erstwhile tribal area), locals move to Karachi. When there is war in Afghanistan, the most refugees arrive in Karachi. When there are floods in the country, the affected go to Karachi. If there is insurgency in Balochistan, locals escape to Karachi. If there are no jobs in southern Punjab, the preferred refuge is Karachi,"" he said.

The directives were issued by the prime minister while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Floods here on Monday, according to an announcement by the PM Office.

Besides the NDMA chief, the meeting was attended by federal Minister for Information Shibli Faraz, Communications Minister Murad Saeed, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda, the director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the chairmen of the National Highways Authority and Federal Flood Commission (FFC).

The provincial chief secretaries also participated in the meeting through a video link. The chief secretaries informed the prime minister about the damages caused by recent floods and rains in their respective provinces.

The NDMA chairman briefed the prime minister on the situation in various parts of the country after the recent spells of monsoon and the damages caused by these heavy rains. He also apprised the prime minister about the relief activities being carried out by the NDMA in different parts of the country affected due to rains.

Meeting reviews relief activities being carried out in rain-affected areas

The officials of the PMD and Flood Commission informed the prime minister that most parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, had received more rains than the past. The meeting participants were informed that almost all the rivers were having medium flow of water.

The prime minister was told that there were “strong chances” that the ongoing monsoon season would come to an end by the middle of this month and the chances of more flood-like situation were very low.

The meeting’s participants were also apprised about the relief operation being carried out by the country’s armed forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister stressed the need for more coordination among all the federal and provincial departments concerned to face the challenge they were facing due to climate changes.

PM Khan was also informed that all dams in the country were full of water and the situation of water availability was satisfactory.

The country’s major reservoirs had already reached their full capacity last month following the countrywide rainfalls and both Tarbela and Mangla dams had attained their maximum conservation levels.

The FFC attributes the filling of dams to effective management of inflows and outflows of the reservoirs, especially by Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).

It has advised the dams operating authorities, including the Flood Monitoring Cell of Mangla, Irsa (Indus River System Authority) and the PMD, to take utmost care and exercise extra vigilance of the reservoirs’ operation.

The combined live storage of major reservoirs — Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — was reported at 13.425 million acre feet (MAF) on Aug 28, which accounted for 98.61 per cent of the 13.614 MAF maximum storage capacity, a record water availability during last 10 years.

According to Wapda, water available in Tarbela and Mangla dams was 2.173 MAF more when compared to last 10 years’ average. The average water availability in the two dams during the last 10 years on the day was recorded at 11.163 MAF.

This better hydrological situation will aptly fulfil the requirement of water for the country’s agriculture in the days to come. More water availability in the reservoirs will also result in more hydel generation in the coming days.

The heavy rainfall spell occurred over the past few days in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi, had caused severe urban flooding in the provincial capital.

The prime minister had visited Karachi last week and in the presence of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a package of Rs1.1 trillion at Governor House to resolve Karachi’s lingering and chronic issues, including provision of clean drinking water, cleaning of drains and sewage and solid waste disposal within three years.

Later, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stated that the Sindh government would contribute Rs800 billion to the Rs1.1tr package for Karachi, saying that they “welcome the Rs300 billion funding from the federal government for Karachi’s infrastructure development”.

On Sunday, however, federal Minister for Planning and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of PTI told a press conference that the federal government would bear 62 per cent of the total amount of Rs1,100 billion announced by the prime minister.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country.

Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged.

The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

""River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,"" reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history.

TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding.

The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

""Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,"" it said.

""Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,"" it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the ""rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September"".

Monsoon rains hit the sub-continent every year in the summer, bringing heavy downpour and floods that displace hundreds and thousands of people.","Wed, 02 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/8/28/w600X390/Pakistan_rains-_AP_.jpg,"['showed', 'rains', 'rivers', 'level', 'pakistan', 'water', '13', 'killed', 'toll', '176', 'office', 'flood', 'rises', 'ndma', 'heavy', 'lash', 'death', 'reported']", ,flood

The number of those affected is expected to rise to 100,000.

Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Al Zaabi, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied by Dr. Salim Ali Al Dhanhani, UAE Consul-General in Karachi, visited Sindh province, where they met with Syed Murad Ali Shah, Chief Minister of Sindh province.

During the visit, Al Zaabi expressed to Shah his most sincere condolences for the flood victims.

Following his meetings with local officials, Al Zaabi visited some of the areas affected by flooding and participated with Shah in distributing Phase-1 of an urgent aid campaign comprising of medicines, tents, blankets and food. The first day of aid distribution benefitted more than 12,000 people, with the campaign to continue for an entire month.

In his speech delivered in the presence of Sindh Province Governor Imran Ismail during the distribution of urgent relief aid, Al Zaabi said that the humanitarian support provided to the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at the direction of the UAE’s leadership is part of the campaign’s efforts to rescue people and improve their living conditions.

Al Zaabi and Ismail also discussed ways of enhancing their ties in areas of mutual concern for both countries, most notably economic. Al Zaabi then briefed Ismail about available opportunities and the investment environment in the UAE, stressing that there are many opportunities for exchanging visits and organising commercial events, conferences and workshops.

During the meeting, Al Zaabi praised the deep overall relations between the UAE and Pakistan, whose foundations were established by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

The chief minister of Sindh praised the bilateral ties between the two countries and stressed the importance of reinforcing them in all economic, commercial and development aid areas.

The £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to many who have lost their homes. It comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks including hygiene kits and tarpaulins to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Lord Ahmad said:

Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands with Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.

The UK aid announced today will ensure life-saving clean water, sanitation and shelter gets to those who need it most. The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be - and the dangers of climate change.

During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.

British High Commissioner Christian Turner CMG said:

Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from COVID-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year. He discussed with the Government of Pakistan how the UK can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet the Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations, and trade ties, and he also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in South Punjab. The UK has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly 8 million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The Minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the COVID-19 surveillance centre. He met the Coordinator National Emergency Operations Centre Dr Rana Safdar who briefed the Minister on Pakistan’s response to COVID-19. Lastly, he was scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

Notes to editors:

In Sindh, according to data from the Meteorological Department, rainfall in August was the highest since recordkeeping began 89 years ago. In Karachi, rainwaters devastated factory stock and caused mass power outages. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected” and local disaster management teams together with NGOs, supported by the military, have been rescuing stranded people, providing medical aid, and food rations. Initial assessments by District authorities suggest that more than 2.5m people have been affected across the worst-hit districts of Badin, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal and Sanghar. In all, monsoon rains have resulted in the death of over 230 people and damaged over 2,600 houses across Pakistan, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The UK has committed at least £11.6 billion in International Climate Finance over the next five years, and will invest £13 million in Pakistan this year on tackling climate change. This will include supporting local communities adapt to climate change and improve resilience through emergency disaster planning and helping to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.

71,71,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Minar-i-Pakistan lawns flooded with water - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594825,"White Star

LAHORE: The government on Tuesday flooded the Minar-i-Pakistan lawns, the venue of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)’s Dec 13 public meeting, which the opposition termed a ‘failed effort’ to sabotage its power show.

In a related move, the Buzdar administration also rushed to enforce ‘smart lockdown’ in 45 areas of Lahore, including those close to the rally’s venue. The opposition also smells a rat in this move, saying the PTI government is taking every step to stop the opposition from holding the rally here but it will fail.

The government is also taking other measures — registering cases against those taking part in the PDM corner meetings and rallies and warning the caterers to extend their services to the PDM for its rallies — ahead of its (PDM) Dec 13 power show.

The government has not yet given permission to the PDM to hold a rally at Minar-i-Pakistan citing Covid-19 measures.

Ahead of PDM’s Multan rally on Nov 30, the government had adopted similar tactics but the opposition had held the rally on the road.

Learning about the government’s tactics, the PML-N leaders rushed to Minar-i-Pakistan and shut hosepipes.

“The PTI government released water at Minar-i-Pakistan in the early hours of Tuesday. When we learnt about it we rushed there and stopped further watering (by the administration),” PML-N lawmaker from Mohni Road Bilal Yasin told reporters at the venue.

He said Imran Khan had got so upset over Maryam Nawaz’s rallies in the city on Monday that an order was placed to flood the Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday.

“I ask Imran Khan to at least respect his office of the prime minister,” he said.

Commenting upon release of water at PDM’s rally venue, Maryam Nawaz said in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”

Special Assistant to CM Punjab for Information Firdous Ashiq Awan clarified that only three to four kanals of Minar-e-Pakistan were watered.

“The way life of plants is connected with water, similarly Rajkumari (Maryam)’s life is connected with lies,” she said in a tweet.

During the last three days the Lahore police registered over 20 FIRs booking over 2,000 PML-N workers and leaders for committing Covid-19 SOPs violation and road block.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb, Talal Chaudhry, MNA Malik Riaz and MNA Shizra Mansab are among the PML-N leaders booked.

Maryam Nawaz told reporters at Jati Umra that the FIRs had been registered against over 3,000 PML-N workers which showed how much unnerved the government had been.

The PML-N also held a convention here to mobilise workers for the Dec 13 rally.

Speaking on the occasion, Khwaja Asif said 130 MNAs of the opposition would resign and they could not be stopped from doing so.

“It is a sin to sit in the assemblies which cannot stop corruption and price hike,” he said and added the PTI had realised that these assemblies could not run any more.

Talking to reporters Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Fascist and incompetent Imran Khan is obsessed with persecuting the PML-N leadership, especially Shehbaz Sharif, while the entire nation suffers at the hands of his disastrous rule.”

She said the level of this selected prime minister was that he was threatening the vendors of chairs and tents with FIRs.

Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told Dawn that the government was taking legal action against the PDM for violating Covid-19 SOPs. “We cannot allow the opposition to violate the law,” she said and added if caterers or others provided services to the opposition for holding an assembly of more than 300 people they would also be booked under the law.

72,72,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"In Pakistan, meltwater from glaciers is causing devastating flash floods, and the dwindling of ice-shields affects the entire nation - D+C Development and Cooperation",https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pakistan-meltwater-glaciers-causing-devastating-flash-floods-and-dwindling-ice-shields,"Flash floods are becoming more common in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Local communities are most at risk – but glacier melt also affects people who live far away from the mountains.

More than a century ago, a catastrophe struck Barikan Kot. This mountain village was flooded by a sudden outburst of water from the Hinarchi glacier. The reason was the bursting of an ice wall which had held back a lake of meltwater that had formed on the glacier. About 100 families lost their homes and livelihoods as rocks, earth and debris were swept over the village and its orchards and fertile land.

In the past, this kind of flash flood occurred rarely. That has changed. The Bagrote valley in the Karakoram mountain range in northern Pakistan now suffers several of them every year. Global warming is affecting glaciers all over the world, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya is no exception. Especially in the summer months, melting ice leads to new glacial lakes which, in turn, can cause flash floods.

Aisha Khan of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC) – a private organisation working on climate change – warns that glacial lake-outburst floods are becoming ever more likely. “The impacts are catastrophic,” she points out. In recent years, several dozens of people have been killed, and many more families have lost their livelihoods. The local communities tend to be disadvantaged and poor. According to Aisha Khan, the challenge is to tell them in simple language why the environment is changing and what they can do to adapt.

The civil-society activist insists that women in particular must be prepared to respond appropriately. They have a crucial role to play in evacuation, first aid and rescue and relief operations, Aisha Khan says. She wants all risk-management measures to reflect both the social conditions in the village and the scientific insights.

Syed Zahid Hussain Shah agrees that the risks are increasing and must be controlled. He was the field manager of a project run by the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) that served this purpose from 2011 to 2016. He reports that the Hinarchi glacier is only 16 kilometres long today. It was about 12 % longer 30 years ago, and its ice-shield was higher too.

Pakistan has more than 7,000 glaciers. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 36 are dangerous. Some 7 million people are exposed to the risk of glacial lake-outburst floods, which typically occur in July and August, the warmest months.

The project Zahid worked for took several risk-mitigating initiatives in Bagrote valley. A bridge and protective walls were built. Moreover, streams were excavated and made deeper, so they can carry more water. The project set up four digitised weather stations that automatically relay information pertaining to possible glacial lake outbursts. Thanks to them, it has become possible to warn local communities early on.

The weather stations have helped to save many lives. Hussain Ali, who lives in a mountain village, appreciates them: “Early warning allows people to shift to safer places.” Nonetheless, he says that flash floods have killed more than 20 people in his area in recent years. Moreover, such extreme weather events have killed livestock and destroyed orchards and fields. Several dozen households were therefore forced to move from the mountain villages down into the valley, where it is easier, but nonetheless still quite difficult to eke out a living for people who have lost all assets.

The government of Pakistan and UNDP are now running a follow-up project in the region. It is called the “Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II)” project. GLOF stands for glacial lake-outburst flood. The budget for the years 2017 to 2021 is $ 37 million. The project will cover 15 districts and benefit approximately 29 million people.

The mountain regions of Pakistan’s neighbouring countries Afghanistan, India and China face the same kind of risk for the same reasons. Irfan Tariq, a former director general of Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change, points out that “the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range is a very sensitive ecological system”. It is very difficult to control or limit the impacts of climate change on glaciers, he says, so Pakistan’s government is closely monitoring the glaciers.



The big picture

The melting of the glaciers has impacts far beyond the mountain ranges. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas feed Asia’s most important rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtse. Hundreds of millions of people depend on these waters. Indeed, Asian civilisations have benefited from the glaciers stabilising water supply throughout the seasons for millennia (see Sheila Mysorekar in the Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/09). As the glaciers dwindle, human-built infrastructure will have to serve the functions the glaciers performed naturally in the past.

In this context, dams matter very much. Related infrastructure is vulnerable to glacial lake-outburst floods however. Should a major glacial lake outburst cause a veritable mountain tsunami, the damage may be serious. Syed Mehr Ali Shah from Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources says: “We are very much concerned with the bigger glacial lake-outburst flood events, with regards to the safety of our existing hydraulic infrastructures, which include Tarbela dam.” This dam is more than 140 metres high and serves the purposes of hydropower, irrigation and flood control.

There are several major dams in northern Pakistan, and a new one is currently being built. The wall of Diamer Bhasha dam will be more than 250 metres high. The safety of these structures is very important, says Mehr: “We need to protect them from any kind of dam-break phenomenon.” The officer expresses his confidence in the structures being strong enough to withstand typical glacial lake-outburst floods. He says the Diamer Bhasha reservoir has been designed to bear any dam-break wave that occurs due to such flood. At the same time, spillways ensure that excess water can be channelled away.

But even if dams can be built to withstand flash floods, mega dams cause environmental problems in their own right. Experts warn, moreover, that ever more sophisticated and expensive infrastructure will be needed to adapt societies to global warning. If environmental change spins out of control, adaptation will prove impossible for ever more people.

Ultimately, there is no alternative to mitigating climate change. Pakistan, however, only emits about one ton of carbon per head and year, according to Climate Analytics, an independent monitoring initiative. This comparatively small figure means that other countries which emit far more must assume responsibility and assist countries like Pakistan to build their resilience to climate change.

On Sunday 26th July-2020 weather system brought heavy rains in Karachi. According to data provided by the MET Office, the highest rainfall was recorded in Gulistan-e-Johar, at 66 millimeters (mm), while 55 mm was registered at Old Airport, 55 mm in Pehlwan Goth, 42 mm in Malir, Saddar 43 millimeters (mm), while 26 mm was registered at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Faisal Base, 22mm in Nazimabad, 12mm at PAF Masroor Base, 8.8mm at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, 3.1mm in Landhi, and 1.2mm in Surjani Town.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), city received more than 80 mm rainfall in the third spell of the monsoon and more rain is expected in this season. The heavy to moderate rainfall caused flooding in low lying areas of the city and inundated several key roads, causing problems for the commuters as administration remained helpless and even absent at some locations despite a prior warning from the met officials. Nipa Chowrangi, Gurumandir Chowrangi, Shahrai-e-Faisal, Hassan Square turned into large water pools, as motorcyclists and four-wheelers could be witnessed trapped in water high up to knee-level. According to the initial reports from media and local communities, in many areas there is still stagnant water in streets and houses that overflowed from Nullahs. Those areas included Orangi Town, Khairabad Police Ground area, Ali Garh Market, Disco Morr, Islam Chowk, Bangla Bazar, Neepa Chowrangi, Gulshan-e- Iqbal, and Hyderi in North Nazimabad.

Root causes for the urban flooding in Karachi

In the last fourty years, Karachi city has been facings severe problems due to heavy rains in monsoon season as there are serious issues with the drainage system in Karachi. Despite accepting the brutal reality of the situation, one can not blame any institution but the responsibility lied with the Provincial government, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and District Munciple Corporations (DMCs) and private housing societies to keep clean the drains of Karachi and to drain out all the rainwater from the city.

In the city, as visible to all, width of many rain water drains and Nullah have been reduced, on many construcuton have been done, and most of them are choked with garbage. Information collected through different sources revealed that there are many structures and building have been constructed over the drain of Soldier bazar incuding two banks, gold shops / market, one section of girls high school, Shaheen complex, car parking area of supreme court, district NAB office, KMC market and Aurganzeb market. In Lyari, on Muhammad Shah road, part of Kakri ground, meat market and two masjids are constructed on one of the drain.

The width of the drainage of Manzoor colony on Korangi road has been reduced and near Qayoomabad, Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has constructed bungalows over the same drainage. Drain that starts from Cantt station to Clifton has a 50 feet width but due to construction of Jamat Khana, its width has been reduced to 36 ft, which drain out in Nahar e Khayam. Drain of Madina colony and Singer chowrangi are also in the same condition.

Width of the largest drain Nullah of Oragni town, has been reduced due to encroachment on both sides, that’s why there was a flood in recent days because of heavy rains of monsoon. Width of Mianwali drainage has been reduced by soil pipe instaltions by KDA into it and now very little amount of rain water flows through it.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1529694-HANDS%20RNA%20Urban%20Flooding%20Karachi%20July%202020.png?itok=3ubSxtIF,"['mm', 'city', 'pakistan', 'need', 'assessment', '2020', 'water', 'drain', 'flooding', 'rapid', 'karachi', 'urban', 'market', 'width', 'reduced', 'drainage', 'heavy']", ,flood

The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

78,78,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Death toll from flooding in northwest Pakistan rises to 48 - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/death-toll-from-flooding-in-northwest-pakistan-rises-to-48-1.5091540,"PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN -- Flash floods triggered by week-long monsoon rains that have hit northwestern Pakistan, including the scenic Swat Valley, have brought the death toll to 48, a government spokesman said Thursday.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged or swept away. The army has joined relief and rescue operations across Pakistan, which has been hard hit by rains this summer.

Key roads that have been blocked by large rocks dislodged in mudslides are being cleared, according to Taimur Khan, spokesman for the disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Before Thursday's updated death toll, the province had said 15 died in the floods.

Overall, about 200 people have been killed in rain-related incidents since July, when monsoon rains began lashing many areas in Pakistan. According to government officials, 101 have died in rain-related incidents in southern Sindh province, which includes the country's financial hub of Karachi.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5091566.1599162934!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['rains', 'northwest', 'monsoon', 'spokesman', 'pakistan', 'hit', 'toll', 'province', 'flooding', 'rainrelated', 'died', 'rises', 'incidents', '48', 'death']", ,flood
79,79,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hits', 'infrastructure', 'climate', 'global', 'change', 'flooded', 'water', 'flooding', 'asia', 'floods', 'region', 'flood', 'river', 'hardest', 'risk']", ,flood_and_drought
80,80,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Sydney flood death: another man rescued day before in same place - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/25/sydney-flood-death-another-man-rescued-day-before-in-same-place,"Another driver was rescued from flood waters near Cattai Creek in Sydney’s north-west, a day before a 25-year-old man died when he became trapped in his car at the same location.

A local resident, who did not want to be named to protect his privacy, told the Guardian that he had pulled a young driver from the same location on Tuesday.

He had been moving his farming equipment on Tuesday morning when his father told him that someone appeared to be stuck in flood waters near their property on Cattai Ridge Road, close to Cattai Creek.

When they went to check it out, they saw “a young man trapped inside his car with approximately 300ml of air space left”.

“The car interior was almost full with water.”

The man used his bobcat to tow the car out of the water “with the young man visibly shaken”.

When police arrived, the resident said officers told him that the p-plate driver had been on the phone with them for “at least 45 minutes”.

The 25-year-old Pakistani national who died at the location on Wednesday morning had been on the phone with emergency services for more than 40 minutes before contact was lost.

NSW police Det Insp Chris Laird suggested his hire car’s electrical system may have failed, preventing him from escaping.

“The triple zero operator did continue to maintain contact with the 25-year-old male as he was in the car. However, at 7.04am, it’s believed contact was lost with the male. Police arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to find the car.”

Police said the man was driving a new car – a Toyota Camry – and it was unclear why he could not escape in time.

Laird said the flood gate blocking the road and signage was 10 metres underwater when they found his body.

“The actual gate blocking the road was underwater by 10 metres,” Det Insp Chris Laird said at a press conference on Wednesday.

“Given the unprecedented water levels, the gates could not be seen from the roadway at all. What has happened is a complete tragedy.”

The local resident questioned why the road had not been closed or proper signage installed to prevent other drivers making the same mistake.

“This tragedy could have been avoided had the roads been properly closed or manned. In addition, existing flood gates should be positioned above the one-in-100-year flood line.”

He also said that the very shape of the road, which dips into a valley and has many sudden turns, made it extremely dangerous during floods.

“Part of the problem was that the flood gate that closes the road was submerged under the flood waters and, upon approaching the sharp bend, there was no way for a driver to realise there was water across the road, especially in the dark early hours of the morning.”

He said that there was a barricade installed before the bend, but that when the man died there on Wednesday, the lights were not working.

“There was a part barricade 1km beforehand, but the lights were not working. The flashing lights have since been installed on Wednesday and are now working correctly.”

Police have not provided a response after being reached for comment.

Emergency services across Australia have been urging people never to drive through flood water, after another man was found dead in flood waters in the Gold Coast hinterland.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received more than 11,000 calls for assistance during the floods, including 976 rescues.

It rescued a total of 62 people on Wednesday and a total of 994 since the weather event began. More than 1,600 rescue teams have been activated across the state and more than 1,500 volunteers are currently in the field.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969cd513598d77df59155cdb2b6c46022f4de0df/0_360_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f7dff4f8d12d62c805a3bb2f77edf1b,"['resident', 'place', 'driver', 'sydney', 'car', 'water', 'road', 'young', 'waters', 'flood', 'rescued', 'told', 'man', 'death', 'day']", ,flood
81,81,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Karachi business grapples with the aftermath of flooding - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576950,"KARACHI: As the water level receded, business and industry struggled to restore normalcy around the mega city. Fuel pumps ran dry, telecom towers fell out of service and many ATM machines were either not functioning or empty of cash.

Those few pumps where fuel was available were mobbed by motorbikes and cars as well as scores of people holding jerry cans to carry fuel for generators as the city-wide power outage extended beyond 24 hours.

People thronged to supermarkets and corner shops to replenish food stocks, only to find them shut or flooded, and in some cases, the large sections of the artificial ceilings had fallen in as rain water seeped through the roof.

“Fuel supplies at the terminals in Keamari are ample” an executive from a large oil marketing company told Dawn early on Friday. “But before we can start sending out tankers to replenish supplies at retail outlets, we have to test the fuel that is already there to determine whether or not it has been contaminated with flood water. If it has then the underground storage tank needs to first be emptied out before more fuel is poured into it.”

The process could take days but the executive told Dawn that fuel deliveries from the Keamari terminals to some outlets, where underground tanks were not contaminated, had begun by Friday evening and would continue overnight.

ATMs out of cash, fuel pumps dry, telecom service down

“The situation should substantially normalise by Saturday morning.”

The prolonged power outage also impacted many other services. Aisha Sarwari, spokesperson for Jazz told Dawn that “largely due to infrastructural challenges and power outages in Karachi, network disruptions are hard to contain, especially when the damage is this large-scale.”

She said knock on effects occur following prolonged power outages once the back up generators that power telecom towers start running out of fuel. Nobody from the telecom sector was willing to give an estimate for how long it will take to restore normal service, but most said it could take ‘a few working days’.

Many ATMs around the city were also not functional when people ventured out after the deluge. “ATMs work primarily on communication networks, availability of electricity and whether staff can reach the locations to replenish the cash” says Ali Habib, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at HBL.

He said his bank was able to ensure that “at least 55 per cent of our network across the city was functional” on Friday morning.

The inundation triggered the power outages and brought movement around the city to a halt, which in turn had knock on effects on communication, banking services and fuel supply across the city. It was late into the day on Friday when normalcy began to return to the life of the city as the weekend began.

Meanwhile, the city’s utility took to social media middle of the day on Friday to say that “close to 80 per cent feeders are powered up”.

“Many parts of Defence, Clifton, Bahadurabad continue to remain submerged and our substations are also badly affected in these areas due to waterlogging,” the statement said.

By Friday night, reports of power being restored were being received from a growing number of localities around the city.

By Arif Hasan

Before 27 August, this monsoon season had brought much less rainfall to Karachi than on previous occasions. Yet, streets turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, and over 30 people drowned or were electrocuted.

However, on 27 August we had more rainfall in one day than the past 92 years. Entire settlements were washed out. This has raised two questions. One, despite a lower volume of rainfall, why has Karachi been devastated? And two, was the heavy rainfall of 27 August linked to climate change?

Vast population increase and lack of investment in sewers

Karachi’s storm water drains connect to two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other, 14-20 kilometres apart. Fifty-eight storm water drains (nalas) carry water from their catchment areas to these two rivers. Over 600 smaller drains feed into these nalas.

Before independence in 1947, Karachi’s population was only 450,000; it is now over 15 million. The city’s sewage system mostly consisted of underground earthenware pipes, and sewage biologically treated at the gutter baghicha (gutter garden).

The treated effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. The gutter garden covered just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares).

With Partition and the arrival of around 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand. Formal and informal sectors developed far away from the gutter garden.

The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns some 20 kilometres from Karachi. Sewage treatment plants were planned for but never constructed and their sewage flowed (and still flows) into the sea and/or the nalas.

Informal settlements and informal drains

Due to lack of housing, informal settlements developed along the nalas – into where sewage was discharged. After the mid-1960s formal sectors also began using nalas for disposal. Sludge from sewage clogged the nalas and their tributaries, and during the heavy rains of 1978-79, much of the housing along the nalas was washed away.

After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities and compact it along the nala edges to secure them and to create land for their homes. Nala widths decreased substantially from 20-40 meters to less than ten, and four to five metres in some places.

Deterioration of the nalas

Spatially, Karachi is a large city with only two landfill sites, both over 40 kilometres from the eastern edge of the city. Due to the time and costs to get there, garbage increasingly did not reach the landfill sites. Meanwhile, a recycling industry developed, mostly in the informal sector.

Contractors pay the Karachi Metropolitan Cooperation (KMC) officials not to collect the garbage so that recyclable material can be picked from it. The non-recyclable material is then thrown into the nalas or at various informal dumping sites along the natural drainage systems.

By the mid-1990s, most of the nalas were full of compacted solid waste. And to this day children play cricket and football on some of them.

Building over the nalas

With Karachi’s development plans stalled and space pressures for commercial activity, the local government constructed bazaars over the nalas. Meanwhile, the government of Sindh constructed car parking facilities, offices, and hostels on the nalas, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

As space for disposal of solid waste in the nalas reduced over time, solid waste was and is still used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite housing. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire tractors to compact it.

A major part of Karachi’s most elite settlement – the Defence Society – has been reclaimed from the sea through use of municipal solid waste. In addition, two of Karachi’s major outlets to the sea have been considerably reduced by developing housing for high income groups and a highway. Now, water struggles to flow out into the sea especially during high tides.

Storm water drains

To overcome these problems, in the 1980s and 90s the government of Sindh arranged for old sewage treatment plants to be rehabilitated and new ones constructed along with trunk sewers along the main roads. However, these trunks remain dry because the sewage continues to flow in the storm water drains.

The Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) has long supported communities to develop lane sewers and decided to document the storm water drains. It discovered this problem could only be tackled by cleaning and covering the drains and incrementally building trunks along the nalas. This concept was accepted by the state and is being partially implemented.

Real estate development

But now, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels and water collection depressions.

When it rains, areas south of this region are completely submerged by flood waters. With more developments, the likelihood of flooding will also increase.

Serious institutional issues

The central and provincial governments are controlled by different political parties. They are at constant loggerheads making it impossible for Karachi’s infrastructure problems to be tackled rationally and with sufficient finances. It also makes it impossible to develop a decentralised city government, free from direct provincial control.

Desperate to maintain its vote bank, the federal government brought in the National Disaster Management Authority to de-silt Karachi’s nalas. So far they have removed 30,000 tonnes of solid waste from 42 choking points on three nalas.

However, desilting will once again make the edges of the nalas vulnerable to erosion and destroy an unspecified number of homes – widening just one major nala will require 5,782 houses to be removed.

If the proposal for widening all the nalas to their original width is followed, around 60,000 houses will be affected. So far, a concept for the rehabilitation plan has not been developed even though promised by the government.

Tackling these issues will require a long-term plan for Karachi that is in keeping with the finances available or that can be generated. But this cannot be done without an empowered local government and participation of people living along the nalas.

OPP-RTI’s interaction with those communities found only they knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of various smaller drains that had disappeared. But how to bring these communities into the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

Meanwhile, climate change only adds to the urgency of addressing Karachi’s worsening floods.

Two medical teams provided basic outpatient medical services to more than 4,000 patients over the course of a month.

MSF also distributed relief items including kitchen, hygiene and shelter kits to more than 2,500 families affected by the floods in five union councils of Tehsil Johi. Supporting the local authorities, the international emergency humanitarian organization has worked on restoring the main water supply sources and lines that benefit over 60,000 people in different locations. Water treatment tablets have in the meantime been distributed to over 2,000 families in the area.

“Our activities in the flood-affected areas of Sindh are part of MSF’s commitment to support the Pakistani authorities in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters,” MSF country representative in Pakistan Aymen Abdullah said in a statement. “We have also donated medicines to the local authorities to support them in meeting urgent medical needs in the area.

”More than 350 villages in Sindh’s Dadu district were affected by the floods after heavy rainfall in August 2020. Dadu was one of the worst hit areas in the province and its population of over 240,000 were declared calamity-affected by the provincial government. While the floods damaged the houses, roads were also washed away thereby further limiting people’s access to healthcare facilities.

“The post-flood period is critical as there is a high risk of outbreaks of vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as malaria. The objective of our mobile clinics was to improve people’s access to healthcare by providing them with basic care at their doorstep and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. We treated patients with acute respiratory diseases, skin infections, malaria and other illnesses,” said Anna Cilliers, MSF medical coordinator.

MSF is also supporting Sindh’s department of health in an awareness campaign on dengue fever. The cases of dengue fever in Karachi increased recently, and 12 union councils of East and South Karachi were declared hotspots. MSF is broadcasting awareness messages of prevention and protection from dengue fever through TV channels, cable networks and social media.

84,84,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"Surging glacier creates lake, floods Pakistan valley - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1563034,"Danger of another flood as water continues to flow from the lake in Hunza valley in northern Pakistan.

""A loud rumble echoed and water started trickling down with soil and rocks. Villagers immediately left their homes and fled to safety,"" recounted Manzoor Hussain. Hussain lives in Hassanabad, a village in the Hunza valley high in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in northern Pakistan.

It was siesta time on May 30 when the rumbling started. ""It was not the first time, so people in the village knew what was happening. They were aware of glacial lake outburst floods [GLOFs]. They thought it was a GLOF at the Shishper glacier,"" said Hussain.

In fact, a lake near the Machuhar glacier had burst its banks, causing a flood that submerged farms, the local power plant and part of the Karakoram Highway. Most residents had to sleep in tents afterwards.

Was this a GLOF, where the failure of an unstable natural dam releases meltwater from a glacier? The question is complicated by the Karakoram Anomaly, which describes the advance of glaciers in the region in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in the Himalayas and globally. Expert opinion is divided.

Zaheer Uddin Babar, the focal person for GLOFs in the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, said, ""We can’t interlink the recent incident with a GLOF. Satellite images received from SUPARCO [Pakistan’s Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission] are not indicating any glacial lake. It may be the water spilled out from a lake on the surface of the Machuhar glacier. The water flow was as low as 3,000 cusecs [cubic feet per second] only."" In some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, water flow after a GLOF has been recorded at around 100,000 cusecs.

The villagers thought the May 30 incident was a GLOF because they had experienced one with a water flow of 7,000 cusecs in 2019, when a 1.5 kilometre-wide lake burst its banks. That time, a large section of the Karakoram Highway, a bridge, two power plants, some offices, over 100 houses, the water supply pumphouse and most farms were submerged.

Shishper is a surging, or advancing, glacier. It formed around the beginning of the twentieth century, when what was then the Hassanabad glacier in the north of the Hunza valley split into two. Machuhar is the other glacier formed by this split. Like the overwhelming majority of glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, Machuhar is receding due to the warming caused by climate change. There are over 15,000 glaciers in this tallest and youngest mountain range of the world, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar. The number keeps changing as receding glaciers split into two or more.

The surge of one glacier while its neighbour melts is creating a strange situation. Babar said Shishper has been surging quickly; it moved forward two kilometres in 2018-19, though there has been no indication of a surge since November 2019. But the earlier surge blocked the drainage route of the Machuhar glacier. As a result, a lake has formed at the snout, or mouth, of the Machuhar glacier, and is getting bigger as climate change gathers pace and the rate of melt increases.

Blocking the water flowing down from the Machuhar glacier also means blocking this water supply to the Hunza River, a tributary of the transboundary Indus River.

There are other glacier pairs in the same situation. Zahid Hussain, a field manager in a GLOF project, said, ""Yune glacier in Bagrot valley is also extending and it has already blocked the waters of Gurgo glacier. A huge cavity has opened up on the hillside, at the intersection of the two glaciers. There is a lake forming, which can burst its banks and can create a disaster any time.""

Muhammad Riaz, director-general of Pakistan Meteorological Department, told The Third Pole, ""There are more than 3,000 glacial lakes in the Karakoram ranges and 34-36 of them have been declared to be of high GLOF potential.""

The danger of a surging glacier

""But the glacier surge is a larger menace than GLOF,"" said Sher Mohammad, a glacier specialist at the regional International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, with its headquarters in Kathmandu. ""There are more than 200 glaciers identified in the Karakoram range with surging or surge-like history and these glaciers cover more than 40% (7,700 square kilometres) of the total glacier area in the Karakoram.""

""The exact reason for some glaciers surging in the Karakoram is still unclear,"" he added. ""It has no linear correlation with snowfall anomalies and thermal changes. However, extreme weather and climate change probably affect surges and surge dynamics, such as intensification, enhance melting, creating crevasses on glacier surfaces and changing the glacier volume.""

Asif Khan, an expert on climate change and an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said, ""Surging is a short-lived event, when a glacier moves 10 to 100 times faster than its normal velocity.""

Mohammad said the flooding on May 30 was probably triggered by a rise in temperature, causing significant glacier melt and increasing the size of the lake. Meteorological data shows a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May. In the first half of June, water was still flowing down the hillside and being blocked by debris, posing a potential risk of another flood.

Shaukat Ali, a climate expert at the Islamabad-based Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), said, ""Surge is a phenomenon that can also be caused by extreme events of precipitation. The Karakoram Anomaly may cause surging and advancing of the Shishper glacier. Our research at GCISC shows that Gupis, Drosh, Chitral and Gilgit are the future hotspots of the highest increase in average temperature in the 21st century.""

Ali pointed out that this could lead to significant changes in future water availability in Pakistan, which is dependent almost totally on the Indus basin for irrigation and other uses. Pakistan’s agriculture sector contributes around 22% of Pakistan’s GDP, and over 45% of the country’s workforce is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly.

A higher glacier melting rate can also trigger GLOFs and floods downstream, leading to more infrastructure and economic losses, Ali added.

In the first installment, we looked at how advances in robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, computing, and autonomous systems could shape warfare. In our second installment, we will look at how technological, political, social, and environmental change could shape the future economy.

Much like the size and shape of future battlefields, the evolution of trade, commerce, and global marketplaces is rather difficult to predict. After all, wherever human beings are involved (and in large numbers), chaos is sure to ensue! Still, there are a few significant changes on the way that cannot be denied, and which economists are preparing for. They include, in no particular order:

Population growth (predominantly in urban centers)

Growth of non-western economies and markets

New technologies, industries, and professions

Changing temperatures, weather patterns, and water shortages

Renewable energy and sustainability

The bottom line is that the future economies will simultaneously be driven by abundance and scarcity, where more people will need to be sustained using less in the way of resources. This challenge not only has the potential for a lot of uncertainty and chaos, but it will also likely foster the development of solutions.

Growing Populations

According to a 2019 report compiled by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs — titled ""World Population Prospects 2019"" — the global population is expected to reach 9.74 billion by mid-century. However, the addition of more than 2 billion people will not be equally distributed between the world's nations.

Whereas Asia has been the greatest contributor to the global population since the mid-20th century, population growth there has been slowing since the beginning of the 21st century. By 2030, Asia's population growth is expected to plateau, and the population of the continent is expected to stay in the vicinity of 5 billion people until 2050.

From that point onward, the only continent to experience a significant increase in population growth will be Africa. Currently, Africa has a population of 1.36 billion people and is projected to reach up to 2.5 billion by mid-century (that's an increase of about 83%). Nevertheless, by 2050, Asia will still be the most populous continent, with a total population of about 5.29 billion.

Africa will be the second-most populous, with an estimated population of 2.49 billion. Latin America and the Caribbean will be third with an estimated 710 million, followed by Europe (705 million), North America (430 million), and Oceania (60 million). As always, the factors driving this growth will be economic, social, and technological in nature.

Urban Sprawl

Another important aspect of population growth in this century is where it will be concentrated. Today, roughly 56% of the global population lives in urban centers instead of rural settings, which works out to about 4.4 billion people. By 2050, the global urban population is projected to increase to 6.6 billion, or roughly 68% of humanity.

This will place additional stress on environmental systems that are already under severe stress by major cities. Urban expansion means that more land needs to be cleared to build infrastructure, more water needs to be diverted for utilities, more electricity needs to be generated, and more agricultural land needs to be set aside.

Since urban populations will be growing far beyond their rural counterparts, there will be proportionally fewer farmers in addition to less farmland. Coupled with the effects of climate change (see below), this means there will be many more mouths to feed in 2050. At the same time, the resources we'll need to do so will be in shorter supply.

However, the problem goes beyond food production. While every new child born between now and 2050 will be another mouth to feed, they'll also be another person in need of shelter, utilities, sanitation, medical care, education, and eventual employment. When these needs are not met, the end result is generally an increase in violent crime, terrorism, and humanitarian crises.

Luckily, it's not all doom and gloom. For, as the logic goes, every new life is a mouth to feed, but also a pair of working hands and a brain for problem-solving. The same holds true for urban environments, which are a big draw on natural resources but also centers for innovation and creative pursuits.

The (Shifting) Wealth of Nations

The global economic balance is expected to change significantly between now and 2050. While much of this is well underway, the pace of change is predicted to accelerate in the next three decades. According to a 2020 Bloomberg Economics forecast, the post-WWII economic stability enjoyed by the developed nations of the world will be coming to an end as new superpowers take their place on the world stage.

In short, the global economy will experience a shift in its center of gravity, moving from West to East and from advanced economies to emerging markets. The effect this will have on global politics, which is similarly already being felt, will intensify. For starters, China will have overtaken the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035 and become the world's largest economy.

By 2050, Asia's share of the global market share of GDP will grow to over 50% (driven largely by China and India). North American and Europe will account for about 20% each, while the rest of the world will account for less than 10%. In terms of which nations will be the wealthiest, the top ten today are the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, India, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, and Canada.

By 2050, this is forecast to be China, the US, India, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, the U.K., and Turkey. For the first time since the ""Age of Imperialism,"" the richest nations in the world will not all be in Europe and North America. Instead, wealth and the political influence it brings will be more evenly distributed between the continents.

Beyond the top ten spots, the largest economies will also be located outside of Europe and North America. They include Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Mexico, Poland, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

But it's not all about who has the most wealth. There's also the question of which will be the fastest-growing economies. In this respect, the countries experiencing the most significant growth in terms of GDP and per capita income by 2050 will be Nigeria, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia, Columbia, Mexico, and Thailand.

Once again, the markets of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be the greatest drivers of change. Much of this will be the result of digital technology and the access it ensures becoming more widespread, to the point where every nation and person in the world can get online.

Internet of Everything

According to a 2018 report by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), more than half of the global population now has access to the internet. By 2050, 90% of the world's people are expected to have access, owing to a combination of economic growth in the developed world, the proliferation of mobile devices, and access to broadband satellite services.

In addition to people, an exponentially greater amount of mobile devices, sensors, ""smart-home"" appliances, and gadgets will be connected to the internet by the middle of the century. In fact, individual devices may also be ""smartened"" thanks to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms, predictive algorithms, and other forms of neural-net software.

Speaking of technology that imitates how humans process information and learn, ongoing studies into human neurology could well lead to the widespread adoption of neural implants. With devices like Neuralink, people will be able to interface with computers and devices, access the internet, do online banking, blog, surf, and create content through the simple act of thinking!

These developments would further accelerate the transition from a physical to a digital economy, where growth is data-driven and the most valuable resource is content. It will also give rise to the so-called ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) — where the real world will come to resemble the internet. This will have a profound effect on society, by improving efficiency and anticipating behavior in advance.

Concordantly, information security will become far more important, as privacy becomes a thing of the past. With cameras, sensors, and digital markers everywhere, and increasingly sophisticated AI systems mining the data to anticipate patterns and spending habits, every move a person makes will be recorded and cataloged in the cloud.

If outside parties were able to gain access to this data, it could lead to new levels of identity theft, extortion, and online harassment in the near future.

New Industries & New Jobs

Perhaps most significant of all is the way that accelerating technological trends will alter the way people work, communicate, shop, and consume. This will naturally lead to all kinds of new occupations, new opportunities for investment, and a general overhaul in how people ""do business."" Four major trends will coincide to drive this change, among them:

Technological Unemployment: Automation will continue to advance and lead to a vast increase in efficiency, but at the cost of eliminating a number of jobs. This will take not only the form of robotic systems but also machine learning and software that will remove the need for human analysis and oversight.

Increasingly Flexible Work: With automated systems handling more and more in the way of physical production, job growth will be increasingly focused on the creation of content and intellectual property. Combined with wireless technology, far more people will be able to work from home or remote locations and make their own hours.

Options for the Rich and Poor: In the developing world, much industrial work will be eliminated by the introduction of robotics and automated production. This will speed a new trend, where emerging nations and markets are forced to adapt to the high-tech, data-driven economy of the future, and the problems of ""downsizing"" and redundancy shift to the developing world.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchains: The rise of the ""industrial internet"" will create new redundancies but also opportunities for entrepreneurs. As more and more economic activity takes place online, economic activity will be far more direct, peer-to-peer, and decentralized.

This trend towards decentralization will be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the blockchains used to distribute them. These are poised to replace traditional banking and monetary transactions, but they may also be programmed to represent energy, resources, investment, and ownership.

Commercial Space: By 2050, the commercial space industry is expected to grow exponentially and reach the point where it is valued in the trillions. This will be driven by the deployment of ""megaconstellations"" providing telecom and internet services, miniature satellites enabling research and development, and orbital refueling services.

Space will become more and more accessible as launch costs continue to decline, owing to space planes, reusable rockets, and commercial spaceports. By mid-century, this could result in space tourism, space hotels, and even habitats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Commercial missions to the Moon, lunar tourism, and even asteroid mining are also likely to become a reality.

The ability to prospect and mine Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) will lead to a massive influx of precious metals and building materials to the global economy. This is anticipated to lead to the world's first trillionaires, the devaluation of precious metals (which will no longer be scarce), and the creation of a space-construction industry.

A Warming Planet

For decades, scientists have known that Earth has been getting warmer since the late 19th century. This trend is the direct result of humanity's impact on the natural environment and fossil fuel consumption. This has led to increased levels of greenhouse gases — most notably, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which increase the amount of solar radiation our atmosphere absorbs.

According to the 2018 Special Report that was released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures are forecast to increase by an average of 2.7 °F to 3.6 °F (1.5 °C to 2 °C) by 2052. The 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) threshold is the target goal established by the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to mitigate climate change through the reduction of CO 2 emissions.

While this may not sound like a lot, it is important to remember that this is an average increase — which includes annual and regional variations. An increase of 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) to 3.6 °F (2 °C) will mean hotter summers, more precipitation, more instances of extreme weather, and the disruption of natural systems that humans rely on for their survival and livelihood.

These temperature increases will be felt strongly in Central and Eastern North America, Central and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In regions located nearer to the poles (Canada, Russia, South Africa, and South America), the length of the frost-free season will likely increase, as will the corresponding growing season.

Because of this, countries located closer to the poles will experience a boom in agricultural production. At the same time, countries that have the largest supplies of renewable freshwater (Brazil, Russia, and Canada) will be forced to contend with increasing demand and may face serious repercussions if they do not scale up extraction to meet it.

Closer to the equator, temperature increases will mean more precipitation in the winter, which will mean more flooding, coastal storms, and runoff. During the summer, the increased heat will mean more drought, desertification, and the lowering of water tables. The combination of these extremes will also mean more in the way of erosion, runoff, and depletion of topsoil.

Similarly, heavily-populated areas along the coasts and major rivers that empty into oceans will be subject to rising sea levels. According to recent research, an estimated 4.6 billion mi² (7.4 billion km²) of land will flood or be underwater by 2040. This will have a massive economic impact as major urban centers are forced to contend with floods that become worse with every passing year.

By mid-century, several major cities are projected to be abandoned (or significantly depopulated) due to rising tides, flooding river systems, or sinkholes (caused by groundwater extraction). This will not only trigger migrations and refugee crises but will have a major impact on global markets as financial centers are lost.

Another trend, which is already well underway, will be the loss of glaciers and polar ice caps. According to a study released in April of 2020, simulations conducted by the Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) have shown that the Arctic Circle will experience ice-free summers by 2050.

The loss of Arctic sea ice will have a profound impact on the planet, influencing ocean circulation and causing open water to absorb more heat. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in ocean temperatures, as well as the potential release of methane deposits beneath the Arctic Ocean.

A similar situation is happening in Siberia right now, where the disappearance of permafrost is allowing caches of subsurface methane to be released into the atmosphere. This creates a vicious circle, where the warming trend results in feedback mechanisms that cause even more warming, and so on.

Water Wars!

In many parts of the world, rapid industrialization and population growth have led to water shortages. In China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico, and the United States, this has led to desperate measures, and even international incidents. With the added stress caused by climate change, freshwater is projected to become increasingly scarce by 2050.

This will inevitably lead to ""Water Wars"" in parts of the world as neighboring countries fight to control access to limited supplies of freshwater — especially where international river systems are concerned. These rivers are essential for drinking water, irrigation, and sanitation wherever they flow, so neighboring countries are not likely to be in the mood to share when they begin to dry up.

In recent years, ""water futures"" have emerged and are now being traded like all precious commodities — similar to oil, precious metals, and stones. So, in addition to having a significant geopolitical and environmental impact, the disappearance of freshwater sources will also be played out in financial markets.

In the meantime, the scarcity of fresh water will continue to drive investment in desalination technology, water reclamation, and closed-loop environmental systems. This will be especially apparent in how architecture will incorporate ecology (aka. ""arcology"") in order to ensure greater sustainability in urban space.

Greener Energy

On the plus side, the impact of climate change will also lead to positive developments in the manufacturing, energy, and transportation sectors by 2050. For starters, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other ""green technologies"" will be far more common due to declining costs, competitive pricing, and the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2018, 28% of global electricity was generated from renewable energy sources — a combination of hydroelectric (45%), nuclear (28%), wind (13%), solar (6%), biofuels (5%), and other methods (3%). By 2050, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates that renewables will generate 49% of global electricity, followed by natural gas (23%), coal (23%), and nuclear (5%).

Solar will occupy the most significant share of renewable sources, accounting for 38% of all electrical generation, while wind will grow to 34%, hydro will reach 27%, and biomass and other fuels will account for the remainder. For solar and wind power, the greatest contributions are expected to be from China and India.

By mid-century, China will account for 37% of solar and 35% of wind generation worldwide, while India will account for 24% of solar and 22% of wind. Hydroelectric power use will be more evenly distributed, with China (23%), the EU (17%), Brazil (15%), and India (8%) occupying the largest share.

Renewable energy is already having a significant impact in developing nations, where access to centralized grids is limited, and utilities are considered unreliable. In these places, portable solar lights, portable wind turbines, and appliances that use alternative energy sources are providing sustainable energy for small communities.

Due to the ongoing loss of arable land, cities will also become greener as urban farming, vertical farming, aquaculture, hydroponics, community gardens, and buildings that combine architecture and ecology into a single design (arcology).

Other changes will include electronic vehicles (EVs), which will make up over half of the automobile market by 2050. Advances in Tokamak fusion reactors are also expected to lay the groundwork for fusion energy, which is projected to become commercially available by 2050 and after.

—

The economy of 2050 won't be anything most people would recognize today. Physical cash and in-person banking are already giving way to e-banking and e-commerce. By 2050, it will give way to cryptocurrencies and distribution nodes that are not subject to regulation or controlled by any centralized government or financial institution.

Between advancements in technology, more people, more connectivity, and the need to do more with less, it's hard to know how it will all play out. On the one hand, the world may find itself being dragged deeper into ecological damage and resource shortfalls, triggering all manner of crises and struggles.

On the other, it's possible that renewable energy, reduced emissions, smart living, commercial space, and a growing focus on sustainability, humanity will enter a period of ""post-scarcity"" economics. One thing is for sure, though. What we do between now and 2050 will determine what happens beyond that point. We could be headed for disaster, or destined for something better.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/y5wWd0nYOX/sizes/dubai-finance_md.jpg,"['increase', 'life', 'billion', 'growth', 'global', 'economy', 'change', 'water', 'glimpse', 'population', 'energy', '2050', 'world', 'future']", ,none
86,86,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"Poor planning, poor governance, poor monitoring flood Karachi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1577236,"It is the same mess in all cities of South Asia.

It does not always rain in Karachi during the monsoon. When it does, it floods. It was worse this year, with a three-day spell of heavy rainfall in late August leading to least 47 deaths due to drowning, electrocution, as well as house and wall collapses. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected”. Personnel from the armed forces have been called out to rescue stranded people, distribute food and medical aid.

Many parts of Karachi went without electricity for 50 hours, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ask, “What kind of service is this?”. Internet and cell phone networks were disrupted all over Pakistan’s largest city.

Women, children and the elderly waded through waist-deep sewage to reach rescue boats as rain continued to pelt down; the boats had to navigate around floating furniture, submerged cars, motorcycles, and even shipping crates pushed around by the force of the floodwater.

The meteorological department totalled August rainfall in Karachi at 484 mm (19 inches), with the highest daily rainfall of 130 mm at PAF Faisal Base on August 28.

“Last year, through the three monsoon months, the PAF Faisal Base recorded a total of 345 mm of rains; this year in just two months, over 600 mm rain has been recorded there,” Sardar Sarfaraz, the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s Karachi head told The Third Pole.

“The rains are unprecedented; and in all likelihood, this seems like an erratic event, with the last such intense rain recorded in 1931,” said Sarfaraz. “I cannot say with finality that this rainfall can definitively be attributed to climate change.”

“Due to the effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle, we will see a continued intensification of monsoons in the coming years,” predicted climate expert Imran Khalid, who heads the Environment and Climate Change section of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute.

Where will the water go?

Khalid wondered, though, if Karachi would have been any better off if there was no climate change? According to him, Karachi’s woes have their roots in poor governance and planning.

“By encroaching and blocking the streams that form the natural watershed, over many decades, the authorities have set us up to fail,” he pointed out, terming the flood footage on television a manifestation of “decades of apathy and ignorance about the laws of nature”.

“If you block the flow of water, it will go around you; if it can’t go around you, it will continue to rise until it envelopes you.” The crises were “of our own making”, Khalid added, emphasising the need to incorporate laws of nature into urban planning.

Karachi has over 550 big and small storm water drains. “But over the years, some as wide as 200 feet have narrowed down to just 30 feet today, due to unauthorised construction,” admitted Karachi’s outgoing mayor Waseem Akhtar, head of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). As he left office on August 30, he said, “Karachi is for everyone but nobody is for Karachi.”

Going about town to inspect the damage, Chief Minister Shah chided people for “building houses in the belly of the Malir river”, according to media reports. “The entire city is sinking because of your encroachments,” he reportedly said.

Noman Ahmed, dean of Architecture and Management Sciences department at Karachi’s NED University, said some encroachments happened in connivance with different government agencies, while some were “organic”.

“For example, the encroachments on Gujjar Nala was facilitated by the KMC functionaries by providing inappropriate leases,” on its edges, in areas that were not supposed to be inhabited in the first place.

“The alignment of the nalas [drains] have clearly been demarcated in all land use plans available with the different civic agencies,” said Ahmed, and therefore selling plots of land was nothing less than a “criminal act”.

He would not blame those who had bought the plots. Ahmed felt people had started building on the dry bed of Gujjar Nala because for decades there was nothing more than a thin stream. “They occupied the land without knowing how vulnerable they were to sudden inundation, and this is what happened in recent rains.”

Architect and heritage consultant Marvi Mazhar also termed “unplanned and unregulated growth, lack of monitoring and corruption” as major reasons for the havoc the rains wrought on the city of 16 million that had been heavily “concretised, with not enough soft ground left for water to be absorbed”.

The problem has persisted despite court judgments, including an order from the country’s chief justice that all illegal construction be removed from Karachi — whether on or off the drains.

Terming removal of encroachments “a very tricky affair”, Ahmed said very often debris left behind by a demolition crew caused more obstruction to water flow than the original buildings had done.

What is to be done?

“These drains can actually be added into beautification plans with plantations on either side, and run across the city like in Amsterdam,” said Mazhar. Instead, she said, they are seen and treated as an eyesore with garbage thrown alongside them, which invariably slips into the drain thereby choking it. She held both residents and the government responsible for the indifference shown towards Karachi’s garbage.

Now Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he wants a “permanent solution” to problems associated with drains, the sewage system and water supply.

Ahmed said the government should come up with a “comprehensive policy for not just all the drains but other waterways and spaces where water accumulates. Just working on a piecemeal basis will not get the desired results.”

He also pointed out that those evicted in this process must be rehabilitated. “The Sindh government has ample land in Karachi’s suburbs. If done in a step by step manner, not everyone will need to be evicted at one go or at least till the re-demarcation of the nalas takes place.”

Many residents feel the collapse of municipal services and consequent problems such as the recent flooding is because Karachi has become too unwieldy to be governed. With 19 different land-owning agencies under the three tiers of government — the city government in the hands of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party that holds the purse strings and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the centre — the city’s problems only get bounced around and the blame game continues.

Same situation all over South Asia

Substitute the names of the rivers, drains and political parties, and the same story is repeated in varying degrees across all the cities of South Asia — Rawalpindi, Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and on and on. For years, residents have been resigned to the mess and vented their ire on social media. Now they have started coming out on the streets — it happened in Kolkata after weeklong power failures in some suburbs following Cyclone Amphan; and it is happening in Karachi now. Perhaps the fact that the hardships have now spread from slums to tony neighbourhoods has something to do with it. The internet is back now, and the phones are working, but the protests continue. Their effect remains to be seen.

The Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a significant flood warning for the northern parts of the country, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in catchment areas of river Kabul River along with hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan division.

""According to latest hydro-meteorological situation, monsoon has become active over Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir producing widespread thunderstorm/rains,"" an alert issued by the PMD's Flood Forecasting Division said. The advisory was shared on Twitter by Azhar Mashwani, the focal person on digital media to the Punjab chief minister.

The alert warned that the existing weather system is likely to persist over those areas during the next 48 hours ""with [a] high probability of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of River Kabul and its tributaries along with hill torrents of DG Khan division which may cause medium to high flood situation"".

Around 872 people were evacuated last week owing to a threat of flood, with several points along the Chenab and Jhelum swelling. At least 60 rescue teams and 326 rescuers saved villagers and their belongings, and still many areas were under the threat of flood.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2020-08-31/pakistan-met-deptt-issues-significant-flood-warning-1598887077-5088.jpg,"['warning', 'khan', 'torrents', 'rainfall', 'punjab', 'significant', 'pakistan', 'issues', 'threat', 'flood', 'kabul', 'met', 'river', 'deptt', 'areas', 'heavy']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: A red alert was issued Tuesday by the federal capital's administration over possible flooding caused by rains expected to lash the city this week.



The Islamabad administration said Ghauri Town, Soan Gardens, and Sectors I-8 and I-9 were forecast to be inundated with rainwater following the heavy rains.

It further underlined that the Soan and Korang rivers, as well as the Simly and Rawal dams, near Islamabad and Rawalpindi were expected to flood during the ongoing week

Flooding was also feared to occur in the kutchi abaadis (slums) in Sectors F-9, G-6, G-8, H-9, and I-9, as well as Khanna Pul, Ghauri Town, and Soan, the administration said.

It warned that opening the Simly and Rawal dams' spillways would likely inundate the Soan and Korang rivers and disrupt electricity, water, and sewerage services in the areas.

The Islamabad administration has imposed an emergency in the federal capital's hospitals ahead of possible destruction due to the rains forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and noted that local schools would be used as relief camps in case of flooding.","Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-09-01/l_708593_054541_updates.jpg,"['rivers', 'flash', 'schools', 'simly', 'possible', 'issues', 'soan', 'flooding', 'sectors', 'islamabad', 'administration', 'alert', 'used', 'town', 'red']", ,flood

Floods symbolise miseries and destruction and their effects can be felt for a very long time, like wrong decisions by politicians drive nations backward and derail them from the path of progress and growth. I am worried to see the way politics is being played on floods where the governments, at both the federal and provincial levels are fighting on percentage sharing. The federal government represents the state and the state is the mother which has to be looked after by each and every citizen of the land.

I wish and hope that Imran khan should have been more tactful and gracious in working with CM Sindh, and CM Sindh should also have cooperated for the sake of the people of Karachi.

The media teams on both sides fight like kids and it looks as if both sides’ media teams are indulging in competition where they are winning at the cost of the public of Karachi who are already crushed with ethnic and poverty storms.

I hope my observations will be taken positively as Karachi is my city too, where I studied and started my civil service; I know the problems of Karachi.

My appeal to fellow politicians is to stop playing politics on floods and other natural disasters at the cost of your own poor masses.

Floods destroy everything that comes in their way and as a poor nation, we keep looking for support and help from rich countries at the cost of our self-respect.

Is it not the duty of the federal or provincial governments to sit with the map of Pakistan, analyse past destruction of the floods and design ways to channel flood water by creating channels based on surveys and hold this water in dams in all provinces?

We should know who is in the charge of it and which authority can take up with provincial authorities. Let me point out that it is the duty of “water board” which needs to be converted into Water board authority which should be empowered with adequate funding to manage the flood water and river water in such a way that each and every drop of water falls in the sea and every drop is used for agriculture to enhance our agricultural proceeds.

Despite being rich in water resources, we Pakistanis continue to face water scarcity every year because of the inability of authorities to properly use and manage these water resources for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability.

Poor water management is costing our country around 4-5 percent of GDP each year. These costs are caused by the floods and droughts that we face due to poor water supply and sanitation. We are endowed with water yet we do not make the best use of this.

The most alarming thing here is that the water crisis was rated as the biggest risk to Pakistan by the World Economic Forum and the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. They also warned that the country could “run dry” by 2025.

Half of the annual rainfall in our country occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimetres in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimetres per month.

This year in August, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall recorded over the last 90 years.

Pakistan receives 145 million-acre feet of water every year. However, only 14m acre-feet of water are preserved and we can meet the shortage if we have proper storage of rainwater and floodwater.

We have rivers and small streams coming from mountains finally meeting at “Sutledge”. The flows and diversions need to be examined scientifically with proper measurements to ensure the use of water for the betterment of local people; it is also important to analyse its miserable effects on the public and crops.

Let every town build a local rain pond which can store all the rainwater which can be used by them later for agricultural and irrigation purposes. Once a storage capacity is built, then a sprinkler irrigation system can be designed and introduced to better store and manage this precious water.

The water can also be converted into clean drinking water by using small plants. This sweet water can be used in multiple ways if properly managed by the local bodies.

We may also let the DC be the Head of a Rainwater Authority to ensure the government’s indulgence and control. It is an extensive but very simple exercise and this should be opted for on a priority.

On one hand, we are facing water scarcity due to floods and poor water management while on the other, we are also facing water terrorism from India as it wants to either just stop/block our share of water with ulterior motives when we need it, or release extra water into our rivers to increase the flow causing floods in Pakistan and we know that both of these are dangerous for Pakistan.

As we are dependent on India for water, Modi, by blocking water, wants to deprive Pakistan of water to convert her into a desert. In fact, Modi is following a full-fledged anti-Pakistan agenda.

India has worked out that the one of the national key quotients is water and hence, India will continue to block water flow from India to Pakistan. PM Modi had already thrown the first water bomb on Pakistan in 2018 by blocking our legitimate natural watercourse. India had completed its construction of Kishanganga hydropower project on the Neelam River by diverting the watercourse through a 16 km tunnel, which is a clear violation of the Indus Water Treaty between the two countries.

The Kishanganga River, upon entering Pakistani territory is recognised as Neelam River that originates from Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and flows through the Gurez Valley to join Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad, at Domail, in Azad Jammu Kashmir. The construction of Kishanganga Dam is also in violation of Article III (4) of the Indus Water Treaty, which places an obligation or restriction on India not to construct any similar projects on western rivers, that is, on Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. Also, the construction of the Kishanganga project will adversely affect the Neelum-Jhelum project, as its power generation capacity will be reduced radically. In accordance with Article III (2) of Indus Water Treaty, India is also prohibited from developing any human made obstructions that shall have or may cause a change in the volume of the natural flow of western rivers.

The project includes a 121 feet tall concrete-face rock-fill dam, which will divert a portion of the river to the south through a 24 km tunnel. The diversion reduced the flow of water into Pakistan by about 11 percent in the summer and about 27 percent in the winter, which would be contrary to the Indus Water Treaty as the western rivers belong to Pakistan. It also contends that the diversion would result in an ecological disaster for the area.

India had signed all the important Conventions that, with complete effect, would ruin our valley totally. It is sad to note that neither our previous government nor the present one ever took this matter seriously whereas the water issue is supposed to be an issue of life and death.

My above suggestions are better in both ways to use the extra water for irrigation. In this way, induction terrorism by India via water flow can be controlled and we can convert this misery into success by irrigating barren land.

We need to bring an enactment/bill or a “rainfall act” to get these activities regulated as a national priority. I am confident that this law will be of great benefit for the nation.

As per many predictions, the next wars will be over sweetwater.

I wish our defence sector takes initiatives to take help of our soldiers to develop these water channels during peacetime with the help of the local public on a volunteer basis.

Let all the provinces and the federation give serious thought to my above proposals.

I will, however, move a bill on “The Flood Control Act” in order to store rainwater throughout the country, fixing the responsibility on concerned authorities.

We have water, all types of minerals, a fertile landscape, the best brains, four seasons, the best beaches, natural gas, green mountains with blue waters and lakes, deserts and forests, but we do not have the command of unity and the skills of governance. We are still slaves of false egos and are masters of self-destruction.

It is time for the leadership to wake up and not flood their national cause and interest. Lead your nation to drive to the valley of love and not hate to protect your future generations.

“National unity Zindabad”.

According to a statement issued by the National Emergency Operations Centre on Polio, the £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to the people who have lost their homes.

This comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks, including hygiene kits and tarpaulins, to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Over 55,000 people will get life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter

Lord Ahmad said: “Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands by Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.”

He added: “The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be — and the dangers of climate change. During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.”

British High Commissioner Christian Turner said: “Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.”

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from Covid-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year.

Lord Ahmad discussed with the government of Pakistan how Britain can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations and trade ties.

He also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in south Punjab.

Britain has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly eight million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The UK minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the Covid-19 surveillance centre. He met National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr Rana Safdar who briefed him on Pakistan’s response to Covid-19.

He is scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

92,92,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistan’s flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to “manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle”, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this ‘annual surprise’ presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bang­la­desh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacue­­es, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

93,93,FL-2017-000115-PAK,Karachi: flood management and governance - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2259093/karachi-flood-management-and-governance,"A new debate has erupted over managing floods in Karachi and the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to clear waste from the drains of Karachi due to heavy rainfall. Acrimonious discussions with a blame game against each other were witnessed on TV talk shows between the representatives of the PTI government, the PPP government in Sindh as well as the MQM.

The PPP sees sinister design behind the move to undermine the authority and image of the Sindh government, portraying it as an example of poor governance. Their contention was that Lahore had also been inundated with floods but neither hue and cry was created nor was FWO sent there. Their argument had been that whatever and wherever something goes wrong, the federal government finds the Sindh government as a punching bag to divert people’s attention from their own failures. Be it the sugar crisis, wheat shortage, fuel shortage, rising food inflation or the postings and transfers, the federal government tries to pass the buck to the Sindh government.

The general public is watching all the melodrama with anguish and anxiety. The intervention of the federal government would have gone unnoticed, had it not been with a political motive, belittling the Sindh government. The federal government and provinces do not work in tight compartments, rather they supplement each other within the contours of the Constitution and law. But, when the Governor of Sindh — instead of acting as a representative of the federal government and constitutional head of the province bound to act on the advice of the Chief Executive of the province — starts issuing statements to browbeat the Chief Minister, then it certainly develops irritation and is not taken in a normal course.

No doubt, Karachi, being a metropolitan city has its own problems, but similar problems also exist in all cities of Pakistan. Karachi being the biggest city and economic hub attracts migrants from all over the country and has expanded in all directions without proper town planning. Therefor the problems of Karachi are of a greater magnitude.

Within the ambit of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh and the local government to provide civic amenities to their citizens, which of course include waste management, desilting and clearance of drains. Rainfall in Karachi causing floods is not a rare phenomenon, it happens with recurrence. This nature of problem may be described as a calamity, hence falling within the purview of the NDMA. In this context, preparedness is one of the essentials of disaster management followed by prevention, mitigation of sufferings and community awareness. But, unfortunately governments have been found negligent in their preparation to deal with such crises.

Disaster management or crisis management has a direct co-relation with governance. Governance is all about delivery within time and action of all tiers of government in unison to add synergy to their efforts. In such a situation KMC, DHA, Cantonments, Port Qasim Authority, Irrigation Department and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) with a lead role of the provincial government should have set a strategy to deal with such an eventuality.

The Sindh government could have easily managed excavators, dumpers or other machinery available on rent in the market. Roughly the rent of an excavator is not more than Rs500,000 per week. If the funds were not available with the respective departments, the Chief Minister should have set aside the funds from his own discretionary grant or re-appropriated in order to escape criticism.

While the Sindh government has its own share of blame, the NDMA has its own role to play. The authority has its own National Disaster and Risk Management plan. According to the Act and plan, the PDMA and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are the coordinating units. Therefore, NDMA has to work through those bodies. In such a scenario, NDMA should have shifted all the resources to PDMA and FWO should have also been at the disposal of the provincial government to avoid political point scoring.

Although with a knee-jerk reaction to the malaise symptomatic treatment has been meted out, the main cause has not been removed. This problem has erupted due to massive encroachments in the nullahs, drains, riverbed, poor designing and construction of roads and bridges. This again is a reflection of poor governance. Rule of law is the foundation of governance. We have all kinds of laws but implementation is missing, hence this mess. As the saying goes, “nip the evil in the bud” but the departments assigned to do the task close their eyes to the initial violation and with the passage of time the problem grows such magnitude that all wonder what to do.

Karachi being a port city is now considered to be a city of all. The population of the city is growing at a fast pace, so are the problems. Governments, particularly city governments in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have been managing well. Why not we? A deeper study of their governance reveals the underlying factor: adherence to the rule of law. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the federal government, to implement the law and remove all encroachments done in violation of the law and set aside funds ahead of the monsoon rains. This is the only way out and a permanent solution. This applies to all cities of Pakistan, including the federal capital.

94,94,FL-2017-000115-PAK,"Cheap Chinese tyres flood Pakistani markets, capture big share - ANI News",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/cheap-chinese-tyres-flood-pakistani-markets-capture-big-share20210406220440,"Karachi [Pakistan], April 6 (ANI): Chinese tyres have captured 85 per cent of the market share in Pakistan which is a substantial 45 per cent increase from two years ago.

According to a report published in Dawn, the takeover of the local market share by a Chinese product is not uncanny and is similar to several Made in China products that have flooded local markets.

Earlier, the Chinese car tyres held 40 per cent of the market share in 2018. The share now has since increased to 85 per cent. ""In the light truck category tyres, China held a share of 30-40 per cent two years ago which has now gone up to 65-70 per cent,"" the report said.

Moreover, Beijing also dominates in truck/bus tyres with over 75 per cent market share which was merely 40 per cent two years back.



""Mushroom growth has been noted in the number of dealers who are regularly flooding the market with Chinese tyres,"" former chairman of the Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) Azim K. Yousufzai told Dawn.

The association leader said the low prices were the main reason for the surging market share of Chinese tyres. They are cheaper than European, Korean, Thai and American tyres.

On the smuggling of tyres, Yousufzai said the illegal arrival of different types of tyres has slowed down drastically owing to strict vigil at the border areas.

""Strict monitoring at the borders has brought down informal arrival of tyres from 50-60 pc to 20pc,"" he claimed.

Over the decrease in sales of Pakistani tyres, the association leader said that the government has reduced the regulatory duty (RD) to 10-20 per cent for various categories of imported tyres which is among the factors encouraging legal imports. (ANI)

1.1. Background

During the current monsoon, Sindh faced seven spells of moderate to heavy rains. These heavy rains affected several districts of Sindh including different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Sanghar, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Tando Muhamamd Khan Jacobabad and Umerkot.

According to Pakistan Meteorological Department Karachi received the heaviest rain in a single day ever in its history when 231 mm rain lashed out in just 12 hours. Maximum rain recorded in millimetres Karachi (Surjani Town 195, Kemari 170, North Karachi 168, Nazimabad 162, Masroor Base 154, Saddar 142, Landhi 126, Airport Old Area 122, University Road & Saadi Town 105, Jinnah Terminal 104, Gulshan-e-Hadid 49) Moen Jo Daro 44, Shaheed Benazirabad 34, Sukkur 15, Larkana 07, Jacobabad 06, Chor and Hyderabad 02. Hub Dam water level crossed 338.5 feet’ after 13 years of history.

During August 2020, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall record over the last 90 years. In recent most 7th spell that started on August 27 and continued, heavy rainfalls are recorded that turns the Karachi and many districts in Shambles. Karachi alone received 223 mm. of rain over 12 hours, and it caused more devastation to Karachi. Rainwater and overflowed water from nullahs and drains flooded most of the main roads and streets in residential locations, a significant number of residential areas including urban slums and villages in peri-urban areas, that gravely disrupted the people’s lives.

The misery of the people increases many folds due to long power outages and gushing flooded water on streets which causes traffic jams, resulted in difficult access for relief or rescue work in affected areas. The inundated roads caused massive traffic jams in Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Sarjani, Sohrab Goth, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, Nagin Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, Orangi Town, Haideri, Liaqatabad, Gulshan Iqbal, Hussain Abad, Kareem Abad, Shahrah-e-Faisal, Quaidabad, Malir National Highway, Hassan Squire, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Defence, Clifton, Gulberg, Kashmir Colony, Saudabad, Golimar, Rizwia, Patel Para, Pak Colony, Shah Latif Town, Lyari, Sakhi Hassan, Shadman, Anda Mor and other parts of the city.

On 29th August 2020, 6 districts of Karachi are declared as “Calamity hit areas” by the Relief Commissioner - Government Sindh under Sindh National Calamities (P&R) Act 1958. According to RNA the two districts respectively Karachi East and Malir are most affected.

An eight-member official delegation from Islamabad will interact with Indian officials at the 116th Permanent Indus Commission meet during March 23-24 in the first face-to-face formal meeting since the intensification of political tension following India’s decision to change the special status of J&K and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Pakistan is likely to bring up its concerns related to the two hydroelectric plants over two tributaries of the Chenab river. Indian officials are prepared to allay all worries by supplying all necessary information,” the source said.

At the last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission meeting in 2018, Pakistan had reportedly raised objections to some design aspects of the 1,000 MW Pakul Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai plants, including the height of the reservoir, and water storage and releases that are yet to be sorted out.

As per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the eastern rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi are under India’s control, while Pakistan controls the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.

India and Pakistan are also likely to discuss the two new run-of-river hydroelectric plants — Durbuk Shyok (19 MW) and Nimu-Chilling (24 MW) — in Ladakh.

The two sides may also talk about flood data arrangements with the view of the forthcoming flood season, the source added.

The Indus Commission meet, which is supposed to be held annually, got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political tension caused by the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories was also a likely reason for delay.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/x71po4/article34130994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bl23indiapak,"['officials', 'plants', 'meet', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'watersharing', 'mw', 'indus', 'hydroelectric', 'discuss', 'likely', 'commission', 'flood', 'india', 'project', 'exchange']", ,flood

1,1,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Parents of Pakistani man who died in NSW floods forced to watch burial through car window - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/05/parents-of-pakistani-man-who-died-in-nsw-floods-forced-to-watch-burial-through-car-window,"The parents of a man who died when his car was trapped in New South Wales flood waters have farewelled their son at a prayer service in Sydney after flying in from Pakistan.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son’s body or coffin and were kept apart from Younus’s friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younus’s father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

“When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,” the grieving father said.

“I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didn’t happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.”

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

“Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me,” he said.

“One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.”

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

“I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.”

Younus had three siblings – two older brothers and a younger sister – who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younus’s parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his son’s coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia’s mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the family’s travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younus’s coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends – Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. “We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities,” he said. “We would spend time there with friends.”

The housemate said Younus “loved going to the gym and playing volleyball – he was a very energetic person”.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younus’s parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

“They’re in quarantine at the moment and an exemption was given only after an intense negotiation, with the immigration department, for them to be released for only a very short period of time,” he said. “It was a minute-to-minute procedure.”

The funeral for Younus was delayed due to a coronial inquiry and because of the complications in obtaining permission for his parents to attend.

4,4,FL-2019-000087-PAK,A glacial disaster in the making - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/838236-a-glacial-disaster-in-the-making,"On August 15, 2020, a teenage girl was killed in a remote village in Chitral as a glacial flood swept away six houses, partially damaging sixteen others and inundating standing crops of wheat and beans. Another 11 people were injured as the local police station and a post of Chitral Scouts were submerged. The glacial flood washed away a stretch of more than 500 meters of road to Baroghil valley as well.

Fast-forward to February 28, 2021 and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issues a GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) warning on the Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers in Hunza. The situation is still developing and a potential GLOF event is expected in May-June 2021 which will put the population in the downstream community of Hassanabad village at risk of glacial flooding. The Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers have a history of flash flooding. The current surge of Shishper, a 25 sq kms glacier in size, has brought its snout as close as four km from the Karakoram highway, a critical route for the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) initiative in the region.

This is the new normal in the everyday life of these remote and impoverished mountain communities. Recurring loss of life, property and livelihood due to natural catastrophes, associated primarily with the changing climate in the region, is only aggravating with every passing year. Even worse, these climatic changes are altering weather patterns in the long term, which are not properly understood by these local communities. Though climate-induced changes encompass a wide range of pressing issues, water is arguably the most essential natural resource at risk.

Pakistan is a unique place: the country hosts 7,200+ glaciers in its North, spread over approximately 17,000 sq km, which is home to the mighty Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges. It has reportedly more glacial ice than anywhere on earth outside the polar regions – hence referred to as the third pole. These glaciers feed the rivers that account for around 75 percent of the stored-water supply in a country inhabited by 212+ million people.

Ironically, Pakistan contributes less than one percent to global pollutant emissions, which ranks it among the least emitters. Yet, the country is among the most vulnerable to climate-related hazards like changing monsoon patterns, rapid glacial ice melt leading to inundation and flash flooding, avalanches, landslides and extreme heatwaves. Consequently, climate-induced migration by the local population in mountain and downstream communities of this region to save lives and to look for better livelihood opportunities is a serious challenge. This is the real evidence of the direct human cost of climate change in this part of the world.

Glaciers are a source of freshwater and vital for the ecosystem. As a consequence of climate change and global warming, several glaciers around the world are shrinking in size and gradually retreating. Depending on the volume and size of the glacial lake, temperature and precipitation, and geomorphological parameters of the terrain, mechanical failures may cause a breach in the wall of an ice or moraine-dammed glacial lake. Subsequently, a sudden discharge of millions of cubic meters of meltwater and debris can occur in a short time, with a catastrophic impact on the socioeconomic life of the downstream communities. This phenomenon is referred to as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or GLOFs.

These GLOFs are a major hazard in high altitude glaciated regions of northern Pakistan. According to a UNDP report, around 3,033 glacial lakes have been identified in this region, with at least 33 critical lakes. Many recent scientific studies are projecting an increase in the frequency of GLOFs in the wake of ongoing climate change and global warming. The government of Pakistan's ‘National Climate Change Policy’ identifies the projected recession of HKH glaciers as a major climate threat, while a key finding of the Asian Development Bank, reported in 2017, is the lack of glacier monitoring infrastructure in Pakistan.

Most of the glaciers in Pakistan are at low altitude and the settlements are near the glaciers. This makes them more vulnerable. Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, the regional programme manager for River Basins & Cryosphere at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, has emphasized that even if the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions are reduced to limit the temperature rise as envisioned in the Paris Agreement, a scenario with only a two degree Celsius could still be devastating as two-third of glaciers in the HKH would melt away!

Mitigative measures at local, national and international levels in a coherent manner are immediate imperatives. Mountain and downstream communities settled in these disaster-prone areas are unceasingly at risk and their vulnerabilities are augmented by poverty, lack of awareness about the GLOF threats, increasing pressure on natural resources, and high-risk settlement patterns. At the local level, adaptation to climate change and resilience building through specific initiatives – early warning systems, promotion of clean energy in the mountains, reducing deforestation and land-use regulation – must be enforced. In a country like Pakistan, which lacks essential infrastructure for glacier monitoring, disaster management policies, risk reduction plans, early warning systems and scientific approach and equipment to deal with the new risks and vulnerabilities arising from its natural resources, it is imperative that the international community must come forward and help.

At the moment, the government of Pakistan, through the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC), and UNDP Pakistan are implementing a $37 million project named Scaling Up of GLOF Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II), a continuation of the GLOF-I pilot project, which aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs. This project is expanding weather information surveillance by installing 50 automatic weather stations at different locations in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Though these weather stations will provide information as part of a local-level early warning system, they are limited in scope and scalability for now.

The glaciated region of HKH is vast and stretches over thousands of kilometres across several countries. This third pole necessitates more engagement of the international community through development of local infrastructure, investment in building community resilience, prevention of deforestation, reduction in GHG emissions, application of scientific approach, tools and methods in their study, risk assessment and reduction planning at the regional level, continuous monitoring and integrated analysis of the evolution of glaciers.

The recent summit by US President Biden has made some headway, but there is a real urgency for stronger climate action, limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as proposed in the Paris Agreement, helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts and discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change.

Climate change doesn’t seem to recognize our borders on land and water, and Mother Nature is ruthless when it comes to punishing. Efforts beyond borders, strategic alliances and politics are essential and only an all-inclusive approach can yield desired results.

Ayaz Younus's father Muhammad Younus and mother Maqsooda Bibi flew from Pakistan to attend the funeral for their son at Baitul Huda Mosque in Marsden Park on Wednesday.

The pair, who arrived in Australian over the weekend, were granted permission to leave quarantine to attend a prayer service and burial.

Mr Younus' three siblings were denied permission to fly from Pakistan.

The 25-year-old software engineer was on the way to his first day at a new job in Glenorie on March 24 and was on the phone to emergency services just before he died.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son's body or coffin, and were kept apart from Younus' friends due to COVID restrictions.

In a pre-recorded message broadcast in the mosque, Younus' parents spoke of their son's love for Australia, and his promise to work two jobs in order to bring his family to the country to live.

""When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,"" Mr Younus said.

""I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents.

""I wished we could have hugged him once more.

""But alas, it didn't happen.

""Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.

""We all belong to God Almighty and we all shall return to him.""

Later, the pair were confined to a car for their son's burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window.

Mr Younus was only briefly allowed outside the car to shovel some sand on his son's coffin.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed by a coronial inquiry and because of the complications involved getting permission for his family to attend.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

Hamad Chaudhry remembered Mr Younus as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the city’s outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.

Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency.

It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.

Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the country’s largest city.

According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachi’s rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.

The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.

Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.

Fallen power lines caused widespread electrical outages, adding misery to the lives of many of the city’s 15 million residents. Some workers stayed at their offices while others spent the night in open areas because there was no public transport to get home in many parts of the city.

Hundreds of vehicles were dragged along the streets by powerful flood waters.

At least eight people were killed when a wall fell on them in a residential area. The victims included children who were playing at the time. Other casualties were also reported in various parts of Karachi in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from rain-related incidents to more than 40 in recent weeks.

8,8,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Pakistan slum dwellers map flood risks to stop evictions - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210412075730-4tzvi/,"Mapping of informal settlements is key to protecting residents from worsening climate change impacts with as little disruption as possible, urban experts say

By Rina Chandran

April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in the Pakistani city of Karachi have stopped the demolition of thousands of homes by mapping flood risks from clogged drains, offering a feasible solution to other informal settlements facing climate change impacts, urban experts said.

After unexpectedly heavy rains flooded much of Karachi last year, authorities said some slum settlements would be removed to allow drains to be widened, with hundreds of homes in Manzoor Colony settlement earmarked for demolition.

Residents, who had always insisted that the flooding was mainly caused by drains blocked with rubbish and sludge, teamed up with non-profit organisations to map the drainage network.

""They generated their own evidence to uncover the reasons – overlooked by authorities – why Karachi floods,"" said Arif Hasan, an architect and planner who backed the mapping project.

""The communities believed that if these obstructions are removed and the drains are cleaned and maintained, flooding will not take place,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

About 12 million people out of Karachi's 16 million population live in informal settlements, and are increasingly vulnerable as Pakistan's largest city faces worsening inundations as the South Asian monsoon brings extreme weather.

Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, has a network of 550 stormwater drains that criss-cross the city and empty into the Arabian Sea. Many are blocked by illegal construction and waste.

Authorities say they clean out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide funds. The unusually heavy rains killed dozens, submerged main roads and inundated hundreds of homes.

To map Manzoor Colony's drains, a team from the non-profit Technical Training Resource Center (TTRC) walked along them with residents, photographing, marking and mapping more than a dozen blockages.

Their map showed only about 40 houses needed to be removed to leave the drains clear, said Mohammad Sirajuddin, head of TTRC, who led the mapping project.

""The authorities said thousands of houses would need to be demolished, but our maps showed otherwise,"" he said.

In November, residents successfully halted the planned demolitions in Manzoor Colony.

While it is not certain whether authorities will use the community's flood risk map in the future, the residents now know where the choke points are and how they can tackle the dangers, Sirajuddin said.

Two other informal settlements in Karachi are being mapped, with residents - especially young people - trained, he said, adding that the model can be replicated across the country.

These maps also generate crucial data on households, said Nausheen Anwar, director of Karachi Urban Lab, a think-tank.

""The maps provide a process through which consensus can be built and inclusion of all residents can be negotiated to stave off evictions and establish a basis for just compensation and resettlement,"" she said.

By 2030, more than half of Pakistan's projected 250 million population are expected to live in cities, compared to 36% now, according to the United Nations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had pledged to build 5 million affordable homes within five years to address a chronic shortage, with housing rights groups warning that poorer residents face evictions as pressure on land increases.

""When youths in the settlements are trained in mapping, they better understand the risks they face,"" said TTRC's Sirajuddin.

""They understand their rights, and can fight evictions.""

9,9,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Qatar LNG Plans To Flood World Market – gCaptain - gcaptain.com - gcaptain.com,https://gcaptain.com/qatar-lng-world-market-exports/,"By Anna Shiryaevskaya (Bloomberg) The world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas is ramping up production dramatically and undercutting competitors in a bid to squeeze them out the market.

Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. It’s also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the country’s sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, it’s falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

“Qatar’s expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options,” said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. “It’s still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.”

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatar’s monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the world’s top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatar’s hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatar’s main advantage is that it has the world’s lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Bonds Coming

Qatar’s state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

That’s enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

“Nobody can compete with Qatari costs,” said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. “They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competition’s profits.”

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatar’s Ministry of Energy and QP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when it’s burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

We’re Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russia’s Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said it’s unperturbed by Qatar’s moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing that’s not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

“We’re not afraid,” Cheniere’s Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. “We’re part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.”

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably won’t secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatar’s wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. “Our expansion is very timely,” he said.

“The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink,” OIES’s Stern said. “It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.”

“The windows broke and the door caved in, that’s how intense the water pressure was,” he said of the first night of torrential monsoon rain in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, last week.

“We didn’t even try to take the water out of the house. I just tied my rickshaw [to a pole] as tightly as I could and my family and I [got on] the rooftop.”

Ahmed, his wife and children spent more than 10 hours on that roof, in the pouring rain, as Karachi saw more than 230mm of rainfall in less than 12 hours, the most ever recorded, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed and thousands of homes washed away in flooding across the country, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) (PDF).

We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started. Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper

Karachi, a sprawling metropolis of more than 20 million people, was one of the worst-hit by the urban flooding. Streets turned to rivers, as the sheer volume of water quickly overloaded the city’s dilapidated and ill-maintained drainage systems.

In Ahmed’s working-class neighbourhood of Yousuf Goth, a video taken after the rains showed water flowing through the streets, mixing with sewage and solid waste, as residents waded through it to salvage what they can from their homes.

“What we need most right now is clean drinking water and vegetables. You can’t make a meal out of oil or just packets [of dry food],” said Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood.

Muhammad Rashid, 29, a construction worker, said his family was trapped at home, but he had to wade through the sewage periodically to try and find drinking water.

“The only thing I left the house for was water,” he said. “We slept without food on the first night. We were safe on our roof, but I kept leaving in the five feet of water just to get [drinking] water.”

The city’s main thoroughfares did not cope much better, submerged under several feet of water, leaving cars stranded or washed away in the flow. Desperate residents took to contracting agricultural tractors to try and winch their vehicles out.

Electricity supply across the city failed, or was pre-emptively cut, almost immediately, as the city’s main utility company reported its substations were being flooded. The pre-emptive cuts were aimed at limiting deaths due to electrocution if exposed wires were to come into contact with water in the streets.

Right now, it's like kicking a dead horse. They just don't have the capacity for it. Farhan Anwar, urban planner

At least six people died as a result of such electrocutions, hospital officials told Al Jazeera.

Ahmed said he had to take the risk to move his family after 48 hours spent on their rooftop without electricity, water or natural gas to cook with.

“I was worried about the [electricity] current in the waters, but when the choice is between certain death by starvation or possibly electrocution, what could I do?”

‘Governance system failure’

As the rains now begin to subside, the hard work of cleaning up the debris and rebuilding will begin. In a city as divided and administratively “broken” as Karachi, however, urban planners and researchers said that will be easier said than done.

“It is an overall governance system failure,” said Farhan Anwar, an urban planner and faculty member at Karachi’s Habib University. “You can’t isolate a particular cause for it [because] we have, over the years, allowed the city to develop and grow without planning or regulation or a framework.”

Anwar said the city was “on its knees” after the rains, and that its institutions, plagued by decades of mismanagement, a lack of planning and political contestation, simply do not have the capacity to deal with the situation.

‘I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,’ said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amid the wreckage of his store [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“These institutions of governance that are responsible for maintaining services, whether it is water, solid waste management, land, transportation or sewage, they are all totally bankrupt,” he said.

“Right now, it’s like kicking a dead horse. They just don’t have the capacity for it.”

One of the reasons for this, Anwar and others told Al Jazeera, is the complex nature of Karachi’s administrative setup. The city is administered by more than a dozen land-owning civic agencies, all of which work independently and are not beholden to a single set of policies.

The city has a mayor, elected in 2016, but he said he only controls 12 percent of the city’s overall area.

A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture Haris Gazdar, researcher

The rest of the city is managed by a mix of federal and provincial government-controlled landholding bodies, cooperative housing societies, the port authority, the railways department, industrial area authorities and military-run cantonments (PDF).

This situation, Anwar argued, has “straitjacketed” growth and development in Karachi.

“Various agencies have control over resources and management and there is no collaboration or coordination between them … Everyone is on their own.”

As political parties play out their contestations over civic institutions, analysts said, it has left most bankrupt.

“The confrontation between the Pakistan People’s Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement over the years has resulted in a tug of war that is played out within these institutions,” said Anwar.

Nazish Brohi, a social sector researcher, says Karachi’s history of violence – it was the site of brutal political violence through the 1990s and again from 2008 onwards – means there is a high price associated with any kind of reform.

“Because Karachi has been so volatile, in terms of conflict and violence in the past, no one wants to disturb the equilibrium,” she said. “The minute someone intervenes, there is fear of a conflagration.”

In 2012, Karachi was the world’s most dangerous megacity, with a homicide rate far higher than any other city of its size, as the battle for power in the city, rooted in ethnic and identity-based politics, played itself out on the city’s streets.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

A military operation targeting the MQM party, which was held responsible for much of the violence, has since reduced the number of violent deaths in the city considerably, although critics said the operation itself involved a large number of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

The scars of that violence can affect everything, even the rebuilding of the city’s drainage system, argues Brohi. She gives the example of the need to clear the city’s drainage channels of illegally built structures that have blocked them.



“The drainage channels are choked right now, and those encroachments obviously need to be cleared,” she said. “But when the city is undergirded by an ethnic grid, then questions of which drainage channel you touch first can lead to a conflagration.”

The worst-hit area

One of the largest landholding bodies in Karachi is the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), a civic authority run by the country’s powerful military that controls 5 percent of urban Karachi’s land (PDF).

This week, hundreds of residents protested outside the offices DHA’s sister body, the Clifton Cantonment Board (CCB), demanding authorities do more to drain water that had been standing in their streets and homes for days.

In a statement, DHA said its staff was “working round the clock to bring life back to normal”, adding that it would work with the protesters to address the concerns of residents.

A day later, it also registered police charges against protest organisers for “rioting [while] armed with a deadly weapon” at the angry, but peaceful protest.

The area, one of the richest in Karachi, was surprisingly some of the worst-hit, with many neighbourhoods remaining inundated a week after the worst of the rains. Video footage shared with Al Jazeera showed residents complaining of flooded roads and basements, with many forced to sleep on rooftops on in stairwells.

For the city’s urban poor, the situation has been even worse.

“A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture,” said Haris Gazdar, senior researcher at the Collective for Social Science Research. “And if you are even poorer than that, you have no assets other than maybe your [food] ration that you had stored up.”

“We live from hand to mouth and it was the end of the month,” says Kulsoom Bibi, a housekeeper in the Mehmoodabad neighbourhood. “For two days, neither my sister nor I could get out because to [leave] the … tunnel was filled to the brim.”

The impact of the floods is also continuing for many, as their livelihoods or businesses have been decimated by the water.

“How will patients reach me? They can’t. I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,” said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amidst the wreckage of his store.

Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper, returned home after having moved to a relative’s home in a drier neighbourhood for a few days.

“It’s been 12 days since we had proper electricity,” he said. “We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started.”

Climate change

On Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan directed authorities to prepare a plan within a week to reform Karachi’s administrative systems.

Experts, however, scoffed at the idea that anything will change on the ground unless the underlying political contestation and other issues are not addressed.

“It’s not that the city has not been planned for,” said Anwar, the urban planner. “There are so many plans, so many master plans, it’s just a matter of implementation and political consensus existing, and a level of sincerity of how you want to do it.”

For Gazdar, fixing Karachi’s problems goes beyond bureaucratic reshuffles – it requires both a fundamental reorganisation of administrative authority, and a clear focus on climate change.

“Flooding happens everywhere, even in cities in very advanced countries – they also suffer flooding and droughts and fires and so on,” he said.

“A lot of it is a failure to detect what the planet is trying to tell us. If you look at a global picture of the planet, [this is] a failure of the way we live our lives.”

In recent years, Karachi, and the Sindh province of which it is a part, has seen increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, leading to periods of drought and flood, and rainfall intensity changes that have badly affected agricultural practices that have stood in place for centuries.

Asked if he believes any of this will change, however, Gazdar laughs.

“What will happen in the coming weeks is that some other issue will take the spotlight,” he says. “Seven days is a nice period of time, because on the seventh day something else would have happened somewhere else in the country, and that needs another seven days, and before you know it another 70 years will go by.”

12,12,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Extreme Monsoon Rains in Pakistan - nasa.gov - nasa.gov,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147330/extreme-monsoon-rains-in-pakistan,"A heavy monsoon season has caused fatal flooding across Pakistan in 2020. More than 400 people have died since mid-June; another 400 were injured; and more than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

The Sindh province in southeastern Pakistan, which received historic amounts of rain, has been the most affected region. The images above show a portion of Sindh on (September 21, 2020) compared to the same time last year (September 21, 2019). The false-color images, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite, use a combination of infrared and visible light (bands 7-2-1) to make it easier to see the boundary between water and land. Water appears navy blue and black; vegetation is bright green.

Sindh was hit by sporadic heavy rains in July and experienced record-breaking rainfall in August. Karachi, the provincial capital and country’s most populous city, recorded the most August rainfall in 89 years of record keeping. Karachi received around 490 millimeters (19 inches) of rain for the month—more than 200 millimeters occurred within twelve hours. According to news reports, some of the urban flooding was the result of clogged stormwater drains.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported heavy rains in late August in other parts of the province, affecting the districts of Mirpur Khas, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Larkana. The Karachi, Hyderbad, and Mirpur Khas districts were declared “calamity-affected areas.” More than 2 million people across Sindh Province have been affected by monsoon rains this year, with 68,000 residents displaced in relief camps.

The government also reported that nearly one million acres of crops have also been destroyed by the flooding. Fields of cotton, vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and sugarcane have been affected.

Monsoon season generally lasts from mid-June through September. As of September 24, the PMD reported normal flow along the Indus and several other key rivers in the country.

13,13,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"As parts of Pakistan ban water-guzzling paddy, one farmer has a solution - Scroll.in",https://scroll.in/article/994235/as-parts-of-pakistan-ban-water-guzzling-paddy-one-farmer-has-a-solution,"The season for sowing paddy is about to kick off in Sindh. But the province in southeast Pakistan has banned rice cultivation in 10 districts on the left bank of the Indus river.

This ban is announced every year at the end of April or early May to limit the waterlogging, salinity and drought-like conditions caused by successive rice farming. By some accounts, rice cultivation has been banned in these areas for over 90 years. Similarly, the Indian government bans paddy cultivation in “dark zones” to help water aquifers.

“Dark zones” are areas of acute overexploitation of groundwater, due to the use of water exceeding its recharge. But these orders fall on deaf ears, as rice cultivation continues in large swathes of farmland in both countries.

Rasheed Channa, the spokesperson for Sindh’s chief minister, said this time will be different. The government is “dead serious” about penalising those who violate the ban, Channa said. District administrations have already been told to be on the lookout for nurseries and “raze the seedlings before they can be transplanted” to flooded fields.

The news sparked considerable anger within the farming community, with farmers saying the government’s timing and thought process were poor.

“The growers were informed just a month before sowing that paddy will not be allowed,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, senior vice-president of the Sindh Abadgar Board, an organisation formed to protect the rights of farmers in the province. “They had not prepared land or bought seeds to grow an alternative crop.”

Policymakers must realise that switching crops on more than 40,000 hectares after the season for other crops has passed is “almost impossible”, he added.

“Even if 20,000 acres [8,000 hectares] are suddenly cultivated for other crops, where will we get buyers from? The prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits will fall,” he pointed out.

Rice and water

While fears for livelihoods are valid, the ban underscores the government’s growing concerns about water scarcity. The chief minister, who is a progressive farmer himself, said one kilogramme of rice requires up to 3,000 litres of water. Officials said water standing in rice farms for long periods of time has caused waterlogging, and that the high-delta crop also uses up other crops’ share of water for irrigation. Low-delta crops need comparatively less water.

As Pakistan grapples with increased glacial melt and erratic rainfall, managing the canal-fed, water-intensive rice crop is yet another problem. The issue is exacerbated by high demand and the fact that rice generates 8% of Pakistan’s income from exports.

Zahid Bhurgri, general secretary of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a lobbying group for farmers, agrees that rice causes waterlogging and soil destruction. But he also said it is “safe”.

“It is considered a safer bet, especially as we confront climate change [because of which] too much or too little water can destroy other delicate crops, like cotton,” Bhurgri said. He added that rice is an easier crop to grow as it “requires nothing but to be submerged in three to four inches of water”.

Justifying rice ban

“There will be 30% less water this year,” said Sindh’s agriculture minister, Ismail Rahu, to The Third Pole, justifying the ban on the “water guzzler”.

Though Rahu acknowledges that “rice is the bread and butter of hundreds of farmers”, he suggested they cultivate low-delta crops, such as beans, melon and vegetables, as they are less water-intensive and detrimental to the soil.

In many of these districts, the water that is available is of poor quality.

Zarif Khero, the chief engineer at Sindh’s Irrigation Department, said the most important consideration is soil fertility, which is spoilt by rice.

“The way [rice cultivation] is done by flooding the fields causes waterlogging, which will eventually turn the soil into wasteland,” he said.

Finding alternatives

Rafique Suleman, a spokesperson for trade body the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, sees the ban as nothing short of an “atrocity”.

“Instead of providing incentives to grow more, the government is taking away our livelihood,” he said. He pointed out that rice, Pakistan’s second-biggest export after textiles, annually brings in around $2.5 billion into the country.

There is similar resistance in India. Despite depleting groundwater in paddy farming areas, farmers do not give up rice because of assured buying from the states of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana.

The only way out, some say, is to give farmers incentives to grow something else.

Farmer with solution

This is where Asif Sharif, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan in Pakistan’s Punjab province, comes in. Sharif, an online sensation within the South Asian farming community, has a solution: if the rice has to be grown, it should happen without flood irrigation. According to him, the rice plant uses 70% of its energy just to survive the inundation.

“Rice can be grown with minimal water,” said the 70-year-old. He added that the ban in parts of Sindh is “unnecessary”.

“Give it less water and the yield will be three to four times more,” he said, adding that the soil should be kept reasonably moist.

Sharif grows a variety of crops on his 200 hectares of land and has thousands of farmers listening to his every word. He engages with the virtual community and gives advice to people from across the globe.

He has more than 24,000 followers, mostly farmers, including quite a few from Punjab on the Indian side. They share videos on his Facebook page, titled Pedaver, showing how well their crops are doing after they follow his tips.

Sharif said, “everything can be grown anywhere”.

He advocates for farmers to return to doing cultivation on raised beds, without tilling and using organic mulch. Paradoxical agriculture, or “paedar qudrati nizam kashtkari” as he calls it, is a “comprehensive climate-smart production process total solution”.

“The process took several years to develop and mature,” said Sharif. “I started with the System of Rice Intensification in 2008. Then merged the crop system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Conservation Agriculture by 2011. This is how the process evolved by 2014.”

The results are impressive. “In Punjab, we have reduced the production cost of wheat from 1,500 Pakistani rupees to 400 Pakistani rupees per 40 kg,” he claimed.

And yet, he has been unable to bring about a revolution. He faults the farm munshi or manager for thwarting development. “They get huge kickbacks by creating demand for each input that increases the cost of production,” he said.

Farmers with huge landholdings are also to blame, he said. “In connivance with corporations and businesses, they keep the rural population deprived of knowledge and therefore, prosperity,” he said.

He talked of the need for a “crop production management company” that travels to different farmlands, teaching farmers how to grow certified crops that are exportable.

Zarif Khero from Sindh’s Irrigation Department supported the idea of training. “Farmers should engage with students from agricultural universities so they can transition to modern methods of sustainable farming which can result in better yields,” he suggested.

14,14,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Pakistan: Post-disaster recovery transition lessons from the 2010 floods - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77313,"Source(s): Climate Adaptation Platform (CAP)



In 2010 severe flooding hit Pakistan, inundating about 37 thousand square kilometres of the nation’s area.

Over 20 million people were affected; the number is higher than those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2005 Cyclone Katrina, or the 2008 cyclone Nargis in Myanmar.

The total loss from these massive floods totalled US$10.4 billion, or 5.7% of Pakistan’s GDP. After the flooding event, the rescue and relief activities lasted up to 8 months, which began in July 2010 until the end of March 2011.

Sindh province was one of the most affected by this event; out of the 20 million affected, 7.3 million residents were from the Sindh province. Sadly for them, the post-recovery after this unprecedented flood stopped at the rescue and relief phase.

According to the study, there was no recovery and reconstruction authority established in the province after the flooding incident – a task that belongs to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Although the institution was lauded for its well-coordinated emergency phase efforts, the recovery and reconstruction phase efforts were missing in the province.

Using Pakistan’s worst flooding in 2010 as a case study, researchers examined the disaster recovery activities after the flood. They highlighted the factors that hinder the transitions to recovery phases in Pakistan, which may also be true in other developing countries.

The three Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) phases in the study are the following –

relief phase, which is meeting the most immediate needs of the community following a disaster, rehabilitation phase or the restoration of basic service and facilities to make communities and societies function; this includes providing temporary housing or shelter, mass feeding, treatment of the injured etc. and lastly, the recovery phase is also termed as the long-term phase wherein major reconstruction, development, and capacity building through structural or non-structural measures occur.

Other PDR phase model like the one proposed by Haast and others shows 4 overlapping phases – emergency, restoration, reconstruction 1, and reconstruction 2, which is similar to the UNDRR model. These PDR models are thoroughly discussed in the study.

According to the study, the Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) in developing countries is limited to the relief and rescue operations, thus failing to transition to subsequent phases like rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery, leading to a full and long-term recovery of a community.

The study finds that the post-disaster recovery in Sindh after the 2010 floods failed to transition to the long-term recovery phase.

The factors that hindered these transitions include the following:

The lack of community-level involvement – the state and relevant institutions failed to place communities at the centre of the recovery process,

Inadequate coping capacity, resource and skills of both the community and local administration which will impede their long-term recovery actions,

Absence of any recovery and reconstruction authority after the flood

No coherence or coordination in the PDR activities among stakeholders led to confusion between stakeholders and hindered the smooth transition of recovery, and

Lack of information and data among local administration and stakeholders led to politically motivating projects and aid distributions.

Through a better understanding of the smooth transition of the various phases of the PDR, the study can help policymakers and disaster management practitioners plan and implement effective PDR strategies, especially in developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate-related and natural disasters.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,"['longterm', 'postdisaster', 'relief', 'lessons', 'pakistan', 'recovery', '2010', 'pdr', 'reconstruction', 'flooding', 'study', 'floods', 'phases', 'transition', 'phase']", ,flood

Taus Bibi, 70, was tending to her goats in Sherabad, an area in Hassanabad, Hunza, when she heard a loud sound of something crashing into the nearby water channel. One of her grandchildren followed shortly, running and asking her to evacuate to a safe area as a flood was dangerously close to their home. Taus had no choice but to run to a nearby orchard where she and other people displaced by the flood spent over 35 hours.

Hassanabad also had one of the major power stations for the district of Hunza, which was also wiped out, depriving the villagers of electricity for many days. Such floods, resulting from glacial lake outbursts have been hitting the village of Hassanabad, (which includes Sherabad, Harum, Roshanabad and main Hassanabad) since 2010. Out of all the surging glaciers in the Karakorum Range, the Shisper Glacier is 12 kms long and has been impacting the most lives in the Hassanabad region.

Melted glacier water can form ice walls, which end up creating reservoirs for the rest of the melted ice. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) occur when these ice walls fail, unleashing entire lakes on nearby villages and roads. There are at least 7,000 glaciers in Gilgit Baltistan out of which 3,044 have formed glacial lakes while 33 are at the risk of outburst flooding. Such floods, if not mitigated, threaten at least seven million people in both Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In March 2017, in order to prevent large scale flooding, a project was started to scale up the lakes that were at the risk of bursting. The Ministry of Climate Change has been leading the project along with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and funding from the Green Climate Fund. The Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II) project is a part of ‘Reducing Risks and Vulnerabilities from GLOF in Northern Pakistan’, also known as GLOF I.

The Shisper Glacier is melting again with the advent of summer in Pakistan and despite the efforts by GLOF I, at least 21 households in Hassanabad have been deemed at risk and families have been asked to evacuate to safer locations while the Gilgit Baltistan administration has declared a state of emergency in the surrounding areas. Teams from both GLOF and the Pakistan Meteorological Department are keeping a close eye on the lake using ground penetrating radars and Differential GPS. Water levels are also being monitored. An automatic weather station has also been installed in Shisper to monitor the weather in real time.

Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committees (CBDRMC) have been formed by training locals in disaster risk reduction, they have also undergone mock drills while being trained in disaster preparedness.

It has been decided that the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) in collaboration with GLOF II will build gabion walls to protect the population in case of a flood, while irrigation channels are also on the cards along with building of shelters, where people may run to in case there is a disaster.

Emergency response equipment has also been handed out to the locals, which include generators, UPS batteries, inverters, binoculars, walkie talkies, GPS, gas cylinders, portal generators, cyber shot cameras, range finders and small solar panels.

Despite these measures, the locals stay fearful, as disaster management is not as good as living disaster free. They are waiting for permanent solutions, such as migration options to safer places that are not in the path of GLOFs, however, with the very real threat of climate change, it is only a matter of time before we have a lot more than just one village and glacier to think about.","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0/Sherabad-Hassanabd1619786872-0.jpg,"['shisper', 'climate', 'gilgit', 'disasters', 'change', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'risk', 'hassanabad', 'water', 'glofs', 'baltistan', 'impending', 'disaster', 'glof']", ,flood

According to WFP, the floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season. The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

18,18,FL-2019-000087-PAK,May 21: a day of special significance for China and Pakistan - Daily Times,https://dailytimes.com.pk/758734/may-21-a-day-of-special-significance-for-china-and-pakistan/,"May 21, 2021 is a day of special significance for the People’s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As the Chinese old saying goes, “Even mountains and seas cannot distance people with common aspirations.” 70 years ago, China and Pakistan joined hands overpass the Karakoram Mountains to formally establish diplomatic relations. The past 70 years have witnessed the two countries sharing weal and woe. The time-tested China-Pakistan friendship now sets exemplary for state-to-state relations, and is strategic asset for both countries, most dearly cherished by the two peoples.

Similar histories brought us close to each other. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries and have similar experiences in getting rid of foreign aggression and seeking independence. At such critical times, be it when New China endeavored to break the external blockade and open up a new prospect for diplomacy, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other.

Similar ideas guide us stand shoulder to shoulder. China and Pakistan are the backbones in maintaining regional peace and stability. The two countries firmly defend multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation, commit to improving the global governance system, and support increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. China and Pakistan always respect the diversity of civilizations, and advocate the vision of exchanges rather than estrangement, mutual learning rather than conflict, and coexistence rather than seeking superiority.

Common interests deepen our cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative. 46 projects have been completed or under construction, with a total investment of US$25.4 billion. The CPEC successfully helped Pakistan solve the power shortage that has plagued it for decades, established the main traffic line from north to south, and revitalized Gwadar Port to become a regional trade hub. China has been Pakistan’s largest trading partner for six consecutive years and largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years.

The tests of crisis reconfirms our common choice. The two peoples are always the first to lend a helping hand to each other when the other side is in trouble. When Wenchuan earthquake hit China in 2008, and when flood plagued Pakistan in 2010, both sides supported each other with full efforts. After the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the governments, armies and all walks of life of the two countries have rendered mutual assistance, and carried out close cooperation in fields of emergency supplies, Covid-19 prevention experiences-sharing, vaccine research and development, thus setting a model for international cooperation against the pandemic.

2021 is a year of great significance for both China and Pakistan. China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and is implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan to embark on a new journey of modernization. Pakistan is making every effort to develop its economy and realize the Naya Pakistan vision proposed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, providing us with new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation. Standing at a new historic starting point, the two countries should further implement the important consensus reached by our leaders, continue to deepen the iron-clad friendship between China and Pakistan, and jointly build a closer China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future in the New Era.

China will continue to put Pakistan on the top agenda of its diplomacy, and firmly support Pakistan to maintain sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and exert a greater constructive role in international and regional affairs. We will continue to provide Pakistan support of medical supplies and vaccines within our capacity until Pakistan completely defeats the pandemic. Following the principle of mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, opening-up and inclusiveness, China will work with Pakistan to boost high-quality development of the CPEC, focus more on industry, agriculture, science and technology and people’s livelihood, so as to develop Pakistan’s manufacturing industry and increase employment and income of its people. China will continue to work closely with Pakistan to deepen the friendship between the two peoples, especially the young generation. We will endeavor to carry forward the China-Pakistan iron-clad friendship for another 70 years, enhancing the all-weather friendship and all-dimensional cooperation, and work together to uplift China-Pakistan bilateral relations to a new level with a brighter future.

Last but not the least, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Pakistan, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and great respect to Pakistani friends from all circles who care about and support the development of our bilateral relations.

(Str/Xinhua/IANS)

Even as the country’s financial capital Karachi battles intense monsoon flood, experts have warned that Pakistan lacks modern weather forecast radars for timely prediction of flooding. Over the last one week, intense monsoon downpour over Karachi has plagued the city with waterlogging, flash floods and power cuts.

Karachi recorded a whopping 230 mm rainfall in a single day on August 27, making this August the wettest August in 89 years. Overall, at least 39 people have been killed so far in several parts of the country this week.

Monsoon death toll spike to 134

The death toll from rain-related incidents across Pakistan has increased to 134, the country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report.

Sharing the data of casualties from June 15 to August 29 on its website, the NDMA said on Saturday that rescue and relief operations were being carried out in the affected areas by concerned departments of the government, army and non-governmental organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst hit where 48 people were killed and 42 others injured, the authority said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah told a press conference on Friday that 80 people were killed in rains in the province with 47 fatalities in provincial capital Karachi alone.

He said 604-mm rainfall was recorded in Karachi during August, breaking the years-long record of heavy rains in the city during the month. The torrential rains have caused a disastrous situation in Balochistan province where scores were left homeless after their houses were swept away by flash floods triggered off by lashing rains.

The NDMA has provided tents, food items, blankets, mosquito nets, among others, in the affected areas. The authority said scattered thunderstorms and rain with isolated heavy falls are also expected in parts of the country on Sunday. More rainfall is expected later next week.

This year, the meteorological department forecast more than usual rains during the ongoing monsoon season and concerned departments have issued advisories for the general public to take self-precautionary measures.

Pakistan lacks modern flood warning system

Advertisement Despite the annual devastation caused by urban flooding in cities and flash floods in the mountainous areas of Pakistan, the country has neither an effective telemetry system nor authorities said. The monsoon winds are the major source of downpour in the country during the months of July-September.

""The country still does not have an effective aviation system to deal with flood disasters and other catastrophes,"" the National Monsoon Contingency Plan 2020 compiled by the Natural Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed on Saturday.

According to the plan, Pakistan has a medium and long term forecast system capable of accurately predicting the weather for a period of only 7 to 15 days while the seasonal weather forecast accuracy rate is also not more than 65-70 per cent, The Express Tribune reported.

The report indicated that the country is relying on old technology for the weather forecast, which makes it difficult to create standard and accurate atmospheric predictions. There is no telemetry system for flash flood warning in the mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Balochistan.

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Flash floods triggered by heavy rains killed 15 people and damaged scores of houses in Pakistan's scenic northwestern Swat Valley, a spokesman said Wednesday, as rescuers assisted residents in the port city of Karachi where last week's rains wreaked havoc that killed dozens.

The latest floods-related fatalities were reported from the Swat region, a popular tourist destination where landslides overnight blocked a key mountain road, stranding scores of tourists who were being evacuated, said Taimur Khan, spokesman for a disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy monsoon rains hit parts of Pakistan last month, triggering flash floods in the country's financial capital of Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, killing at least 47 people there. Since June, when rains began lashing Pakistan, at least 176 people have been killed across the country, according to the national disaster management agency.

Last week, Karachi's many neighborhoods were flooded and water is still being pump out from submerged streets.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was expected to visit Karachi to meet with residents and get a briefing about damages caused by the monsoon rains, which came as authorities have been trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 296,000 people and killed 6,318 since February.

Pakistan reported 18 more deaths on Wednesday from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

For several kilometres and pretty much as far as the eye could see, there were temporary camps for the flood-affected, dispossessed communities, with families living in hastily erected shelters on the roadside.

Some 136 people have been reported dead and thousands have been displaced in this year’s monsoon season, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The United Nations World Food Programme has reached 11,000 people with emergency food assistance and is calling for $500,000 (£400,000) to increase its reach, particularly in the Sindh region—up to 300,000 people are in need of food assistance.

For some towns and villages, such as the ones in Mirpurkhas district, we had to travel by motorboat to reach the area. Villagers there told us that they hadn’t seen any outsiders ever since the floods devastated their homes and that all their crops were now gone and possessions lost; no more houses, and nothing to eat.

Working closely with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in Sindh, the World Food Programme has provided them with food rations — flour, pulses, cooking oil, and nutritious edibles for children to prevent malnutrition from setting in.

By Rina Saeed Khan

ISLAMABAD, Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Flood-slammed Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, could face worsening urban inundations in coming years, in part as the South Asian monsoon shifts, climate scientists have warned.

The winds that drive Pakistan's annual monsoon, which arrives from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, appear to be altering as a result of climate change, which could push more rainfall to Karachi - and less to key agricultural regions, they said.

""It's new phenomenon and we need to understand it. It hasn't rained like this in Karachi for more than half a century,"" said Shaukat Ali, a meteorologist and senior scientific officer at the Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad.

He said winds driving the monsoon from the Bay of Bengal appear to be shifting it northwards, away from its traditional core zone in the agricultural breadbasket of Punjab.

Winds from the Arabian Sea have traditionally been weak but now seem to be strengthening, Ali said.

This year monsoon winds were ""extremely erratic"", he said, with hotter temperatures in the Arabian Sea leading to monsoon depressions that dumped unexpectedly heavy rainfall on an unprepared Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.

""The sea and winds behaved very differently this monsoon,"" he noted.

RECORD RAINS

Record-breaking heavy rain in Karachi in August killed over 100 people and disrupted the lives of many of the city's more than 15 million residents as water flooded main roads and homes.

The city received its largest-ever-recorded rainfall total in a single day on August 24, when 230 mm (9 inches) of rain fall in just 12 hours, according to the Pakistan Meteorology Department.

Over the month, Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) of rain, the highest total in at least 90 years, it noted.

Heavier rainfall in Karachi this year was in part the result of a La Nina phenomenon, a regular oscillation in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can drive changes in rainfall, said Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

It was likely the larger driver of this year's shift in rainfall, he said.

But as climate change warms oceans, it is also accelerating evaporation of water, which then falls as rain - one significant additional driver of Karachi's floods, he said.

Both scientists have been part of a research effort through GCISC to better predict extreme weather in South Asia and help countries adapt to it.

A paper published by Ashfaq and a dozen international researchers in June, in the journal Climate Dynamics, predicted that unchecked climate-changing emissions could shorten Asian monsoons, with more intense rain falling in a shorter period.

The rest of the year would then have longer dry periods, it said.

These extremes could worsen floods, droughts, wildfires and other weather-related threats that already pose a problem in the region, the scientists said.

CAPTURING WATER

Malik Amin Aslam, the Pakistan prime minister's special assistant on climate change, said the reports indicate the ""frequency and intensity of climate-triggered freak events is going up in Pakistan"".

That was likely to affect not just urban communities but farmers, he said.

""The timing of rains is radically shifting without allowing an agriculture adaptation to adjust to the new reality,"" he said. In a recent trip to Pakistan's mountainous north, he said, he had seen how the shifting South Asian monsoon was accelerating glacier melt, while Karachi and Sindh province's coast were receiving heavy rains that once fell out at sea.

He said Sindh is one of the most climate-impacted regions of the country, with worsening heatwaves also making life difficult for residents.

To deal with increasing extreme rainfall and glacier melt, he said, the country needed to find ways to capture and store ""the huge amounts of water which are becoming available"" in order to recharge aquifers and provide water in dry periods.

Ashfaq agreed that more reservoirs and dams were needed to store water and for flood control. Cities and towns also needed to adapt their infrastructure for extreme rainfall events and move homes away from riverbanks, he said.

Ayaz Younus, 25, died on the way to his first day at a new job when his car became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on March 24.

The Australian resident was the first victim of the floods that ravaged parts of Sydney's west, and had been on the phone to emergency services before he died.

He was a software engineer who had recently completed his masters degree. He was to start his job as a driver for a multinational company.

The funeral for Mr Younus was delayed because of a coronial inquiry as well as efforts to have his family attend the funeral from Pakistan.

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia has helped pay for the family's travel, accommodation and funeral costs.

It said a request for Mr Younus' three siblings to fly from Pakistan had been denied by the Australian government.

His parents arrived in Australia on Sunday and immediately went into quarantine.

The association said the man's parents had been given an exemption by the Australian government to attend part of the funeral, and it hoped it could negotiate for the parents to be able to attend the burial site.

Hamad Chaudhry, who knew Mr Younus through the association, remembers him as a keen sportsman who was very involved with the community.

""Ayaz was a very happy and friendly person who loved his sport and was extremely community-minded. He is deeply missed,"" Mr Chaudhry told AAP.

""It's been very important to help get his parents out to Australia, and his siblings will be watching the funeral virtually.""

Mr Younus is remembered as an active volunteer, planting trees in his community in western Sydney and donating his time to various charities.

A prayer service for the engineering graduate will be held at Marsden Park on Wednesday. He will be buried at Riverstone Cemetery.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-2746618/51058343169e0d3da522b053d9423f7242675093-16x9-x0y75w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1200,"['younus', 'funeral', 'parents', 'died', 'australian', 'australia', 'floods', 'west', 'man', 'sydneys', 'mr', 'attend', 'association', 'nsw']", ,flood

In Afghanistan, the number of victims is expected to rise as rescue teams try and locate people buried under destroyed homes, according to a spokeswoman for northern Parwan province.

Wahida Shahkar said at least 66 people had been killed and 90 were injured in her province alone.

Several children are among the dead and some of those who are injured are in a critical condition, the head of the provincial hospital, Abdul Qasim Sangin, said.

Flooding began in the central part of the province overnight following heavy rains and destroyed many homes.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Pakistan, the military said it would deploy rescue helicopters to the city of Karachi to transport some 200 families to safety after canal waters flooded the city during monsoon rains.

A total of 90 people have died in rain-related incidents across Pakistan since Sunday, the country's national disaster management agency said.

While heavy rain has lashed many parts of Pakistan, the southern port city of Karachi has been the hardest hit, with streets flooded with sewage water.

Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has ordered aid to be delivered to Parwan and other provinces, while expressing his condolences to the victims' families.

Disaster management ministry spokesman Ahmad Tameem Azimi said flooding blocked highways to eastern and northern provinces, and that teams were working to reopen the roads to traffic.

He added that at least 300 houses were destroyed in Parwan and over a thousand people displaced, and that ground and air support sent to help those trapped by the flooding had reached the provinces.

Hundreds of acres of agricultural land have been destroyed, with rain wiping out crops in eastern Nuristan province.

Mr Azimi said that houses and roads were also destroyed in northern Kapisa, Panjshir and eastern Paktia provinces.

Two people died and five others were also injured in eastern Maidan Wardak province after flooding destroyed several homes there.

And in Nangarhar, located in the eastern part of Afghanistan, two members of a family died and four others were injured on Wednesday when the wall of their house collapsed in flooding.

Earlier this month, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan sent troops to help local authorities pump out rainwater from residential areas, as rains are expected to continue for the rest of the week in Karachi.

The Pakistani military said it would send out rescue helicopters when the weather cleared up.

KARACHI, Pakistan -- Three days of heavy monsoon rains triggering flash floods killed at least 58 people in various parts of Pakistan, as troops with boats rushed Sunday to evacuate people from flood-affected districts in the country's southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.

According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, eight in Punjab province and 10 in the country's scenic northern Gligit Baltistan region in the past three days.

Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.

Heavy rains also lashed many districts in the southwestern Baluchistan province, killing eight people, damaging homes and inundating many villages in the district of Jhal Magsi, according to Saleem Zakir, spokesman for provincial disaster management authority. He said rescuers with the army’s help were still trying to evacuate people from the district's flood-hit villages.

He said floods damaged a bridge and a gas pipeline and destroyed coastal roads on the Arabian Sea, severing links to the port of Gwadar, part of China’s multi-billion dollar one-road project linking south and Central Asia to China.

According to local media reports, hundreds of people moved to nearby hills when the floodwaters entered their villages in remote areas of Baluchistan, and the military used helicopters and boats to move them to safer places. Authorities were dispatching tents and food for the flood-affected people.

Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.

According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.

In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.

29,29,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Graveyards in Rawalpindi city running out of space - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1625120,"RAWALPINDI: The shortage of space in existing graveyards of the city has been a cause for concern among residents of the city as the government continues to ignore the issue.

Almost 90pc of Rawalpindi’s graveyards are short on space to accommodate fresh requests to bury the dead. There are more than 60 small and big graveyards in the garrison city and 10 in cantonment areas.

All main graveyards of the city including Ratta Amral, Pirwadhai, Eidgah, Shan Diyan Talian, Kuri Road, Dhoke Khaba, Dhoke Illahi Buksh, Dhoke Kashmirian, Cha Sultan, Malikan Da Kabristan, and the one near Committee Chowk do not have space for new graves. Yet, grave diggers dig new graves over unattended ones to accommodate requests that cannot be turned down.

During a survey, Dawn found encroachments along graveyards whereas due to limited space, managements of graveyard committees have also been charging higher prices for new graves. All graveyards are without boundary walls and land grabbers have managed to carry out construction in their surrounding areas; the worst affected is one of the oldest graveyards of Rawalpindi whereas the Dhoke Ratta and Pirwadhai graveyards also present the same picture.

Management of the graveyards had dug new graves along the bank of the nullah passing through the area but during monsoon, flood water destroys them, creating problems for the heirs.

The Eidgah graveyard is accommodating new arrivals as the management extended limits of the graveyard along the banks of the nullah.

Racecourse graveyard in cantonment is also running out of space. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) imposed a ban on new arrivals in the graveyard and asked that limited space be allocated for only army personnel.

Mohammad Nasir, resident of Mohanpura, said that his father died two months ago and he visited all the graveyards near his locality but they refused to bury his father. He said he talked to a grave-digger in Dhoke Illahi Buksh who managed to provide a space between two graves for his deceased father.

A resident of Chaklala Scheme III, Mudassir Malik said his brother died a few weeks ago and his family faced difficulty in finding a place to bury the deceased as there was no space available in Chaklala Scheme-III graveyard.

He said he paid Rs30,000 to the graveyard near Chungi Stop adjacent to Scheme-III. The government should allocate space for a graveyard in the city. In mid-90’s, 1000 kanals of land was allocated for the purpose in Rakh Dhamial but since the last 26 years, all governments failed to develop the graveyard.

In 2017, the PML-N government had launched project Shehr-e-Khamoshan and started work to construct a funeral prayer site, mosque, ablution area and other facilities but the graveyard is still not being utilised.

On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested in burying their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamial as it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the deceased and people to attend funeral prayers.

RDA, which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and managing housing societies across the district has failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards. Under the law, every private housing society has to allocate space for graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and it has to be transferred in the name of the state.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said that the ruling party has failed to develop graveyards. “We do not expect good from them as they are snatching bread from the people. How can they provide facilities?” he said.

The PML-N government in its tenure developed the Rakh Dhamial graveyard but work on it was stopped by the present government just to get political revenge from PML-N.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi said that development of graveyards was the government’s priority. When contacted, Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) Chief officer Ali Abbas Bukhari said Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat directed to speed up work to develop Rakh Dhamial graveyard and make it functional as soon as possible.

He said that RMC purchased two funeral buses so families could transport deceased persons to the graveyard. “We are providing free of cost service to citizens in the garrison city for use of funeral buses. We will purchase two more buses soon,” he said, adding there is an acute shortage of graveyards in the city making burial of the dead a great problem for the bereaved families.

The Pakistan Red Cross Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is assessing the evolution of the current monsoon rainfalls and its impacts during the next few days.

The situation

Heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan from 6 – 7 August 2020 with intermissions. This Monsoon rains created floods situation in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu. However, Tehsil Johi of District Dadu is the area which is greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods not only damaged the houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh already declared 80 villages of District Dadu as “Calamity Affected Areas’’. The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad and Jhal Magsi.

PRCS is already working together with the government, Movement partners and other organizations for COVID19 Response. The changing Scenario of i.e. floods/flash floods may increase the risks of COVID-19 spread in the affected communities. It has been reported that due to floods, many communities are forced to live together in small camps. The initial reports suggested that District Dadu of Sindh and District Jhal Magsi, Sibi, Harnai, Naseeabad and Kachi of Baluchistan are the worst-hit areas. However, administration is still in process of damage and need assessment as most of the communication channels are also broken in some affected areas. The floods also destroyed standing crops and greatly affected the livelihood of inhabitants.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Situation Report No.13 as of 13 August 2020, heavy monsoon rainfall has caused flooding and damages in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces over the last few days. The report indicates that as of date 82 people have lost their lives and 28 injuries, while 873 houses are fully damaged while 186 partially damaged.

In Baluchistan, 13 people have died in floods in recent days, with many more reportedly missing. Over 861 homes are fully damaged and 46 partially damaged. Flooding struck in the districts of Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Gwadar, Pasni, Kachi and Dera Bugti from 7 August 2020. Severe flooding occurred in the west of the province from 8 August after flood water from Baluchistan made its way downstream along the Nai Gaj river.

Meanwhile in Sindh Province, heavy rainfall from 6 August caused flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sakrand, Tando Jam, Dadu and Thatta. The floods caused 31 death. Hundreds of people were rescued by military personnel. Formal requests by district government through Deputy Commissioners of respective districts including situation of damages possibly with numbers/figures and required support in terms of food and non-food on immediate basis is expected.

The government is responding the situation and Pakistan army is carrying the Search & Rescue and evacuation operation. Some of the steps taken by government are as follows.

• 299 persons evacuated using 10 boats in district Dadu district by Armed Forces.

• PDMA Baluchistan Emergency Operational Center and DDMAs control rooms are functional and on high alert.

• Damage assessment by district government in Baluchistan is being conducted.

33,33,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Pakistan floods: 1.4 million children at risk of homelessness and disease - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-14-million-children-risk-homelessness-and-disease,"As many as 1.4 million children[i] face homelessness and disease following some of the worst ever floods in Pakistan, warns Save the Children.

In scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods that swept parts of the country in 2010, children are living outdoors, schools have been destroyed or damaged and agricultural crops have been lost. In many rural districts, people have only five days’ worth of food stock left.

There are concerns for the spread of COVID-19 and water-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, as a large-scale humanitarian operation gathers pace across Sindh province in Pakistan’s south-east.

Khuram Gondal, Save the Children’s Country Director in Pakistan, said:

“During the current monsoon, Sindh province has experienced some of the heaviest rainfall for nearly 90 years and more heavy rains are expected.

“More than 4 million people have been impacted by the monsoon floods and that’s equivalent to the population of a city the size of Rome.

“Make no mistake, this is an under-reported humanitarian catastrophe deserving of more attention, which would stretch the resources of the most powerful and richest nations on the planet.”

One of the major impacts of the floods is on crops and livestock. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmlands have been damaged, leading to fears for the supply of food.

“We are hearing that in many flood-affected communities only about three per cent of households have received food assistance, with food stocks running out in five to nine days’ time, depending on whether people live in rural or urban areas,” warned Mr Gondal.

There are worries for the disruption of children’s education, too.

“A thorough assessment of the full flood damage to schools is urgently required, but in one district of Sindh our teams found damage to scores of schools, with some destroyed completely.

“As a result, we expect long-term disruption to the education of boys and girls. We are also concerned that the damage to schools may aggravate the high school drop-out ratio of children, especially girls.

“Partially damaged schools are not safe or ready to accommodate students returning after several months of learning gaps due to COVID-19, therefore an urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction approach is needed,” said Mr Gondal.

The intense rains and floods that have battered Pakistan’s Sindh province raise the alarm for climate change, warns Save the Children.

“We know that extreme and erratic weather events pose a growing threat to children’s ability to thrive. It’s therefore never been more important for climate vulnerable communities to be supported to cope with and adapt to climate change, as well as build their resilience to hazards like floods,” added Mr Gondal.

There are fears that today’s floods could eclipse the floods from a decade ago, especially if the monsoon rains continue as predicted. But during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, international media attention led to a huge humanitarian relief effort.

“The Pakistani authorities are working very hard to support their people, but they need urgent support from the international community,” said Mr Gondal.

In response to the floods, Save the Children has mobilised humanitarian aid workers and supplies to:

Provide 400 households with emergency tents

Provide 700 of the most vulnerable households with emergency food rations

Pump water out of main roads to ensure access to school buildings and basic health units

At least two people were killed and more than a dozen were injured as torrential rains damaged houses in Panjgur district of Balochistan.

The torrential rains and hailstones started Friday afternoon caused flood and mud, debris and rainwater entered into houses in Tusp Khuda-Badan, Girmakan, Wasbod Kilag, Irap, Damb and other areas of the district.

“We did not break fast till late evening as water entered our house and we were trying to keep our stuff safe,” said Anwar Azad, a resident of Dumb. He added flood not only destroyed our valuable stuff and furniture but also damaged walls of our house.

According to locals of the area, walls of more than a hundred houses in Dumb, Irap, Qadirsbad, Saravan and adjacent areas were collapsed and dozens of livestock and two vehicles were washed away in the flash floods, while the situation compelled people to spend whole night in open sky.

Panjgur Deputy Commissioner Abdul Razzaq Sasoli, SP Captain (retd) Zuhaib Mushin, Commandant Frontier Corps (FC) Panjgur Rifles and other officials visited the flood-affected areas, examined the damages caused by flash floods and assured public of financial and manpower support.

Sasoli assured people that Levies, police and FC men were on the ground helping affected people and taking part in rescue operation, adding the government would compensate flood-affected people.

Following the situation emerged after heavy rain and flood, Panjgur Rifles FC set up an emergency cell in the town through which affectees would be assisted.

“All flood-affectees are directed to submit their claims and other details with Emergency Cell or contact officials at the helpline, 0855641240,” said Panjgur FC in a statement issued on Saturday.

The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, 83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.

Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information — and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what they’re looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.

Wow factor

Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with “troll farms” in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.

Some people unwittingly share misinformation on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented — whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)

Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. “Seeing is believing,” Sundar says.

Video sells WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic — in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine. S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand. Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement T. Tibbitts T. Tibbitts Source: S.S. Sundar and E. Cho/Penn State and M. Molina/Michigan State Univ.

The findings, in press at the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. “People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form,” Sundar says. That’s especially important with the rise of deepfake technologies that feature false but visually convincing videos (SN: 9/15/18, p. 12).

One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once it’s there. We’re constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it,” she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.

Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist because of the influence of their emotions and values, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives — or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.

One such approach is to “prebunk” beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change canceled any benefit of receiving the true information. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined people’s understanding of what was true.

That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information before giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that “Charles Darwin” and “members of the Spice Girls” were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.

Here’s a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, Bad News, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called GO VIRAL! Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.

Take a breath

Sometimes it doesn’t take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what they’re doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.

In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as “Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling,” with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants’ analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, lazy thinking rather than political bias may drive people’s susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in Cognition.

When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into people’s behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm people’s reasoning skills when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.

Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to “nudge” the concept of accuracy into people’s minds, helping them resist misinformation. “It’s basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form,” he says. “We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.”

Push in the right direction Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge. Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing T. Tibbitts Source: G. Pennycook et al/Nature 2021

With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation — Breitbart and InfoWars — Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.

On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. It’s a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges — but the work, reported online March 17 in Nature, suggests that very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect.

For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as “true” or “false” after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

How to debunk Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if you’re fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers: Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.

Don’t stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or you’re more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.

Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.

When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).

Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check after someone reads a headline can be helpful, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.

Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.

Misinformation researchers have recently called for social media companies to share more of their data so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users’ privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.

Much of the work to date on misinformation’s spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.

At least 90 lives have been lost, over 1,000 homes have been destroyed and thousands more have been displaced.

The flood situation in Pakistan is a complete disaster. In the north-west heavy downpour has overwhelmed the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A total of 23 lives have been lost in this province alone. In the north-east, the province of Punjab is no better, eight lives have been lost to incessant rains and flooding.In the south-west Balochistan too is reeling with flood and at least 15 people have died.

Right next to Balochistan is Sindh. The worst affected province in Pakistan, where 31 people have died here due to the annual monsoon deluge.

Karachi is the capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's financial hub. Karachi is now a submerged city. The residents say they are losing everything to rainwater.

At least eight people have died in Karachi alone. Mostly due to electrocution and drowning. Now, sewage water is flooding homes in low-lying areas and disaster relief is yet to arrive.

A recent study examines the link between power structures and vulnerability to flash floods in Reshun. The vulnerable location of Reshun, a village in Upper Chitral District in the northwest of Pakistan, leaves it exposed to natural disaster hazards. It sits along the seismically active Hindu Kush mountain range—and at the base of a drainage stream for the massive Chitral glaciers. While the risk of glacial flooding is regional, the vulnerabilities among Reshun's residents are far from equal, according to study authors Ishaq Khan and Inam Ullah Leghari, a graduate student and professor at the Department of Anthropology at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.

Members of Chitral's lowest serf class, cheermuzh, have long lived in stark marginalization. Now as glacial floods in Reshun grow more frequent due to climate change, low-income residents with little access to political power are left increasingly without options. The floods disproportionately devastate cheermuzh communities, and aid has been insufficient. As Hamna Tariq, a junior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center, told GlacierHub, ""They tough it out, until they cannot.""

Outside the polar regions, Pakistan is one of the world's major centers of glacial ice. Over 7,000 known glaciers lie within its borders and more than 500 of these glaciers are in the remote Chitral valley. The entire area is at risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are outpours of meltwater caused by glacial dam failure. However, exposure to GLOFs is highly varied and determined by one's social status.

Chitral society is divided into four classes—the highest of which is ""adamzade"" (proper human), and the lowest of which is a serf class, cheermuzh, often referred to as ""beizzat"" (without respect) and ""ghalamus"" (slave). True to a serfdom-like system, upper classes grant land to cheermuzh to live and farm on, which they retain by providing services to their landlords. This hierarchy is not just functional, but reflective of social attitudes toward low-status residents; a Chitral resident of lordly descent opposed the construction of a water pipe in his village on the grounds that he could not drink the same water as cheermuzh.

Like the village's social organization, vulnerabilities to glacial lake outburst floods are unequal and hierarchized. Reshun's cheermuzh communities reside by a stream flowing between two mountains. Flash floods linked to heavy rains and GLOFs annually devastate these communities.

The impacts of the 2013 and 2015 flash floods, in particular, illustrate their disproportionate effect on low-status residents. Khan and Leghari found that the 2013 Reshun flood's damage was concentrated in three mostly cheermuzh hamlets —Panandeh, Batikandeh, and Golguch. Only families in these hamlets lost their homes or livestock, an important food source and financial asset. There were 23 fully damaged and 16 partially damaged houses. The flooding also destroyed the hamlets' drinking water supply line and the bridges connecting them to evacuation routes.

Though these low-status residents were stranded, help didn't come for days. Aid workers were even instructed not to go into the hamlets as a precautionary measure. One resident, Ashraf Khan, told the study authors how he and his family were forced to spend one week outside, unaided and unsheltered, after their home was destroyed.

Two years later, the flash floods were even worse. Nearly 100 houses were fully damaged, 86 of which belonged to low-status households, including Khan's. His family was one of 30 low-status households whose homes were destroyed twice, in both 2013 and 2015. As mentioned in the study, all of these households had rebuilt their homes in the same place, as they had nowhere else to live. On the other hand, five households whose homes were destroyed in the 2013 flood and who could afford to move elsewhere were unaffected in 2015.

The 2015 flood also completely washed away the road connecting the three hamlets to the main road. ""Flash flood isolated us from the rest of the world,"" said another resident, Sher Muhammad, who was quoted in the study. Now, not only were cheermuzh socially marginalized, but they were also physically isolated.

Muhammad is also involved in Golguch's anti-grazing movement. As glacial lake outburst floods have become more frequent, goat grazing near Reshun's nearby glaciers has become a controversial issue. According to anti-grazers, grazing intensifies flooding by breaking the soil surrounding the nearby glaciers. Khan, the graduate student who co-authored the article, wrote to GlacierHub that grazing is ""mostly supported by lordly families,"" who are not at the highest risk of flooding, while opponents of grazing are mostly from low-status backgrounds. This divide is indicative of the class-based vulnerabilities to GLOFs and the tensions that have risen as a result.

Without any prospect that GLOFs will subside in a warming climate, Reshun's cheermuzh residents are left without many options. Writing to GlacierHub, Hamna Tariq highlighted the need for government aid: ""Granted these regions are nestled between dangerous landscapes, more can still be done like providing better warning systems, immediate flood relief aid, temporary housing, and employment opportunities.""

The article's authors, Khan and Muhammad, emphasize the importance of addressing power structures in addition to the floods. They write that ""the effectiveness of mitigation and relief programs for such communities can only be achieved if the political structure of the past and its perpetual effect could be understood.""

As the study illustrates, Reshun residents like Ashraf Khan and Sher Muhammad face the severe dangers of glacial flooding due to no fault of their own, but as a result of their socioeconomic marginalization. The paper's conclusions affirm the need not only to address GLOF-related impacts, but also the class inequities that create these unequal vulnerabilities. Failing to address this two-fold crisis is to fail these residents and all others at the frontlines of climate change.

PRCS aims to extend the DREF timeline to six months.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

First spell of heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan Province from 6 August and continued until 7 August 2020 with intermissions. Continuous rain over a period of 24 hours caused massive flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu districts of Sindh province, with Tehsil Johi in Dadu district as the area greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods are not only damaging infrastructures and houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh has declared 80 villages in Dadu district as “Calamity Affected Areas’’.

The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad, Jafferabad and Jhal Magsi districts where Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts as the most affected areas according to the rapid need assessment report. On 18 August 2020, the Government of Baluchistan also declared emergency in Jhal Magsi district. Besides the recent floods, COVID-19 outbreak is also a threat to the affected population. However, the number of positive cases reported so far in the targeted district are on lower side. As of 7 September 2020, Dadu district reported 1,184 positive cases, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad (Baluchistan) 328 and 71 reported positive COVID-19 cases respectively.

Another heavy spell of Monsoon rain started in most part of the country on 20 August 2020 and continued until 3 September 2020 with intervals. This resulted in urban flooding in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, while flash floods reported in district Shangla, Swat and flooding in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Karachi experienced heaviest rains in almost a century, killing at least 41 people in the city. Thousands of people were trapped due to waterlogging in low-lying slums. In some part of the city people were without electricity for days as urban flooding badly affected infrastructure. The second spell of flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Despite the best efforts of the government, the living conditions of the displaced are appalling, with very limited access to safe water and food and with limited shelter. In the meantime, they have no safe water or livelihoods.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538276-MDRPK019du1.png?itok=ikFPghHy,"['n', 'dref', 'monsoon', 'mdrpk019', 'pakistan', '2020', 'water', 'operation', 'report', 'province', 'flooding', 'updates', 'karachi', 'floods', 'district', 'sindh', 'affected', 'reported']", ,flood

2.5 million people have been affected by floods which devasted Sindh Province in late August.

71,500 people received in-kind food assistance during WFP’s first phase of the response between September and early October.

117,000 people will receive cash assistance under WFP’s second phase of the response. Among them, 26,658 people have already been reached.

Highlights

• WFP initiated a second phase of relief assistance in November 2020 to meet persistent humanitarian needs in Sindh’s flood affected districts. Cash transfers under this second phase are expected to be completed by early January.

• Following the relief phase, WFP plans to focus on recovery efforts in 2021 together with its government and development partners, to rebuild livelihoods and rehabilitate assets that can support sustainable food security.

WFP Funding Requirements

• WFP’s ongoing relief assistance is fully funded.

• WFP is currently seeking contributions to support recovery activities planned in 2021.

Situation Update

• The floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton.

• Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

• The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

WFP Response

• On 10 November, WFP started distributing unconditional cash assistance to vulnerable floodaffected households who had not yet received in-kind food assistance from WFP in September. Distributions are being carried out in the three most affected districts: Umerkot, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas.

• Each targeted household is receiving a multipurpose cash transfer of PKR 15,000 (approximately USD 90), distributed in two tranches.

• Sensitization sessions on nutrition and hygiene practices are also being carried out at distribution points and through village development committees, with a focus on pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. Sensitization sessions also cover precautionary measures against the spread of COVID19 and dengue virus.

• As of 15 December, WFP and its partners, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and Secours Islamique France (SIF) have distributed cash assistance to 26,658 people.

• WFP plans to distribute assistance to another 90,342 people by early January 2021.

• Following the completion of this relief cash assistance in January 2021, WFP is looking to support the Sindh Government’s recovery efforts. Working with Government and development partners, WFP is in the process of designing livelihoods recovery programmes, including cash-for-asset and disaster risk reduction activities, to reduce the impacts of future floods and droughts.","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549279-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%235%20%2816%20Dec%202020%29.png?itok=93hsgBQs,"['development', 'situation', 'food', 'response', 'relief', 'pakistan', '2020', 'recovery', 'assistance', 'cash', 'report', 'wfp', 'flood', 'wfps', '16', 'sindh', 'phase', 'affected']", ,flood

By Henrike Brecht and Ahsan Tehsin

Mehar Khan, 54, had poured his life’s savings into building a modest home for his family in Naya Nazimabad, a housing society in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Karachi was particularly hard hit by torrential rains in August which caused around $1 billion in national economic damage and loss. Streets across the city turned into rivers and washed away many houses. Mehar’s family was one among thousands stranded in inundated parts of the city for days.

Pakistan’s financial and economic center, Karachi with its 16 million inhabitants is home to the country's largest corporations and main ports. Its economy has grown steadily for decades - last year its GDP was nearly $164 billion. The city has also made impressive progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2015.

Now, Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success? It doesn’t have to. Moving forward, the city can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction:

Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success?

First, the sewage network needs an urgent overhaul. Karachi can reap large benefits from the development and implementation of a comprehensive Drainage and Stormwater Master Plan for the entire city. The World Bank is helping large cities implement drainage solutions for the 21st century and adapt to climate change, for example, in Yangon, Myanmar or Manila, Philippines.

Second, comprehensive solutions for solid waste management are important. Of the 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste generated each day in Karachi, 60 percent does not reach a dumpsite, and trash accumulates in drainage pipes. Across the globe, cities are employing new approaches to solid waste management, focusing on reduction and recycling. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $4.7 billion to more than 340 solid waste management programs, for instance, in Indonesia or China.

Third, moving towards sponge city concept to absorb rainwater, prioritizing green infrastructure and permeable surfaces will go a long way to counter floods and heat. Instead of carrying the water away, these sponge cities treat it as a resource that is filtered by the soil and then stored. This ensures the economic and sustainable use of the valuable natural resource that fresh water constitutes. It also helps the city cool down through evaporation. This would involve stopping encroachment into urban wetlands and increasing water infiltration through greening, which would reduce the need for costly storm water drainage systems in the city. China’s Sponge Cities Initiative provides $12 billion to more than 30 of its cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan, with the aim of re-using 70 percent of rainwater in 80 percent of the urban areas which are part of the program.

Karachi can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction.

Comprehensive policy changes would be as equally important as targeted investments to reduce flooding in Karachi. Responsibilities between agencies at national, provincial and local levels need to be clearly defined. Coordination among the different jurisdictions to develop entire-city approaches need to replace administrative fragmentation. Risk-sensitive land-use plans and their enforcement must ensure that new development takes place away from the most at-risk zones. New infrastructure and risk reduction strategies cannot be developed separately. These measures need to converge to help reduce the city’s vulnerability in the long-term, for example, through building code development and enforcement. Strengthening Karachi’s emergency management response systems through drills and equipment will also reduce the impacts of disasters.

Challenging the status quo will not be easy. For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

But changing course will be cost-effective in the long-term. Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Plan 2012–22 ranks Karachi as the country’s most vulnerable district. Karachi is not only prone to floods but also to earthquakes, cyclones and more recently, heatwaves. Pakistan is also the fifth most affected country by climate change. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, they will severely impact people’s livelihoods and Karachi’s economic competitiveness.

For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

The good news is that Karachi can benefit from existing developments and build on initial achievements. Pakistan shifted to an ex-ante disaster risk management approach after the 2005 earthquake. A National Flood Protection Plan, Pakistan’s investments in nature-based solutions and reforestation programs along with the Karachi Transformative Strategy pave the way. The World Bank continues to strengthen Karachi’s efforts to become more resilient. It committed $652 million in 2019 to reinforce the city’s infrastructure and institutions with a focus on urban management, public transport, safe water, and sanitation.

Karachi also benefits from the Sindh Resilience Project, which invests in flood protection works and integrates disaster risk reduction in planning processes. The Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project and the Hydromet and Climate Services Project also support climate sensitive and sustainable solutions.

The World Bank stands ready to assist Karachi in moving forward to become a world-class inclusive, sustainable and more livable city.","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['largest', 'city', 'building', 'management', 'climate', 'pakistan', 'need', 'economic', 'water', 'karachi', 'floods', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'world', 'risk']", ,flood

(Photo: Reuters)

Pakistan has been reeling under floods for the past three months, leading to the loss of hundreds of lives. However, leave alone its neighbours or the rest of the world, even people in Pakistan are hardly talking about it.

The first indications of the worsening flood situation were noticed when a recently established UK-based NGO called Muslim Aid started collecting funds for Pakistanis.

Latest satellite images from Sentinel were accessed by India Today OSINT team and compared with three-month-old images to understand the extent of flood damage in Pakistan.

These are false colour images taken using a combination of infrared and visible light that clearly distinguishes between land, which appears bright green, and water that appears black.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been providing situation reports that have been ignored by most government ministries. The latest NDMA report indicates 400 deaths and damages to over 2 lakh houses.

While damage to infrastructure is maximum in Sindh province, the highest deaths have been reported from Sindh and Punjab. More than 6 lakh acres of crops have suffered damage in Mirpur Khas and Dadu districts alone. The next few days are crucial as yet another spate of rains is expected by NDMA.

(Photo: India Today)

The satellite images, when compared to previous years’ data, indicate that no action has been taken by Pakistan to either resettle victims or alleviate threats since the deadly 2010 floods.

The administration has made no effort to train the rivers properly. River banks haven’t been lined and bridges across the Indus are under danger of getting washed away. Road approaches stall water overflowing the riverside, thus, endangering the complete bridge infrastructure. The Dadu Moro Bridge is a classic example of this type of possible future damage that can be assessed from satellite imagery.

(Photo: India Today)

The Indus River is clearly not trained at the bridge site with either retainer walls or embankments, thus, overflowing the divergent guide banks. The next large gush of flood waters will certainly damage this bridge’s western side severely.

Large areas in Jacobabad, including parts of Shahbaz Air Base, are also under water. Shahbaz is one of the most important air bases of Pakistan Air Force. It has fighter and transporter jets along with a huge ammunition depot. In the last decade, Pakistan suffered severe floods in 2007 and 2010 when damage to property was almost $40-$50 billion.

(Photo: India Today)

In 2010, the air base supposedly suffered the worst damage in PAF history when most of the ammunition, including air-to-surface missiles, had come under water.

Recent satellite images indicate that although water released from Guddu Barrage had entered the area, it did not cross the retainer wall constructed by PAF on the northern side of the air base.","Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202009/pak_flood_reuters-647x363.png?EISsNEMGRC6wauOuHeyf11Lzu3Ld6BRF,"['months', 'air', 'pakistan', 'satellite', 'water', 'damage', 'images', 'bridge', 'extent', 'flood', 'india', 'suffered']", ,flood

Cyclone, Weather forecast Highlights: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday said the Severe Cyclonic Storm “Tauktae” over eastcentral Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 13 kmph during past 6 hours.

It lay centred over eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 14.2°N and longitude 72.7°E at 2030 hours IST on Saturday, about 190 km southwest of Panjim-Goa, 550 km south of Mumbai, 780 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 910 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening.

As it would bring very heavy rainfall in that region, cities like Mumbai would not be affected much, the IMD added.

There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 17 over north Konkan, including Mumbai,

the IMD said.

The Maharashtra capital can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, said Shubhani Bhute, senior director (weather) IMD, Mumbai. The storm is currently 250 km south-west of Goa, she added.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated. He also called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, a statement said.","Sun, 16 May 2021 04:02:27 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/TVM-1200.jpeg,"['km', 'eastcentral', 'winds', 'mumbai', 'diu', 'imd', 'cyclonic', 'weather', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'storm', 'highlights', 'severe', 'tauktae', 'gujarat', 'cyclone', 'arabian', 'sea']", ,none
45,45,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

About 36 people are reported to have died after torrential rain triggered flash floods and urban flooding in Pakistan.

An emergency has been imposed at hospitals across Karachi, where paramilitary forces are helping traffic police in rescuing commuters amid traffic jams, flooding of roads and destruction of infrastructure.

“We were stuck in homes this Sunday as people shared videos of motorcycles and even cars being swept away in strong floods. Several people were injured by tiles falling from high buildings,” Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Pakistan Karachi, told UCA News.

“The frontline volunteers of our disaster management committees (DMCs) continued rescue efforts during heavy rains and helped in saving people and their belongings in low-lying areas.”

Father James Shamaun parish priest of St. Thomas Catholic Church in Wah Cantonment, a military city in Punjab province, shared the devastation in a Facebook Live video recorded on July 25. The priest described visiting a flooded church in Taxila, another city of the Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.

“The river is flooded. We pray here every Sunday evening. We cannot reach there in this situation. We shall pray here depending on the weather,” he said. The clip has been viewed more than 3,300 times.

Meanwhile, Caritas is developing a response plan for a flood emergency this year. The charity has inspired DMCs in all six dioceses and the apostolic prefecture, empowering disaster-prone communities to help themselves.

Amjad Gulzar, executive director of Caritas Pakistan, said the floods will worsen livelihood challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Covid-19 has changed the scenario of country. Rain-related damages have added to the losses of the poor and daily wagers struggling amid the lockdown,"" he said.

“DMCs have been especially instructed to observe social distancing and SOPs [standard operating procedures] in rescue and relief efforts. Our response plan includes food kits, hygiene kits, shelter and non-food items.”

47,47,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Unravelling the urban flood - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577689,"Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation.

Every year, natural disasters claim around 90,000 lives and affect more than 150 million around the world. Among these, floods pose the most intense threat to lives and livelihoods, bludgeoning communities large and small, and inundating large swathes of land across borders. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected nearly a third of the global population, or 2 billion people worldwide. Beyond the obvious impact on infrastructure and utilities, flooding is a harbinger of a multitude of long-term effects, including economic losses, loss of means of livelihood, ecological changes, and public health challenges.

Floods are the most damaging natural hazard in Pakistan with 26 major events having ravaged the country since 1950. The 2010 “super flood” alone affected 20 million people, and caused direct and indirect losses worth nearly $10 billion. Since then a major flood event occurred at least once each year, affecting millions more. In the past five years or so, urban flooding has gained a strong foothold in Pakistan, becoming almost synonymous with the monsoon season. It is becoming increasingly evident that current policy, planning, and implementation mechanisms for urban flood management are not effective within the context of climate change.

Emerging Climate Challenges

A growing body of research supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has established close linkages between climate change and disaster risk. Whilst climate change cannot be attributed directly to any one major disaster — for example, the urban flooding in Karachi — it does point to an alteration of the global atmosphere. These alterations, caused by human activities such as deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, and other commercial and industrial practices, coupled with the likelihood of more extreme weather events in the future, are likely to increase the frequency and scale of disasters.

Also read: Early downpour exposes Karachi’s drainage flaws

The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and socio-economic impact. The 2019 CRI ranked Pakistan as the 8th most affected country when it comes to extreme weather events. The report went on to add that “countries like….Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The same report placed India at the 14th spot in terms of impact of extreme weather events.

Between 80-90% of all documented natural disasters in the past decades have, on average, been a result of floods, heat waves, droughts, and storms.

Floods, in particular, are increasing in frequency and intensity, and extreme variations in precipitation are expected to contribute to flooding in areas that have historically remained immune.

A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) evaluated the high risk of floods and droughts during the monsoon season. The report pointed out that over eight million people would be exposed to flood risk in Pakistan this year alone.

High risk areas for floods in South Asia

The South Asian monsoon, characterised by concentrated rainfall between June and September, is the lifeline of the agricultural sector in the region, irrigating as much as 55% of cultivated land. Over the past few years, however, researchers have noticed wide temporal and spatial variations in monsoon rainfall. Erratic monsoon patterns have seen a shift of rainfall not only in geographical terms, but also onset and withdrawal. This has resulted in devastating floods throughout the region, claiming scores of lives.

Last week, at least 40 lives were lost as a result of urban flooding in Karachi. Massive cracks in the city’s administrative and operational infrastructure surfaced with every conceivable flood hazard — from cars being swept away by rainwater to collapsing houses to electrocution and even landsliding — becoming a harsh reality. Whilst this does not undermine incidences of riverine and flash flooding throughout the rest of Pakistan, it does indicate that a new, rapid phenomenon in densely populated areas is taking shape: that of urban flooding.

Urban floods are a consequence of meteorological factors, such as intense precipitation, and human actions, such as land use change, occupation of flood plains, alteration of natural water courses, and inadequate drainage and sanitation infrastructure. As soon as precipitation exceeds the capacity of an urban area’s drainage system which includes sewers, gutters, open channels, natural and manmade pathways to a receiving water body — urban flooding occurs. In the weeks leading up to perhaps what will historically be remembered as Pakistan’s biggest urban flood, it became abundantly clear that existing drainage channels were already operating below capacity. A combination of factors, including informal settlements driven by urbanisation, and poor solid waste management directly contributed to this loss of capacity.

More on this | What causes urban flooding? Hint: It’s not just rain

Stripping away land cover and vegetation in the name of “development” to make way for buildings, roads, and bridges not only alters natural water flow channels; it also greatly diminishes water absorption and storage capacity of the soil. As a result, when precipitation runoff flows rapidly across the surface, in short, intense, high-volume bursts rather than sinking into the soil. Not only does this overload a city’s drainage system, but considerably more rainwater ends up in sewers and directly flows off into water bodies, instead of recharging ground water sources. The obstruction of drainage systems, ditches, and other pathways by solid waste and refuse can block channels, causing the water to back up and spread laterally into commercial and residential areas. Many communities did not know that until they found water coursing through their houses, streets, and commercial buildings. Thus, a confluence of disorganised implementation of urban infrastructure such as bridges and embankments obstructing runoff, reduced drainage channel availability due to backfilling, deposition of sediments and refuse in canals and waterways, and archaic drainage and sanitation infrastructure, contributed to the devastation in Karachi.

Policymaking for urban flood management

A recent study in the United States on flood policy noted severe shortcomings in the ability to project the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. Given high levels of uncertainty, policy-making for flood planning & response may be even more difficult and fraught than it already is. Vulnerability of urban systems increases as population density increases, and the effects are multiplied when flooding damages electrical, transportation, communication and other support systems.

Whilst the direct impact of urban flooding — such as inundation of streets and residences, losses and damages to property and vehicles, and destruction of infrastructure — are easily visible, it is the indirect impact that leaves longer lasting effects. For example, the public health threat as a result of untreated sewage or chemical runoff from industrial areas mixing with water sources; the loss of livelihoods for certain periods of time; and the inability to travel to work. Those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale will have a lower capacity to respond and recover, placing ever greater demands on existing social and community service mechanisms.

Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation. The losses in terms of property, productivity, livelihood, and quality of life demand a socioeconomic approach to flood risk management, one that focuses not just on rescue and relief, but also the rehabilitation of communities to the same or a better state that they were in before disaster struck. Future policies should thus address:

— The challenges posed by climate change

— The major economic, environmental, financial, political and social issues likely to impact urban development and urban flood management

— Ancillary payoffs (such as environmental, economic, or social) of pursuing adaptive strategies

Infrastructure management practices for urban flooding

Flooding is the most hazardous consequence of intense precipitation, and even small increases in precipitation can have inordinately large effects on the drainage system. Research based on actual events and simulations indicates that a “20 per cent increase in precipitation in a single event leads to a 365 per cent increase in flood volume and the number of at-risk buildings increases by 120 per cent”.

Drainage and flood control infrastructure is largely designed based on 25-, 50- or 100-year flood frequencies, and historic trends. However, as is becoming increasingly evident, past history may no longer be a reliable guide to future events, especially in the context of urban flooding. Drainage systems, developed and built over decades, are only as good as the weakest connecting link. Decisions made during the scoping and early design stages, when urban sprawl and population were both limited, can have significant impact on outcomes few years down the road. Changes and modifications made at later stages are not always possible or cost effective, which makes both under-sizing and over-sizing of the infrastructure equally problematic: extensive damage in the first case; and excessive expenditures in the second.

Read further: What's it like to suffer from climate change in Pakistan?

Furthermore, focusing on technical and engineering issues in tackling flooding has become somewhat of a national trend, which discounts the influence of social characteristics and circumstances. This bias can actually encourage development in areas where hazard risk may surpass technological solutions. Similarly, efforts to manage urban floods by focusing on the flow and its transit elsewhere, akin to following the “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” approach, don’t solve the problem but merely shift it — usually to low income areas.

Uncontrolled development of informal settlements

In recent years, Pakistan, like many developing nations has witnessed massive in-migration (movement of people within the country). The 2019 Migration Snapshot published by the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) notes that nearly 13% of the Pakistani population comprises of internal migrants. Internal migration in Pakistan is usually undertaken by low skilled workers who move from the rural districts to urban areas due to marriage, family ties, and economic opportunities. A number of socioeconomic factors are at play here, but what is key is the emergence of new settlements in and around cities. These areas, characterized by population highly concentrated in a (relatively) small area runs well ahead of the planning and construction of infrastructure to cope with it.

It would be remiss not to point out that the deleterious effects of degraded environmental conditions have the most (though not exclusive) impact on low income settlements, including katchi abadis or shanties. Built atop slopes, drainage channels, and waterways subject to flash floods, these dwellings are “put together” with substandard materials in areas with poor or overloaded water and waste disposal systems. Residents of these settlements may fill natural drainage channels with dwellings or waste materials, preventing normal rainwater flow and causing the water to spread out into the residential area. Pathways and (unpaved) streets are usually impervious, affording no means for absorption of precipitation, but rather providing a free passage of precipitation and flood water into homes, buildings, and commercial establishments. As these settlements are not planned or subject to land use restrictions or whatever building codes that may or may not exist, the effects of a severe natural disaster can be greatly magnified.

Conclusion

Climate change will impact future city growth, planning and development. By 2030, at least 61% of the world’s population will be living in cities. In developing nations, cities will become home to nearly four billion residents, or a whopping 80 per cent of the global urban population. Consequently, what was once dispersed rural poverty will now be concentrated in urban informal and squatter settlements. It is not really possible to control or totally eliminate floods, and policy planners and practitioners should concentrate instead on enhancing the resilience of the population to flood risks through a combination of engineering techniques coupled with and social, economic and administrative measures. In so doing, they must work within the framework of Integrated Flood Management so as to meet the larger issues of effectiveness, socioeconomic equity, and long-term positive outcomes. This can be achieved, in part by:

— Integrating land and water management;

— Ensuring a participatory community-level approach;

— Adopting integrated hazard management approaches;

— Adopting a combination of economic, legislative, policy-based, and sociological measures to move from traditional “flood control” towards “flood management”;

— Synchronisation with the national development agenda, including measures such as the Ehsaas programme, the Green Pakistan initiative, setting up effective local governments and other poverty alleviation and social uplifting schemes;

— It must also accommodate integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) practices

The aforementioned steps can be proactively implemented in incremental stages with ad hoc tactical adjustments made as events and situations unfold. The uncertainty inherent in climate change projections means that risk-centred approaches and risk-based analysis (including cost-benefit analysis) are no longer as useful or robust as they have been. The past may no longer be a reliable guide to the future when it comes to urban flood management. The combination of climate change, increasing urbanisation, demands for housing and industrial land (often in the floodplain), economic development and rising expectations cannot be discounted in urban flood management. Rather than focusing on any one of these issues, it will be necessary to combine them — and their many stakeholders — into a comprehensive planning process for increasing adaptation and enhancing community resilience.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/09/5f505e90e296d.jpg,"['management', 'water', 'precipitation', 'flooding', 'unravelling', 'flood', 'urban', 'floods', 'impact', 'drainage', 'areas']", ,flood

300,000 people are estimated to be in need of food assistance in nine districts

62,764 people are targeted by WFP with food assistance in three districts

Highlights

• On 28 August, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked WFP to provide food assistance to flood-affected people in Sindh Province.

• As of 9 September evening, WFP had distributed food to 669 households in Karachi (out of the total 1,780 targeted in Karachi). Distributions to 7,876 households in rural districts will start on 11 September.

• NDMA has warned of potential new flooding across the country, which could further increase the number of people in immediate need of assistance.

WFP Funding Requirements

• US$ 410,320 are needed to replenish food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations for this emergency response.

Situation Update

• The Sindh Government announced a state of emergency on 25 August, with 20 districts declared calamity-affected.

• On 2 September, at the request of the Sindh PDMA, the Sindh UN Provincial Programme Team launched a rapid needs assessment in the nine hardest-hit districts (including four in Karachi and five rural districts). The results were endorsed by the PDMA on 7 September.

• One million people are affected according to Sindh PDMA estimates; 30 percent of whom are estimated to be in need of food assistance based on the findings of the rapid needs assessment.

• In Karachi, water has receded in most parts of the city. However, the informal settlements of Malir District, located in low-lying areas and without sewage infrastructure, remain flooded.

Only 4 percent of households interviewed in Karachi said they had already received food assistance. Most of these households depend on casual labour, and their coping capacities have already been exhausted by COVID-19.

• In the rural areas assessed, only 1 percent of households had received food assistance, and the vast majority reported their food stocks would run out in less than five days. Agricultural livelihoods have been severely affected, with 93 percent of crop lost, 66 percent of irrigation infrastructure reported to be damaged, and most households reporting significant livestock losses or distress sales.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1535006-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%231%20%2810%20Sep%29.png?itok=GIgAFl8O,"['situation', 'food', 'response', 'pakistan', '2020', 'pdma', 'households', 'assistance', 'need', 'report', 'wfp', 'districts', 'rural', 'karachi', 'flood', 'sindh']", ,flood
49,49,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Pakistan floods: Monsoon rains expose blockages in both Karachi’s drains and politics - The Independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/pakistan-floods-karachi-moonsoon-rain-waseem-akhtar-a9666811.html,"C

raftsman Mohammad Zakir, who lives in a low-lying area of Karachi’s Orangi Town, does not recall the authorities ever cleaning out the storm water drain serving his neighbourhood.

Thorani Goth in West District was flooded during the fourth bout of monsoon rain this season from 6-8 August.

During that – and a previous downpour in late July – water came up 4-5ft (1.2-1.5m) inside Mr Zakir’s home, ruining furniture, electrical equipment and important documents.

It also soaked an order of 250 women’s garments he was due to decorate with sequins and beads – his first job in five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’ll put them out to dry to see if there are water stains on them,” said the informal-sector worker.

If the clothes were ruined, he would have to bear half the cost of 250,000 Pakistani rupees (£1,139), he added.

Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation people “are certainly not exaggerating when they say water comes up chest-high into their homes”.

The city has a network of 550 storm water drains which zigzag through the city and flow out into the Arabian Sea, but many are obstructed by illegal construction, waste and sludge.

Mr Akhtar said the city authorities cleaned out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide the funds for the work.

In the mayor’s four-year term, which ends this month, management of Karachi’s services has been hamstrung by disputes between different levels of government.

Meanwhile the city’s infrastructure is struggling to cope with heavy monsoon rains, as seen this year.

Sardar Sarfaraz, Karachi head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said rainfall of as little as 50mm (2 inches) could cause urban flooding in some of Karachi’s low-lying areas, with the most recent downpour easily exceeding that across the city.

Scientists are still figuring out how global warming will affect the Asian monsoon, but in many parts of the world, higher temperatures are fuelling more intense bouts of rainfall.

Mr Sarfaraz noted the trend is for more erratic weather patterns, as predicted by climate scientists.

In Karachi, the August rains killed 22 people, 11 of them by electrocution, after 10 died in July. From 2014 to 2019, the city recorded more than 70 rain-related deaths, with 2018 an exception as it was largely dry.

After the havoc this July – with main roads submerged, sewage spewing from manholes and into homes, and power cuts lasting for hours – Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, tasked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with sorting out the city’s drains.

The NDMA, helped by the military’s engineering wing, said it had cleaned three major drains in just under a week, clearing 42 choke points and removing more than 31,000 tonnes of sludge.

After touring the city, Sindh information minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper there were no floods in the city, despite the intensity of this month’s rain, as prevention policies had been effectively implemented.

But Mr Zakir’s experience does not back up that assertion.

Illegal building

Hot sun after the monsoon rain has provided some respite for Mr Zakir’s family and the 13 million city residents, out of a population of more than 17 million, who live in informal settlements that are prone to flooding.

Mr Zakir blamed illegal construction along the drainage channels, adding that “the government needs to come here and bulldoze” the buildings.

“The storm water drains, some as wide as 200ft, have over the years, due to unauthorised construction, narrowed to just 30 feet – so what do you expect?” said Mr Akhtar, the city’s mayor.

The main responsibility lies both with residents who have encroached on land along the drain, and the provincial government for letting it happen, said the outgoing mayor.

The province of Sindh has taken a larger share of control from the city authority but has not provided the budget owed, which a court ruling ordered it to pay, Mr Akhtar said.

A Sindh government spokesman said it did not owe money to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, to which it had transferred 50bn rupees (£227m) in the last three and a half years.

Solid waste dumped into storm water drains exacerbates the flooding. It is estimated that the mega-city generates 13,000 tonnes of garbage daily.

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board collects 70 per cent of that and takes it to two landfills, but told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it does not know what happens to the rest.

Sewage is also being dumped in storm drains, as little has been invested in rehabilitating the crumbling sewerage system for two decades despite the city’s expansion, officials said.

Longer-term plan?

Zubair Channa, director of the Sindh government-led Solid Waste Emergency and Efficiency Project (SWEEP), funded with $100m (£76.8m) from the World Bank, said encroachment on most of Karachi’s large drains over a long period, coupled with their uneven width, caused disturbances in the flow of water.

Drains feeding into the big water channels are also not well maintained, making the flooding worse, noted the civil engineer.

“What is needed is a comprehensive engineering solution,” he said, rather than “firefighting” each year as the city does now.

In its first year, SWEEP has hired contractors to remove about 10 million cubic ft of sludge from the drains and deposit it in landfill by the end of August, he noted.

With floods causing so much devastation year after year, Mr Akhtar said it was time “to take the firm but unpleasant decision” of pulling down illegal buildings.

Before that is done, people must be provided with an alternative, he added.

“There is enough government land that can be used for both vertical expansion as well as developing satellite towns around Karachi, where these people can be shifted,” he said.

But with Karachi run by three tiers of government dominated by three different political parties, real solutions to its problems are often lost in a war of words.

“We need the judiciary and the army to sit with experts like architects and town planners to resolve the issue,” Mr Akhtar said.

PESHAWAR: At least 16 people, including a woman and two children, were killed and eight others injured due to flash floods caused by torrential rains in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district, a disaster management official said on Friday.

Eight people died in Upper Kohistan district, six in Swat and two in Shangla district of the province due to the floods on Thursday night, an official of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said, adding that 40 houses were damaged in these areas.

The flood water inundated houses in Shahgram and Teerat area of Swat district from where six deaths and injuries to eight people were reported.

PDMA Director General Pervez Khan and Secretary of relief rushed to the affected areas to oversee rescue activities.

The rescue activities are underway in full swing in the affected areas and people are being shifted to safer places, Khan said.

51,51,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Millions at risk as melting Pakistan glaciers raise flood fears - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/9/millions-at-risk-as-melting-pakistan-glaciers-raise-flood-fears,"As ice melts, there is risk of large glacial lakes bursting through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream.

Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet (three metres) from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The floodwater broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Reuters news agency by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses, and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37m in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners – the UN Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change – as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told Reuters.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with the aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

Melting glaciers

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the UN Adaptation Fund from 2011 to 2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

‘People will suffer’

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier in a helicopter recently, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier, and there was talk of an [automated] early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system is extremely urgent, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding, and people will suffer.”","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f710960554f9487aad8f63e38374bcf2_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['warning', 'millions', 'ice', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'fears', 'hassanabad', 'walls', 'raise', 'glaciers', 'outburst', 'flood', 'shishper', 'melting', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Pakistani villages located at the bank of River Sutlej have been submerged after India released water without notifying the authorities in Pakistan, displacing hundreds of people while destroying several houses and standing crops, said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday.

Over 1,200 persons were rescued from the flood-affected villages by a local administration while another 1,613 persons have been shifted to safer places, according to the NDMA.

Rescue teams along with Pakistan army personnel are taking part in the rescue operations, a local administrative official in Lahore told Xinhua, adding that more than 80 relief camps have been set up for flood affectees so far.

He said water level in the river is continuously rising, and the concerned authorities are making all-out efforts to ensure timely evacuation of people from the affected villages.

A spokesperson of the NDMA Mukhtar Ahmed told local media that three of the villages located near the bed of the river went completely underwater due to flooding, and the people from these most-affected villages have already been evacuated to safer places.

Earlier on Monday, the NDMA had warned of a flood-like situation in the areas alongside the river after India released up to 200,000 million cusecs of excessive water in the River Sutlej that flows through Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

""The flood alert was issued in order to avoid the loss of lives and properties as India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,"" Director General of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Khurram Shahzad said.

According to a water-distribution agreement between the two neighboring countries, India is bound to pre-schedule its spillway openings, but the incumbent Indian government has canceled all the meetings of Indus Water Commission, which was formed to resolve disputes over water sharing with Pakistan.

Pakistani agricultural experts believe that India is trying to destroy an agro-based economy of the country by taking such measures and using water as an instrument of war, trying to convert agricultural land of Pakistan into deserts through inundation and trickling of water.

The development came when relations between Pakistan and India have been strained after the latter decided to revoke the special status of the Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.

In its response, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade ties with India.","Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['displaces', 'hundreds', 'houses', 'local', 'pakistan', 'water', 'villages', 'notification', 'flood', 'xinhua', 'india', 'ndma', 'trying', 'river', 'told', 'releases']", ,flood

“The actual number has not been confirmed yet,” but 100 to 150 people were feared dead, Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand state where the incident occurred, told Reuters.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down a river valley.

“It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,” Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of Raini village, told Reuters by phone. “I felt that even we would be swept away.”

Locals fear that people working at a nearby hydro-power project had been swept away, as well as villagers roaming near the river looking for firewood or grazing their cattle, Rana said. “We have no idea how many people are missing.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was closely monitoring the situation.

“India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,” he said on Twitter after speaking with the state chief minister.

India’s air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, the federal government said, while Home Minister Amit Shah said disaster-response teams were being airlifted in to help with relief and rescue.

“All the concerned officers are working on a war footing,” Shah said on Twitter, referring to Uttarakhand by its nickname, the Hindi term for “land of the gods” — due to the numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres located across the state.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous, also put its riverside areas on high alert.

Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the dam as well as whatever else was in its path.

Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.

“The flow of the Alaknanda River beyond Nandprayag [stretch] has become normal,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Twitter.

“The water level of the river is now one metre above normal but the flow is decreasing.”

Meanwhile, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, also expressed sorrow over the ""loss of precious lives due to flash floods caused by glacier break-off in Uttarakhand"".

Uttarakhand in the Himalayas is prone to flash floods and landslides. In June 2013, record rainfall caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the “Himalayan tsunami” by the media due to the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi’s party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

“When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2021/02/601fbde54f47e.png,"['100', 'minister', 'chief', 'uttarakhand', 'glacier', 'feared', 'water', 'away', 'state', 'himalayan', 'floods', 'india', 'bursts', 'dam', 'river', 'twitter', 'dead']", ,flood

It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.

Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.

This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.

The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.

Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.

The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.

Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

11,000 households (71,500 people) planned to be assisted by WFP

8,506 households (77 percent of households targeted) assisted by WFP as of 21 September

Highlights

The scale of damage and humanitarian needs caused by the floods have been significantly underreported in local and international media.

WFP started emergency food distributions on 8 September with its partners ACTED and HANDS.

Distributions in Malir (Karachi) and Umerkot districts have been completed. Distributions in Mirpur Khas and Sanghar are expected to be completed by 25 September.

WFP Funding Requirements

US$500,000 is needed to cover the costs of this emergency response and replenish the food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations.

Situation Update

The situation in rural areas is extremely worrying, both in terms of immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term impacts on livelihoods, food security and nutrition. While rains have stopped, many areas remain flooded and stagnant water is posing major health, nutrition and shelter issues.

Thousands of families displaced by the floods are still living by the side of the road, with little chance of returning home for at least another month and no employment opportunities in view given large-scale crop and livestock losses.

On 12 September, Sindh Chief Minister requested additional humanitarian assistance from the UN.

On 17-18 September, the UN Resident Coordinator and WFP Country Director visited a WFP food distribution and a UNICEF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) distribution in Mirpur Khas district. They met with the Mirpur Khas Commissioner, the Sindh Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the Sindh Chief Secretary, who expressed appreciation for WFP’s fast response.

At the request of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), UN and NGO partners are preparing to carry out a multisectoral needs assessment to inform mediumterm recovery needs, covering the 30 mostaffected districts across the country. This new assessment will complement the rapid joint needs assessment carried out during the first week of September.

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the city’s infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachi’s stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachi’s population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-’60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-’60s Karachi’s sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-’90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachi’s development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the women’s college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachi’s most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

Photo by Tahir Imran

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late ’80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and people’s investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistan’s foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachi’s sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3) — part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majesty’s government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for “capacity building.” Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at “good practices” and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established — a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, children’s play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadra’s assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Council’s annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

You need to be unbearably audacious to flaunt hypocrisy in the manner most members of the National Assembly have thoughtlessly employed for “expressing solidarity” with besieged and relentlessly bombed people of Palestine.

They took more than 90 minutes to assemble for the first sitting of another session of the National Assembly Monday evening. At the outset of it, Asad Qaisar, the Speaker, announced the decision of devoting the entire sitting to “the cause of Palestine only” and invited Shehbaz Sharif, the Opposition Leader, to initiate a yawn-inducing round of trivial speechmaking.

After spending many months in jail, the PML-N leader had reached Islamabad to attend the assembly session. He might not have been here, if the government had not stopped him from flying to London, with the permission of Lahore High Court.

Seriously suspending my cynical approach to “our representatives,” I tried hard to carefully listen to each word of his speech. Except narrating facts, which even a school going kid must know regarding the history of Palestine, he never cared to furnish anything fresh and attention-worthy.

Repeatedly, he kept urging the government to “lead from the front” in furnishing solace to constantly bombed Palestinians. How to go about it and with what strategy? He had no answer to it.

Still, he did admit that “emotional speeches” wouldn’t deliver any protection to abandoned people of Palestine. But forcefully suggested that the coming Friday should be observed as “Al Quds” day. The day of solidarity should end with a visit to UN Offices in Islamabad to handover a resolution in support of the people of Palestine, unanimously prepared by all the political parties of Pakistan. The expected resolution should also ask the United Nations Security Council to instantly move to stop Israel from vicious and barbaric attacks on Palestinian territory.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the foreign minister, on the other hand, consumed more time to reveal that Prime Minister Imran Khan had already been working around the clock to develop a workable strategy to check Israel with constant contacts with the rest of Islamic countries. Thanks to his persistence, Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was finally motivated to hold a series of SOS meetings.

While profusely welcoming the activist role of the OIC, Shah Mahmood Qureshi also recalled with a hurt heart that the US had vetoed against a UNSC resolution, which attempted to condemn Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians but failed to explain how to convince the Biden administration to behave otherwise.

He seemed quite proud in claiming that foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s concern with grateful words. Doing this, he conveniently forgot that Israel’s recent barrages of bombs were primarily targeting Gaza-confined Palestinians and so far the people living in the West Bank had been spared. And Hamas and not the Palestinian Authority is in complete control of Gaza.

Similarly, he sounded laughably naïve while stressing that after failing in getting some relief from the UN Security Council, the OIC should now force the UN to hold an urgent General Assembly sitting. To ensure the same, he would leave for Turkey Monday night and from there intends to fly on to New York, hopefully along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Sudan, to intensify lobbying for an emergency session of the UN General Assembly on Palestine.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi is not a novice to foreign affairs; he had been our foreign minister during the Gillani-led PPP government as well. He surely needs no tutor to discover that UN General Assembly has no mandate to actively engage in atrocity-stopping actions. That remains the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council.

Our Foreign Minister also felt excited about the series of protest marches in metropolitan cities like London, Paris and Berlin etc. Praising these marches, he indeed appeared completely oblivious to embarrassing indifference that many metropolitan cities of the Muslim countries were displaying these days regarding the ceaseless atrocities in Gaza.

In the end, however, he had to helplessly admit that United States of America remained the one and only country, relishing leverage vis-à-vis Israel. Keeping this in mind, he also had focused on recent events in Palestine during his telephone conversation with the US Secretary of State Sunday evening.

Referring to the same conversation, he suddenly switched to criticize the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, and began raising serious questions regarding his conduct during a critical phase of the Afghan issue, when the US and the NATO forces had already announced the intent of leaving Afghanistan by September 11, 2001.

His comments regarding Afghanistan made me suspect that the ‘end game’ in that war torn country was not moving according to the plan Pakistan might have imagined. Things rather appear heading to fear-inducing explosion in our immediate neighborhood. Yet, our foreign minister kept feeling too proud in suggesting as if Pakistan was set to play a leading role to protect Palestine from Israel’s atrocities.

Delivering bombastic speeches, our worthy members should also have done sincere soul searching. Around two years ago on August 5, 2019, Modi government of India had unilaterally revoked the ‘special status of the Occupied Kashmir. After announcing the said decision, it enforced a ruthless lockdown on the Valley of Kashmir. Its brute clamp down clearly emulated tactics, Zionists had been employing to encroach into Palestinian territories since 1948.

“Our representatives,” crowding the National Assembly miserably failed to imagine an effective strategy to ensure pushing back of the Indian onslaught on occupied Kashmir. With the start of 2021, we rather started to get a flood of credible-sounding stories, strongly suggesting that India and Pakistan were now seeking peace with each other through ‘backdoor negotiations.”

The nonstop flood of such stories never motivated our “supreme to all” pretending parliamentarians to force the Imran government and its foreign minister to stand up in the National Assembly or the Senate to explain even cursory details related to reported “negotiations.” While most of them keep boasting that the issue of Kashmir remains the core existential question for Pakistan. They remained equally clueless regarding the recent development in Afghanistan. Yet the same parliamentarians hardly felt any shame in flaunting “deep concerns” for the people of Palestine and boastfully pretending as if they have finally found a workable strategy to furnish solace to their wounds.","Mon, 17 May 2021 21:39:47 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-05-18/delivering-bombastic-speeches-1621287582-6148.jpg,"['assembly', 'minister', 'bombastic', 'strategy', 'pakistan', 'speeches', 'national', 'regarding', 'foreign', 'kashmir', 'palestinian', 'delivering', 'palestine']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Indus Water Commission (PCIW) will raise the issue of delaying flood data by India during the annual meeting of the commission on March 23-24.

The meeting is taking place after a hiatus of nearly three years, with the last being held in Lahore in August 2018.

Last year's meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.

As per the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.



Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehr Ali said the Pakistani delegation will leave for New Delhi on March 22 where the meeting would take place.

What will be discussed in the meeting?

Shah will lead the Pakistani delegation whereas the Indian side will be headed by PK Saxena.

“Controversial projects of 1000 MW Pakkal Dal and 48 MW Lower Kalnai will be discussed during the two-day meeting. Pakistan has already raised objections on the design of these projects,” he said.

The top official of the Indus Water Commission said two more water projects -Darbuk and Nemochaling – will also come under discussion, adding that the issue of delaying flood data will also be raised with New Delhi.

“India has been violating the Indus Basin Agreement in providing flood data for 2 years. Pakistan wants daily flood data from July 1 to October 10,” Mehar noted.

62,62,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag - Reuters",https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN23F03B,"ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

MELTING GLACIERS

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

DANGER AHEAD

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system can’t come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer”.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['warning', 'cut', 'surges', 'climate', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'change', 'village', 'efforts', 'outburst', 'flood', 'drag', 'walls', 'early', 'melt', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood
63,63,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Why is Karachi drowning and could we have prevented it? - Euronews,https://www.euronews.com/green/2020/09/07/why-is-karachi-drowning-and-could-we-have-prevented-it-,"Anmol Irfan is a writer, feminist, and founder of Perspective Magazine. Here she shares her views on how the largest city in Pakistan should not have ignored warnings about the climate crisis.

Karachi is drowning.

Over the last week, torrential rains have ravaged Pakistan’s cosmopolitan hub. Breaking records of over 90 years, the city has been flooded as its systems and infrastructure find themselves unable to cope with the unprecedented amount of rainfall.

But how much does this have to do with climate change?

The city’s inability to deal with rain isn’t exactly a revelation - previous years have seen monsoon seasons cause substantial damage. But this year, it’s a crisis like never before. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has reported 63 deaths in rain related incidents already, while entire residential areas and markets have been submerged, causing millions of rupees worth of damage to houses and businesses.

The onslaught of such a disaster has come as a shock to locals who wonder why officials didn’t put preventative measures in place, with full knowledge that the rainy season was coming.

“It’s not something that’s happened recently. This has been 30-40 years in the making,” explains Vice Chairman of the Lahore Development Authority, SM Imran. The neglect of Karachi’s development is cited as the main reason behind the city’s current crisis. Despite the city’s importance to Pakistan’s economy and development, sustainable growth of the city has never been a political priority, he adds.

As roads collapse and sewage systems overflow, questions are arising as to where years worth of taxpayers money has gone. Residents of various areas in the city are experiencing three-day long power shortages and stagnant water blocking the streets.

Did Karachi ignore the warnings?

Karachi’s situation is a glaring example of what can happen when climate change warnings and sustainable growth are neglected - in favour of political optics and superficial development.

In a country that has faced significant damage in the past due to droughts, this influx of rain could have been a game changer. But instead, a lack of preparation has turned what should have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster.

To make matters worse, the drainage system which collapsed in DHA, supposedly the posh area of the city, was built in 2007 and residents were charged for it.

A lack of preparation has turned what could have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster

Moving forward, it is imperative we understand exactly where the problem lies. The lost lives and flooding are horrific enough - but the damage they have caused may not be fixed for years to come.

Pakistan’s already debt-ridden economy will now have to face the harrowing consequences of redoing entire sewage systems, rehabilitating thousands of people and businesses and possibly risk losing their main port city.

How will the city recover?

This year’s disaster has proven that there is no time to be lost. Priorities need to be set in order for changes to be made. Instead of focusing on other aspects of infrastructure that contribute very little to the city’s growth, Imran believes the focus now needs to be on water conservation and treatment.

For Imran, Israel is a good example we can learn from. Its Ashkelon facility provided for 70 per cent of the country’s water demands through a process of seawater desalination. A city that craved rainfall is now richer in water resources. This just shows that we can harness the effects of climate change in our favour, if we know how to. What’s needed now is a complete overhaul of what we thought our future would be, explains Imran.

Karachi has been labelled “resilient” many times over the years. But as the city descends into worse conditions, its resilience is no longer a compliment but an excuse. No longer can this idea of resilience be used to ignore its exacerbating problems.

One possible solution is for local governments to do more than just pass bills. Many now believe that programmes should be put in place to teach employees how best to reuse water and treat rubbish.

Currently though, political solutions seem too little too late, and citizens are stepping up to rehabilitate the city themselves.

Citizens are coming to the rescue

Among the many initiatives taken over by relief workers and organisations, is Saturday Welfare Group (SWG). What started as a group of friends wanting to provide rehabilitation to marginalised communities in Pakistan has grown into a powerful initiative that steps up in times of crisis.

“Everyone is equal who is contributing to or working for welfare,” is their motto.

A resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) protests against failure to fix drainage pipes. AFP

It's a motto that couldn’t be more fitting with the situation Karachi now finds itself in. Both within the country and among the Pakistani diaspora, fundraising is at an all-time high. It’s a testament to the idea that there are people who want change, and are ready to work for it - they just need an opportunity. Development in Karachi should be carried out on a much more equal scale, and perhaps those truly working for change will finally get the attention they deserve.

Recovery will be a long road, and hopefully when political action begins to reflect the needs of the hour, it will be up to residents to play their role as well. Pollution and littering is a major problem the city struggles with. As trash from the streets finds its way into drainage pipes, it blocks the very waterways that are meant to save the city from such disasters. Conservation initiatives need to be better understood.

This is a responsibility that lies with the educated strata of society, who have the power and resources to implement these initiatives and make them accessible to the masses. Feigning ignorance over harmful habits and actions is no longer a valid excuse.","Mon, 07 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/93/76/44/1000x563_cmsv2_7fe7a6a1-6ce3-5379-ad73-e8d45fe149d9-4937644.jpg,"['development', 'political', 'city', 'climate', 'change', 'water', 'damage', 'worth', 'drowning', 'karachi', 'prevented', 'citys']", ,flood

Residents complained of sewage on the streets and in water tanks. Power was out in several areas for days amid sweltering heat and humidity. The outage also caused disruptions in cellphone service, interrupting emergency management and leaving citizens out of touch with loved ones.

In some cases, the electricity cables broke, causing fears of electrocution.

""Few residents located in these zones have also requested us not to power up supply since it may be a safety hazard for them,"" tweeted Karachi's electricity provider, K-Electric.

Meanwhile, authorities said another weather system was hovering over Sindh province, increasing the likelihood of more rains in the coming days.

The large metropolis, considered to be Pakistan's economic lifeline, has faced problems of overcrowding and unplanned development since the country's independence in 1947.

""[A] very large majority of its population lives in informal settlements in poorly designed housing with inadequate services,"" according to a 2017 working paper, titled, ""Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi.""

Much of the city's planning woes have been exacerbated over the decades due to corruption coupled with political rivalries among local, provincial and federal governments.

Parts of Karachi are owned by the federal government. In addition, local and provincial governments have set up parallel structures of service delivery, like trash pickup, diluting resources.

""We need to clearly understand who is responsible for what. Until the municipal functions are divided between the federal and provincial governments, problems of delivery will remain,"" Murtaza Wahab, the spokesman for Sindh government, told local news channel Geo News.

According to the working paper, bad governance and development shortcomings in Karachi ""have created vulnerabilities at different scales that are likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change-related weather events taking place within the city and elsewhere in the country.""

Development professional Zaigham Khan said overcrowding and slum developments were a result of the city absorbing the social and economic problems of the entire country.

""If there is terrorism in FATA (erstwhile tribal area), locals move to Karachi. When there is war in Afghanistan, the most refugees arrive in Karachi. When there are floods in the country, the affected go to Karachi. If there is insurgency in Balochistan, locals escape to Karachi. If there are no jobs in southern Punjab, the preferred refuge is Karachi,"" he said.

The directives were issued by the prime minister while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Floods here on Monday, according to an announcement by the PM Office.

Besides the NDMA chief, the meeting was attended by federal Minister for Information Shibli Faraz, Communications Minister Murad Saeed, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda, the director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the chairmen of the National Highways Authority and Federal Flood Commission (FFC).

The provincial chief secretaries also participated in the meeting through a video link. The chief secretaries informed the prime minister about the damages caused by recent floods and rains in their respective provinces.

The NDMA chairman briefed the prime minister on the situation in various parts of the country after the recent spells of monsoon and the damages caused by these heavy rains. He also apprised the prime minister about the relief activities being carried out by the NDMA in different parts of the country affected due to rains.

Meeting reviews relief activities being carried out in rain-affected areas

The officials of the PMD and Flood Commission informed the prime minister that most parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, had received more rains than the past. The meeting participants were informed that almost all the rivers were having medium flow of water.

The prime minister was told that there were “strong chances” that the ongoing monsoon season would come to an end by the middle of this month and the chances of more flood-like situation were very low.

The meeting’s participants were also apprised about the relief operation being carried out by the country’s armed forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister stressed the need for more coordination among all the federal and provincial departments concerned to face the challenge they were facing due to climate changes.

PM Khan was also informed that all dams in the country were full of water and the situation of water availability was satisfactory.

The country’s major reservoirs had already reached their full capacity last month following the countrywide rainfalls and both Tarbela and Mangla dams had attained their maximum conservation levels.

The FFC attributes the filling of dams to effective management of inflows and outflows of the reservoirs, especially by Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).

It has advised the dams operating authorities, including the Flood Monitoring Cell of Mangla, Irsa (Indus River System Authority) and the PMD, to take utmost care and exercise extra vigilance of the reservoirs’ operation.

The combined live storage of major reservoirs — Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — was reported at 13.425 million acre feet (MAF) on Aug 28, which accounted for 98.61 per cent of the 13.614 MAF maximum storage capacity, a record water availability during last 10 years.

According to Wapda, water available in Tarbela and Mangla dams was 2.173 MAF more when compared to last 10 years’ average. The average water availability in the two dams during the last 10 years on the day was recorded at 11.163 MAF.

This better hydrological situation will aptly fulfil the requirement of water for the country’s agriculture in the days to come. More water availability in the reservoirs will also result in more hydel generation in the coming days.

The heavy rainfall spell occurred over the past few days in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi, had caused severe urban flooding in the provincial capital.

The prime minister had visited Karachi last week and in the presence of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a package of Rs1.1 trillion at Governor House to resolve Karachi’s lingering and chronic issues, including provision of clean drinking water, cleaning of drains and sewage and solid waste disposal within three years.

Later, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stated that the Sindh government would contribute Rs800 billion to the Rs1.1tr package for Karachi, saying that they “welcome the Rs300 billion funding from the federal government for Karachi’s infrastructure development”.

On Sunday, however, federal Minister for Planning and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of PTI told a press conference that the federal government would bear 62 per cent of the total amount of Rs1,100 billion announced by the prime minister.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country.

Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged.

The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

""River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,"" reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history.

TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding.

The first day of aid distribution benefitted more than 12,000 people, with the campaign to continue for an entire month.

In his speech delivered in the presence of Sindh Province Governor Imran Ismail during the distribution of urgent relief aid, Al Zaabi said that the humanitarian support provided to the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan at the direction of the UAE’s leadership is part of the campaign’s efforts to rescue people and improve their living conditions.

Al Zaabi and Ismail also discussed ways of enhancing their ties in areas of mutual concern for both countries, most notably economic. Al Zaabi then briefed Ismail about available opportunities and the investment environment in the UAE, stressing that there are many opportunities for exchanging visits and organising commercial events, conferences and workshops.

During the meeting, Al Zaabi praised the deep overall relations between the UAE and Pakistan, whose foundations were established by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

The chief minister of Sindh praised the bilateral ties between the two countries and stressed the importance of reinforcing them in all economic, commercial and development aid areas.

70,70,FL-2019-000087-PAK,UK pledges support for victims of devastating floods in Pakistan - GOV.UK,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-pledges-support-for-victims-of-devastating-floods-in-pakistan,"The announcement was made by Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister of State for South Asia at the UK’s Foreign Commonwealth & Development Office, during a virtual visit to Pakistan where he also discussed with the Government of Pakistan how Britain could work with them to tackle climate change.

The £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to many who have lost their homes. It comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks including hygiene kits and tarpaulins to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Lord Ahmad said:

Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands with Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.

The UK aid announced today will ensure life-saving clean water, sanitation and shelter gets to those who need it most. The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be - and the dangers of climate change.

During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.

British High Commissioner Christian Turner CMG said:

Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from COVID-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year. He discussed with the Government of Pakistan how the UK can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet the Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations, and trade ties, and he also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in South Punjab. The UK has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly 8 million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The Minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the COVID-19 surveillance centre. He met the Coordinator National Emergency Operations Centre Dr Rana Safdar who briefed the Minister on Pakistan’s response to COVID-19. Lastly, he was scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

Notes to editors:

In Sindh, according to data from the Meteorological Department, rainfall in August was the highest since recordkeeping began 89 years ago. In Karachi, rainwaters devastated factory stock and caused mass power outages. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected” and local disaster management teams together with NGOs, supported by the military, have been rescuing stranded people, providing medical aid, and food rations. Initial assessments by District authorities suggest that more than 2.5m people have been affected across the worst-hit districts of Badin, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal and Sanghar. In all, monsoon rains have resulted in the death of over 230 people and damaged over 2,600 houses across Pakistan, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The UK has committed at least £11.6 billion in International Climate Finance over the next five years, and will invest £13 million in Pakistan this year on tackling climate change. This will include supporting local communities adapt to climate change and improve resilience through emergency disaster planning and helping to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.

71,71,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Minar-i-Pakistan lawns flooded with water - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594825,"White Star

LAHORE: The government on Tuesday flooded the Minar-i-Pakistan lawns, the venue of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)’s Dec 13 public meeting, which the opposition termed a ‘failed effort’ to sabotage its power show.

In a related move, the Buzdar administration also rushed to enforce ‘smart lockdown’ in 45 areas of Lahore, including those close to the rally’s venue. The opposition also smells a rat in this move, saying the PTI government is taking every step to stop the opposition from holding the rally here but it will fail.

The government is also taking other measures — registering cases against those taking part in the PDM corner meetings and rallies and warning the caterers to extend their services to the PDM for its rallies — ahead of its (PDM) Dec 13 power show.

The government has not yet given permission to the PDM to hold a rally at Minar-i-Pakistan citing Covid-19 measures.

Ahead of PDM’s Multan rally on Nov 30, the government had adopted similar tactics but the opposition had held the rally on the road.

Learning about the government’s tactics, the PML-N leaders rushed to Minar-i-Pakistan and shut hosepipes.

“The PTI government released water at Minar-i-Pakistan in the early hours of Tuesday. When we learnt about it we rushed there and stopped further watering (by the administration),” PML-N lawmaker from Mohni Road Bilal Yasin told reporters at the venue.

He said Imran Khan had got so upset over Maryam Nawaz’s rallies in the city on Monday that an order was placed to flood the Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday.

“I ask Imran Khan to at least respect his office of the prime minister,” he said.

Commenting upon release of water at PDM’s rally venue, Maryam Nawaz said in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”

Special Assistant to CM Punjab for Information Firdous Ashiq Awan clarified that only three to four kanals of Minar-e-Pakistan were watered.

“The way life of plants is connected with water, similarly Rajkumari (Maryam)’s life is connected with lies,” she said in a tweet.

During the last three days the Lahore police registered over 20 FIRs booking over 2,000 PML-N workers and leaders for committing Covid-19 SOPs violation and road block.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb, Talal Chaudhry, MNA Malik Riaz and MNA Shizra Mansab are among the PML-N leaders booked.

Maryam Nawaz told reporters at Jati Umra that the FIRs had been registered against over 3,000 PML-N workers which showed how much unnerved the government had been.

The PML-N also held a convention here to mobilise workers for the Dec 13 rally.

Speaking on the occasion, Khwaja Asif said 130 MNAs of the opposition would resign and they could not be stopped from doing so.

“It is a sin to sit in the assemblies which cannot stop corruption and price hike,” he said and added the PTI had realised that these assemblies could not run any more.

Talking to reporters Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Fascist and incompetent Imran Khan is obsessed with persecuting the PML-N leadership, especially Shehbaz Sharif, while the entire nation suffers at the hands of his disastrous rule.”

She said the level of this selected prime minister was that he was threatening the vendors of chairs and tents with FIRs.

Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told Dawn that the government was taking legal action against the PDM for violating Covid-19 SOPs. “We cannot allow the opposition to violate the law,” she said and added if caterers or others provided services to the opposition for holding an assembly of more than 300 people they would also be booked under the law.

72,72,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"In Pakistan, meltwater from glaciers is causing devastating flash floods, and the dwindling of ice-shields affects the entire nation - D+C Development and Cooperation",https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pakistan-meltwater-glaciers-causing-devastating-flash-floods-and-dwindling-ice-shields,"Flash floods are becoming more common in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Local communities are most at risk – but glacier melt also affects people who live far away from the mountains.

More than a century ago, a catastrophe struck Barikan Kot. This mountain village was flooded by a sudden outburst of water from the Hinarchi glacier. The reason was the bursting of an ice wall which had held back a lake of meltwater that had formed on the glacier. About 100 families lost their homes and livelihoods as rocks, earth and debris were swept over the village and its orchards and fertile land.

In the past, this kind of flash flood occurred rarely. That has changed. The Bagrote valley in the Karakoram mountain range in northern Pakistan now suffers several of them every year. Global warming is affecting glaciers all over the world, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya is no exception. Especially in the summer months, melting ice leads to new glacial lakes which, in turn, can cause flash floods.

Aisha Khan of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC) – a private organisation working on climate change – warns that glacial lake-outburst floods are becoming ever more likely. “The impacts are catastrophic,” she points out. In recent years, several dozens of people have been killed, and many more families have lost their livelihoods. The local communities tend to be disadvantaged and poor. According to Aisha Khan, the challenge is to tell them in simple language why the environment is changing and what they can do to adapt.

The civil-society activist insists that women in particular must be prepared to respond appropriately. They have a crucial role to play in evacuation, first aid and rescue and relief operations, Aisha Khan says. She wants all risk-management measures to reflect both the social conditions in the village and the scientific insights.

Syed Zahid Hussain Shah agrees that the risks are increasing and must be controlled. He was the field manager of a project run by the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) that served this purpose from 2011 to 2016. He reports that the Hinarchi glacier is only 16 kilometres long today. It was about 12 % longer 30 years ago, and its ice-shield was higher too.

Pakistan has more than 7,000 glaciers. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 36 are dangerous. Some 7 million people are exposed to the risk of glacial lake-outburst floods, which typically occur in July and August, the warmest months.

The project Zahid worked for took several risk-mitigating initiatives in Bagrote valley. A bridge and protective walls were built. Moreover, streams were excavated and made deeper, so they can carry more water. The project set up four digitised weather stations that automatically relay information pertaining to possible glacial lake outbursts. Thanks to them, it has become possible to warn local communities early on.

The weather stations have helped to save many lives. Hussain Ali, who lives in a mountain village, appreciates them: “Early warning allows people to shift to safer places.” Nonetheless, he says that flash floods have killed more than 20 people in his area in recent years. Moreover, such extreme weather events have killed livestock and destroyed orchards and fields. Several dozen households were therefore forced to move from the mountain villages down into the valley, where it is easier, but nonetheless still quite difficult to eke out a living for people who have lost all assets.

The government of Pakistan and UNDP are now running a follow-up project in the region. It is called the “Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II)” project. GLOF stands for glacial lake-outburst flood. The budget for the years 2017 to 2021 is $ 37 million. The project will cover 15 districts and benefit approximately 29 million people.

The mountain regions of Pakistan’s neighbouring countries Afghanistan, India and China face the same kind of risk for the same reasons. Irfan Tariq, a former director general of Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change, points out that “the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range is a very sensitive ecological system”. It is very difficult to control or limit the impacts of climate change on glaciers, he says, so Pakistan’s government is closely monitoring the glaciers.



The big picture

The melting of the glaciers has impacts far beyond the mountain ranges. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas feed Asia’s most important rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtse. Hundreds of millions of people depend on these waters. Indeed, Asian civilisations have benefited from the glaciers stabilising water supply throughout the seasons for millennia (see Sheila Mysorekar in the Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/09). As the glaciers dwindle, human-built infrastructure will have to serve the functions the glaciers performed naturally in the past.

In this context, dams matter very much. Related infrastructure is vulnerable to glacial lake-outburst floods however. Should a major glacial lake outburst cause a veritable mountain tsunami, the damage may be serious. Syed Mehr Ali Shah from Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources says: “We are very much concerned with the bigger glacial lake-outburst flood events, with regards to the safety of our existing hydraulic infrastructures, which include Tarbela dam.” This dam is more than 140 metres high and serves the purposes of hydropower, irrigation and flood control.

There are several major dams in northern Pakistan, and a new one is currently being built. The wall of Diamer Bhasha dam will be more than 250 metres high. The safety of these structures is very important, says Mehr: “We need to protect them from any kind of dam-break phenomenon.” The officer expresses his confidence in the structures being strong enough to withstand typical glacial lake-outburst floods. He says the Diamer Bhasha reservoir has been designed to bear any dam-break wave that occurs due to such flood. At the same time, spillways ensure that excess water can be channelled away.

But even if dams can be built to withstand flash floods, mega dams cause environmental problems in their own right. Experts warn, moreover, that ever more sophisticated and expensive infrastructure will be needed to adapt societies to global warning. If environmental change spins out of control, adaptation will prove impossible for ever more people.

Ultimately, there is no alternative to mitigating climate change. Pakistan, however, only emits about one ton of carbon per head and year, according to Climate Analytics, an independent monitoring initiative. This comparatively small figure means that other countries which emit far more must assume responsibility and assist countries like Pakistan to build their resilience to climate change.

73,73,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Rapid Need Assessment Urban Flooding Karachi - July 2020 - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/rapid-need-assessment-urban-flooding-karachi-july-2020,"Background

On Sunday 26th July-2020 weather system brought heavy rains in Karachi. According to data provided by the MET Office, the highest rainfall was recorded in Gulistan-e-Johar, at 66 millimeters (mm), while 55 mm was registered at Old Airport, 55 mm in Pehlwan Goth, 42 mm in Malir, Saddar 43 millimeters (mm), while 26 mm was registered at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Faisal Base, 22mm in Nazimabad, 12mm at PAF Masroor Base, 8.8mm at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, 3.1mm in Landhi, and 1.2mm in Surjani Town.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), city received more than 80 mm rainfall in the third spell of the monsoon and more rain is expected in this season. The heavy to moderate rainfall caused flooding in low lying areas of the city and inundated several key roads, causing problems for the commuters as administration remained helpless and even absent at some locations despite a prior warning from the met officials. Nipa Chowrangi, Gurumandir Chowrangi, Shahrai-e-Faisal, Hassan Square turned into large water pools, as motorcyclists and four-wheelers could be witnessed trapped in water high up to knee-level. According to the initial reports from media and local communities, in many areas there is still stagnant water in streets and houses that overflowed from Nullahs. Those areas included Orangi Town, Khairabad Police Ground area, Ali Garh Market, Disco Morr, Islam Chowk, Bangla Bazar, Neepa Chowrangi, Gulshan-e- Iqbal, and Hyderi in North Nazimabad.

Root causes for the urban flooding in Karachi

In the last fourty years, Karachi city has been facings severe problems due to heavy rains in monsoon season as there are serious issues with the drainage system in Karachi. Despite accepting the brutal reality of the situation, one can not blame any institution but the responsibility lied with the Provincial government, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and District Munciple Corporations (DMCs) and private housing societies to keep clean the drains of Karachi and to drain out all the rainwater from the city.

In the city, as visible to all, width of many rain water drains and Nullah have been reduced, on many construcuton have been done, and most of them are choked with garbage. Information collected through different sources revealed that there are many structures and building have been constructed over the drain of Soldier bazar incuding two banks, gold shops / market, one section of girls high school, Shaheen complex, car parking area of supreme court, district NAB office, KMC market and Aurganzeb market. In Lyari, on Muhammad Shah road, part of Kakri ground, meat market and two masjids are constructed on one of the drain.

The width of the drainage of Manzoor colony on Korangi road has been reduced and near Qayoomabad, Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has constructed bungalows over the same drainage. Drain that starts from Cantt station to Clifton has a 50 feet width but due to construction of Jamat Khana, its width has been reduced to 36 ft, which drain out in Nahar e Khayam. Drain of Madina colony and Singer chowrangi are also in the same condition.

Width of the largest drain Nullah of Oragni town, has been reduced due to encroachment on both sides, that’s why there was a flood in recent days because of heavy rains of monsoon. Width of Mianwali drainage has been reduced by soil pipe instaltions by KDA into it and now very little amount of rain water flows through it.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1529694-HANDS%20RNA%20Urban%20Flooding%20Karachi%20July%202020.png?itok=3ubSxtIF,"['mm', 'city', 'pakistan', 'need', 'assessment', '2020', 'water', 'drain', 'flooding', 'rapid', 'karachi', 'urban', 'market', 'width', 'reduced', 'drainage', 'heavy']", ,flood

(AP)

Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood-like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country. Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged. The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

“River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,” reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history. TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding. The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

“Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,” it said.

“Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,” it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the “rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September”.

Monsoon rains hit the sub-continent every year in the summer, bringing heavy downpour and floods that displace hundreds and thousands of people.","Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/09/Pakistan-weather-1200.jpg,"['showed', 'rains', 'rivers', 'level', 'pakistan', 'water', '13', 'killed', 'flood', 'country', 'ndma', 'heavy', 'lash', 'reported']", ,flood

The fatality is the first confirmed death in New South Wales since the catastrophic weather event began. Authorities confirmed the Pakistani National was driving a hire car when he hit trouble and made several attempts to escape before his care experienced a possible electronic failure. He spent almost an hour on the phone to triple-0 before losing contact with emergency services who responded to reports at 6:30am on Wednesday. The Daily Telegraph is reporting the incident occurred on the corner of Cattai Ridge Road and Hidden Valley Lane in Glenorie, with the man’s body and vehicle discovered at 1:10pm yesterday.

A Pakistani national killed in Sydney floodwaters was on the phone to emergency services and tried desperately to free himself from his car but he could not get out.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was on his first day as a contractor when his Toyota Camby became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on Sydney’s northern outskirts.

Farhat Jaffri, from the Pakistan Association of Australia, said he had spoken to the man’s father.

Mr Younus, from Malir Cantt Karachi, was studying software engineering and had two elder brothers and one younger sister, Mr Jaffri said.

“Family has requested to send the body back to Karachi,” Mr Jaffri said.

“I have requested to Consul General to take care of this matter and offered any assistance from Pakistan Association of Australia.”

“You can only just imagine somebody fighting for their life to get out of the car – that’s what the inside damage of the car looked like,” Detective Inspector Chris Laird said as he described the horrific scene on Wednesday.

Police said the man called emergency services just before 6.30am after he became trapped in floodwaters on Cattai Ridge Road in Glenorie.

He managed to stay on the phone to Triple-0 for nearly 40 minutes until the connection was lost.

His vehicle was later found just after 1pm with his body inside.

Inspector Laird said the 25-year-old man was on the first day of a new contracting job.

“We can only speculate that he may have not known the area as locals would … he may not have seen the water as he drove in given the fact that the gates across the road were completely submerged,” he told reporters.

“Sadly, in hindsight we can always say never drive into a swollen road and that will form part of our inquiries.”

Inspector Laird described the man’s death as an “absolute tragedy” and said it was a miracle no one else had been killed in Sydney’s catastrophic floods.

“We can only speculate again that, given what I have seen and the damage to the vehicle, that it could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car, which is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

“Also, the fact that he was on the phone for so long is even more tragic and is going to form part of our inquiries as to what actually went on in the car and why this tragic accident occurred.”

Inspector Laird said there were no broken windows and the man “clearly couldn’t get out”.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.

Just hours after telling reporters it was “simply a miracle” there had been no deaths in the wildly destructive floods, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told parliament the state had recorded its first fatality.

“Unfortunately, we have received news of a fatality in the northwest of Sydney flood waters,” she said during question time on Wednesday afternoon.

“Because it’s early stages, I will allow emergency services to comment at the appropriate time to ensure arrangements have been made with next of kin.”

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also addressed the tragedy in federal parliament.

“It underscores the messages everybody from the NSW Premier, the Prime Minister down have been issuing over recent days, and that is, please, do not enter these floodwaters.”



Scott Morrison expressed his deepest condolences, on behalf of the parliament to the man’s family.

“As the floodwaters recede and the clean-up begins ... their house will be dark and their grief will be great because their loss will not recede,” Mr Morrison said.

“I just pray a blessing on their family.”

He also paid tribute to the NSW police officers who responded to the incident.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese joined the Prime Minister in expressing his regret for “this tragic loss of life”.

“A family has lost a loved one, with no doubt that although the person has not been identified, his friends, his community will be feeling this loss very soon,” Mr Albanese said.

He reiterated that water and cars “don’t mix”, reminding Australians it was better to be delayed than to take risks during the significant weather event lashing the east coast.

Mr Albanese said no more lives being lost over the past few days was a credit to Australians.

NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

78,78,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Death toll from flooding in northwest Pakistan rises to 48 - CTV News,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/death-toll-from-flooding-in-northwest-pakistan-rises-to-48-1.5091540,"PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN -- Flash floods triggered by week-long monsoon rains that have hit northwestern Pakistan, including the scenic Swat Valley, have brought the death toll to 48, a government spokesman said Thursday.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged or swept away. The army has joined relief and rescue operations across Pakistan, which has been hard hit by rains this summer.

Key roads that have been blocked by large rocks dislodged in mudslides are being cleared, according to Taimur Khan, spokesman for the disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Before Thursday's updated death toll, the province had said 15 died in the floods.

Overall, about 200 people have been killed in rain-related incidents since July, when monsoon rains began lashing many areas in Pakistan. According to government officials, 101 have died in rain-related incidents in southern Sindh province, which includes the country's financial hub of Karachi.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September.","Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.5091566.1599162934!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg,"['rains', 'northwest', 'monsoon', 'spokesman', 'pakistan', 'hit', 'toll', 'province', 'flooding', 'rainrelated', 'died', 'rises', 'incidents', '48', 'death']", ,flood
79,79,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hits', 'infrastructure', 'climate', 'global', 'change', 'flooded', 'water', 'flooding', 'asia', 'floods', 'region', 'flood', 'river', 'hardest', 'risk']", ,flood_and_drought
80,80,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Sydney flood death: another man rescued day before in same place - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/25/sydney-flood-death-another-man-rescued-day-before-in-same-place,"Another driver was rescued from flood waters near Cattai Creek in Sydney’s north-west, a day before a 25-year-old man died when he became trapped in his car at the same location.

A local resident, who did not want to be named to protect his privacy, told the Guardian that he had pulled a young driver from the same location on Tuesday.

He had been moving his farming equipment on Tuesday morning when his father told him that someone appeared to be stuck in flood waters near their property on Cattai Ridge Road, close to Cattai Creek.

When they went to check it out, they saw “a young man trapped inside his car with approximately 300ml of air space left”.

“The car interior was almost full with water.”

The man used his bobcat to tow the car out of the water “with the young man visibly shaken”.

When police arrived, the resident said officers told him that the p-plate driver had been on the phone with them for “at least 45 minutes”.

The 25-year-old Pakistani national who died at the location on Wednesday morning had been on the phone with emergency services for more than 40 minutes before contact was lost.

NSW police Det Insp Chris Laird suggested his hire car’s electrical system may have failed, preventing him from escaping.

“The triple zero operator did continue to maintain contact with the 25-year-old male as he was in the car. However, at 7.04am, it’s believed contact was lost with the male. Police arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to find the car.”

Police said the man was driving a new car – a Toyota Camry – and it was unclear why he could not escape in time.

Laird said the flood gate blocking the road and signage was 10 metres underwater when they found his body.

“The actual gate blocking the road was underwater by 10 metres,” Det Insp Chris Laird said at a press conference on Wednesday.

“Given the unprecedented water levels, the gates could not be seen from the roadway at all. What has happened is a complete tragedy.”

The local resident questioned why the road had not been closed or proper signage installed to prevent other drivers making the same mistake.

“This tragedy could have been avoided had the roads been properly closed or manned. In addition, existing flood gates should be positioned above the one-in-100-year flood line.”

He also said that the very shape of the road, which dips into a valley and has many sudden turns, made it extremely dangerous during floods.

“Part of the problem was that the flood gate that closes the road was submerged under the flood waters and, upon approaching the sharp bend, there was no way for a driver to realise there was water across the road, especially in the dark early hours of the morning.”

He said that there was a barricade installed before the bend, but that when the man died there on Wednesday, the lights were not working.

“There was a part barricade 1km beforehand, but the lights were not working. The flashing lights have since been installed on Wednesday and are now working correctly.”

Police have not provided a response after being reached for comment.

Emergency services across Australia have been urging people never to drive through flood water, after another man was found dead in flood waters in the Gold Coast hinterland.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received more than 11,000 calls for assistance during the floods, including 976 rescues.

It rescued a total of 62 people on Wednesday and a total of 994 since the weather event began. More than 1,600 rescue teams have been activated across the state and more than 1,500 volunteers are currently in the field.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969cd513598d77df59155cdb2b6c46022f4de0df/0_360_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f7dff4f8d12d62c805a3bb2f77edf1b,"['resident', 'place', 'driver', 'sydney', 'car', 'water', 'road', 'young', 'waters', 'flood', 'rescued', 'told', 'man', 'death', 'day']", ,flood
81,81,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Karachi business grapples with the aftermath of flooding - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576950,"KARACHI: As the water level receded, business and industry struggled to restore normalcy around the mega city. Fuel pumps ran dry, telecom towers fell out of service and many ATM machines were either not functioning or empty of cash.

Those few pumps where fuel was available were mobbed by motorbikes and cars as well as scores of people holding jerry cans to carry fuel for generators as the city-wide power outage extended beyond 24 hours.

People thronged to supermarkets and corner shops to replenish food stocks, only to find them shut or flooded, and in some cases, the large sections of the artificial ceilings had fallen in as rain water seeped through the roof.

“Fuel supplies at the terminals in Keamari are ample” an executive from a large oil marketing company told Dawn early on Friday. “But before we can start sending out tankers to replenish supplies at retail outlets, we have to test the fuel that is already there to determine whether or not it has been contaminated with flood water. If it has then the underground storage tank needs to first be emptied out before more fuel is poured into it.”

The process could take days but the executive told Dawn that fuel deliveries from the Keamari terminals to some outlets, where underground tanks were not contaminated, had begun by Friday evening and would continue overnight.

ATMs out of cash, fuel pumps dry, telecom service down

“The situation should substantially normalise by Saturday morning.”

The prolonged power outage also impacted many other services. Aisha Sarwari, spokesperson for Jazz told Dawn that “largely due to infrastructural challenges and power outages in Karachi, network disruptions are hard to contain, especially when the damage is this large-scale.”

She said knock on effects occur following prolonged power outages once the back up generators that power telecom towers start running out of fuel. Nobody from the telecom sector was willing to give an estimate for how long it will take to restore normal service, but most said it could take ‘a few working days’.

Many ATMs around the city were also not functional when people ventured out after the deluge. “ATMs work primarily on communication networks, availability of electricity and whether staff can reach the locations to replenish the cash” says Ali Habib, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at HBL.

He said his bank was able to ensure that “at least 55 per cent of our network across the city was functional” on Friday morning.

The inundation triggered the power outages and brought movement around the city to a halt, which in turn had knock on effects on communication, banking services and fuel supply across the city. It was late into the day on Friday when normalcy began to return to the life of the city as the weekend began.

Meanwhile, the city’s utility took to social media middle of the day on Friday to say that “close to 80 per cent feeders are powered up”.

“Many parts of Defence, Clifton, Bahadurabad continue to remain submerged and our substations are also badly affected in these areas due to waterlogging,” the statement said.

By Friday night, reports of power being restored were being received from a growing number of localities around the city.

By Arif Hasan

Before 27 August, this monsoon season had brought much less rainfall to Karachi than on previous occasions. Yet, streets turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, and over 30 people drowned or were electrocuted.

However, on 27 August we had more rainfall in one day than the past 92 years. Entire settlements were washed out. This has raised two questions. One, despite a lower volume of rainfall, why has Karachi been devastated? And two, was the heavy rainfall of 27 August linked to climate change?

Vast population increase and lack of investment in sewers

Karachi’s storm water drains connect to two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other, 14-20 kilometres apart. Fifty-eight storm water drains (nalas) carry water from their catchment areas to these two rivers. Over 600 smaller drains feed into these nalas.

Before independence in 1947, Karachi’s population was only 450,000; it is now over 15 million. The city’s sewage system mostly consisted of underground earthenware pipes, and sewage biologically treated at the gutter baghicha (gutter garden).

The treated effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. The gutter garden covered just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares).

With Partition and the arrival of around 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand. Formal and informal sectors developed far away from the gutter garden.

The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns some 20 kilometres from Karachi. Sewage treatment plants were planned for but never constructed and their sewage flowed (and still flows) into the sea and/or the nalas.

Informal settlements and informal drains

Due to lack of housing, informal settlements developed along the nalas – into where sewage was discharged. After the mid-1960s formal sectors also began using nalas for disposal. Sludge from sewage clogged the nalas and their tributaries, and during the heavy rains of 1978-79, much of the housing along the nalas was washed away.

After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities and compact it along the nala edges to secure them and to create land for their homes. Nala widths decreased substantially from 20-40 meters to less than ten, and four to five metres in some places.

Deterioration of the nalas

Spatially, Karachi is a large city with only two landfill sites, both over 40 kilometres from the eastern edge of the city. Due to the time and costs to get there, garbage increasingly did not reach the landfill sites. Meanwhile, a recycling industry developed, mostly in the informal sector.

Contractors pay the Karachi Metropolitan Cooperation (KMC) officials not to collect the garbage so that recyclable material can be picked from it. The non-recyclable material is then thrown into the nalas or at various informal dumping sites along the natural drainage systems.

By the mid-1990s, most of the nalas were full of compacted solid waste. And to this day children play cricket and football on some of them.

Building over the nalas

With Karachi’s development plans stalled and space pressures for commercial activity, the local government constructed bazaars over the nalas. Meanwhile, the government of Sindh constructed car parking facilities, offices, and hostels on the nalas, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

As space for disposal of solid waste in the nalas reduced over time, solid waste was and is still used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite housing. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire tractors to compact it.

A major part of Karachi’s most elite settlement – the Defence Society – has been reclaimed from the sea through use of municipal solid waste. In addition, two of Karachi’s major outlets to the sea have been considerably reduced by developing housing for high income groups and a highway. Now, water struggles to flow out into the sea especially during high tides.

Storm water drains

To overcome these problems, in the 1980s and 90s the government of Sindh arranged for old sewage treatment plants to be rehabilitated and new ones constructed along with trunk sewers along the main roads. However, these trunks remain dry because the sewage continues to flow in the storm water drains.

The Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) has long supported communities to develop lane sewers and decided to document the storm water drains. It discovered this problem could only be tackled by cleaning and covering the drains and incrementally building trunks along the nalas. This concept was accepted by the state and is being partially implemented.

Real estate development

But now, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels and water collection depressions.

When it rains, areas south of this region are completely submerged by flood waters. With more developments, the likelihood of flooding will also increase.

Serious institutional issues

The central and provincial governments are controlled by different political parties. They are at constant loggerheads making it impossible for Karachi’s infrastructure problems to be tackled rationally and with sufficient finances. It also makes it impossible to develop a decentralised city government, free from direct provincial control.

Desperate to maintain its vote bank, the federal government brought in the National Disaster Management Authority to de-silt Karachi’s nalas. So far they have removed 30,000 tonnes of solid waste from 42 choking points on three nalas.

However, desilting will once again make the edges of the nalas vulnerable to erosion and destroy an unspecified number of homes – widening just one major nala will require 5,782 houses to be removed.

If the proposal for widening all the nalas to their original width is followed, around 60,000 houses will be affected. So far, a concept for the rehabilitation plan has not been developed even though promised by the government.

Tackling these issues will require a long-term plan for Karachi that is in keeping with the finances available or that can be generated. But this cannot be done without an empowered local government and participation of people living along the nalas.

OPP-RTI’s interaction with those communities found only they knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of various smaller drains that had disappeared. But how to bring these communities into the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

Meanwhile, climate change only adds to the urgency of addressing Karachi’s worsening floods.

Two medical teams provided basic outpatient medical services to more than 4,000 patients over the course of a month.

MSF also distributed relief items including kitchen, hygiene and shelter kits to more than 2,500 families affected by the floods in five union councils of Tehsil Johi. Supporting the local authorities, the international emergency humanitarian organization has worked on restoring the main water supply sources and lines that benefit over 60,000 people in different locations. Water treatment tablets have in the meantime been distributed to over 2,000 families in the area.

“Our activities in the flood-affected areas of Sindh are part of MSF’s commitment to support the Pakistani authorities in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters,” MSF country representative in Pakistan Aymen Abdullah said in a statement. “We have also donated medicines to the local authorities to support them in meeting urgent medical needs in the area.

”More than 350 villages in Sindh’s Dadu district were affected by the floods after heavy rainfall in August 2020. Dadu was one of the worst hit areas in the province and its population of over 240,000 were declared calamity-affected by the provincial government. While the floods damaged the houses, roads were also washed away thereby further limiting people’s access to healthcare facilities.

“The post-flood period is critical as there is a high risk of outbreaks of vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as malaria. The objective of our mobile clinics was to improve people’s access to healthcare by providing them with basic care at their doorstep and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. We treated patients with acute respiratory diseases, skin infections, malaria and other illnesses,” said Anna Cilliers, MSF medical coordinator.

MSF is also supporting Sindh’s department of health in an awareness campaign on dengue fever. The cases of dengue fever in Karachi increased recently, and 12 union councils of East and South Karachi were declared hotspots. MSF is broadcasting awareness messages of prevention and protection from dengue fever through TV channels, cable networks and social media.

84,84,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"Surging glacier creates lake, floods Pakistan valley - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1563034,"Danger of another flood as water continues to flow from the lake in Hunza valley in northern Pakistan.

""A loud rumble echoed and water started trickling down with soil and rocks. Villagers immediately left their homes and fled to safety,"" recounted Manzoor Hussain. Hussain lives in Hassanabad, a village in the Hunza valley high in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in northern Pakistan.

It was siesta time on May 30 when the rumbling started. ""It was not the first time, so people in the village knew what was happening. They were aware of glacial lake outburst floods [GLOFs]. They thought it was a GLOF at the Shishper glacier,"" said Hussain.

In fact, a lake near the Machuhar glacier had burst its banks, causing a flood that submerged farms, the local power plant and part of the Karakoram Highway. Most residents had to sleep in tents afterwards.

Was this a GLOF, where the failure of an unstable natural dam releases meltwater from a glacier? The question is complicated by the Karakoram Anomaly, which describes the advance of glaciers in the region in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in the Himalayas and globally. Expert opinion is divided.

Zaheer Uddin Babar, the focal person for GLOFs in the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, said, ""We can’t interlink the recent incident with a GLOF. Satellite images received from SUPARCO [Pakistan’s Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission] are not indicating any glacial lake. It may be the water spilled out from a lake on the surface of the Machuhar glacier. The water flow was as low as 3,000 cusecs [cubic feet per second] only."" In some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, water flow after a GLOF has been recorded at around 100,000 cusecs.

The villagers thought the May 30 incident was a GLOF because they had experienced one with a water flow of 7,000 cusecs in 2019, when a 1.5 kilometre-wide lake burst its banks. That time, a large section of the Karakoram Highway, a bridge, two power plants, some offices, over 100 houses, the water supply pumphouse and most farms were submerged.

Shishper is a surging, or advancing, glacier. It formed around the beginning of the twentieth century, when what was then the Hassanabad glacier in the north of the Hunza valley split into two. Machuhar is the other glacier formed by this split. Like the overwhelming majority of glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, Machuhar is receding due to the warming caused by climate change. There are over 15,000 glaciers in this tallest and youngest mountain range of the world, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar. The number keeps changing as receding glaciers split into two or more.

The surge of one glacier while its neighbour melts is creating a strange situation. Babar said Shishper has been surging quickly; it moved forward two kilometres in 2018-19, though there has been no indication of a surge since November 2019. But the earlier surge blocked the drainage route of the Machuhar glacier. As a result, a lake has formed at the snout, or mouth, of the Machuhar glacier, and is getting bigger as climate change gathers pace and the rate of melt increases.

Blocking the water flowing down from the Machuhar glacier also means blocking this water supply to the Hunza River, a tributary of the transboundary Indus River.

There are other glacier pairs in the same situation. Zahid Hussain, a field manager in a GLOF project, said, ""Yune glacier in Bagrot valley is also extending and it has already blocked the waters of Gurgo glacier. A huge cavity has opened up on the hillside, at the intersection of the two glaciers. There is a lake forming, which can burst its banks and can create a disaster any time.""

Muhammad Riaz, director-general of Pakistan Meteorological Department, told The Third Pole, ""There are more than 3,000 glacial lakes in the Karakoram ranges and 34-36 of them have been declared to be of high GLOF potential.""

The danger of a surging glacier

""But the glacier surge is a larger menace than GLOF,"" said Sher Mohammad, a glacier specialist at the regional International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, with its headquarters in Kathmandu. ""There are more than 200 glaciers identified in the Karakoram range with surging or surge-like history and these glaciers cover more than 40% (7,700 square kilometres) of the total glacier area in the Karakoram.""

""The exact reason for some glaciers surging in the Karakoram is still unclear,"" he added. ""It has no linear correlation with snowfall anomalies and thermal changes. However, extreme weather and climate change probably affect surges and surge dynamics, such as intensification, enhance melting, creating crevasses on glacier surfaces and changing the glacier volume.""

Asif Khan, an expert on climate change and an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said, ""Surging is a short-lived event, when a glacier moves 10 to 100 times faster than its normal velocity.""

Mohammad said the flooding on May 30 was probably triggered by a rise in temperature, causing significant glacier melt and increasing the size of the lake. Meteorological data shows a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May. In the first half of June, water was still flowing down the hillside and being blocked by debris, posing a potential risk of another flood.

Shaukat Ali, a climate expert at the Islamabad-based Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), said, ""Surge is a phenomenon that can also be caused by extreme events of precipitation. The Karakoram Anomaly may cause surging and advancing of the Shishper glacier. Our research at GCISC shows that Gupis, Drosh, Chitral and Gilgit are the future hotspots of the highest increase in average temperature in the 21st century.""

Ali pointed out that this could lead to significant changes in future water availability in Pakistan, which is dependent almost totally on the Indus basin for irrigation and other uses. Pakistan’s agriculture sector contributes around 22% of Pakistan’s GDP, and over 45% of the country’s workforce is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly.

A higher glacier melting rate can also trigger GLOFs and floods downstream, leading to more infrastructure and economic losses, Ali added.

In the first installment, we looked at how advances in robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, computing, and autonomous systems could shape warfare. In our second installment, we will look at how technological, political, social, and environmental change could shape the future economy.

Much like the size and shape of future battlefields, the evolution of trade, commerce, and global marketplaces is rather difficult to predict. After all, wherever human beings are involved (and in large numbers), chaos is sure to ensue! Still, there are a few significant changes on the way that cannot be denied, and which economists are preparing for. They include, in no particular order:

Population growth (predominantly in urban centers)

Growth of non-western economies and markets

New technologies, industries, and professions

Changing temperatures, weather patterns, and water shortages

Renewable energy and sustainability

The bottom line is that the future economies will simultaneously be driven by abundance and scarcity, where more people will need to be sustained using less in the way of resources. This challenge not only has the potential for a lot of uncertainty and chaos, but it will also likely foster the development of solutions.

Growing Populations

According to a 2019 report compiled by the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs — titled ""World Population Prospects 2019"" — the global population is expected to reach 9.74 billion by mid-century. However, the addition of more than 2 billion people will not be equally distributed between the world's nations.

Whereas Asia has been the greatest contributor to the global population since the mid-20th century, population growth there has been slowing since the beginning of the 21st century. By 2030, Asia's population growth is expected to plateau, and the population of the continent is expected to stay in the vicinity of 5 billion people until 2050.

From that point onward, the only continent to experience a significant increase in population growth will be Africa. Currently, Africa has a population of 1.36 billion people and is projected to reach up to 2.5 billion by mid-century (that's an increase of about 83%). Nevertheless, by 2050, Asia will still be the most populous continent, with a total population of about 5.29 billion.

Africa will be the second-most populous, with an estimated population of 2.49 billion. Latin America and the Caribbean will be third with an estimated 710 million, followed by Europe (705 million), North America (430 million), and Oceania (60 million). As always, the factors driving this growth will be economic, social, and technological in nature.

Urban Sprawl

Another important aspect of population growth in this century is where it will be concentrated. Today, roughly 56% of the global population lives in urban centers instead of rural settings, which works out to about 4.4 billion people. By 2050, the global urban population is projected to increase to 6.6 billion, or roughly 68% of humanity.

This will place additional stress on environmental systems that are already under severe stress by major cities. Urban expansion means that more land needs to be cleared to build infrastructure, more water needs to be diverted for utilities, more electricity needs to be generated, and more agricultural land needs to be set aside.

Since urban populations will be growing far beyond their rural counterparts, there will be proportionally fewer farmers in addition to less farmland. Coupled with the effects of climate change (see below), this means there will be many more mouths to feed in 2050. At the same time, the resources we'll need to do so will be in shorter supply.

However, the problem goes beyond food production. While every new child born between now and 2050 will be another mouth to feed, they'll also be another person in need of shelter, utilities, sanitation, medical care, education, and eventual employment. When these needs are not met, the end result is generally an increase in violent crime, terrorism, and humanitarian crises.

Luckily, it's not all doom and gloom. For, as the logic goes, every new life is a mouth to feed, but also a pair of working hands and a brain for problem-solving. The same holds true for urban environments, which are a big draw on natural resources but also centers for innovation and creative pursuits.

The (Shifting) Wealth of Nations

The global economic balance is expected to change significantly between now and 2050. While much of this is well underway, the pace of change is predicted to accelerate in the next three decades. According to a 2020 Bloomberg Economics forecast, the post-WWII economic stability enjoyed by the developed nations of the world will be coming to an end as new superpowers take their place on the world stage.

In short, the global economy will experience a shift in its center of gravity, moving from West to East and from advanced economies to emerging markets. The effect this will have on global politics, which is similarly already being felt, will intensify. For starters, China will have overtaken the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035 and become the world's largest economy.

By 2050, Asia's share of the global market share of GDP will grow to over 50% (driven largely by China and India). North American and Europe will account for about 20% each, while the rest of the world will account for less than 10%. In terms of which nations will be the wealthiest, the top ten today are the US, China, Japan, Germany, France, India, the U.K., Brazil, Italy, and Canada.

By 2050, this is forecast to be China, the US, India, Indonesia, Germany, Japan, Brazil, France, the U.K., and Turkey. For the first time since the ""Age of Imperialism,"" the richest nations in the world will not all be in Europe and North America. Instead, wealth and the political influence it brings will be more evenly distributed between the continents.

Beyond the top ten spots, the largest economies will also be located outside of Europe and North America. They include Argentina, Russia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Nigeria, Mexico, Poland, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, Iran, the Netherlands, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

But it's not all about who has the most wealth. There's also the question of which will be the fastest-growing economies. In this respect, the countries experiencing the most significant growth in terms of GDP and per capita income by 2050 will be Nigeria, Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, South Africa, Egypt, Malaysia, Columbia, Mexico, and Thailand.

Once again, the markets of Asia, Africa, and Latin America will be the greatest drivers of change. Much of this will be the result of digital technology and the access it ensures becoming more widespread, to the point where every nation and person in the world can get online.

Internet of Everything

According to a 2018 report by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU), more than half of the global population now has access to the internet. By 2050, 90% of the world's people are expected to have access, owing to a combination of economic growth in the developed world, the proliferation of mobile devices, and access to broadband satellite services.

In addition to people, an exponentially greater amount of mobile devices, sensors, ""smart-home"" appliances, and gadgets will be connected to the internet by the middle of the century. In fact, individual devices may also be ""smartened"" thanks to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) algorithms, predictive algorithms, and other forms of neural-net software.

Speaking of technology that imitates how humans process information and learn, ongoing studies into human neurology could well lead to the widespread adoption of neural implants. With devices like Neuralink, people will be able to interface with computers and devices, access the internet, do online banking, blog, surf, and create content through the simple act of thinking!

These developments would further accelerate the transition from a physical to a digital economy, where growth is data-driven and the most valuable resource is content. It will also give rise to the so-called ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) — where the real world will come to resemble the internet. This will have a profound effect on society, by improving efficiency and anticipating behavior in advance.

Concordantly, information security will become far more important, as privacy becomes a thing of the past. With cameras, sensors, and digital markers everywhere, and increasingly sophisticated AI systems mining the data to anticipate patterns and spending habits, every move a person makes will be recorded and cataloged in the cloud.

If outside parties were able to gain access to this data, it could lead to new levels of identity theft, extortion, and online harassment in the near future.

New Industries & New Jobs

Perhaps most significant of all is the way that accelerating technological trends will alter the way people work, communicate, shop, and consume. This will naturally lead to all kinds of new occupations, new opportunities for investment, and a general overhaul in how people ""do business."" Four major trends will coincide to drive this change, among them:

Technological Unemployment: Automation will continue to advance and lead to a vast increase in efficiency, but at the cost of eliminating a number of jobs. This will take not only the form of robotic systems but also machine learning and software that will remove the need for human analysis and oversight.

Increasingly Flexible Work: With automated systems handling more and more in the way of physical production, job growth will be increasingly focused on the creation of content and intellectual property. Combined with wireless technology, far more people will be able to work from home or remote locations and make their own hours.

Options for the Rich and Poor: In the developing world, much industrial work will be eliminated by the introduction of robotics and automated production. This will speed a new trend, where emerging nations and markets are forced to adapt to the high-tech, data-driven economy of the future, and the problems of ""downsizing"" and redundancy shift to the developing world.

Cryptocurrency and Blockchains: The rise of the ""industrial internet"" will create new redundancies but also opportunities for entrepreneurs. As more and more economic activity takes place online, economic activity will be far more direct, peer-to-peer, and decentralized.

This trend towards decentralization will be facilitated by the use of cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the blockchains used to distribute them. These are poised to replace traditional banking and monetary transactions, but they may also be programmed to represent energy, resources, investment, and ownership.

Commercial Space: By 2050, the commercial space industry is expected to grow exponentially and reach the point where it is valued in the trillions. This will be driven by the deployment of ""megaconstellations"" providing telecom and internet services, miniature satellites enabling research and development, and orbital refueling services.

Space will become more and more accessible as launch costs continue to decline, owing to space planes, reusable rockets, and commercial spaceports. By mid-century, this could result in space tourism, space hotels, and even habitats in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Commercial missions to the Moon, lunar tourism, and even asteroid mining are also likely to become a reality.

The ability to prospect and mine Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) will lead to a massive influx of precious metals and building materials to the global economy. This is anticipated to lead to the world's first trillionaires, the devaluation of precious metals (which will no longer be scarce), and the creation of a space-construction industry.

A Warming Planet

For decades, scientists have known that Earth has been getting warmer since the late 19th century. This trend is the direct result of humanity's impact on the natural environment and fossil fuel consumption. This has led to increased levels of greenhouse gases — most notably, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which increase the amount of solar radiation our atmosphere absorbs.

According to the 2018 Special Report that was released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global temperatures are forecast to increase by an average of 2.7 °F to 3.6 °F (1.5 °C to 2 °C) by 2052. The 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) threshold is the target goal established by the 2015 Paris Agreement, which seeks to mitigate climate change through the reduction of CO 2 emissions.

While this may not sound like a lot, it is important to remember that this is an average increase — which includes annual and regional variations. An increase of 2.7 °F (1.5 °C) to 3.6 °F (2 °C) will mean hotter summers, more precipitation, more instances of extreme weather, and the disruption of natural systems that humans rely on for their survival and livelihood.

These temperature increases will be felt strongly in Central and Eastern North America, Central and Southern Europe, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Western and Central Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. In regions located nearer to the poles (Canada, Russia, South Africa, and South America), the length of the frost-free season will likely increase, as will the corresponding growing season.

Because of this, countries located closer to the poles will experience a boom in agricultural production. At the same time, countries that have the largest supplies of renewable freshwater (Brazil, Russia, and Canada) will be forced to contend with increasing demand and may face serious repercussions if they do not scale up extraction to meet it.

Closer to the equator, temperature increases will mean more precipitation in the winter, which will mean more flooding, coastal storms, and runoff. During the summer, the increased heat will mean more drought, desertification, and the lowering of water tables. The combination of these extremes will also mean more in the way of erosion, runoff, and depletion of topsoil.

Similarly, heavily-populated areas along the coasts and major rivers that empty into oceans will be subject to rising sea levels. According to recent research, an estimated 4.6 billion mi² (7.4 billion km²) of land will flood or be underwater by 2040. This will have a massive economic impact as major urban centers are forced to contend with floods that become worse with every passing year.

By mid-century, several major cities are projected to be abandoned (or significantly depopulated) due to rising tides, flooding river systems, or sinkholes (caused by groundwater extraction). This will not only trigger migrations and refugee crises but will have a major impact on global markets as financial centers are lost.

Another trend, which is already well underway, will be the loss of glaciers and polar ice caps. According to a study released in April of 2020, simulations conducted by the Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP) have shown that the Arctic Circle will experience ice-free summers by 2050.

The loss of Arctic sea ice will have a profound impact on the planet, influencing ocean circulation and causing open water to absorb more heat. This, in turn, will lead to an increase in ocean temperatures, as well as the potential release of methane deposits beneath the Arctic Ocean.

A similar situation is happening in Siberia right now, where the disappearance of permafrost is allowing caches of subsurface methane to be released into the atmosphere. This creates a vicious circle, where the warming trend results in feedback mechanisms that cause even more warming, and so on.

Water Wars!

In many parts of the world, rapid industrialization and population growth have led to water shortages. In China, Egypt, India, Israel, Pakistan, Mexico, and the United States, this has led to desperate measures, and even international incidents. With the added stress caused by climate change, freshwater is projected to become increasingly scarce by 2050.

This will inevitably lead to ""Water Wars"" in parts of the world as neighboring countries fight to control access to limited supplies of freshwater — especially where international river systems are concerned. These rivers are essential for drinking water, irrigation, and sanitation wherever they flow, so neighboring countries are not likely to be in the mood to share when they begin to dry up.

In recent years, ""water futures"" have emerged and are now being traded like all precious commodities — similar to oil, precious metals, and stones. So, in addition to having a significant geopolitical and environmental impact, the disappearance of freshwater sources will also be played out in financial markets.

In the meantime, the scarcity of fresh water will continue to drive investment in desalination technology, water reclamation, and closed-loop environmental systems. This will be especially apparent in how architecture will incorporate ecology (aka. ""arcology"") in order to ensure greater sustainability in urban space.

Greener Energy

On the plus side, the impact of climate change will also lead to positive developments in the manufacturing, energy, and transportation sectors by 2050. For starters, renewable energy, electric vehicles, and other ""green technologies"" will be far more common due to declining costs, competitive pricing, and the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2018, 28% of global electricity was generated from renewable energy sources — a combination of hydroelectric (45%), nuclear (28%), wind (13%), solar (6%), biofuels (5%), and other methods (3%). By 2050, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) anticipates that renewables will generate 49% of global electricity, followed by natural gas (23%), coal (23%), and nuclear (5%).

Solar will occupy the most significant share of renewable sources, accounting for 38% of all electrical generation, while wind will grow to 34%, hydro will reach 27%, and biomass and other fuels will account for the remainder. For solar and wind power, the greatest contributions are expected to be from China and India.

By mid-century, China will account for 37% of solar and 35% of wind generation worldwide, while India will account for 24% of solar and 22% of wind. Hydroelectric power use will be more evenly distributed, with China (23%), the EU (17%), Brazil (15%), and India (8%) occupying the largest share.

Renewable energy is already having a significant impact in developing nations, where access to centralized grids is limited, and utilities are considered unreliable. In these places, portable solar lights, portable wind turbines, and appliances that use alternative energy sources are providing sustainable energy for small communities.

Due to the ongoing loss of arable land, cities will also become greener as urban farming, vertical farming, aquaculture, hydroponics, community gardens, and buildings that combine architecture and ecology into a single design (arcology).

Other changes will include electronic vehicles (EVs), which will make up over half of the automobile market by 2050. Advances in Tokamak fusion reactors are also expected to lay the groundwork for fusion energy, which is projected to become commercially available by 2050 and after.

—

The economy of 2050 won't be anything most people would recognize today. Physical cash and in-person banking are already giving way to e-banking and e-commerce. By 2050, it will give way to cryptocurrencies and distribution nodes that are not subject to regulation or controlled by any centralized government or financial institution.

Between advancements in technology, more people, more connectivity, and the need to do more with less, it's hard to know how it will all play out. On the one hand, the world may find itself being dragged deeper into ecological damage and resource shortfalls, triggering all manner of crises and struggles.

On the other, it's possible that renewable energy, reduced emissions, smart living, commercial space, and a growing focus on sustainability, humanity will enter a period of ""post-scarcity"" economics. One thing is for sure, though. What we do between now and 2050 will determine what happens beyond that point. We could be headed for disaster, or destined for something better.","Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/y5wWd0nYOX/sizes/dubai-finance_md.jpg,"['increase', 'life', 'billion', 'growth', 'global', 'economy', 'change', 'water', 'glimpse', 'population', 'energy', '2050', 'world', 'future']", ,none
86,86,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"Poor planning, poor governance, poor monitoring flood Karachi - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1577236,"It is the same mess in all cities of South Asia.

It does not always rain in Karachi during the monsoon. When it does, it floods. It was worse this year, with a three-day spell of heavy rainfall in late August leading to least 47 deaths due to drowning, electrocution, as well as house and wall collapses. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected”. Personnel from the armed forces have been called out to rescue stranded people, distribute food and medical aid.

Many parts of Karachi went without electricity for 50 hours, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ask, “What kind of service is this?”. Internet and cell phone networks were disrupted all over Pakistan’s largest city.

Women, children and the elderly waded through waist-deep sewage to reach rescue boats as rain continued to pelt down; the boats had to navigate around floating furniture, submerged cars, motorcycles, and even shipping crates pushed around by the force of the floodwater.

The meteorological department totalled August rainfall in Karachi at 484 mm (19 inches), with the highest daily rainfall of 130 mm at PAF Faisal Base on August 28.

“Last year, through the three monsoon months, the PAF Faisal Base recorded a total of 345 mm of rains; this year in just two months, over 600 mm rain has been recorded there,” Sardar Sarfaraz, the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s Karachi head told The Third Pole.

“The rains are unprecedented; and in all likelihood, this seems like an erratic event, with the last such intense rain recorded in 1931,” said Sarfaraz. “I cannot say with finality that this rainfall can definitively be attributed to climate change.”

“Due to the effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle, we will see a continued intensification of monsoons in the coming years,” predicted climate expert Imran Khalid, who heads the Environment and Climate Change section of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute.

Where will the water go?

Khalid wondered, though, if Karachi would have been any better off if there was no climate change? According to him, Karachi’s woes have their roots in poor governance and planning.

“By encroaching and blocking the streams that form the natural watershed, over many decades, the authorities have set us up to fail,” he pointed out, terming the flood footage on television a manifestation of “decades of apathy and ignorance about the laws of nature”.

“If you block the flow of water, it will go around you; if it can’t go around you, it will continue to rise until it envelopes you.” The crises were “of our own making”, Khalid added, emphasising the need to incorporate laws of nature into urban planning.

Karachi has over 550 big and small storm water drains. “But over the years, some as wide as 200 feet have narrowed down to just 30 feet today, due to unauthorised construction,” admitted Karachi’s outgoing mayor Waseem Akhtar, head of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). As he left office on August 30, he said, “Karachi is for everyone but nobody is for Karachi.”

Going about town to inspect the damage, Chief Minister Shah chided people for “building houses in the belly of the Malir river”, according to media reports. “The entire city is sinking because of your encroachments,” he reportedly said.

Noman Ahmed, dean of Architecture and Management Sciences department at Karachi’s NED University, said some encroachments happened in connivance with different government agencies, while some were “organic”.

“For example, the encroachments on Gujjar Nala was facilitated by the KMC functionaries by providing inappropriate leases,” on its edges, in areas that were not supposed to be inhabited in the first place.

“The alignment of the nalas [drains] have clearly been demarcated in all land use plans available with the different civic agencies,” said Ahmed, and therefore selling plots of land was nothing less than a “criminal act”.

He would not blame those who had bought the plots. Ahmed felt people had started building on the dry bed of Gujjar Nala because for decades there was nothing more than a thin stream. “They occupied the land without knowing how vulnerable they were to sudden inundation, and this is what happened in recent rains.”

Architect and heritage consultant Marvi Mazhar also termed “unplanned and unregulated growth, lack of monitoring and corruption” as major reasons for the havoc the rains wrought on the city of 16 million that had been heavily “concretised, with not enough soft ground left for water to be absorbed”.

The problem has persisted despite court judgments, including an order from the country’s chief justice that all illegal construction be removed from Karachi — whether on or off the drains.

Terming removal of encroachments “a very tricky affair”, Ahmed said very often debris left behind by a demolition crew caused more obstruction to water flow than the original buildings had done.

What is to be done?

“These drains can actually be added into beautification plans with plantations on either side, and run across the city like in Amsterdam,” said Mazhar. Instead, she said, they are seen and treated as an eyesore with garbage thrown alongside them, which invariably slips into the drain thereby choking it. She held both residents and the government responsible for the indifference shown towards Karachi’s garbage.

Now Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he wants a “permanent solution” to problems associated with drains, the sewage system and water supply.

Ahmed said the government should come up with a “comprehensive policy for not just all the drains but other waterways and spaces where water accumulates. Just working on a piecemeal basis will not get the desired results.”

He also pointed out that those evicted in this process must be rehabilitated. “The Sindh government has ample land in Karachi’s suburbs. If done in a step by step manner, not everyone will need to be evicted at one go or at least till the re-demarcation of the nalas takes place.”

Many residents feel the collapse of municipal services and consequent problems such as the recent flooding is because Karachi has become too unwieldy to be governed. With 19 different land-owning agencies under the three tiers of government — the city government in the hands of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party that holds the purse strings and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the centre — the city’s problems only get bounced around and the blame game continues.

Same situation all over South Asia

Substitute the names of the rivers, drains and political parties, and the same story is repeated in varying degrees across all the cities of South Asia — Rawalpindi, Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and on and on. For years, residents have been resigned to the mess and vented their ire on social media. Now they have started coming out on the streets — it happened in Kolkata after weeklong power failures in some suburbs following Cyclone Amphan; and it is happening in Karachi now. Perhaps the fact that the hardships have now spread from slums to tony neighbourhoods has something to do with it. The internet is back now, and the phones are working, but the protests continue. Their effect remains to be seen.

The Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a significant flood warning for the northern parts of the country, predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in catchment areas of river Kabul River along with hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan division.

""According to latest hydro-meteorological situation, monsoon has become active over Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kashmir producing widespread thunderstorm/rains,"" an alert issued by the PMD's Flood Forecasting Division said. The advisory was shared on Twitter by Azhar Mashwani, the focal person on digital media to the Punjab chief minister.

The alert warned that the existing weather system is likely to persist over those areas during the next 48 hours ""with [a] high probability of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of River Kabul and its tributaries along with hill torrents of DG Khan division which may cause medium to high flood situation"".

Around 872 people were evacuated last week owing to a threat of flood, with several points along the Chenab and Jhelum swelling. At least 60 rescue teams and 326 rescuers saved villagers and their belongings, and still many areas were under the threat of flood.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/digital_images/large/2020-08-31/pakistan-met-deptt-issues-significant-flood-warning-1598887077-5088.jpg,"['warning', 'khan', 'torrents', 'rainfall', 'punjab', 'significant', 'pakistan', 'issues', 'threat', 'flood', 'kabul', 'met', 'river', 'deptt', 'areas', 'heavy']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: A red alert was issued Tuesday by the federal capital's administration over possible flooding caused by rains expected to lash the city this week.



The Islamabad administration said Ghauri Town, Soan Gardens, and Sectors I-8 and I-9 were forecast to be inundated with rainwater following the heavy rains.

It further underlined that the Soan and Korang rivers, as well as the Simly and Rawal dams, near Islamabad and Rawalpindi were expected to flood during the ongoing week

Flooding was also feared to occur in the kutchi abaadis (slums) in Sectors F-9, G-6, G-8, H-9, and I-9, as well as Khanna Pul, Ghauri Town, and Soan, the administration said.

It warned that opening the Simly and Rawal dams' spillways would likely inundate the Soan and Korang rivers and disrupt electricity, water, and sewerage services in the areas.

The Islamabad administration has imposed an emergency in the federal capital's hospitals ahead of possible destruction due to the rains forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and noted that local schools would be used as relief camps in case of flooding.","Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-09-01/l_708593_054541_updates.jpg,"['rivers', 'flash', 'schools', 'simly', 'possible', 'issues', 'soan', 'flooding', 'sectors', 'islamabad', 'administration', 'alert', 'used', 'town', 'red']", ,flood

Floods symbolise miseries and destruction and their effects can be felt for a very long time, like wrong decisions by politicians drive nations backward and derail them from the path of progress and growth. I am worried to see the way politics is being played on floods where the governments, at both the federal and provincial levels are fighting on percentage sharing. The federal government represents the state and the state is the mother which has to be looked after by each and every citizen of the land.

I wish and hope that Imran khan should have been more tactful and gracious in working with CM Sindh, and CM Sindh should also have cooperated for the sake of the people of Karachi.

The media teams on both sides fight like kids and it looks as if both sides’ media teams are indulging in competition where they are winning at the cost of the public of Karachi who are already crushed with ethnic and poverty storms.

I hope my observations will be taken positively as Karachi is my city too, where I studied and started my civil service; I know the problems of Karachi.

My appeal to fellow politicians is to stop playing politics on floods and other natural disasters at the cost of your own poor masses.

Floods destroy everything that comes in their way and as a poor nation, we keep looking for support and help from rich countries at the cost of our self-respect.

Is it not the duty of the federal or provincial governments to sit with the map of Pakistan, analyse past destruction of the floods and design ways to channel flood water by creating channels based on surveys and hold this water in dams in all provinces?

We should know who is in the charge of it and which authority can take up with provincial authorities. Let me point out that it is the duty of “water board” which needs to be converted into Water board authority which should be empowered with adequate funding to manage the flood water and river water in such a way that each and every drop of water falls in the sea and every drop is used for agriculture to enhance our agricultural proceeds.

Despite being rich in water resources, we Pakistanis continue to face water scarcity every year because of the inability of authorities to properly use and manage these water resources for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability.

Poor water management is costing our country around 4-5 percent of GDP each year. These costs are caused by the floods and droughts that we face due to poor water supply and sanitation. We are endowed with water yet we do not make the best use of this.

The most alarming thing here is that the water crisis was rated as the biggest risk to Pakistan by the World Economic Forum and the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. They also warned that the country could “run dry” by 2025.

Half of the annual rainfall in our country occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimetres in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimetres per month.

This year in August, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall recorded over the last 90 years.

Pakistan receives 145 million-acre feet of water every year. However, only 14m acre-feet of water are preserved and we can meet the shortage if we have proper storage of rainwater and floodwater.

We have rivers and small streams coming from mountains finally meeting at “Sutledge”. The flows and diversions need to be examined scientifically with proper measurements to ensure the use of water for the betterment of local people; it is also important to analyse its miserable effects on the public and crops.

Let every town build a local rain pond which can store all the rainwater which can be used by them later for agricultural and irrigation purposes. Once a storage capacity is built, then a sprinkler irrigation system can be designed and introduced to better store and manage this precious water.

The water can also be converted into clean drinking water by using small plants. This sweet water can be used in multiple ways if properly managed by the local bodies.

We may also let the DC be the Head of a Rainwater Authority to ensure the government’s indulgence and control. It is an extensive but very simple exercise and this should be opted for on a priority.

On one hand, we are facing water scarcity due to floods and poor water management while on the other, we are also facing water terrorism from India as it wants to either just stop/block our share of water with ulterior motives when we need it, or release extra water into our rivers to increase the flow causing floods in Pakistan and we know that both of these are dangerous for Pakistan.

As we are dependent on India for water, Modi, by blocking water, wants to deprive Pakistan of water to convert her into a desert. In fact, Modi is following a full-fledged anti-Pakistan agenda.

India has worked out that the one of the national key quotients is water and hence, India will continue to block water flow from India to Pakistan. PM Modi had already thrown the first water bomb on Pakistan in 2018 by blocking our legitimate natural watercourse. India had completed its construction of Kishanganga hydropower project on the Neelam River by diverting the watercourse through a 16 km tunnel, which is a clear violation of the Indus Water Treaty between the two countries.

The Kishanganga River, upon entering Pakistani territory is recognised as Neelam River that originates from Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and flows through the Gurez Valley to join Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad, at Domail, in Azad Jammu Kashmir. The construction of Kishanganga Dam is also in violation of Article III (4) of the Indus Water Treaty, which places an obligation or restriction on India not to construct any similar projects on western rivers, that is, on Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. Also, the construction of the Kishanganga project will adversely affect the Neelum-Jhelum project, as its power generation capacity will be reduced radically. In accordance with Article III (2) of Indus Water Treaty, India is also prohibited from developing any human made obstructions that shall have or may cause a change in the volume of the natural flow of western rivers.

The project includes a 121 feet tall concrete-face rock-fill dam, which will divert a portion of the river to the south through a 24 km tunnel. The diversion reduced the flow of water into Pakistan by about 11 percent in the summer and about 27 percent in the winter, which would be contrary to the Indus Water Treaty as the western rivers belong to Pakistan. It also contends that the diversion would result in an ecological disaster for the area.

India had signed all the important Conventions that, with complete effect, would ruin our valley totally. It is sad to note that neither our previous government nor the present one ever took this matter seriously whereas the water issue is supposed to be an issue of life and death.

My above suggestions are better in both ways to use the extra water for irrigation. In this way, induction terrorism by India via water flow can be controlled and we can convert this misery into success by irrigating barren land.

We need to bring an enactment/bill or a “rainfall act” to get these activities regulated as a national priority. I am confident that this law will be of great benefit for the nation.

As per many predictions, the next wars will be over sweetwater.

I wish our defence sector takes initiatives to take help of our soldiers to develop these water channels during peacetime with the help of the local public on a volunteer basis.

Let all the provinces and the federation give serious thought to my above proposals.

I will, however, move a bill on “The Flood Control Act” in order to store rainwater throughout the country, fixing the responsibility on concerned authorities.

We have water, all types of minerals, a fertile landscape, the best brains, four seasons, the best beaches, natural gas, green mountains with blue waters and lakes, deserts and forests, but we do not have the command of unity and the skills of governance. We are still slaves of false egos and are masters of self-destruction.

It is time for the leadership to wake up and not flood their national cause and interest. Lead your nation to drive to the valley of love and not hate to protect your future generations.

“National unity Zindabad”.

According to a statement issued by the National Emergency Operations Centre on Polio, the £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to the people who have lost their homes.

This comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks, including hygiene kits and tarpaulins, to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Over 55,000 people will get life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter

Lord Ahmad said: “Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands by Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.”

He added: “The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be — and the dangers of climate change. During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.”

British High Commissioner Christian Turner said: “Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.”

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from Covid-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year.

Lord Ahmad discussed with the government of Pakistan how Britain can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations and trade ties.

He also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in south Punjab.

Britain has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly eight million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The UK minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the Covid-19 surveillance centre. He met National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr Rana Safdar who briefed him on Pakistan’s response to Covid-19.

He is scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

92,92,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistan’s flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to “manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle”, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this ‘annual surprise’ presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bang­la­desh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacue­­es, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

93,93,FL-2019-000087-PAK,Karachi: flood management and governance - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2259093/karachi-flood-management-and-governance,"A new debate has erupted over managing floods in Karachi and the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to clear waste from the drains of Karachi due to heavy rainfall. Acrimonious discussions with a blame game against each other were witnessed on TV talk shows between the representatives of the PTI government, the PPP government in Sindh as well as the MQM.

The PPP sees sinister design behind the move to undermine the authority and image of the Sindh government, portraying it as an example of poor governance. Their contention was that Lahore had also been inundated with floods but neither hue and cry was created nor was FWO sent there. Their argument had been that whatever and wherever something goes wrong, the federal government finds the Sindh government as a punching bag to divert people’s attention from their own failures. Be it the sugar crisis, wheat shortage, fuel shortage, rising food inflation or the postings and transfers, the federal government tries to pass the buck to the Sindh government.

The general public is watching all the melodrama with anguish and anxiety. The intervention of the federal government would have gone unnoticed, had it not been with a political motive, belittling the Sindh government. The federal government and provinces do not work in tight compartments, rather they supplement each other within the contours of the Constitution and law. But, when the Governor of Sindh — instead of acting as a representative of the federal government and constitutional head of the province bound to act on the advice of the Chief Executive of the province — starts issuing statements to browbeat the Chief Minister, then it certainly develops irritation and is not taken in a normal course.

No doubt, Karachi, being a metropolitan city has its own problems, but similar problems also exist in all cities of Pakistan. Karachi being the biggest city and economic hub attracts migrants from all over the country and has expanded in all directions without proper town planning. Therefor the problems of Karachi are of a greater magnitude.

Within the ambit of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh and the local government to provide civic amenities to their citizens, which of course include waste management, desilting and clearance of drains. Rainfall in Karachi causing floods is not a rare phenomenon, it happens with recurrence. This nature of problem may be described as a calamity, hence falling within the purview of the NDMA. In this context, preparedness is one of the essentials of disaster management followed by prevention, mitigation of sufferings and community awareness. But, unfortunately governments have been found negligent in their preparation to deal with such crises.

Disaster management or crisis management has a direct co-relation with governance. Governance is all about delivery within time and action of all tiers of government in unison to add synergy to their efforts. In such a situation KMC, DHA, Cantonments, Port Qasim Authority, Irrigation Department and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) with a lead role of the provincial government should have set a strategy to deal with such an eventuality.

The Sindh government could have easily managed excavators, dumpers or other machinery available on rent in the market. Roughly the rent of an excavator is not more than Rs500,000 per week. If the funds were not available with the respective departments, the Chief Minister should have set aside the funds from his own discretionary grant or re-appropriated in order to escape criticism.

While the Sindh government has its own share of blame, the NDMA has its own role to play. The authority has its own National Disaster and Risk Management plan. According to the Act and plan, the PDMA and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are the coordinating units. Therefore, NDMA has to work through those bodies. In such a scenario, NDMA should have shifted all the resources to PDMA and FWO should have also been at the disposal of the provincial government to avoid political point scoring.

Although with a knee-jerk reaction to the malaise symptomatic treatment has been meted out, the main cause has not been removed. This problem has erupted due to massive encroachments in the nullahs, drains, riverbed, poor designing and construction of roads and bridges. This again is a reflection of poor governance. Rule of law is the foundation of governance. We have all kinds of laws but implementation is missing, hence this mess. As the saying goes, “nip the evil in the bud” but the departments assigned to do the task close their eyes to the initial violation and with the passage of time the problem grows such magnitude that all wonder what to do.

Karachi being a port city is now considered to be a city of all. The population of the city is growing at a fast pace, so are the problems. Governments, particularly city governments in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have been managing well. Why not we? A deeper study of their governance reveals the underlying factor: adherence to the rule of law. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the federal government, to implement the law and remove all encroachments done in violation of the law and set aside funds ahead of the monsoon rains. This is the only way out and a permanent solution. This applies to all cities of Pakistan, including the federal capital.

94,94,FL-2019-000087-PAK,"Cheap Chinese tyres flood Pakistani markets, capture big share - ANI News",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/cheap-chinese-tyres-flood-pakistani-markets-capture-big-share20210406220440,"Karachi [Pakistan], April 6 (ANI): Chinese tyres have captured 85 per cent of the market share in Pakistan which is a substantial 45 per cent increase from two years ago.

According to a report published in Dawn, the takeover of the local market share by a Chinese product is not uncanny and is similar to several Made in China products that have flooded local markets.

Earlier, the Chinese car tyres held 40 per cent of the market share in 2018. The share now has since increased to 85 per cent. ""In the light truck category tyres, China held a share of 30-40 per cent two years ago which has now gone up to 65-70 per cent,"" the report said.

Moreover, Beijing also dominates in truck/bus tyres with over 75 per cent market share which was merely 40 per cent two years back.



""Mushroom growth has been noted in the number of dealers who are regularly flooding the market with Chinese tyres,"" former chairman of the Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) Azim K. Yousufzai told Dawn.

The association leader said the low prices were the main reason for the surging market share of Chinese tyres. They are cheaper than European, Korean, Thai and American tyres.

On the smuggling of tyres, Yousufzai said the illegal arrival of different types of tyres has slowed down drastically owing to strict vigil at the border areas.

""Strict monitoring at the borders has brought down informal arrival of tyres from 50-60 pc to 20pc,"" he claimed.

Over the decrease in sales of Pakistani tyres, the association leader said that the government has reduced the regulatory duty (RD) to 10-20 per cent for various categories of imported tyres which is among the factors encouraging legal imports. (ANI)

1.1. Background

During the current monsoon, Sindh faced seven spells of moderate to heavy rains. These heavy rains affected several districts of Sindh including different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Sanghar, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Tando Muhamamd Khan Jacobabad and Umerkot.

According to Pakistan Meteorological Department Karachi received the heaviest rain in a single day ever in its history when 231 mm rain lashed out in just 12 hours. Maximum rain recorded in millimetres Karachi (Surjani Town 195, Kemari 170, North Karachi 168, Nazimabad 162, Masroor Base 154, Saddar 142, Landhi 126, Airport Old Area 122, University Road & Saadi Town 105, Jinnah Terminal 104, Gulshan-e-Hadid 49) Moen Jo Daro 44, Shaheed Benazirabad 34, Sukkur 15, Larkana 07, Jacobabad 06, Chor and Hyderabad 02. Hub Dam water level crossed 338.5 feet’ after 13 years of history.

During August 2020, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall record over the last 90 years. In recent most 7th spell that started on August 27 and continued, heavy rainfalls are recorded that turns the Karachi and many districts in Shambles. Karachi alone received 223 mm. of rain over 12 hours, and it caused more devastation to Karachi. Rainwater and overflowed water from nullahs and drains flooded most of the main roads and streets in residential locations, a significant number of residential areas including urban slums and villages in peri-urban areas, that gravely disrupted the people’s lives.

The misery of the people increases many folds due to long power outages and gushing flooded water on streets which causes traffic jams, resulted in difficult access for relief or rescue work in affected areas. The inundated roads caused massive traffic jams in Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Sarjani, Sohrab Goth, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, Nagin Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, Orangi Town, Haideri, Liaqatabad, Gulshan Iqbal, Hussain Abad, Kareem Abad, Shahrah-e-Faisal, Quaidabad, Malir National Highway, Hassan Squire, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Defence, Clifton, Gulberg, Kashmir Colony, Saudabad, Golimar, Rizwia, Patel Para, Pak Colony, Shah Latif Town, Lyari, Sakhi Hassan, Shadman, Anda Mor and other parts of the city.

On 29th August 2020, 6 districts of Karachi are declared as “Calamity hit areas” by the Relief Commissioner - Government Sindh under Sindh National Calamities (P&R) Act 1958. According to RNA the two districts respectively Karachi East and Malir are most affected.

An eight-member official delegation from Islamabad will interact with Indian officials at the 116th Permanent Indus Commission meet during March 23-24 in the first face-to-face formal meeting since the intensification of political tension following India’s decision to change the special status of J&K and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Pakistan is likely to bring up its concerns related to the two hydroelectric plants over two tributaries of the Chenab river. Indian officials are prepared to allay all worries by supplying all necessary information,” the source said.

At the last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission meeting in 2018, Pakistan had reportedly raised objections to some design aspects of the 1,000 MW Pakul Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai plants, including the height of the reservoir, and water storage and releases that are yet to be sorted out.

As per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the eastern rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi are under India’s control, while Pakistan controls the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.

India and Pakistan are also likely to discuss the two new run-of-river hydroelectric plants — Durbuk Shyok (19 MW) and Nimu-Chilling (24 MW) — in Ladakh.

The two sides may also talk about flood data arrangements with the view of the forthcoming flood season, the source added.

The Indus Commission meet, which is supposed to be held annually, got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political tension caused by the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories was also a likely reason for delay.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/x71po4/article34130994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bl23indiapak,"['officials', 'plants', 'meet', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'watersharing', 'mw', 'indus', 'hydroelectric', 'discuss', 'likely', 'commission', 'flood', 'india', 'project', 'exchange']", ,flood

1,1,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Parents of Pakistani man who died in NSW floods forced to watch burial through car window - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/05/parents-of-pakistani-man-who-died-in-nsw-floods-forced-to-watch-burial-through-car-window,"The parents of a man who died when his car was trapped in New South Wales flood waters have farewelled their son at a prayer service in Sydney after flying in from Pakistan.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was travelling to his first day at a new job on 24 March when his car got stuck in flood waters at Glenorie and he was unable to escape. He was on the phone to emergency services for almost 40 minutes before he died.

His grieving parents were given permission to enter Australia for the funeral. They arrived in Sydney on Sunday and followed strict protocols.

The emotional couple were unable to touch their son’s body or coffin and were kept apart from Younus’s friends due to Covid restrictions.

Younus’s father, Muhammad Younus, was unable to address mourners but in a pre-recorded message broadcast at the service said the family was heartbroken.

“When I stepped out of Sydney airport, my eyes were looking for him,” the grieving father said.

“I wished he would have been there to welcome his parents. I wished we could have hugged him once more. I wished we could have embraced him and kissed his forehead. But alas it didn’t happen. Rather we are here to say goodbye to him.”

Muhammad Younus said his son had spoken to his family about bringing them to Australia and showing them his new home.

“Australia is a beautiful country and once you come here, Dad, I will show you around. These were the words of my dear son Ayaz whenever he used to call me,” he said.

“One day before his death, he was talking to his friend and telling him that now he would be doing double duty as a truck driver and also as an Uber driver, so he may bring his parents, brothers and sister here in Australia.”

The father thanked the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, for helping organise their attendance.

“I wished my children could have been here with me also, to say goodbye to their beloved brother. I still hope and pray that one day they will be here to pay their respect and pray, standing at his grave.”

Younus had three siblings – two older brothers and a younger sister – who were unable to attend the service and instead watched it on Zoom from Pakistan.

Younus’s parents were confined to a car for the actual burial, forced to watch and film from a distance through a partially wound-down window. Muhammad Younus was briefly allowed outside the vehicle to shovel sand on his son’s coffin.

The funeral was held at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia’s mosque, the Baitul Huda mosque, in Marsden Park.

The association helped pay for the family’s travel, accommodation and funeral costs because Younus was an active volunteer with the organisation.

Younus’s coffin was earlier displayed in a hall for his friends and family to farewell him. When his parents arrived, the hall was emptied.

Younus was remembered as an active member of the local community who arrived in Australia two years ago. He had volunteered to help with the flood clean-up before he died.

Younus shared a home with two friends – Imran Ahfad and Atta Sharifi.

Ahfad said they had enjoyed travelling and seeing Australia. “We travelled a lot, especially in the past year, to different cities,” he said. “We would spend time there with friends.”

The housemate said Younus “loved going to the gym and playing volleyball – he was a very energetic person”.

Mirza Sharif, the public relations director at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association of Australia, said it had been difficult to arrange for Younus’s parents to travel to Sydney for the funeral.

4,4,FL-2020-000185-PAK,A glacial disaster in the making - The News International,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/838236-a-glacial-disaster-in-the-making,"On August 15, 2020, a teenage girl was killed in a remote village in Chitral as a glacial flood swept away six houses, partially damaging sixteen others and inundating standing crops of wheat and beans. Another 11 people were injured as the local police station and a post of Chitral Scouts were submerged. The glacial flood washed away a stretch of more than 500 meters of road to Baroghil valley as well.

Fast-forward to February 28, 2021 and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issues a GLOF (glacial lake outburst flood) warning on the Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers in Hunza. The situation is still developing and a potential GLOF event is expected in May-June 2021 which will put the population in the downstream community of Hassanabad village at risk of glacial flooding. The Shishper-Muchuhur glaciers have a history of flash flooding. The current surge of Shishper, a 25 sq kms glacier in size, has brought its snout as close as four km from the Karakoram highway, a critical route for the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) initiative in the region.

This is the new normal in the everyday life of these remote and impoverished mountain communities. Recurring loss of life, property and livelihood due to natural catastrophes, associated primarily with the changing climate in the region, is only aggravating with every passing year. Even worse, these climatic changes are altering weather patterns in the long term, which are not properly understood by these local communities. Though climate-induced changes encompass a wide range of pressing issues, water is arguably the most essential natural resource at risk.

Pakistan is a unique place: the country hosts 7,200+ glaciers in its North, spread over approximately 17,000 sq km, which is home to the mighty Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges. It has reportedly more glacial ice than anywhere on earth outside the polar regions – hence referred to as the third pole. These glaciers feed the rivers that account for around 75 percent of the stored-water supply in a country inhabited by 212+ million people.

Ironically, Pakistan contributes less than one percent to global pollutant emissions, which ranks it among the least emitters. Yet, the country is among the most vulnerable to climate-related hazards like changing monsoon patterns, rapid glacial ice melt leading to inundation and flash flooding, avalanches, landslides and extreme heatwaves. Consequently, climate-induced migration by the local population in mountain and downstream communities of this region to save lives and to look for better livelihood opportunities is a serious challenge. This is the real evidence of the direct human cost of climate change in this part of the world.

Glaciers are a source of freshwater and vital for the ecosystem. As a consequence of climate change and global warming, several glaciers around the world are shrinking in size and gradually retreating. Depending on the volume and size of the glacial lake, temperature and precipitation, and geomorphological parameters of the terrain, mechanical failures may cause a breach in the wall of an ice or moraine-dammed glacial lake. Subsequently, a sudden discharge of millions of cubic meters of meltwater and debris can occur in a short time, with a catastrophic impact on the socioeconomic life of the downstream communities. This phenomenon is referred to as Glacial Lake Outburst Floods or GLOFs.

These GLOFs are a major hazard in high altitude glaciated regions of northern Pakistan. According to a UNDP report, around 3,033 glacial lakes have been identified in this region, with at least 33 critical lakes. Many recent scientific studies are projecting an increase in the frequency of GLOFs in the wake of ongoing climate change and global warming. The government of Pakistan's ‘National Climate Change Policy’ identifies the projected recession of HKH glaciers as a major climate threat, while a key finding of the Asian Development Bank, reported in 2017, is the lack of glacier monitoring infrastructure in Pakistan.

Most of the glaciers in Pakistan are at low altitude and the settlements are near the glaciers. This makes them more vulnerable. Dr Arun Bhakta Shrestha, the regional programme manager for River Basins & Cryosphere at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, has emphasized that even if the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions are reduced to limit the temperature rise as envisioned in the Paris Agreement, a scenario with only a two degree Celsius could still be devastating as two-third of glaciers in the HKH would melt away!

Mitigative measures at local, national and international levels in a coherent manner are immediate imperatives. Mountain and downstream communities settled in these disaster-prone areas are unceasingly at risk and their vulnerabilities are augmented by poverty, lack of awareness about the GLOF threats, increasing pressure on natural resources, and high-risk settlement patterns. At the local level, adaptation to climate change and resilience building through specific initiatives – early warning systems, promotion of clean energy in the mountains, reducing deforestation and land-use regulation – must be enforced. In a country like Pakistan, which lacks essential infrastructure for glacier monitoring, disaster management policies, risk reduction plans, early warning systems and scientific approach and equipment to deal with the new risks and vulnerabilities arising from its natural resources, it is imperative that the international community must come forward and help.

At the moment, the government of Pakistan, through the Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC), and UNDP Pakistan are implementing a $37 million project named Scaling Up of GLOF Risk Reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II), a continuation of the GLOF-I pilot project, which aims to empower communities to identify and manage risks associated with GLOFs. This project is expanding weather information surveillance by installing 50 automatic weather stations at different locations in the Gilgit-Baltistan region. Though these weather stations will provide information as part of a local-level early warning system, they are limited in scope and scalability for now.

The glaciated region of HKH is vast and stretches over thousands of kilometres across several countries. This third pole necessitates more engagement of the international community through development of local infrastructure, investment in building community resilience, prevention of deforestation, reduction in GHG emissions, application of scientific approach, tools and methods in their study, risk assessment and reduction planning at the regional level, continuous monitoring and integrated analysis of the evolution of glaciers.

The recent summit by US President Biden has made some headway, but there is a real urgency for stronger climate action, limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as proposed in the Paris Agreement, helping vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts and discussing opportunities to strengthen capacity to protect lives and livelihoods from the impacts of climate change.

Climate change doesn’t seem to recognize our borders on land and water, and Mother Nature is ruthless when it comes to punishing. Efforts beyond borders, strategic alliances and politics are essential and only an all-inclusive approach can yield desired results.

Streets and homes were flooded with sewage water in Karachi on Tuesday, where the city’s outdated drainage and waste systems were overwhelmed by another spell of heavy rain.

Of the total rain-related casualties, 31 deaths were reported in southern Sindh province, while 23 people died in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the agency.

It said 15 deaths were reported in south-western Baluchistan province and eight in Punjab province. Thirteen more people died elsewhere in the north of the country, including three in the Pakistan-administered sector of Kashmir.

Troops, rescuers and volunteers from the radical Islamist group Tehreek-e-Labbaik were seen evacuating people from inundated residential neighborhoods in Karachi as some families waded through waist-high water. Hundreds of people were forced to take shelter in the houses of relatives in the country’s largest city.

According to the disaster agency, troops using boats evacuated 300 people from rain-hit district of Dadu in Sindh province, while 1,245 people were evacuated from Karachi’s rain-hit areas, where residents said they were still waiting for help.

The rains are expected to continue this week in Karachi, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, earlier this month sent troops to help local authorities in pumping out rainwater from inundated residential areas.

Monsoon rains are lashing Pakistan at a time when authorities are trying to contain the spread of the coronovirus, which caused more than 6,200 deaths since February when the country reported its first case. Pakistan reported nine more Covid-19 deaths Tuesday, one of the lowest numbers of daily fatalities since March.

Fallen power lines caused widespread electrical outages, adding misery to the lives of many of the city’s 15 million residents. Some workers stayed at their offices while others spent the night in open areas because there was no public transport to get home in many parts of the city.

Hundreds of vehicles were dragged along the streets by powerful flood waters.

At least eight people were killed when a wall fell on them in a residential area. The victims included children who were playing at the time. Other casualties were also reported in various parts of Karachi in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll from rain-related incidents to more than 40 in recent weeks.

7,7,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Pakistan slum dwellers map flood risks to stop evictions - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210412075730-4tzvi/,"Mapping of informal settlements is key to protecting residents from worsening climate change impacts with as little disruption as possible, urban experts say

By Rina Chandran

April 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Slum dwellers in the Pakistani city of Karachi have stopped the demolition of thousands of homes by mapping flood risks from clogged drains, offering a feasible solution to other informal settlements facing climate change impacts, urban experts said.

After unexpectedly heavy rains flooded much of Karachi last year, authorities said some slum settlements would be removed to allow drains to be widened, with hundreds of homes in Manzoor Colony settlement earmarked for demolition.

Residents, who had always insisted that the flooding was mainly caused by drains blocked with rubbish and sludge, teamed up with non-profit organisations to map the drainage network.

""They generated their own evidence to uncover the reasons – overlooked by authorities – why Karachi floods,"" said Arif Hasan, an architect and planner who backed the mapping project.

""The communities believed that if these obstructions are removed and the drains are cleaned and maintained, flooding will not take place,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

About 12 million people out of Karachi's 16 million population live in informal settlements, and are increasingly vulnerable as Pakistan's largest city faces worsening inundations as the South Asian monsoon brings extreme weather.

Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub, has a network of 550 stormwater drains that criss-cross the city and empty into the Arabian Sea. Many are blocked by illegal construction and waste.

Authorities say they clean out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide funds. The unusually heavy rains killed dozens, submerged main roads and inundated hundreds of homes.

To map Manzoor Colony's drains, a team from the non-profit Technical Training Resource Center (TTRC) walked along them with residents, photographing, marking and mapping more than a dozen blockages.

Their map showed only about 40 houses needed to be removed to leave the drains clear, said Mohammad Sirajuddin, head of TTRC, who led the mapping project.

""The authorities said thousands of houses would need to be demolished, but our maps showed otherwise,"" he said.

In November, residents successfully halted the planned demolitions in Manzoor Colony.

While it is not certain whether authorities will use the community's flood risk map in the future, the residents now know where the choke points are and how they can tackle the dangers, Sirajuddin said.

Two other informal settlements in Karachi are being mapped, with residents - especially young people - trained, he said, adding that the model can be replicated across the country.

These maps also generate crucial data on households, said Nausheen Anwar, director of Karachi Urban Lab, a think-tank.

""The maps provide a process through which consensus can be built and inclusion of all residents can be negotiated to stave off evictions and establish a basis for just compensation and resettlement,"" she said.

By 2030, more than half of Pakistan's projected 250 million population are expected to live in cities, compared to 36% now, according to the United Nations.

Prime Minister Imran Khan had pledged to build 5 million affordable homes within five years to address a chronic shortage, with housing rights groups warning that poorer residents face evictions as pressure on land increases.

""When youths in the settlements are trained in mapping, they better understand the risks they face,"" said TTRC's Sirajuddin.

""They understand their rights, and can fight evictions.""

8,8,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Qatar LNG Plans To Flood World Market – gCaptain - gcaptain.com - gcaptain.com,https://gcaptain.com/qatar-lng-world-market-exports/,"By Anna Shiryaevskaya (Bloomberg) The world’s top exporter of liquefied natural gas is ramping up production dramatically and undercutting competitors in a bid to squeeze them out the market.

Qatar is dropping prices and pushing ahead with a $29 billion project to boost its exports of the fuel by more than 50%, stymieing the prospects of new plants elsewhere. It’s also established a trading team to compete in the nascent spot market and pushing into Asia more aggressively, according to people familiar with the matter.

The strategy marks a shift for Qatar, which has barely raised production in the past five years and traditionally prioritized prices over market share. Increased competition, especially from the U.S. and Australia, has forced the Persian Gulf state to become more nimble and attract buyers in Asia, a hot spot for gas demand.

The global transition to renewable energy is adding to the country’s sense of urgency. While LNG was until recently touted as a bridge from coal and oil to the likes of solar and wind power, it’s falling out of favor with some governments as they step up efforts to slow climate change.

“Qatar’s expansion plan is so huge that there are questions on the need for other supply options,” said Julien Hoarau, head of EnergyScan, the analytics unit of the French utility Engie SA. “It’s still the number one, but the U.S. has never been so close, so Qatar needed to move if it wanted to keep its leading position.”

The U.S. came close to overtaking Qatar’s monthly exports for the first time in April, while Australia has been neck-in-neck with the Middle Eastern nation for the last year, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. As Gulf Coast projects develop, the U.S. is slated to briefly become the world’s top supplier by 2024, before Qatar regains that status later in the decade, according to BloombergNEF.

Several factors are playing into Qatar’s hands. China, one of the fastest growing LNG markets, has been reluctant to import more from the U.S. or Australia due to trade and geopolitical tensions.

But Qatar’s main advantage is that it has the world’s lowest production costs thanks to an abundance of easy-to-extract gas, most of it contained in the giant North Field that extends into Iran.

Bonds Coming

Qatar’s state energy company, which may soon sell up to $10 billion of bonds to fund the gas expansion, said the project will be viable even with oil at $20 a barrel, 70% less than current levels. LNG contracts are typically linked to oil.

That’s enabling Qatar Petroleum to set pricing below what other exporters can manage, according to traders. The firm has sold LNG in recent months at around 10% of Brent crude prices, including to China and Pakistan, whereas it used to set the level at 15%.

“Nobody can compete with Qatari costs,” said Jonathan Stern, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies. “They can do whatever they like and everybody will have to respond the way they can. And, especially when the market is in surplus and prices are low, that will impact the competition’s profits.”

QP executives have jetted across Asia over the past few months to ink export deals. Their efforts led in March to a 10-year contract with Beijing-based Sinopec, signed at 10%-10.19% of Brent.

Qatar’s Ministry of Energy and QP didn’t respond to requests for comment.

A few years ago, demand for LNG was projected to rise steeply over the coming decades. Gas emits less carbon dioxide than most other fossil fuels when it’s burned, while renewable-energy projects were still too expensive to power electricity grids, factories and transport on a mass scale.

But solar and wind technology is improving faster than expected, helped in part by massive government green-spending programs triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

We’re Not Afraid

Even as Qatar seeks to make the most of its assets, there are obstacles to it reaching total domination. Many buyers want a diverse group of suppliers. Russia’s Yamal LNG project and the planned Arctic LNG 2 plant, led by Novatek PJSC, are among those that will remain competitive as Qatar ramps up exports, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc.

The biggest U.S. LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc., said it’s unperturbed by Qatar’s moves. Some importers are attracted by American firms offering more flexible delivery terms and pricing that’s not tied to oil, which has soared almost 30% this year.

“We’re not afraid,” Cheniere’s Chief Commercial Officer Anatol Feygin told investors this month. “We’re part of a sort of diversification of the supply and contracting structure along with Qatar Petroleum and our friends at Novatek.”

Yet U.S. projects are among those most likely to struggle. At least 10, five of them in Texas and four in Louisiana, probably won’t secure enough financing to be completed, according to analysis from BloombergNEF.

Feedstock costs are part of the problem. American companies have to buy gas at around $2.50 per million British thermal units, way above Qatar’s wellhead prices of $0.30 or lower.

New suppliers in the U.S. need spot LNG prices to be at least $7.80 per million Btu in Asia and $6.80 in Europe, said David Thomas, an independent adviser and former head of LNG at Vitol, the world’s largest independent oil trader. For comparison, Asian rates have averaged about $6.80 over the last five years. The economics for producers in Australia and Africa are similar, Thomas said.

The lack of new supply from other countries will benefit Qatar, Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi, who is also chief executive officer of QP, said in an interview with Bloomberg in February. “Our expansion is very timely,” he said.

“The Qatari strategy appears to be maintaining its global market share and also maximizing sales, before the gas market starts to shrink,” OIES’s Stern said. “It is a competitive and strategic rush. They recognize LNG demand will eventually decline as the world moves forward in the energy transition.”

10,10,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Pakistan’s sprawling Karachi ‘broken’ by monsoon floods - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/4/pakistans-sprawling-karachi-broken-by-monsoon-floods,"Record rains inundated Pakistan’s largest city, paralysing city authorities as people were left to fend for themselves.

Karachi/Islamabad, Pakistan – For Shahzad Ahmed, there was no time to think.

“The windows broke and the door caved in, that’s how intense the water pressure was,” he said of the first night of torrential monsoon rain in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, last week.

“We didn’t even try to take the water out of the house. I just tied my rickshaw [to a pole] as tightly as I could and my family and I [got on] the rooftop.”

Ahmed, his wife and children spent more than 10 hours on that roof, in the pouring rain, as Karachi saw more than 230mm of rainfall in less than 12 hours, the most ever recorded, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed and thousands of homes washed away in flooding across the country, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) (PDF).

We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started. Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper

Karachi, a sprawling metropolis of more than 20 million people, was one of the worst-hit by the urban flooding. Streets turned to rivers, as the sheer volume of water quickly overloaded the city’s dilapidated and ill-maintained drainage systems.

In Ahmed’s working-class neighbourhood of Yousuf Goth, a video taken after the rains showed water flowing through the streets, mixing with sewage and solid waste, as residents waded through it to salvage what they can from their homes.

“What we need most right now is clean drinking water and vegetables. You can’t make a meal out of oil or just packets [of dry food],” said Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood.

Muhammad Rashid, 29, a construction worker, said his family was trapped at home, but he had to wade through the sewage periodically to try and find drinking water.

Shehzad Ansari’s aluminium door and window frame shop was inundated by the floods, and ‘everything was destroyed’, he says [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

“The only thing I left the house for was water,” he said. “We slept without food on the first night. We were safe on our roof, but I kept leaving in the five feet of water just to get [drinking] water.”

The city’s main thoroughfares did not cope much better, submerged under several feet of water, leaving cars stranded or washed away in the flow. Desperate residents took to contracting agricultural tractors to try and winch their vehicles out.

Electricity supply across the city failed, or was pre-emptively cut, almost immediately, as the city’s main utility company reported its substations were being flooded. The pre-emptive cuts were aimed at limiting deaths due to electrocution if exposed wires were to come into contact with water in the streets.

Right now, it's like kicking a dead horse. They just don't have the capacity for it. Farhan Anwar, urban planner

At least six people died as a result of such electrocutions, hospital officials told Al Jazeera.

Ahmed said he had to take the risk to move his family after 48 hours spent on their rooftop without electricity, water or natural gas to cook with.

“I was worried about the [electricity] current in the waters, but when the choice is between certain death by starvation or possibly electrocution, what could I do?”

‘Governance system failure’

As the rains now begin to subside, the hard work of cleaning up the debris and rebuilding will begin. In a city as divided and administratively “broken” as Karachi, however, urban planners and researchers said that will be easier said than done.

“It is an overall governance system failure,” said Farhan Anwar, an urban planner and faculty member at Karachi’s Habib University. “You can’t isolate a particular cause for it [because] we have, over the years, allowed the city to develop and grow without planning or regulation or a framework.”

Anwar said the city was “on its knees” after the rains, and that its institutions, plagued by decades of mismanagement, a lack of planning and political contestation, simply do not have the capacity to deal with the situation.

“These institutions of governance that are responsible for maintaining services, whether it is water, solid waste management, land, transportation or sewage, they are all totally bankrupt,” he said.

“Right now, it’s like kicking a dead horse. They just don’t have the capacity for it.”

One of the reasons for this, Anwar and others told Al Jazeera, is the complex nature of Karachi’s administrative setup. The city is administered by more than a dozen land-owning civic agencies, all of which work independently and are not beholden to a single set of policies.

The city has a mayor, elected in 2016, but he said he only controls 12 percent of the city’s overall area.

A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture Haris Gazdar, researcher

The rest of the city is managed by a mix of federal and provincial government-controlled landholding bodies, cooperative housing societies, the port authority, the railways department, industrial area authorities and military-run cantonments (PDF).

This situation, Anwar argued, has “straitjacketed” growth and development in Karachi.

“Various agencies have control over resources and management and there is no collaboration or coordination between them … Everyone is on their own.”

As political parties play out their contestations over civic institutions, analysts said, it has left most bankrupt.

“The confrontation between the Pakistan People’s Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement over the years has resulted in a tug of war that is played out within these institutions,” said Anwar.

Nazish Brohi, a social sector researcher, says Karachi’s history of violence – it was the site of brutal political violence through the 1990s and again from 2008 onwards – means there is a high price associated with any kind of reform.

“Because Karachi has been so volatile, in terms of conflict and violence in the past, no one wants to disturb the equilibrium,” she said. “The minute someone intervenes, there is fear of a conflagration.”

In 2012, Karachi was the world’s most dangerous megacity, with a homicide rate far higher than any other city of its size, as the battle for power in the city, rooted in ethnic and identity-based politics, played itself out on the city’s streets.

This year, Pakistan has seen some of the most intense monsoon rains in years, with more than 189 people killed [Aysha Imtiaz/Al Jazeera]

A military operation targeting the MQM party, which was held responsible for much of the violence, has since reduced the number of violent deaths in the city considerably, although critics said the operation itself involved a large number of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances.

The scars of that violence can affect everything, even the rebuilding of the city’s drainage system, argues Brohi. She gives the example of the need to clear the city’s drainage channels of illegally built structures that have blocked them.



“The drainage channels are choked right now, and those encroachments obviously need to be cleared,” she said. “But when the city is undergirded by an ethnic grid, then questions of which drainage channel you touch first can lead to a conflagration.”

The worst-hit area

One of the largest landholding bodies in Karachi is the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), a civic authority run by the country’s powerful military that controls 5 percent of urban Karachi’s land (PDF).

This week, hundreds of residents protested outside the offices DHA’s sister body, the Clifton Cantonment Board (CCB), demanding authorities do more to drain water that had been standing in their streets and homes for days.

In a statement, DHA said its staff was “working round the clock to bring life back to normal”, adding that it would work with the protesters to address the concerns of residents.

A day later, it also registered police charges against protest organisers for “rioting [while] armed with a deadly weapon” at the angry, but peaceful protest.

The area, one of the richest in Karachi, was surprisingly some of the worst-hit, with many neighbourhoods remaining inundated a week after the worst of the rains. Video footage shared with Al Jazeera showed residents complaining of flooded roads and basements, with many forced to sleep on rooftops on in stairwells.

For the city’s urban poor, the situation has been even worse.

“A lot of people have lost everything, a lot of their saving and investment was in the form of their appliances or furniture,” said Haris Gazdar, senior researcher at the Collective for Social Science Research. “And if you are even poorer than that, you have no assets other than maybe your [food] ration that you had stored up.”

“We live from hand to mouth and it was the end of the month,” says Kulsoom Bibi, a housekeeper in the Mehmoodabad neighbourhood. “For two days, neither my sister nor I could get out because to [leave] the … tunnel was filled to the brim.”

The impact of the floods is also continuing for many, as their livelihoods or businesses have been decimated by the water.

“How will patients reach me? They can’t. I haven’t seen any patients at my clinic since it started to rain,” said Arif Javed, a herbalist doctor standing amidst the wreckage of his store.

Azhar Abbas, a shopkeeper, returned home after having moved to a relative’s home in a drier neighbourhood for a few days.

“It’s been 12 days since we had proper electricity,” he said. “We used to have clean drinking water, but we haven’t had any since the rain started.”

Climate change

On Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan directed authorities to prepare a plan within a week to reform Karachi’s administrative systems.

Experts, however, scoffed at the idea that anything will change on the ground unless the underlying political contestation and other issues are not addressed.

“It’s not that the city has not been planned for,” said Anwar, the urban planner. “There are so many plans, so many master plans, it’s just a matter of implementation and political consensus existing, and a level of sincerity of how you want to do it.”

For Gazdar, fixing Karachi’s problems goes beyond bureaucratic reshuffles – it requires both a fundamental reorganisation of administrative authority, and a clear focus on climate change.

“Flooding happens everywhere, even in cities in very advanced countries – they also suffer flooding and droughts and fires and so on,” he said.

“A lot of it is a failure to detect what the planet is trying to tell us. If you look at a global picture of the planet, [this is] a failure of the way we live our lives.”

In recent years, Karachi, and the Sindh province of which it is a part, has seen increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, leading to periods of drought and flood, and rainfall intensity changes that have badly affected agricultural practices that have stood in place for centuries.

Asked if he believes any of this will change, however, Gazdar laughs.

“What will happen in the coming weeks is that some other issue will take the spotlight,” he says. “Seven days is a nice period of time, because on the seventh day something else would have happened somewhere else in the country, and that needs another seven days, and before you know it another 70 years will go by.”

More than 400 people have died since mid-June; another 400 were injured; and more than 200,000 homes were damaged or destroyed.

The Sindh province in southeastern Pakistan, which received historic amounts of rain, has been the most affected region. The images above show a portion of Sindh on (September 21, 2020) compared to the same time last year (September 21, 2019). The false-color images, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite, use a combination of infrared and visible light (bands 7-2-1) to make it easier to see the boundary between water and land. Water appears navy blue and black; vegetation is bright green.

Sindh was hit by sporadic heavy rains in July and experienced record-breaking rainfall in August. Karachi, the provincial capital and country’s most populous city, recorded the most August rainfall in 89 years of record keeping. Karachi received around 490 millimeters (19 inches) of rain for the month—more than 200 millimeters occurred within twelve hours. According to news reports, some of the urban flooding was the result of clogged stormwater drains.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported heavy rains in late August in other parts of the province, affecting the districts of Mirpur Khas, Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Larkana. The Karachi, Hyderbad, and Mirpur Khas districts were declared “calamity-affected areas.” More than 2 million people across Sindh Province have been affected by monsoon rains this year, with 68,000 residents displaced in relief camps.

The government also reported that nearly one million acres of crops have also been destroyed by the flooding. Fields of cotton, vegetables, onions, tomatoes, and sugarcane have been affected.

Monsoon season generally lasts from mid-June through September. As of September 24, the PMD reported normal flow along the Indus and several other key rivers in the country.

But the province in southeast Pakistan has banned rice cultivation in 10 districts on the left bank of the Indus river.

This ban is announced every year at the end of April or early May to limit the waterlogging, salinity and drought-like conditions caused by successive rice farming. By some accounts, rice cultivation has been banned in these areas for over 90 years. Similarly, the Indian government bans paddy cultivation in “dark zones” to help water aquifers.

“Dark zones” are areas of acute overexploitation of groundwater, due to the use of water exceeding its recharge. But these orders fall on deaf ears, as rice cultivation continues in large swathes of farmland in both countries.

Rasheed Channa, the spokesperson for Sindh’s chief minister, said this time will be different. The government is “dead serious” about penalising those who violate the ban, Channa said. District administrations have already been told to be on the lookout for nurseries and “raze the seedlings before they can be transplanted” to flooded fields.

The news sparked considerable anger within the farming community, with farmers saying the government’s timing and thought process were poor.

“The growers were informed just a month before sowing that paddy will not be allowed,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, senior vice-president of the Sindh Abadgar Board, an organisation formed to protect the rights of farmers in the province. “They had not prepared land or bought seeds to grow an alternative crop.”

Policymakers must realise that switching crops on more than 40,000 hectares after the season for other crops has passed is “almost impossible”, he added.

“Even if 20,000 acres [8,000 hectares] are suddenly cultivated for other crops, where will we get buyers from? The prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits will fall,” he pointed out.

Rice and water

While fears for livelihoods are valid, the ban underscores the government’s growing concerns about water scarcity. The chief minister, who is a progressive farmer himself, said one kilogramme of rice requires up to 3,000 litres of water. Officials said water standing in rice farms for long periods of time has caused waterlogging, and that the high-delta crop also uses up other crops’ share of water for irrigation. Low-delta crops need comparatively less water.

As Pakistan grapples with increased glacial melt and erratic rainfall, managing the canal-fed, water-intensive rice crop is yet another problem. The issue is exacerbated by high demand and the fact that rice generates 8% of Pakistan’s income from exports.

Zahid Bhurgri, general secretary of the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a lobbying group for farmers, agrees that rice causes waterlogging and soil destruction. But he also said it is “safe”.

“It is considered a safer bet, especially as we confront climate change [because of which] too much or too little water can destroy other delicate crops, like cotton,” Bhurgri said. He added that rice is an easier crop to grow as it “requires nothing but to be submerged in three to four inches of water”.

Justifying rice ban

“There will be 30% less water this year,” said Sindh’s agriculture minister, Ismail Rahu, to The Third Pole, justifying the ban on the “water guzzler”.

Though Rahu acknowledges that “rice is the bread and butter of hundreds of farmers”, he suggested they cultivate low-delta crops, such as beans, melon and vegetables, as they are less water-intensive and detrimental to the soil.

In many of these districts, the water that is available is of poor quality.

Zarif Khero, the chief engineer at Sindh’s Irrigation Department, said the most important consideration is soil fertility, which is spoilt by rice.

“The way [rice cultivation] is done by flooding the fields causes waterlogging, which will eventually turn the soil into wasteland,” he said.

Finding alternatives

Rafique Suleman, a spokesperson for trade body the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan, sees the ban as nothing short of an “atrocity”.

“Instead of providing incentives to grow more, the government is taking away our livelihood,” he said. He pointed out that rice, Pakistan’s second-biggest export after textiles, annually brings in around $2.5 billion into the country.

There is similar resistance in India. Despite depleting groundwater in paddy farming areas, farmers do not give up rice because of assured buying from the states of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana.

The only way out, some say, is to give farmers incentives to grow something else.

Farmer with solution

This is where Asif Sharif, a progressive farmer from Pakpattan in Pakistan’s Punjab province, comes in. Sharif, an online sensation within the South Asian farming community, has a solution: if the rice has to be grown, it should happen without flood irrigation. According to him, the rice plant uses 70% of its energy just to survive the inundation.

“Rice can be grown with minimal water,” said the 70-year-old. He added that the ban in parts of Sindh is “unnecessary”.

“Give it less water and the yield will be three to four times more,” he said, adding that the soil should be kept reasonably moist.

Sharif grows a variety of crops on his 200 hectares of land and has thousands of farmers listening to his every word. He engages with the virtual community and gives advice to people from across the globe.

He has more than 24,000 followers, mostly farmers, including quite a few from Punjab on the Indian side. They share videos on his Facebook page, titled Pedaver, showing how well their crops are doing after they follow his tips.

Sharif said, “everything can be grown anywhere”.

He advocates for farmers to return to doing cultivation on raised beds, without tilling and using organic mulch. Paradoxical agriculture, or “paedar qudrati nizam kashtkari” as he calls it, is a “comprehensive climate-smart production process total solution”.

“The process took several years to develop and mature,” said Sharif. “I started with the System of Rice Intensification in 2008. Then merged the crop system of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ Conservation Agriculture by 2011. This is how the process evolved by 2014.”

The results are impressive. “In Punjab, we have reduced the production cost of wheat from 1,500 Pakistani rupees to 400 Pakistani rupees per 40 kg,” he claimed.

And yet, he has been unable to bring about a revolution. He faults the farm munshi or manager for thwarting development. “They get huge kickbacks by creating demand for each input that increases the cost of production,” he said.

Farmers with huge landholdings are also to blame, he said. “In connivance with corporations and businesses, they keep the rural population deprived of knowledge and therefore, prosperity,” he said.

He talked of the need for a “crop production management company” that travels to different farmlands, teaching farmers how to grow certified crops that are exportable.

Zarif Khero from Sindh’s Irrigation Department supported the idea of training. “Farmers should engage with students from agricultural universities so they can transition to modern methods of sustainable farming which can result in better yields,” he suggested.

13,13,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Pakistan: Post-disaster recovery transition lessons from the 2010 floods - PreventionWeb,https://www.preventionweb.net/go/77313,"Source(s): Climate Adaptation Platform (CAP)



In 2010 severe flooding hit Pakistan, inundating about 37 thousand square kilometres of the nation’s area.

Over 20 million people were affected; the number is higher than those affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, 2005 Cyclone Katrina, or the 2008 cyclone Nargis in Myanmar.

The total loss from these massive floods totalled US$10.4 billion, or 5.7% of Pakistan’s GDP. After the flooding event, the rescue and relief activities lasted up to 8 months, which began in July 2010 until the end of March 2011.

Sindh province was one of the most affected by this event; out of the 20 million affected, 7.3 million residents were from the Sindh province. Sadly for them, the post-recovery after this unprecedented flood stopped at the rescue and relief phase.

According to the study, there was no recovery and reconstruction authority established in the province after the flooding incident – a task that belongs to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

Although the institution was lauded for its well-coordinated emergency phase efforts, the recovery and reconstruction phase efforts were missing in the province.

Using Pakistan’s worst flooding in 2010 as a case study, researchers examined the disaster recovery activities after the flood. They highlighted the factors that hinder the transitions to recovery phases in Pakistan, which may also be true in other developing countries.

The three Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) phases in the study are the following –

relief phase, which is meeting the most immediate needs of the community following a disaster, rehabilitation phase or the restoration of basic service and facilities to make communities and societies function; this includes providing temporary housing or shelter, mass feeding, treatment of the injured etc. and lastly, the recovery phase is also termed as the long-term phase wherein major reconstruction, development, and capacity building through structural or non-structural measures occur.

Other PDR phase model like the one proposed by Haast and others shows 4 overlapping phases – emergency, restoration, reconstruction 1, and reconstruction 2, which is similar to the UNDRR model. These PDR models are thoroughly discussed in the study.

According to the study, the Post-Disaster Recovery (PDR) in developing countries is limited to the relief and rescue operations, thus failing to transition to subsequent phases like rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery, leading to a full and long-term recovery of a community.

The study finds that the post-disaster recovery in Sindh after the 2010 floods failed to transition to the long-term recovery phase.

The factors that hindered these transitions include the following:

The lack of community-level involvement – the state and relevant institutions failed to place communities at the centre of the recovery process,

Inadequate coping capacity, resource and skills of both the community and local administration which will impede their long-term recovery actions,

Absence of any recovery and reconstruction authority after the flood

No coherence or coordination in the PDR activities among stakeholders led to confusion between stakeholders and hindered the smooth transition of recovery, and

Lack of information and data among local administration and stakeholders led to politically motivating projects and aid distributions.

Through a better understanding of the smooth transition of the various phases of the PDR, the study can help policymakers and disaster management practitioners plan and implement effective PDR strategies, especially in developing countries that are most vulnerable to climate-related and natural disasters.","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",,"['longterm', 'postdisaster', 'relief', 'lessons', 'pakistan', 'recovery', '2010', 'pdr', 'reconstruction', 'flooding', 'study', 'floods', 'phases', 'transition', 'phase']", ,flood

According to WFP, the floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton. Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

16,16,FL-2020-000185-PAK,May 21: a day of special significance for China and Pakistan - Daily Times,https://dailytimes.com.pk/758734/may-21-a-day-of-special-significance-for-china-and-pakistan/,"May 21, 2021 is a day of special significance for the People’s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. As the Chinese old saying goes, “Even mountains and seas cannot distance people with common aspirations.” 70 years ago, China and Pakistan joined hands overpass the Karakoram Mountains to formally establish diplomatic relations. The past 70 years have witnessed the two countries sharing weal and woe. The time-tested China-Pakistan friendship now sets exemplary for state-to-state relations, and is strategic asset for both countries, most dearly cherished by the two peoples.

Similar histories brought us close to each other. Both China and Pakistan are developing countries and have similar experiences in getting rid of foreign aggression and seeking independence. At such critical times, be it when New China endeavored to break the external blockade and open up a new prospect for diplomacy, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other.

Similar ideas guide us stand shoulder to shoulder. China and Pakistan are the backbones in maintaining regional peace and stability. The two countries firmly defend multilateralism, free trade and win-win cooperation, commit to improving the global governance system, and support increasing the representation and voice of developing countries in international affairs. China and Pakistan always respect the diversity of civilizations, and advocate the vision of exchanges rather than estrangement, mutual learning rather than conflict, and coexistence rather than seeking superiority.

Common interests deepen our cooperation. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pilot project of the Belt and Road Initiative. 46 projects have been completed or under construction, with a total investment of US$25.4 billion. The CPEC successfully helped Pakistan solve the power shortage that has plagued it for decades, established the main traffic line from north to south, and revitalized Gwadar Port to become a regional trade hub. China has been Pakistan’s largest trading partner for six consecutive years and largest source of FDI for seven consecutive years.

The tests of crisis reconfirms our common choice. The two peoples are always the first to lend a helping hand to each other when the other side is in trouble. When Wenchuan earthquake hit China in 2008, and when flood plagued Pakistan in 2010, both sides supported each other with full efforts. After the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, the governments, armies and all walks of life of the two countries have rendered mutual assistance, and carried out close cooperation in fields of emergency supplies, Covid-19 prevention experiences-sharing, vaccine research and development, thus setting a model for international cooperation against the pandemic.

2021 is a year of great significance for both China and Pakistan. China celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China and is implementing the 14th Five-Year Plan to embark on a new journey of modernization. Pakistan is making every effort to develop its economy and realize the Naya Pakistan vision proposed by Prime Minister Imran Khan, providing us with new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation. Standing at a new historic starting point, the two countries should further implement the important consensus reached by our leaders, continue to deepen the iron-clad friendship between China and Pakistan, and jointly build a closer China-Pakistan Community of Shared Future in the New Era.

China will continue to put Pakistan on the top agenda of its diplomacy, and firmly support Pakistan to maintain sovereign independence and territorial integrity, and exert a greater constructive role in international and regional affairs. We will continue to provide Pakistan support of medical supplies and vaccines within our capacity until Pakistan completely defeats the pandemic. Following the principle of mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, opening-up and inclusiveness, China will work with Pakistan to boost high-quality development of the CPEC, focus more on industry, agriculture, science and technology and people’s livelihood, so as to develop Pakistan’s manufacturing industry and increase employment and income of its people. China will continue to work closely with Pakistan to deepen the friendship between the two peoples, especially the young generation. We will endeavor to carry forward the China-Pakistan iron-clad friendship for another 70 years, enhancing the all-weather friendship and all-dimensional cooperation, and work together to uplift China-Pakistan bilateral relations to a new level with a brighter future.

Last but not the least, on behalf of the Embassy of China in Pakistan, I would like to extend my sincere gratitude and great respect to Pakistani friends from all circles who care about and support the development of our bilateral relations.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- Flash floods triggered by heavy rains killed 15 people and damaged scores of houses in Pakistan's scenic northwestern Swat Valley, a spokesman said Wednesday, as rescuers assisted residents in the port city of Karachi where last week's rains wreaked havoc that killed dozens.

The latest floods-related fatalities were reported from the Swat region, a popular tourist destination where landslides overnight blocked a key mountain road, stranding scores of tourists who were being evacuated, said Taimur Khan, spokesman for a disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy monsoon rains hit parts of Pakistan last month, triggering flash floods in the country's financial capital of Karachi and elsewhere in southern Sindh province, killing at least 47 people there. Since June, when rains began lashing Pakistan, at least 176 people have been killed across the country, according to the national disaster management agency.

Last week, Karachi's many neighborhoods were flooded and water is still being pump out from submerged streets.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was expected to visit Karachi to meet with residents and get a briefing about damages caused by the monsoon rains, which came as authorities have been trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 296,000 people and killed 6,318 since February.

Pakistan reported 18 more deaths on Wednesday from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

(Str/Xinhua/IANS)

Even as the country’s financial capital Karachi battles intense monsoon flood, experts have warned that Pakistan lacks modern weather forecast radars for timely prediction of flooding. Over the last one week, intense monsoon downpour over Karachi has plagued the city with waterlogging, flash floods and power cuts.

Karachi recorded a whopping 230 mm rainfall in a single day on August 27, making this August the wettest August in 89 years. Overall, at least 39 people have been killed so far in several parts of the country this week.

Monsoon death toll spike to 134

The death toll from rain-related incidents across Pakistan has increased to 134, the country's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said in a report.

Sharing the data of casualties from June 15 to August 29 on its website, the NDMA said on Saturday that rescue and relief operations were being carried out in the affected areas by concerned departments of the government, army and non-governmental organizations, reports Xinhua news agency.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the worst hit where 48 people were killed and 42 others injured, the authority said. Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah told a press conference on Friday that 80 people were killed in rains in the province with 47 fatalities in provincial capital Karachi alone.

He said 604-mm rainfall was recorded in Karachi during August, breaking the years-long record of heavy rains in the city during the month. The torrential rains have caused a disastrous situation in Balochistan province where scores were left homeless after their houses were swept away by flash floods triggered off by lashing rains.

The NDMA has provided tents, food items, blankets, mosquito nets, among others, in the affected areas. The authority said scattered thunderstorms and rain with isolated heavy falls are also expected in parts of the country on Sunday. More rainfall is expected later next week.

This year, the meteorological department forecast more than usual rains during the ongoing monsoon season and concerned departments have issued advisories for the general public to take self-precautionary measures.

Pakistan lacks modern flood warning system

Advertisement Despite the annual devastation caused by urban flooding in cities and flash floods in the mountainous areas of Pakistan, the country has neither an effective telemetry system nor authorities said. The monsoon winds are the major source of downpour in the country during the months of July-September.

""The country still does not have an effective aviation system to deal with flood disasters and other catastrophes,"" the National Monsoon Contingency Plan 2020 compiled by the Natural Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) revealed on Saturday.

According to the plan, Pakistan has a medium and long term forecast system capable of accurately predicting the weather for a period of only 7 to 15 days while the seasonal weather forecast accuracy rate is also not more than 65-70 per cent, The Express Tribune reported.

The report indicated that the country is relying on old technology for the weather forecast, which makes it difficult to create standard and accurate atmospheric predictions. There is no telemetry system for flash flood warning in the mountainous regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Balochistan.

Telemetry is the automatic recording and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to an IT system in a different location for monitoring and analysis.

For several kilometres and pretty much as far as the eye could see, there were temporary camps for the flood-affected, dispossessed communities, with families living in hastily erected shelters on the roadside.

Some 136 people have been reported dead and thousands have been displaced in this year’s monsoon season, exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The United Nations World Food Programme has reached 11,000 people with emergency food assistance and is calling for $500,000 (£400,000) to increase its reach, particularly in the Sindh region—up to 300,000 people are in need of food assistance.

Communities face serious health risks living in appalling conditions. Flies and mosquitos are everywhere. Getting by is a daily struggle. People walk long distances in search of fresh water—the alternative is to drink from the dirty water along the roadside that children play in. Many do just that.

Women bathe their children in the same water they wash clothes in. Limited supplies of clean water are strictly rationed.

Many farmers lost their cattle in the floods. Some built makeshift shelters for the animals and shared whatever clean water they could spare with them.

For some towns and villages, such as the ones in Mirpurkhas district, we had to travel by motorboat to reach the area. Villagers there told us that they hadn’t seen any outsiders ever since the floods devastated their homes and that all their crops were now gone and possessions lost; no more houses, and nothing to eat.

Working closely with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in Sindh, the World Food Programme has provided them with food rations — flour, pulses, cooking oil, and nutritious edibles for children to prevent malnutrition from setting in.

By Rina Saeed Khan

ISLAMABAD, Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Flood-slammed Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, could face worsening urban inundations in coming years, in part as the South Asian monsoon shifts, climate scientists have warned.

The winds that drive Pakistan's annual monsoon, which arrives from the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, appear to be altering as a result of climate change, which could push more rainfall to Karachi - and less to key agricultural regions, they said.

""It's new phenomenon and we need to understand it. It hasn't rained like this in Karachi for more than half a century,"" said Shaukat Ali, a meteorologist and senior scientific officer at the Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC) in Islamabad.

He said winds driving the monsoon from the Bay of Bengal appear to be shifting it northwards, away from its traditional core zone in the agricultural breadbasket of Punjab.

Winds from the Arabian Sea have traditionally been weak but now seem to be strengthening, Ali said.

This year monsoon winds were ""extremely erratic"", he said, with hotter temperatures in the Arabian Sea leading to monsoon depressions that dumped unexpectedly heavy rainfall on an unprepared Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub.

""The sea and winds behaved very differently this monsoon,"" he noted.

RECORD RAINS

Record-breaking heavy rain in Karachi in August killed over 100 people and disrupted the lives of many of the city's more than 15 million residents as water flooded main roads and homes.

The city received its largest-ever-recorded rainfall total in a single day on August 24, when 230 mm (9 inches) of rain fall in just 12 hours, according to the Pakistan Meteorology Department.

Over the month, Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) of rain, the highest total in at least 90 years, it noted.

Heavier rainfall in Karachi this year was in part the result of a La Nina phenomenon, a regular oscillation in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures that can drive changes in rainfall, said Moetasim Ashfaq, a climate computational scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the U.S. state of Tennessee.

It was likely the larger driver of this year's shift in rainfall, he said.

But as climate change warms oceans, it is also accelerating evaporation of water, which then falls as rain - one significant additional driver of Karachi's floods, he said.

Both scientists have been part of a research effort through GCISC to better predict extreme weather in South Asia and help countries adapt to it.

A paper published by Ashfaq and a dozen international researchers in June, in the journal Climate Dynamics, predicted that unchecked climate-changing emissions could shorten Asian monsoons, with more intense rain falling in a shorter period.

The rest of the year would then have longer dry periods, it said.

These extremes could worsen floods, droughts, wildfires and other weather-related threats that already pose a problem in the region, the scientists said.

CAPTURING WATER

Malik Amin Aslam, the Pakistan prime minister's special assistant on climate change, said the reports indicate the ""frequency and intensity of climate-triggered freak events is going up in Pakistan"".

That was likely to affect not just urban communities but farmers, he said.

""The timing of rains is radically shifting without allowing an agriculture adaptation to adjust to the new reality,"" he said. In a recent trip to Pakistan's mountainous north, he said, he had seen how the shifting South Asian monsoon was accelerating glacier melt, while Karachi and Sindh province's coast were receiving heavy rains that once fell out at sea.

He said Sindh is one of the most climate-impacted regions of the country, with worsening heatwaves also making life difficult for residents.

To deal with increasing extreme rainfall and glacier melt, he said, the country needed to find ways to capture and store ""the huge amounts of water which are becoming available"" in order to recharge aquifers and provide water in dry periods.

Ashfaq agreed that more reservoirs and dams were needed to store water and for flood control. Cities and towns also needed to adapt their infrastructure for extreme rainfall events and move homes away from riverbanks, he said.

KARACHI, Pakistan -- Three days of heavy monsoon rains triggering flash floods killed at least 58 people in various parts of Pakistan, as troops with boats rushed Sunday to evacuate people from flood-affected districts in the country's southern Sindh and southwestern Baluchistan provinces.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning. The monsoon season runs from July through September, during which swelling rivers cause damage to crops and infrastructure.

According to Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority, 19 people were killed in rain-related incidents in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 12 in southern Sindh province, eight in Punjab province and 10 in the country's scenic northern Gligit Baltistan region in the past three days.

Rains also partially damaged about 100 homes and caused a breach in a flooded main canal, inundating villages in Sindh province. In a statement, the military said troops used boats to rescue stranded people and move them to safety. It said a medical camp was also established and food was being provided to the rescued people.

Heavy rains also lashed many districts in the southwestern Baluchistan province, killing eight people, damaging homes and inundating many villages in the district of Jhal Magsi, according to Saleem Zakir, spokesman for provincial disaster management authority. He said rescuers with the army’s help were still trying to evacuate people from the district's flood-hit villages.

He said floods damaged a bridge and a gas pipeline and destroyed coastal roads on the Arabian Sea, severing links to the port of Gwadar, part of China’s multi-billion dollar one-road project linking south and Central Asia to China.

According to local media reports, hundreds of people moved to nearby hills when the floodwaters entered their villages in remote areas of Baluchistan, and the military used helicopters and boats to move them to safer places. Authorities were dispatching tents and food for the flood-affected people.

Heavy rainfall began last week and continued Sunday, flooding streets even in the eastern city of Lahore. It especially disrupted normal life last week in Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's commercial hub, where sewage flooded most of the streets, prompting Prime Minister Imran Khan to order the army to assist authorities in handling the situation.

According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rains are expected to continue next week.

In Pakistan and neighboring India, deadly floods occur regularly during the monsoon season.

26,26,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Chitralis chalk out own disaster risk management plans - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1624066,"CHITRAL: The residents of the disaster-prone villages of Chitral have formulated their own disaster risk management plans to mitigate the destruction caused by natural calamities.

Wasif Ahmed, resilience manager of an international organisation based in Chitral, told Dawn that the region was highly vulnerable to natural hazards like hydrological, geo-climatic and glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs).

He said a number of natural disasters had struck Chitral during the last about 15 years, claiming scores of lives and sweeping away more than five villages. He said loss to the physical infrastructure was estimated at Rs16 billion.

“Chitral is home to 543 glaciers spreading over 4,000 square kilometres, out of which, 116 have been declared sensitive and 10 hyper-sensitive. Most of these glaciers are said to be at the verge of explosion, triggering Glofs,” he said.

“The vulnerable communities have made them highly resilient to such disasters. If a village is hit by a disaster they manage it efficiently by mobilising their own resources and volunteers to carry out rescue operations.”

Trained by Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH) the vulnerable villagers have formulated their own disaster risk management plans keeping in view the nature of the hazard and its anticipated magnitude, he explained.

“As per the management plan, a stockpile of non-food items is maintained at the union council level to be moved to the affected area without waiting for the government response,” Wasif Ahmed said.

He said the trained volunteers rushed to the community emergency response team (CERT) within a few minutes of the occurrence of the disaster and started search and rescue operations. Women had also been included in the scheme, he added.

He recalled that a group of volunteers had rushed to a village in Karimabad valley last year in no time, shifted the injured to safe places, provided them first aid and arranged food supplies for the displaced.

Mr Ahmed said the community-based risk management mechanism had helped people in the disaster-prone valleys of Chitral in an efficient way.

He said the residents of the flood-prone villages had recently put in place an early warning system and deputed a person in the highlands with a mobile phone who promptly informed them about any incoming flood.

In July last year, the residents of Golen valley rushed to the higher lands within 10 to 15 minutes of the explosion of a glacial lake after the person deputed at highlands informed them about it, he said.

27,27,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Graveyards in Rawalpindi city running out of space - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1625120,"RAWALPINDI: The shortage of space in existing graveyards of the city has been a cause for concern among residents of the city as the government continues to ignore the issue.

Almost 90pc of Rawalpindi’s graveyards are short on space to accommodate fresh requests to bury the dead. There are more than 60 small and big graveyards in the garrison city and 10 in cantonment areas.

All main graveyards of the city including Ratta Amral, Pirwadhai, Eidgah, Shan Diyan Talian, Kuri Road, Dhoke Khaba, Dhoke Illahi Buksh, Dhoke Kashmirian, Cha Sultan, Malikan Da Kabristan, and the one near Committee Chowk do not have space for new graves. Yet, grave diggers dig new graves over unattended ones to accommodate requests that cannot be turned down.

During a survey, Dawn found encroachments along graveyards whereas due to limited space, managements of graveyard committees have also been charging higher prices for new graves. All graveyards are without boundary walls and land grabbers have managed to carry out construction in their surrounding areas; the worst affected is one of the oldest graveyards of Rawalpindi whereas the Dhoke Ratta and Pirwadhai graveyards also present the same picture.

Management of the graveyards had dug new graves along the bank of the nullah passing through the area but during monsoon, flood water destroys them, creating problems for the heirs.

The Eidgah graveyard is accommodating new arrivals as the management extended limits of the graveyard along the banks of the nullah.

Racecourse graveyard in cantonment is also running out of space. The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) imposed a ban on new arrivals in the graveyard and asked that limited space be allocated for only army personnel.

Mohammad Nasir, resident of Mohanpura, said that his father died two months ago and he visited all the graveyards near his locality but they refused to bury his father. He said he talked to a grave-digger in Dhoke Illahi Buksh who managed to provide a space between two graves for his deceased father.

A resident of Chaklala Scheme III, Mudassir Malik said his brother died a few weeks ago and his family faced difficulty in finding a place to bury the deceased as there was no space available in Chaklala Scheme-III graveyard.

He said he paid Rs30,000 to the graveyard near Chungi Stop adjacent to Scheme-III. The government should allocate space for a graveyard in the city. In mid-90’s, 1000 kanals of land was allocated for the purpose in Rakh Dhamial but since the last 26 years, all governments failed to develop the graveyard.

In 2017, the PML-N government had launched project Shehr-e-Khamoshan and started work to construct a funeral prayer site, mosque, ablution area and other facilities but the graveyard is still not being utilised.

On the other hand, officials of the administration said that people were not interested in burying their near and dear ones in Rakh Dhamial as it was out of the city. There is no proper transport to carry the deceased and people to attend funeral prayers.

RDA, which is responsible for metropolitan planning of the city and managing housing societies across the district has failed to force private housing societies to develop their own graveyards. Under the law, every private housing society has to allocate space for graveyard, school, college, mosque, park and roads and it has to be transferred in the name of the state.

Former PML-N MNA Malik Shakil Awan said that the ruling party has failed to develop graveyards. “We do not expect good from them as they are snatching bread from the people. How can they provide facilities?” he said.

The PML-N government in its tenure developed the Rakh Dhamial graveyard but work on it was stopped by the present government just to get political revenge from PML-N.

Former PTI MPA Arif Abbasi said that development of graveyards was the government’s priority. When contacted, Rawalpindi Metropolitan Corporation (RMC) Chief officer Ali Abbas Bukhari said Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat directed to speed up work to develop Rakh Dhamial graveyard and make it functional as soon as possible.

He said that RMC purchased two funeral buses so families could transport deceased persons to the graveyard. “We are providing free of cost service to citizens in the garrison city for use of funeral buses. We will purchase two more buses soon,” he said, adding there is an acute shortage of graveyards in the city making burial of the dead a great problem for the bereaved families.

30,30,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Pakistan: Monsoon Floods - Information Bulletin (15 August 2020) - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-monsoon-floods-information-bulletin-15-august-2020,"This bulletin is being issued for information only and reflects the current situation and details available at this time. The Pakistan Red Cross Society (PRCS), with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is assessing the evolution of the current monsoon rainfalls and its impacts during the next few days.

The situation

Heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan from 6 – 7 August 2020 with intermissions. This Monsoon rains created floods situation in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu. However, Tehsil Johi of District Dadu is the area which is greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods not only damaged the houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh already declared 80 villages of District Dadu as “Calamity Affected Areas’’. The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad and Jhal Magsi.

PRCS is already working together with the government, Movement partners and other organizations for COVID19 Response. The changing Scenario of i.e. floods/flash floods may increase the risks of COVID-19 spread in the affected communities. It has been reported that due to floods, many communities are forced to live together in small camps. The initial reports suggested that District Dadu of Sindh and District Jhal Magsi, Sibi, Harnai, Naseeabad and Kachi of Baluchistan are the worst-hit areas. However, administration is still in process of damage and need assessment as most of the communication channels are also broken in some affected areas. The floods also destroyed standing crops and greatly affected the livelihood of inhabitants.

According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Situation Report No.13 as of 13 August 2020, heavy monsoon rainfall has caused flooding and damages in Baluchistan and Sindh provinces over the last few days. The report indicates that as of date 82 people have lost their lives and 28 injuries, while 873 houses are fully damaged while 186 partially damaged.

In Baluchistan, 13 people have died in floods in recent days, with many more reportedly missing. Over 861 homes are fully damaged and 46 partially damaged. Flooding struck in the districts of Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi, Lasbela, Gwadar, Pasni, Kachi and Dera Bugti from 7 August 2020. Severe flooding occurred in the west of the province from 8 August after flood water from Baluchistan made its way downstream along the Nai Gaj river.

Meanwhile in Sindh Province, heavy rainfall from 6 August caused flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sakrand, Tando Jam, Dadu and Thatta. The floods caused 31 death. Hundreds of people were rescued by military personnel. Formal requests by district government through Deputy Commissioners of respective districts including situation of damages possibly with numbers/figures and required support in terms of food and non-food on immediate basis is expected.

The government is responding the situation and Pakistan army is carrying the Search & Rescue and evacuation operation. Some of the steps taken by government are as follows.

• 299 persons evacuated using 10 boats in district Dadu district by Armed Forces.

• PDMA Baluchistan Emergency Operational Center and DDMAs control rooms are functional and on high alert.

• Damage assessment by district government in Baluchistan is being conducted.

• Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) is providing relief items to Dadu District Administration including 1,000 boats with motors, 1,000 units of tents, 1,000 sets of kitchen sets, 1,000 units of mosquito nets, 1,000 units of jerry cans and 1,000 units of water coolers.

• Government of Sindh declared 80 ‘Dehs’ (villages) of Tehsil Johi, Dadu district as “Calamity Affected Areas”.

• Work on cleaning of 552 big and small ‘nullahs’ (gravity feed water system) in Karachi started by NDMA.

• Hospitals have been put on alert by the health department in Karachi.","Sat, 15 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1531305-IBPKmf150820.png?itok=y-K9mHjO,"['situation', 'dadu', 'monsoon', 'pakistan', '2020', 'units', 'bulletin', 'karachi', '15', 'floods', 'baluchistan', '1000', 'district', 'information', 'sindh', 'affected']", ,flood
31,31,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Pakistan floods: 1.4 million children at risk of homelessness and disease - Pakistan - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/pakistan/pakistan-floods-14-million-children-risk-homelessness-and-disease,"As many as 1.4 million children[i] face homelessness and disease following some of the worst ever floods in Pakistan, warns Save the Children.

In scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods that swept parts of the country in 2010, children are living outdoors, schools have been destroyed or damaged and agricultural crops have been lost. In many rural districts, people have only five days’ worth of food stock left.

There are concerns for the spread of COVID-19 and water-borne diseases like malaria and dengue, as a large-scale humanitarian operation gathers pace across Sindh province in Pakistan’s south-east.

Khuram Gondal, Save the Children’s Country Director in Pakistan, said:

“During the current monsoon, Sindh province has experienced some of the heaviest rainfall for nearly 90 years and more heavy rains are expected.

“More than 4 million people have been impacted by the monsoon floods and that’s equivalent to the population of a city the size of Rome.

“Make no mistake, this is an under-reported humanitarian catastrophe deserving of more attention, which would stretch the resources of the most powerful and richest nations on the planet.”

One of the major impacts of the floods is on crops and livestock. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmlands have been damaged, leading to fears for the supply of food.

“We are hearing that in many flood-affected communities only about three per cent of households have received food assistance, with food stocks running out in five to nine days’ time, depending on whether people live in rural or urban areas,” warned Mr Gondal.

There are worries for the disruption of children’s education, too.

“A thorough assessment of the full flood damage to schools is urgently required, but in one district of Sindh our teams found damage to scores of schools, with some destroyed completely.

“As a result, we expect long-term disruption to the education of boys and girls. We are also concerned that the damage to schools may aggravate the high school drop-out ratio of children, especially girls.

“Partially damaged schools are not safe or ready to accommodate students returning after several months of learning gaps due to COVID-19, therefore an urgent rehabilitation and reconstruction approach is needed,” said Mr Gondal.

The intense rains and floods that have battered Pakistan’s Sindh province raise the alarm for climate change, warns Save the Children.

“We know that extreme and erratic weather events pose a growing threat to children’s ability to thrive. It’s therefore never been more important for climate vulnerable communities to be supported to cope with and adapt to climate change, as well as build their resilience to hazards like floods,” added Mr Gondal.

There are fears that today’s floods could eclipse the floods from a decade ago, especially if the monsoon rains continue as predicted. But during the 2010 floods in Pakistan, international media attention led to a huge humanitarian relief effort.

“The Pakistani authorities are working very hard to support their people, but they need urgent support from the international community,” said Mr Gondal.

In response to the floods, Save the Children has mobilised humanitarian aid workers and supplies to:

Provide 400 households with emergency tents

Provide 700 of the most vulnerable households with emergency food rations

Pump water out of main roads to ensure access to school buildings and basic health units

32,32,FL-2020-000185-PAK,"How to detect, resist and counter the flood of fake news - Science News Magazine",https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fake-news-misinformation-covid-vaccines-conspiracy,"From lies about election fraud to QAnon conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine falsehoods, misinformation is racing through our democracy. And it is dangerous.

Awash in bad information, people have swallowed hydroxychloroquine hoping the drug will protect them against COVID-19 — even with no evidence that it helps (SN Online: 8/2/20). Others refuse to wear masks, contrary to the best public health advice available. In January, protestors disrupted a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles, blocking life-saving shots for hundreds of people. “COVID has opened everyone’s eyes to the dangers of health misinformation,” says cognitive scientist Briony Swire-Thompson of Northeastern University in Boston.

The pandemic has made clear that bad information can kill. And scientists are struggling to stem the tide of misinformation that threatens to drown society. The sheer volume of fake news, flooding across social media with little fact-checking to dam it, is taking an enormous toll on trust in basic institutions. In a December poll of 1,115 U.S. adults, by NPR and the research firm Ipsos, 83 percent said they were concerned about the spread of false information. Yet fewer than half were able to identify as false a QAnon conspiracy theory about pedophilic Satan worshippers trying to control politics and the media.

Scientists have been learning more about why and how people fall for bad information — and what we can do about it. Certain characteristics of social media posts help misinformation spread, new findings show. Other research suggests bad claims can be counteracted by giving accurate information to consumers at just the right time, or by subtly but effectively nudging people to pay attention to the accuracy of what they’re looking at. Such techniques involve small behavior changes that could add up to a significant bulwark against the onslaught of fake news.

Wow factor

Misinformation is tough to fight, in part because it spreads for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s bad actors churning out fake-news content in a quest for internet clicks and advertising revenue, as with “troll farms” in Macedonia that generated hoax political stories during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other times, the recipients of misinformation are driving its spread.

Some people unwittingly share misinformation on social media and elsewhere simply because they find it surprising or interesting. Another factor is the method through which the misinformation is presented — whether through text, audio or video. Of these, video can be seen as the most credible, according to research by S. Shyam Sundar, an expert on the psychology of messaging at Penn State. He and colleagues decided to study this after a series of murders in India started in 2017 as people circulated via WhatsApp a video purported to be of child abduction. (It was, in reality, a distorted clip of a public awareness campaign video from Pakistan.)

Sundar recently showed 180 participants in India audio, text and video versions of three fake-news stories as WhatsApp messages, with research funding from WhatsApp. The video stories were assessed as the most credible and most likely to be shared by respondents with lower levels of knowledge on the topic of the story. “Seeing is believing,” Sundar says.

Video sells WhatsApp users looked at three versions of a story that falsely claimed that rice was being made out of plastic — in (left to right) text, audio or a video showing a man feeding plastic sheets into a machine. S.S. Sundar, M.D. Molina and E. Cho Participants tended to rate the video version as more credible than the audio or text versions. The effect diminished for users who were highly involved with the topic of the false story, suggesting that video is a particularly compelling medium for those who may not be knowledgeable on the topic at hand. Perceived credibility of a message based on format and issue involvement T. Tibbitts T. Tibbitts Source: S.S. Sundar and E. Cho/Penn State and M. Molina/Michigan State Univ.

The findings, in press at the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, suggest several ways to fight fake news, he says. For instance, social media companies could prioritize responding to user complaints when the misinformation being spread includes video, above those that are text-only. And media-literacy efforts might focus on educating people that videos can be highly deceptive. “People should know they are more gullible to misinformation when they see something in video form,” Sundar says. That’s especially important with the rise of deepfake technologies that feature false but visually convincing videos (SN: 9/15/18, p. 12).

One of the most insidious problems with fake news is how easily it lodges itself in our brains and how hard it is to dislodge once it’s there. We’re constantly deluged with information, and our minds use cognitive shortcuts to figure out what to retain and what to let go, says Sara Yeo, a science-communication expert at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “Sometimes that information is aligned with the values that we hold, which makes us more likely to accept it,” she says. That means people continually accept information that aligns with what they already believe, further insulating them in self-reinforcing bubbles.

Compounding the problem is that people can process the facts of a message properly while misunderstanding its gist because of the influence of their emotions and values, psychologist Valerie Reyna of Cornell University wrote in 2020 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Thanks to new insights like these, psychologists and cognitive scientists are developing tools people can use to battle misinformation before it arrives — or that prompts them to think more deeply about the information they are consuming.

One such approach is to “prebunk” beforehand rather than debunk after the fact. In 2017, Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and colleagues found that presenting information about a petition that denied the reality of climate science following true information about climate change canceled any benefit of receiving the true information. Simply mentioning the misinformation undermined people’s understanding of what was true.

That got van der Linden thinking: Would giving people other relevant information before giving them the misinformation be helpful? In the climate change example, this meant telling people ahead of time that “Charles Darwin” and “members of the Spice Girls” were among the false signatories to the petition. This advance knowledge helped people resist the bad information they were then exposed to and retain the message of the scientific consensus on climate change.

Here’s a very 2021 metaphor: Think of misinformation as a virus, and prebunking as a weakened dose of that virus. Prebunking becomes a vaccine that allows people to build up antibodies to bad information. To broaden this beyond climate change, and to give people tools to recognize and battle misinformation more broadly, van der Linden and colleagues came up with a game, Bad News, to test the effectiveness of prebunking (see Page 36). The results were so promising that the team developed a COVID-19 version of the game, called GO VIRAL! Early results suggest that playing it helps people better recognize pandemic-related misinformation.

Take a breath

Sometimes it doesn’t take very much of an intervention to make a difference. Sometimes it’s just a matter of getting people to stop and think for a moment about what they’re doing, says Gordon Pennycook, a social psychologist at the University of Regina in Canada.

In one 2019 study, Pennycook and David Rand, a cognitive scientist now at MIT, tested real news headlines and partisan fake headlines, such as “Pennsylvania federal court grants legal authority to REMOVE TRUMP after Russian meddling,” with nearly 3,500 participants. The researchers also tested participants’ analytical reasoning skills. People who scored higher on the analytical tests were less likely to identify fake news headlines as accurate, no matter their political affiliation. In other words, lazy thinking rather than political bias may drive people’s susceptibility to fake news, Pennycook and Rand reported in Cognition.

When it comes to COVID-19, however, political polarization does spill over into people’s behavior. In a working paper first posted online April 14, 2020, at PsyArXiv.org, Pennycook and colleagues describe findings that political polarization, especially in the United States with its contrasting media ecosystems, can overwhelm people’s reasoning skills when it comes to taking protective actions, such as wearing masks.

Inattention plays a major role in the spread of misinformation, Pennycook argues. Fortunately, that suggests some simple ways to intervene, to “nudge” the concept of accuracy into people’s minds, helping them resist misinformation. “It’s basically critical thinking training, but in a very light form,” he says. “We have to stop shutting off our brains so much.”

Push in the right direction Nudging Twitter users to think about the accuracy of a nonpolitical headline resulted in users temporarily sharing more information from more trustworthy media outlets (blue dots toward the right) and less from less trustworthy outlets (blue dots toward the left). Dot size is proportional to the number of tweets that link to that website prior to the accuracy nudge. Effect of an accuracy nudge on news sharing T. Tibbitts Source: G. Pennycook et al/Nature 2021

With nearly 5,400 people who previously tweeted links to articles from two sites known for posting misinformation — Breitbart and InfoWars — Pennycook, Rand and colleagues used innocuous-sounding Twitter accounts to send direct messages with a seemingly random question about the accuracy of a nonpolitical news headline. Then the scientists tracked how often the people shared links from sites of high-quality information versus those known for low-quality information, as rated by professional fact-checkers, for the next 24 hours.

On average, people shared higher-quality information after the intervention than before. It’s a simple nudge with simple results, Pennycook acknowledges — but the work, reported online March 17 in Nature, suggests that very basic reminders about accuracy can have a subtle but noticeable effect.

For debunking, timing can be everything. Tagging headlines as “true” or “false” after presenting them helped people remember whether the information was accurate a week later, compared with tagging before or at the moment the information was presented, Nadia Brashier, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard University, reported with Pennycook, Rand and political scientist Adam Berinsky of MIT in February in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

How to debunk Debunking bad information is challenging, especially if you’re fighting with a cranky family member on Facebook. Here are some tips from misinformation researchers: Arm yourself with media-literacy skills, at sites such as the News Literacy Project (newslit.org), to better understand how to spot hoax videos and stories.

Don’t stigmatize people for holding inaccurate beliefs. Show empathy and respect, or you’re more likely to alienate your audience than successfully share accurate information.

Translate complicated but true ideas into simple messages that are easy to grasp. Videos, graphics and other visual aids can help.

When possible, once you provide a factual alternative to the misinformation, explain the underlying fallacies (such as cherry-picking information, a common tactic of climate change deniers).

Prebunking still has value, they note. But providing a quick and simple fact-check after someone reads a headline can be helpful, particularly on social media platforms where people often mindlessly scroll through posts.

Social media companies have taken some steps to fight misinformation spread on their platforms, with mixed results. Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking program, Birdwatch, launched as a beta test in January, has already run into trouble with the poor quality of user-flagging. And Facebook has struggled to effectively combat misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines on its platform.

Misinformation researchers have recently called for social media companies to share more of their data so that scientists can better track the spread of online misinformation. Such research can be done without violating users’ privacy, for instance by aggregating information or asking users to actively consent to research studies.

Much of the work to date on misinformation’s spread has used public data from Twitter because it is easily searchable, but platforms such as Facebook have many more users and much more data. Some social media companies do collaborate with outside researchers to study the dynamics of fake news, but much more remains to be done to inoculate the public against false information.

At least 90 lives have been lost, over 1,000 homes have been destroyed and thousands more have been displaced.

The flood situation in Pakistan is a complete disaster. In the north-west heavy downpour has overwhelmed the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

A total of 23 lives have been lost in this province alone. In the north-east, the province of Punjab is no better, eight lives have been lost to incessant rains and flooding.In the south-west Balochistan too is reeling with flood and at least 15 people have died.

Right next to Balochistan is Sindh. The worst affected province in Pakistan, where 31 people have died here due to the annual monsoon deluge.

Karachi is the capital of Sindh province and Pakistan's financial hub. Karachi is now a submerged city. The residents say they are losing everything to rainwater.

At least eight people have died in Karachi alone. Mostly due to electrocution and drowning. Now, sewage water is flooding homes in low-lying areas and disaster relief is yet to arrive.

Shama Parveen, impacted by flooding said: ""When the water reached neck high, we lifted our kids on shoulders and took refuge at the neighbour's house. We spent the whole night sitting at the roof, only we know how we had spent the night. My daughter-in-law's furniture is sinking at home, everything we had is sinking.""

Every year --- many major cities around the world have to deal with floods. But that's mostly due to poor planning.

A recent study examines the link between power structures and vulnerability to flash floods in Reshun. The vulnerable location of Reshun, a village in Upper Chitral District in the northwest of Pakistan, leaves it exposed to natural disaster hazards. It sits along the seismically active Hindu Kush mountain range—and at the base of a drainage stream for the massive Chitral glaciers. While the risk of glacial flooding is regional, the vulnerabilities among Reshun's residents are far from equal, according to study authors Ishaq Khan and Inam Ullah Leghari, a graduate student and professor at the Department of Anthropology at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.

Members of Chitral's lowest serf class, cheermuzh, have long lived in stark marginalization. Now as glacial floods in Reshun grow more frequent due to climate change, low-income residents with little access to political power are left increasingly without options. The floods disproportionately devastate cheermuzh communities, and aid has been insufficient. As Hamna Tariq, a junior fellow in the South Asia program at the Stimson Center, told GlacierHub, ""They tough it out, until they cannot.""

Outside the polar regions, Pakistan is one of the world's major centers of glacial ice. Over 7,000 known glaciers lie within its borders and more than 500 of these glaciers are in the remote Chitral valley. The entire area is at risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), which are outpours of meltwater caused by glacial dam failure. However, exposure to GLOFs is highly varied and determined by one's social status.

Chitral society is divided into four classes—the highest of which is ""adamzade"" (proper human), and the lowest of which is a serf class, cheermuzh, often referred to as ""beizzat"" (without respect) and ""ghalamus"" (slave). True to a serfdom-like system, upper classes grant land to cheermuzh to live and farm on, which they retain by providing services to their landlords. This hierarchy is not just functional, but reflective of social attitudes toward low-status residents; a Chitral resident of lordly descent opposed the construction of a water pipe in his village on the grounds that he could not drink the same water as cheermuzh.

Like the village's social organization, vulnerabilities to glacial lake outburst floods are unequal and hierarchized. Reshun's cheermuzh communities reside by a stream flowing between two mountains. Flash floods linked to heavy rains and GLOFs annually devastate these communities.

The impacts of the 2013 and 2015 flash floods, in particular, illustrate their disproportionate effect on low-status residents. Khan and Leghari found that the 2013 Reshun flood's damage was concentrated in three mostly cheermuzh hamlets —Panandeh, Batikandeh, and Golguch. Only families in these hamlets lost their homes or livestock, an important food source and financial asset. There were 23 fully damaged and 16 partially damaged houses. The flooding also destroyed the hamlets' drinking water supply line and the bridges connecting them to evacuation routes.

Though these low-status residents were stranded, help didn't come for days. Aid workers were even instructed not to go into the hamlets as a precautionary measure. One resident, Ashraf Khan, told the study authors how he and his family were forced to spend one week outside, unaided and unsheltered, after their home was destroyed.

Two years later, the flash floods were even worse. Nearly 100 houses were fully damaged, 86 of which belonged to low-status households, including Khan's. His family was one of 30 low-status households whose homes were destroyed twice, in both 2013 and 2015. As mentioned in the study, all of these households had rebuilt their homes in the same place, as they had nowhere else to live. On the other hand, five households whose homes were destroyed in the 2013 flood and who could afford to move elsewhere were unaffected in 2015.

The 2015 flood also completely washed away the road connecting the three hamlets to the main road. ""Flash flood isolated us from the rest of the world,"" said another resident, Sher Muhammad, who was quoted in the study. Now, not only were cheermuzh socially marginalized, but they were also physically isolated.

Muhammad is also involved in Golguch's anti-grazing movement. As glacial lake outburst floods have become more frequent, goat grazing near Reshun's nearby glaciers has become a controversial issue. According to anti-grazers, grazing intensifies flooding by breaking the soil surrounding the nearby glaciers. Khan, the graduate student who co-authored the article, wrote to GlacierHub that grazing is ""mostly supported by lordly families,"" who are not at the highest risk of flooding, while opponents of grazing are mostly from low-status backgrounds. This divide is indicative of the class-based vulnerabilities to GLOFs and the tensions that have risen as a result.

Without any prospect that GLOFs will subside in a warming climate, Reshun's cheermuzh residents are left without many options. Writing to GlacierHub, Hamna Tariq highlighted the need for government aid: ""Granted these regions are nestled between dangerous landscapes, more can still be done like providing better warning systems, immediate flood relief aid, temporary housing, and employment opportunities.""

The article's authors, Khan and Muhammad, emphasize the importance of addressing power structures in addition to the floods. They write that ""the effectiveness of mitigation and relief programs for such communities can only be achieved if the political structure of the past and its perpetual effect could be understood.""

As the study illustrates, Reshun residents like Ashraf Khan and Sher Muhammad face the severe dangers of glacial flooding due to no fault of their own, but as a result of their socioeconomic marginalization. The paper's conclusions affirm the need not only to address GLOF-related impacts, but also the class inequities that create these unequal vulnerabilities. Failing to address this two-fold crisis is to fail these residents and all others at the frontlines of climate change.

Another round of continuous heavy rains started in most part of the country on the week of 20 August 2020 until 3 September 2020 intermittently. The second round of torrential rains caused urban flooding in the Sindh province and flash flooding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). New areas have been affected by the urban flooding including the districts of Malir, Karachi Central, Karachi West, Karachi East and Korangi (Sindh), and District Shangla, Swat and Charsadda in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This Operation Update is issued to inform stakeholders of revisions made to the DREF Operation and second allocation of the budget of CHF 339,183 based on current immediate humanitarian needs and priorities identified from government and PRCS rapid needs assessments that are still ongoing in the areas affected by the Monsoon Flood. This comprises the following changes:

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH): inclusion of water and hygiene promotion interventions, distribution of hygiene kits and household water filters to additional targeting to 14,350 people (2,050 HH) in KP and Sindh provinces.

Replenishment of 1,500 hygiene kits and 2,050 household water filters.

Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA): additional target to a total of 28,000 people; 17,500 people in five most affected districts in Sindh Province and 10,500 in KP for cash assistance for one-month period.

PRCS aims to extend the DREF timeline to six months.

A. SITUATION ANALYSIS

Description of the disaster

First spell of heavy rainfall started in Sindh and Baluchistan Province from 6 August and continued until 7 August 2020 with intermissions. Continuous rain over a period of 24 hours caused massive flooding in Karachi, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad and Dadu districts of Sindh province, with Tehsil Johi in Dadu district as the area greatly affected by flash floods. It has been reported that floods are not only damaging infrastructures and houses but also destroyed crops in Johi Tehsil. Government of Sindh has declared 80 villages in Dadu district as “Calamity Affected Areas’’.

The floods also hit different parts of Baluchistan including Kacchi, Sibbi, Harnai, Naseerabad, Jafferabad and Jhal Magsi districts where Jhal Magsi and Jafferabad districts as the most affected areas according to the rapid need assessment report. On 18 August 2020, the Government of Baluchistan also declared emergency in Jhal Magsi district. Besides the recent floods, COVID-19 outbreak is also a threat to the affected population. However, the number of positive cases reported so far in the targeted district are on lower side. As of 7 September 2020, Dadu district reported 1,184 positive cases, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad (Baluchistan) 328 and 71 reported positive COVID-19 cases respectively.

Another heavy spell of Monsoon rain started in most part of the country on 20 August 2020 and continued until 3 September 2020 with intervals. This resulted in urban flooding in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, while flash floods reported in district Shangla, Swat and flooding in Charsadda, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Karachi experienced heaviest rains in almost a century, killing at least 41 people in the city. Thousands of people were trapped due to waterlogging in low-lying slums. In some part of the city people were without electricity for days as urban flooding badly affected infrastructure. The second spell of flooding has displaced hundreds of thousands of people. Despite the best efforts of the government, the living conditions of the displaced are appalling, with very limited access to safe water and food and with limited shelter. In the meantime, they have no safe water or livelihoods.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1538276-MDRPK019du1.png?itok=ikFPghHy,"['n', 'dref', 'monsoon', 'mdrpk019', 'pakistan', '2020', 'water', 'operation', 'report', 'province', 'flooding', 'updates', 'karachi', 'floods', 'district', 'sindh', 'affected', 'reported']", ,none

2.5 million people have been affected by floods which devasted Sindh Province in late August.

71,500 people received in-kind food assistance during WFP’s first phase of the response between September and early October.

117,000 people will receive cash assistance under WFP’s second phase of the response. Among them, 26,658 people have already been reached.

Highlights

• WFP initiated a second phase of relief assistance in November 2020 to meet persistent humanitarian needs in Sindh’s flood affected districts. Cash transfers under this second phase are expected to be completed by early January.

• Following the relief phase, WFP plans to focus on recovery efforts in 2021 together with its government and development partners, to rebuild livelihoods and rehabilitate assets that can support sustainable food security.

WFP Funding Requirements

• WFP’s ongoing relief assistance is fully funded.

• WFP is currently seeking contributions to support recovery activities planned in 2021.

Situation Update

• The floods have destroyed this year’s main crops, in particular cotton, wheat and chili. This has particularly affected women who often work as casual labourers to pick chili and cotton.

• Although flood water has drained away in most areas, much of the agricultural land remains uncultivable, thus preventing farmers from planting for the next season.

• The loss of infrastructure, crops and livelihoods has exacerbated the province’s already precarious food security and nutrition situation.

WFP Response

• On 10 November, WFP started distributing unconditional cash assistance to vulnerable floodaffected households who had not yet received in-kind food assistance from WFP in September. Distributions are being carried out in the three most affected districts: Umerkot, Sanghar and Mirpurkhas.

• Each targeted household is receiving a multipurpose cash transfer of PKR 15,000 (approximately USD 90), distributed in two tranches.

• Sensitization sessions on nutrition and hygiene practices are also being carried out at distribution points and through village development committees, with a focus on pregnant and lactating women, infants and young children. Sensitization sessions also cover precautionary measures against the spread of COVID19 and dengue virus.

• As of 15 December, WFP and its partners, Agency for Technical Cooperation and Development (ACTED) and Secours Islamique France (SIF) have distributed cash assistance to 26,658 people.

• WFP plans to distribute assistance to another 90,342 people by early January 2021.

• Following the completion of this relief cash assistance in January 2021, WFP is looking to support the Sindh Government’s recovery efforts. Working with Government and development partners, WFP is in the process of designing livelihoods recovery programmes, including cash-for-asset and disaster risk reduction activities, to reduce the impacts of future floods and droughts.","Mon, 21 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1549279-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%235%20%2816%20Dec%202020%29.png?itok=93hsgBQs,"['development', 'situation', 'food', 'response', 'relief', 'pakistan', '2020', 'recovery', 'assistance', 'cash', 'report', 'wfp', 'flood', 'wfps', '16', 'sindh', 'phase', 'affected']", ,flood

By Henrike Brecht and Ahsan Tehsin

Mehar Khan, 54, had poured his life’s savings into building a modest home for his family in Naya Nazimabad, a housing society in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi. Karachi was particularly hard hit by torrential rains in August which caused around $1 billion in national economic damage and loss. Streets across the city turned into rivers and washed away many houses. Mehar’s family was one among thousands stranded in inundated parts of the city for days.

Pakistan’s financial and economic center, Karachi with its 16 million inhabitants is home to the country's largest corporations and main ports. Its economy has grown steadily for decades - last year its GDP was nearly $164 billion. The city has also made impressive progress in reducing poverty, which fell from 23 percent in 2005 to 9 percent in 2015.

Now, Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success? It doesn’t have to. Moving forward, the city can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction:

Karachi is at a crossroads. Will flooded businesses and interrupted connectivity become the new normal and hamper its economic success?

First, the sewage network needs an urgent overhaul. Karachi can reap large benefits from the development and implementation of a comprehensive Drainage and Stormwater Master Plan for the entire city. The World Bank is helping large cities implement drainage solutions for the 21st century and adapt to climate change, for example, in Yangon, Myanmar or Manila, Philippines.

Second, comprehensive solutions for solid waste management are important. Of the 12,000 tons of municipal solid waste generated each day in Karachi, 60 percent does not reach a dumpsite, and trash accumulates in drainage pipes. Across the globe, cities are employing new approaches to solid waste management, focusing on reduction and recycling. Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $4.7 billion to more than 340 solid waste management programs, for instance, in Indonesia or China.

Third, moving towards sponge city concept to absorb rainwater, prioritizing green infrastructure and permeable surfaces will go a long way to counter floods and heat. Instead of carrying the water away, these sponge cities treat it as a resource that is filtered by the soil and then stored. This ensures the economic and sustainable use of the valuable natural resource that fresh water constitutes. It also helps the city cool down through evaporation. This would involve stopping encroachment into urban wetlands and increasing water infiltration through greening, which would reduce the need for costly storm water drainage systems in the city. China’s Sponge Cities Initiative provides $12 billion to more than 30 of its cities, including Shanghai and Wuhan, with the aim of re-using 70 percent of rainwater in 80 percent of the urban areas which are part of the program.

Karachi can make climate resilience and disaster risk management central to its development by taking important steps in the right direction.

Comprehensive policy changes would be as equally important as targeted investments to reduce flooding in Karachi. Responsibilities between agencies at national, provincial and local levels need to be clearly defined. Coordination among the different jurisdictions to develop entire-city approaches need to replace administrative fragmentation. Risk-sensitive land-use plans and their enforcement must ensure that new development takes place away from the most at-risk zones. New infrastructure and risk reduction strategies cannot be developed separately. These measures need to converge to help reduce the city’s vulnerability in the long-term, for example, through building code development and enforcement. Strengthening Karachi’s emergency management response systems through drills and equipment will also reduce the impacts of disasters.

Challenging the status quo will not be easy. For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

But changing course will be cost-effective in the long-term. Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Plan 2012–22 ranks Karachi as the country’s most vulnerable district. Karachi is not only prone to floods but also to earthquakes, cyclones and more recently, heatwaves. Pakistan is also the fifth most affected country by climate change. If these vulnerabilities are not addressed, they will severely impact people’s livelihoods and Karachi’s economic competitiveness.

For Karachi to move forward, its citizens and civil society need to be empowered. Increased financial transparency and reform-minded officials will need to play a major role.

The good news is that Karachi can benefit from existing developments and build on initial achievements. Pakistan shifted to an ex-ante disaster risk management approach after the 2005 earthquake. A National Flood Protection Plan, Pakistan’s investments in nature-based solutions and reforestation programs along with the Karachi Transformative Strategy pave the way. The World Bank continues to strengthen Karachi’s efforts to become more resilient. It committed $652 million in 2019 to reinforce the city’s infrastructure and institutions with a focus on urban management, public transport, safe water, and sanitation.

Karachi also benefits from the Sindh Resilience Project, which invests in flood protection works and integrates disaster risk reduction in planning processes. The Karachi Neighborhood Improvement Project and the Hydromet and Climate Services Project also support climate sensitive and sustainable solutions.

The World Bank stands ready to assist Karachi in moving forward to become a world-class inclusive, sustainable and more livable city.","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",,"['largest', 'city', 'building', 'management', 'climate', 'pakistan', 'need', 'economic', 'water', 'karachi', 'floods', 'disaster', 'resilience', 'world', 'risk']", ,flood

(Photo: Reuters)

Pakistan has been reeling under floods for the past three months, leading to the loss of hundreds of lives. However, leave alone its neighbours or the rest of the world, even people in Pakistan are hardly talking about it.

The first indications of the worsening flood situation were noticed when a recently established UK-based NGO called Muslim Aid started collecting funds for Pakistanis.

Latest satellite images from Sentinel were accessed by India Today OSINT team and compared with three-month-old images to understand the extent of flood damage in Pakistan.

These are false colour images taken using a combination of infrared and visible light that clearly distinguishes between land, which appears bright green, and water that appears black.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan has been providing situation reports that have been ignored by most government ministries. The latest NDMA report indicates 400 deaths and damages to over 2 lakh houses.

While damage to infrastructure is maximum in Sindh province, the highest deaths have been reported from Sindh and Punjab. More than 6 lakh acres of crops have suffered damage in Mirpur Khas and Dadu districts alone. The next few days are crucial as yet another spate of rains is expected by NDMA.

(Photo: India Today)

The satellite images, when compared to previous years’ data, indicate that no action has been taken by Pakistan to either resettle victims or alleviate threats since the deadly 2010 floods.

The administration has made no effort to train the rivers properly. River banks haven’t been lined and bridges across the Indus are under danger of getting washed away. Road approaches stall water overflowing the riverside, thus, endangering the complete bridge infrastructure. The Dadu Moro Bridge is a classic example of this type of possible future damage that can be assessed from satellite imagery.

(Photo: India Today)

The Indus River is clearly not trained at the bridge site with either retainer walls or embankments, thus, overflowing the divergent guide banks. The next large gush of flood waters will certainly damage this bridge’s western side severely.

Large areas in Jacobabad, including parts of Shahbaz Air Base, are also under water. Shahbaz is one of the most important air bases of Pakistan Air Force. It has fighter and transporter jets along with a huge ammunition depot. In the last decade, Pakistan suffered severe floods in 2007 and 2010 when damage to property was almost $40-$50 billion.

(Photo: India Today)

(PTI Photo)

Cyclone, Weather forecast Highlights: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) Saturday said the Severe Cyclonic Storm “Tauktae” over eastcentral Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 13 kmph during past 6 hours.

It lay centred over eastcentral Arabian Sea near latitude 14.2°N and longitude 72.7°E at 2030 hours IST on Saturday, about 190 km southwest of Panjim-Goa, 550 km south of Mumbai, 780 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) and 910 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It is very likely to intensify into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 12 hours and intensify further. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the morning of 18th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Naliya around 18th May Afternoon / evening.

As it would bring very heavy rainfall in that region, cities like Mumbai would not be affected much, the IMD added.

There will be strong winds and heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 17 over north Konkan, including Mumbai,

the IMD said.

The Maharashtra capital can expect showers from Sunday afternoon, said Shubhani Bhute, senior director (weather) IMD, Mumbai. The storm is currently 250 km south-west of Goa, she added.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of cyclone Tauktae and asked them to take every possible measure to ensure that people are safely evacuated. He also called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, a statement said.","Sun, 16 May 2021 04:02:27 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/05/TVM-1200.jpeg,"['km', 'eastcentral', 'winds', 'mumbai', 'diu', 'imd', 'cyclonic', 'weather', 'thiruvananthapuram', 'storm', 'highlights', 'severe', 'tauktae', 'gujarat', 'cyclone', 'arabian', 'sea']", ,flood
42,42,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Mangoes from Vietnam and Cambodia impacting Chinese local industry - FreshPlaza.com,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9322453/mangoes-from-vietnam-and-cambodia-impacting-chinese-local-industry/,"Recently, a ceremony celebrating the first shipment of Cambodian fresh mango exports to China was held in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is reported that the first shipment of 80 tons of fresh mangoes departed from Phnom Penh Port, and will arrive in China by sea via Ho Chi Minh Port, Vietnam. It is expected that 100,000 tons of Cambodian mangoes will enter the Chinese market this year. Although the volume is not large compared with China's local production, they will still impact the Chinese mango market, as the production of the entire Hainan Province this year is expected to be only about 800,000 tons, and these extra 100,000 tons will directly lead the price of local mangoes to fall.

At the same time, the consumer market in Cambodia is in severe oversupply. The market price is low, but the product quality is high, coupled with the yearly export quota of 500,000 tons, they surely will impress their rivals with strong competitiveness.

China is the world's second-largest mango exporter, with a yearly production of more than 2.4 million tons. They also import fresh mangoes from 10 countries and regions, including India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam, Peru, and most recently Cambodia.

Mango market in 2021

Many regions in southern China are key mango-producing areas, such as Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The production in Guangxi alone this year reached 800,000 tons. In March, when products from Hainan became available, the highest purchase price reached 7 yuan per half a kilo. From May, with products flooding the market, prices fell. Just as prices of mangoes from Hainan started to fall, mangoes from Guangdong became available and were about to flood the market. It is understood that the yearly production in Guangxi this year will also reach 800,000 tons.

Local growers in Guangxi said that due to the uncertainty in the international market, there are much fewer orders for export compared with previous years. The taste of mangoes from Baise, Guangxi is as good as those from Vietnam, and products from Guangxi can leverage their advantages in pricing.

Current status of Chinese mango cultivation

At present, among the varieties grown in China, many are mid-late and late varieties. The variety structure is not varied, making the harvesting period in various regions short and the market window concentrated, leading to high sales pressure. In certain markets, the pressure of competition is high, and the ability to withstand risks is low, therefore influencing the prices.

In recent years, the production in Hainan and Guangdong provinces has also gradually increased. The slight decline in mango prices this year is mainly due to weather and market factors. On the one hand, since March this year, the temperature in southern regions has risen sharply, helping plant and fruit growth, leading to a bumper harvest, resulting in oversupply. On the other hand, the pressure of competition in the industry has increased, and a large number of traders are involved in the business, which has led to the fall in wholesale prices.

Moreover, due to large imports, the price of imported mangoes has also fallen. At present, two-thirds of mangoes on the market are Gaolemi and golden mangoes from Vietnam. Due to cheaper rent and lower labor costs, although Vietnamese mangoes are imported, their prices are still lower than those of Chinese mangoes. The “invasion” of Cambodian mangoes has also brought headaches to Chinese mango traders.

About 36 people are reported to have died after torrential rain triggered flash floods and urban flooding in Pakistan.

An emergency has been imposed at hospitals across Karachi, where paramilitary forces are helping traffic police in rescuing commuters amid traffic jams, flooding of roads and destruction of infrastructure.

“We were stuck in homes this Sunday as people shared videos of motorcycles and even cars being swept away in strong floods. Several people were injured by tiles falling from high buildings,” Mansha Noor, executive secretary of Caritas Pakistan Karachi, told UCA News.

“The frontline volunteers of our disaster management committees (DMCs) continued rescue efforts during heavy rains and helped in saving people and their belongings in low-lying areas.”

Father James Shamaun parish priest of St. Thomas Catholic Church in Wah Cantonment, a military city in Punjab province, shared the devastation in a Facebook Live video recorded on July 25. The priest described visiting a flooded church in Taxila, another city of the Diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi.

“The river is flooded. We pray here every Sunday evening. We cannot reach there in this situation. We shall pray here depending on the weather,” he said. The clip has been viewed more than 3,300 times.

Meanwhile, Caritas is developing a response plan for a flood emergency this year. The charity has inspired DMCs in all six dioceses and the apostolic prefecture, empowering disaster-prone communities to help themselves.

Amjad Gulzar, executive director of Caritas Pakistan, said the floods will worsen livelihood challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic.

“Covid-19 has changed the scenario of country. Rain-related damages have added to the losses of the poor and daily wagers struggling amid the lockdown,"" he said.

“DMCs have been especially instructed to observe social distancing and SOPs [standard operating procedures] in rescue and relief efforts. Our response plan includes food kits, hygiene kits, shelter and non-food items.”

44,44,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Unravelling the urban flood - Pakistan - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1577689,"Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation.

Every year, natural disasters claim around 90,000 lives and affect more than 150 million around the world. Among these, floods pose the most intense threat to lives and livelihoods, bludgeoning communities large and small, and inundating large swathes of land across borders. Between 1998 and 2017, floods affected nearly a third of the global population, or 2 billion people worldwide. Beyond the obvious impact on infrastructure and utilities, flooding is a harbinger of a multitude of long-term effects, including economic losses, loss of means of livelihood, ecological changes, and public health challenges.

Floods are the most damaging natural hazard in Pakistan with 26 major events having ravaged the country since 1950. The 2010 “super flood” alone affected 20 million people, and caused direct and indirect losses worth nearly $10 billion. Since then a major flood event occurred at least once each year, affecting millions more. In the past five years or so, urban flooding has gained a strong foothold in Pakistan, becoming almost synonymous with the monsoon season. It is becoming increasingly evident that current policy, planning, and implementation mechanisms for urban flood management are not effective within the context of climate change.

Emerging Climate Challenges

A growing body of research supported by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has established close linkages between climate change and disaster risk. Whilst climate change cannot be attributed directly to any one major disaster — for example, the urban flooding in Karachi — it does point to an alteration of the global atmosphere. These alterations, caused by human activities such as deforestation, increased use of fossil fuels, and other commercial and industrial practices, coupled with the likelihood of more extreme weather events in the future, are likely to increase the frequency and scale of disasters.

Also read: Early downpour exposes Karachi’s drainage flaws

The Global Climate Risk Index by Germanwatch analyses global extreme weather events and socio-economic impact. The 2019 CRI ranked Pakistan as the 8th most affected country when it comes to extreme weather events. The report went on to add that “countries like….Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The same report placed India at the 14th spot in terms of impact of extreme weather events.

Between 80-90% of all documented natural disasters in the past decades have, on average, been a result of floods, heat waves, droughts, and storms.

Floods, in particular, are increasing in frequency and intensity, and extreme variations in precipitation are expected to contribute to flooding in areas that have historically remained immune.

A study by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (Unescap) evaluated the high risk of floods and droughts during the monsoon season. The report pointed out that over eight million people would be exposed to flood risk in Pakistan this year alone.

High risk areas for floods in South Asia

The South Asian monsoon, characterised by concentrated rainfall between June and September, is the lifeline of the agricultural sector in the region, irrigating as much as 55% of cultivated land. Over the past few years, however, researchers have noticed wide temporal and spatial variations in monsoon rainfall. Erratic monsoon patterns have seen a shift of rainfall not only in geographical terms, but also onset and withdrawal. This has resulted in devastating floods throughout the region, claiming scores of lives.

Last week, at least 40 lives were lost as a result of urban flooding in Karachi. Massive cracks in the city’s administrative and operational infrastructure surfaced with every conceivable flood hazard — from cars being swept away by rainwater to collapsing houses to electrocution and even landsliding — becoming a harsh reality. Whilst this does not undermine incidences of riverine and flash flooding throughout the rest of Pakistan, it does indicate that a new, rapid phenomenon in densely populated areas is taking shape: that of urban flooding.

Urban floods are a consequence of meteorological factors, such as intense precipitation, and human actions, such as land use change, occupation of flood plains, alteration of natural water courses, and inadequate drainage and sanitation infrastructure. As soon as precipitation exceeds the capacity of an urban area’s drainage system which includes sewers, gutters, open channels, natural and manmade pathways to a receiving water body — urban flooding occurs. In the weeks leading up to perhaps what will historically be remembered as Pakistan’s biggest urban flood, it became abundantly clear that existing drainage channels were already operating below capacity. A combination of factors, including informal settlements driven by urbanisation, and poor solid waste management directly contributed to this loss of capacity.

More on this | What causes urban flooding? Hint: It’s not just rain

Stripping away land cover and vegetation in the name of “development” to make way for buildings, roads, and bridges not only alters natural water flow channels; it also greatly diminishes water absorption and storage capacity of the soil. As a result, when precipitation runoff flows rapidly across the surface, in short, intense, high-volume bursts rather than sinking into the soil. Not only does this overload a city’s drainage system, but considerably more rainwater ends up in sewers and directly flows off into water bodies, instead of recharging ground water sources. The obstruction of drainage systems, ditches, and other pathways by solid waste and refuse can block channels, causing the water to back up and spread laterally into commercial and residential areas. Many communities did not know that until they found water coursing through their houses, streets, and commercial buildings. Thus, a confluence of disorganised implementation of urban infrastructure such as bridges and embankments obstructing runoff, reduced drainage channel availability due to backfilling, deposition of sediments and refuse in canals and waterways, and archaic drainage and sanitation infrastructure, contributed to the devastation in Karachi.

Policymaking for urban flood management

A recent study in the United States on flood policy noted severe shortcomings in the ability to project the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. Given high levels of uncertainty, policy-making for flood planning & response may be even more difficult and fraught than it already is. Vulnerability of urban systems increases as population density increases, and the effects are multiplied when flooding damages electrical, transportation, communication and other support systems.

Whilst the direct impact of urban flooding — such as inundation of streets and residences, losses and damages to property and vehicles, and destruction of infrastructure — are easily visible, it is the indirect impact that leaves longer lasting effects. For example, the public health threat as a result of untreated sewage or chemical runoff from industrial areas mixing with water sources; the loss of livelihoods for certain periods of time; and the inability to travel to work. Those on the lower end of the socio-economic scale will have a lower capacity to respond and recover, placing ever greater demands on existing social and community service mechanisms.

Policymakers must understand that urban floods are not discrete, bounded events and the impact is not limited to inundation. The losses in terms of property, productivity, livelihood, and quality of life demand a socioeconomic approach to flood risk management, one that focuses not just on rescue and relief, but also the rehabilitation of communities to the same or a better state that they were in before disaster struck. Future policies should thus address:

— The challenges posed by climate change

— The major economic, environmental, financial, political and social issues likely to impact urban development and urban flood management

— Ancillary payoffs (such as environmental, economic, or social) of pursuing adaptive strategies

Infrastructure management practices for urban flooding

Flooding is the most hazardous consequence of intense precipitation, and even small increases in precipitation can have inordinately large effects on the drainage system. Research based on actual events and simulations indicates that a “20 per cent increase in precipitation in a single event leads to a 365 per cent increase in flood volume and the number of at-risk buildings increases by 120 per cent”.

Drainage and flood control infrastructure is largely designed based on 25-, 50- or 100-year flood frequencies, and historic trends. However, as is becoming increasingly evident, past history may no longer be a reliable guide to future events, especially in the context of urban flooding. Drainage systems, developed and built over decades, are only as good as the weakest connecting link. Decisions made during the scoping and early design stages, when urban sprawl and population were both limited, can have significant impact on outcomes few years down the road. Changes and modifications made at later stages are not always possible or cost effective, which makes both under-sizing and over-sizing of the infrastructure equally problematic: extensive damage in the first case; and excessive expenditures in the second.

Furthermore, focusing on technical and engineering issues in tackling flooding has become somewhat of a national trend, which discounts the influence of social characteristics and circumstances. This bias can actually encourage development in areas where hazard risk may surpass technological solutions. Similarly, efforts to manage urban floods by focusing on the flow and its transit elsewhere, akin to following the “Out of Sight, Out of Mind” approach, don’t solve the problem but merely shift it — usually to low income areas.

Uncontrolled development of informal settlements

In recent years, Pakistan, like many developing nations has witnessed massive in-migration (movement of people within the country). The 2019 Migration Snapshot published by the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) notes that nearly 13% of the Pakistani population comprises of internal migrants. Internal migration in Pakistan is usually undertaken by low skilled workers who move from the rural districts to urban areas due to marriage, family ties, and economic opportunities. A number of socioeconomic factors are at play here, but what is key is the emergence of new settlements in and around cities. These areas, characterized by population highly concentrated in a (relatively) small area runs well ahead of the planning and construction of infrastructure to cope with it.

It would be remiss not to point out that the deleterious effects of degraded environmental conditions have the most (though not exclusive) impact on low income settlements, including katchi abadis or shanties. Built atop slopes, drainage channels, and waterways subject to flash floods, these dwellings are “put together” with substandard materials in areas with poor or overloaded water and waste disposal systems. Residents of these settlements may fill natural drainage channels with dwellings or waste materials, preventing normal rainwater flow and causing the water to spread out into the residential area. Pathways and (unpaved) streets are usually impervious, affording no means for absorption of precipitation, but rather providing a free passage of precipitation and flood water into homes, buildings, and commercial establishments. As these settlements are not planned or subject to land use restrictions or whatever building codes that may or may not exist, the effects of a severe natural disaster can be greatly magnified.

Conclusion

Climate change will impact future city growth, planning and development. By 2030, at least 61% of the world’s population will be living in cities. In developing nations, cities will become home to nearly four billion residents, or a whopping 80 per cent of the global urban population. Consequently, what was once dispersed rural poverty will now be concentrated in urban informal and squatter settlements. It is not really possible to control or totally eliminate floods, and policy planners and practitioners should concentrate instead on enhancing the resilience of the population to flood risks through a combination of engineering techniques coupled with and social, economic and administrative measures. In so doing, they must work within the framework of Integrated Flood Management so as to meet the larger issues of effectiveness, socioeconomic equity, and long-term positive outcomes. This can be achieved, in part by:

— Integrating land and water management;

— Ensuring a participatory community-level approach;

— Adopting integrated hazard management approaches;

— Adopting a combination of economic, legislative, policy-based, and sociological measures to move from traditional “flood control” towards “flood management”;

— Synchronisation with the national development agenda, including measures such as the Ehsaas programme, the Green Pakistan initiative, setting up effective local governments and other poverty alleviation and social uplifting schemes;

— It must also accommodate integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) practices

The aforementioned steps can be proactively implemented in incremental stages with ad hoc tactical adjustments made as events and situations unfold. The uncertainty inherent in climate change projections means that risk-centred approaches and risk-based analysis (including cost-benefit analysis) are no longer as useful or robust as they have been. The past may no longer be a reliable guide to the future when it comes to urban flood management. The combination of climate change, increasing urbanisation, demands for housing and industrial land (often in the floodplain), economic development and rising expectations cannot be discounted in urban flood management. Rather than focusing on any one of these issues, it will be necessary to combine them — and their many stakeholders — into a comprehensive planning process for increasing adaptation and enhancing community resilience.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2020/09/5f505e90e296d.jpg,"['management', 'water', 'precipitation', 'flooding', 'unravelling', 'flood', 'urban', 'floods', 'impact', 'drainage', 'areas']", ,none

Highlights

• On 28 August, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) asked WFP to provide food assistance to flood-affected people in Sindh Province.

• As of 9 September evening, WFP had distributed food to 669 households in Karachi (out of the total 1,780 targeted in Karachi). Distributions to 7,876 households in rural districts will start on 11 September.

• NDMA has warned of potential new flooding across the country, which could further increase the number of people in immediate need of assistance.

WFP Funding Requirements

• US$ 410,320 are needed to replenish food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations for this emergency response.

Situation Update

• The Sindh Government announced a state of emergency on 25 August, with 20 districts declared calamity-affected.

• On 2 September, at the request of the Sindh PDMA, the Sindh UN Provincial Programme Team launched a rapid needs assessment in the nine hardest-hit districts (including four in Karachi and five rural districts). The results were endorsed by the PDMA on 7 September.

• One million people are affected according to Sindh PDMA estimates; 30 percent of whom are estimated to be in need of food assistance based on the findings of the rapid needs assessment.

• In Karachi, water has receded in most parts of the city. However, the informal settlements of Malir District, located in low-lying areas and without sewage infrastructure, remain flooded.

Only 4 percent of households interviewed in Karachi said they had already received food assistance. Most of these households depend on casual labour, and their coping capacities have already been exhausted by COVID-19.

• In the rural areas assessed, only 1 percent of households had received food assistance, and the vast majority reported their food stocks would run out in less than five days. Agricultural livelihoods have been severely affected, with 93 percent of crop lost, 66 percent of irrigation infrastructure reported to be damaged, and most households reporting significant livestock losses or distress sales.","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1535006-Pakistan%20Sindh%20Floods%20External%20Sitrep%20%231%20%2810%20Sep%29.png?itok=GIgAFl8O,"['situation', 'food', 'response', 'pakistan', '2020', 'pdma', 'households', 'assistance', 'need', 'report', 'wfp', 'districts', 'rural', 'karachi', 'flood', 'sindh']", ,flood

raftsman Mohammad Zakir, who lives in a low-lying area of Karachi’s Orangi Town, does not recall the authorities ever cleaning out the storm water drain serving his neighbourhood.

Thorani Goth in West District was flooded during the fourth bout of monsoon rain this season from 6-8 August.

During that – and a previous downpour in late July – water came up 4-5ft (1.2-1.5m) inside Mr Zakir’s home, ruining furniture, electrical equipment and important documents.

It also soaked an order of 250 women’s garments he was due to decorate with sequins and beads – his first job in five months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“I’ll put them out to dry to see if there are water stains on them,” said the informal-sector worker.

If the clothes were ruined, he would have to bear half the cost of 250,000 Pakistani rupees (£1,139), he added.

Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation people “are certainly not exaggerating when they say water comes up chest-high into their homes”.

The city has a network of 550 storm water drains which zigzag through the city and flow out into the Arabian Sea, but many are obstructed by illegal construction, waste and sludge.

Mr Akhtar said the city authorities cleaned out the drains every year before the monsoon, except last year when the provincial government did not provide the funds for the work.

In the mayor’s four-year term, which ends this month, management of Karachi’s services has been hamstrung by disputes between different levels of government.

Meanwhile the city’s infrastructure is struggling to cope with heavy monsoon rains, as seen this year.

Sardar Sarfaraz, Karachi head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said rainfall of as little as 50mm (2 inches) could cause urban flooding in some of Karachi’s low-lying areas, with the most recent downpour easily exceeding that across the city.

Scientists are still figuring out how global warming will affect the Asian monsoon, but in many parts of the world, higher temperatures are fuelling more intense bouts of rainfall.

Mr Sarfaraz noted the trend is for more erratic weather patterns, as predicted by climate scientists.

In Karachi, the August rains killed 22 people, 11 of them by electrocution, after 10 died in July. From 2014 to 2019, the city recorded more than 70 rain-related deaths, with 2018 an exception as it was largely dry.

After the havoc this July – with main roads submerged, sewage spewing from manholes and into homes, and power cuts lasting for hours – Imran Khan, Pakistan’s prime minister, tasked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with sorting out the city’s drains.

The NDMA, helped by the military’s engineering wing, said it had cleaned three major drains in just under a week, clearing 42 choke points and removing more than 31,000 tonnes of sludge.

After touring the city, Sindh information minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah told Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper there were no floods in the city, despite the intensity of this month’s rain, as prevention policies had been effectively implemented.

But Mr Zakir’s experience does not back up that assertion.

Illegal building

Hot sun after the monsoon rain has provided some respite for Mr Zakir’s family and the 13 million city residents, out of a population of more than 17 million, who live in informal settlements that are prone to flooding.

Mr Zakir blamed illegal construction along the drainage channels, adding that “the government needs to come here and bulldoze” the buildings.

“The storm water drains, some as wide as 200ft, have over the years, due to unauthorised construction, narrowed to just 30 feet – so what do you expect?” said Mr Akhtar, the city’s mayor.

The main responsibility lies both with residents who have encroached on land along the drain, and the provincial government for letting it happen, said the outgoing mayor.

The province of Sindh has taken a larger share of control from the city authority but has not provided the budget owed, which a court ruling ordered it to pay, Mr Akhtar said.

A Sindh government spokesman said it did not owe money to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, to which it had transferred 50bn rupees (£227m) in the last three and a half years.

Solid waste dumped into storm water drains exacerbates the flooding. It is estimated that the mega-city generates 13,000 tonnes of garbage daily.

The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board collects 70 per cent of that and takes it to two landfills, but told the Thomson Reuters Foundation it does not know what happens to the rest.

Sewage is also being dumped in storm drains, as little has been invested in rehabilitating the crumbling sewerage system for two decades despite the city’s expansion, officials said.

Longer-term plan?

Zubair Channa, director of the Sindh government-led Solid Waste Emergency and Efficiency Project (SWEEP), funded with $100m (£76.8m) from the World Bank, said encroachment on most of Karachi’s large drains over a long period, coupled with their uneven width, caused disturbances in the flow of water.

Drains feeding into the big water channels are also not well maintained, making the flooding worse, noted the civil engineer.

“What is needed is a comprehensive engineering solution,” he said, rather than “firefighting” each year as the city does now.

In its first year, SWEEP has hired contractors to remove about 10 million cubic ft of sludge from the drains and deposit it in landfill by the end of August, he noted.

With floods causing so much devastation year after year, Mr Akhtar said it was time “to take the firm but unpleasant decision” of pulling down illegal buildings.

Before that is done, people must be provided with an alternative, he added.

“There is enough government land that can be used for both vertical expansion as well as developing satellite towns around Karachi, where these people can be shifted,” he said.

But with Karachi run by three tiers of government dominated by three different political parties, real solutions to its problems are often lost in a war of words.

“We need the judiciary and the army to sit with experts like architects and town planners to resolve the issue,” Mr Akhtar said.

PESHAWAR: At least 16 people, including a woman and two children, were killed and eight others injured due to flash floods caused by torrential rains in northwest Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district, a disaster management official said on Friday.

Eight people died in Upper Kohistan district, six in Swat and two in Shangla district of the province due to the floods on Thursday night, an official of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said, adding that 40 houses were damaged in these areas.

The flood water inundated houses in Shahgram and Teerat area of Swat district from where six deaths and injuries to eight people were reported.

PDMA Director General Pervez Khan and Secretary of relief rushed to the affected areas to oversee rescue activities.

The rescue activities are underway in full swing in the affected areas and people are being shifted to safer places, Khan said.

Chief Minister K P Mehmood Khan, who also hails from Swat, has expressed concern over the loss of life and property.","Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/8/28/w600X390/Pakistan_rains-_AP_.jpg,"['khan', 'swat', 'northwest', 'management', 'flash', 'houses', 'pakistan', 'indian', 'rescue', 'killed', 'express', 'floods', 'official', 'disaster', 'district', '16', 'areas']", ,flood
48,48,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Millions at risk as melting Pakistan glaciers raise flood fears - Aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/6/9/millions-at-risk-as-melting-pakistan-glaciers-raise-flood-fears,"As ice melts, there is risk of large glacial lakes bursting through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream.

Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet (three metres) from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The floodwater broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Reuters news agency by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses, and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37m in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners – the UN Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change – as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told Reuters.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with the aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

Melting glaciers

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the UN Adaptation Fund from 2011 to 2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

‘People will suffer’

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier in a helicopter recently, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier, and there was talk of an [automated] early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system is extremely urgent, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding, and people will suffer.”","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/f710960554f9487aad8f63e38374bcf2_18.jpeg?fit=1000%2C562,"['warning', 'millions', 'ice', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'fears', 'hassanabad', 'walls', 'raise', 'glaciers', 'outburst', 'flood', 'shishper', 'melting', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of Pakistani villages located at the bank of River Sutlej have been submerged after India released water without notifying the authorities in Pakistan, displacing hundreds of people while destroying several houses and standing crops, said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday.

Over 1,200 persons were rescued from the flood-affected villages by a local administration while another 1,613 persons have been shifted to safer places, according to the NDMA.

Rescue teams along with Pakistan army personnel are taking part in the rescue operations, a local administrative official in Lahore told Xinhua, adding that more than 80 relief camps have been set up for flood affectees so far.

He said water level in the river is continuously rising, and the concerned authorities are making all-out efforts to ensure timely evacuation of people from the affected villages.

A spokesperson of the NDMA Mukhtar Ahmed told local media that three of the villages located near the bed of the river went completely underwater due to flooding, and the people from these most-affected villages have already been evacuated to safer places.

Earlier on Monday, the NDMA had warned of a flood-like situation in the areas alongside the river after India released up to 200,000 million cusecs of excessive water in the River Sutlej that flows through Pakistan's eastern Punjab province.

""The flood alert was issued in order to avoid the loss of lives and properties as India did not communicate the release of water to Pakistan,"" Director General of the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Khurram Shahzad said.

According to a water-distribution agreement between the two neighboring countries, India is bound to pre-schedule its spillway openings, but the incumbent Indian government has canceled all the meetings of Indus Water Commission, which was formed to resolve disputes over water sharing with Pakistan.

Pakistani agricultural experts believe that India is trying to destroy an agro-based economy of the country by taking such measures and using water as an instrument of war, trying to convert agricultural land of Pakistan into deserts through inundation and trickling of water.

The development came when relations between Pakistan and India have been strained after the latter decided to revoke the special status of the Indian-controlled Kashmir earlier this month.

In its response, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade ties with India.","Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",,"['displaces', 'hundreds', 'houses', 'local', 'pakistan', 'water', 'villages', 'notification', 'flood', 'xinhua', 'india', 'ndma', 'trying', 'river', 'told', 'releases']", ,flood

On Sunday 26th July-2020 weather system brought heavy rains in Karachi. According to data provided by the MET Office, the highest rainfall was recorded in Gulistan-e-Johar, at 66 millimeters (mm), while 55 mm was registered at Old Airport, 55 mm in Pehlwan Goth, 42 mm in Malir, Saddar 43 millimeters (mm), while 26 mm was registered at Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Faisal Base, 22mm in Nazimabad, 12mm at PAF Masroor Base, 8.8mm at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, 3.1mm in Landhi, and 1.2mm in Surjani Town.

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), city received more than 80 mm rainfall in the third spell of the monsoon and more rain is expected in this season. The heavy to moderate rainfall caused flooding in low lying areas of the city and inundated several key roads, causing problems for the commuters as administration remained helpless and even absent at some locations despite a prior warning from the met officials. Nipa Chowrangi, Gurumandir Chowrangi, Shahrai-e-Faisal, Hassan Square turned into large water pools, as motorcyclists and four-wheelers could be witnessed trapped in water high up to knee-level. According to the initial reports from media and local communities, in many areas there is still stagnant water in streets and houses that overflowed from Nullahs. Those areas included Orangi Town, Khairabad Police Ground area, Ali Garh Market, Disco Morr, Islam Chowk, Bangla Bazar, Neepa Chowrangi, Gulshan-e- Iqbal, and Hyderi in North Nazimabad.

Root causes for the urban flooding in Karachi

In the last fourty years, Karachi city has been facings severe problems due to heavy rains in monsoon season as there are serious issues with the drainage system in Karachi. Despite accepting the brutal reality of the situation, one can not blame any institution but the responsibility lied with the Provincial government, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and District Munciple Corporations (DMCs) and private housing societies to keep clean the drains of Karachi and to drain out all the rainwater from the city.

In the city, as visible to all, width of many rain water drains and Nullah have been reduced, on many construcuton have been done, and most of them are choked with garbage. Information collected through different sources revealed that there are many structures and building have been constructed over the drain of Soldier bazar incuding two banks, gold shops / market, one section of girls high school, Shaheen complex, car parking area of supreme court, district NAB office, KMC market and Aurganzeb market. In Lyari, on Muhammad Shah road, part of Kakri ground, meat market and two masjids are constructed on one of the drain.

The width of the drainage of Manzoor colony on Korangi road has been reduced and near Qayoomabad, Defence Housing Authority (DHA) has constructed bungalows over the same drainage. Drain that starts from Cantt station to Clifton has a 50 feet width but due to construction of Jamat Khana, its width has been reduced to 36 ft, which drain out in Nahar e Khayam. Drain of Madina colony and Singer chowrangi are also in the same condition.

Width of the largest drain Nullah of Oragni town, has been reduced due to encroachment on both sides, that’s why there was a flood in recent days because of heavy rains of monsoon. Width of Mianwali drainage has been reduced by soil pipe instaltions by KDA into it and now very little amount of rain water flows through it.","Tue, 04 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1529694-HANDS%20RNA%20Urban%20Flooding%20Karachi%20July%202020.png?itok=3ubSxtIF,"['mm', 'city', 'pakistan', 'need', 'assessment', '2020', 'water', 'drain', 'flooding', 'rapid', 'karachi', 'urban', 'market', 'width', 'reduced', 'drainage', 'heavy']", ,flood

“The actual number has not been confirmed yet,” but 100 to 150 people were feared dead, Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand state where the incident occurred, told Reuters.

A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down a river valley.

“It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,” Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of Raini village, told Reuters by phone. “I felt that even we would be swept away.”

Locals fear that people working at a nearby hydro-power project had been swept away, as well as villagers roaming near the river looking for firewood or grazing their cattle, Rana said. “We have no idea how many people are missing.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was closely monitoring the situation.

“India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,” he said on Twitter after speaking with the state chief minister.

India’s air force was being readied to help with rescue operations, the federal government said, while Home Minister Amit Shah said disaster-response teams were being airlifted in to help with relief and rescue.

“All the concerned officers are working on a war footing,” Shah said on Twitter, referring to Uttarakhand by its nickname, the Hindi term for “land of the gods” — due to the numerous Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres located across the state.

The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous, also put its riverside areas on high alert.

Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the dam as well as whatever else was in its path.

Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.

“The flow of the Alaknanda River beyond Nandprayag [stretch] has become normal,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Twitter.

“The water level of the river is now one metre above normal but the flow is decreasing.”

Meanwhile, Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry, the spokesperson for Pakistan's foreign ministry, also expressed sorrow over the ""loss of precious lives due to flash floods caused by glacier break-off in Uttarakhand"".

Uttarakhand in the Himalayas is prone to flash floods and landslides. In June 2013, record rainfall caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.

That disaster was dubbed the “Himalayan tsunami” by the media due to the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.

Uma Bharti, India’s former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi’s party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.

“When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.","Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://i.dawn.com/large/2021/02/601fbde54f47e.png,"['100', 'minister', 'chief', 'uttarakhand', 'glacier', 'feared', 'water', 'away', 'state', 'himalayan', 'floods', 'india', 'bursts', 'dam', 'river', 'twitter', 'dead']", ,flood

It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.

Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.

This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.

The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.

Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.

The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.

Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

11,000 households (71,500 people) planned to be assisted by WFP

8,506 households (77 percent of households targeted) assisted by WFP as of 21 September

Highlights

The scale of damage and humanitarian needs caused by the floods have been significantly underreported in local and international media.

WFP started emergency food distributions on 8 September with its partners ACTED and HANDS.

Distributions in Malir (Karachi) and Umerkot districts have been completed. Distributions in Mirpur Khas and Sanghar are expected to be completed by 25 September.

WFP Funding Requirements

US$500,000 is needed to cover the costs of this emergency response and replenish the food stocks borrowed from other WFP operations.

Situation Update

The situation in rural areas is extremely worrying, both in terms of immediate humanitarian needs and longer-term impacts on livelihoods, food security and nutrition. While rains have stopped, many areas remain flooded and stagnant water is posing major health, nutrition and shelter issues.

Thousands of families displaced by the floods are still living by the side of the road, with little chance of returning home for at least another month and no employment opportunities in view given large-scale crop and livestock losses.

On 12 September, Sindh Chief Minister requested additional humanitarian assistance from the UN.

On 17-18 September, the UN Resident Coordinator and WFP Country Director visited a WFP food distribution and a UNICEF Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) distribution in Mirpur Khas district. They met with the Mirpur Khas Commissioner, the Sindh Director General Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the Sindh Chief Secretary, who expressed appreciation for WFP’s fast response.

At the request of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), UN and NGO partners are preparing to carry out a multisectoral needs assessment to inform mediumterm recovery needs, covering the 30 mostaffected districts across the country. This new assessment will complement the rapid joint needs assessment carried out during the first week of September.

56,56,FL-2020-000185-PAK,WHY KARACHI FLOODS - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1578061,"In order to address the reasons for Karachi's flooding, its complexities must first be understood.

The record-breaking rains of August 27 resulted in a near-collapse of the city’s infrastructure and exposed the lack of foresight, planning and governance that the metropolis has long suffered. But in order to address the issues, their complexities must first be understood





This monsoon season, Karachi flooded as never before. Streets were turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, landslides occurred in a number of places damaging vehicles and property, and over a hundred persons drowned or were electrocuted. The people of Karachi understand well that the causes of the problems of the city that they love so much are political and institutional and so are their solutions. However, the province and Islamabad, the antagonists in the Karachi situation, have yet to accept and express this.

It is generally believed that the reason for the flooding is encroachments by the residents of katchi abadis on the natural drainage system of the city and that the solution lies in removing these encroachments and the solid waste that has accumulated in the nullahs. However, the situation is far more complex than that, and has aggravated over a long period of time. This article tries to explain this complexity and the steps that have been taken in the past to address it and what, in technical terms, needs to be done now in a very changed situation.





A HISTORY OF DRAINAGE

As most Karachiites know, Karachi’s stormwater drains into two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other with a distance of between 14-20 kms in between. Forty-three stormwater drains (or nullahs), according to the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) documentation, and 64 according to the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), carry the water of their huge catchment areas to them and over 600 smaller drains feed into these 64 nullahs. In addition, real estate has been built over thousands of even smaller nullahs.

Before independence, Karachi’s population was only 450,000. The city had a sewage system consisting mostly of underground earthenware pipes and it was treated through biological treatment at Gutter Baghicha located in the trans-Lyari area of the city between the Haroonabad drain and the Orangi nullah. The treated Effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. Gutter Baghicha, which covered an area of just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares), has been reduced to 480 acres (according to the NGO Shehri) due to illegal yet officially sanctioned settlements.

With partition and the arrival of about 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand and both formal and informal sector developments took place far away from Gutter Baghicha. The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns, Landhi-Korangi and New Karachi, at a distance of about 20 kilometres each from the then city. Sewage treatment plants were planned for these settlements and treated sewage was to be disposed; in the case of Landhi-Korangi, to the Korangi Creek and in the case of North Karachi, to Khawaja Ajmer Nagri nullah. However, these plants were never constructed and so untreated sewage is still disposed at these locations.

Because of an absence of a sustainable social housing policy, informal settlements developed along the nullahs, and these discharge their sewage into them as well. After the mid-’60s formal sector developments, in the absence of an alternative, also used the nullahs for disposal. So one can safely say that, post the mid-’60s Karachi’s sewage system has been officially planned to dispose into the nullahs and, as a result, sludge from sewage began to clog the nullahs and their tributaries.

Map1

In 1978-79, there were very heavy rains in Karachi and much of the housing along the nullahs was washed away. After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities to compact it along the nullah edges to secure them from erosion and flooding and to acquire land to extend their homes into the nullahs. It would not be out of place here to mention that the stormwater drains developed by the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) also carry sewage to the Clifton beach and, in the process, pollute the sea. With the passage of time, solid waste generated by the city increased from 6,500 tons to 14,000-15,000 tons between 2001 and 2020 and, in the absence of proper management and control, became increasingly difficult to manage. This had severe repercussions for the overall drainage system in Karachi.





THE SOLID WASTE ISSUE

Although Karachi is spatially a large city of 3,780 sq kms (with a built up area of approximately 500 sq kms), it has only two landfill sites, both next to each other and in District West. Consequently, solid waste has to be carried for over 40 kms from the eastern edge of the city so as to reach the landfill sites. Because of this distance, and the time and costs entailed, solid waste from most of Karachi does not reach the landfill sites, and is dumped at numerous informal dumping sites along the Korangi Creek and various other open areas and nullahs that join it. Proposals for additional landfill sites have been made since 1975 and, in a 2001 report, one landfill site for each district was suggested, but never implemented.

Meanwhile, a solid waste recycling industry, mostly in the informal sector, developed in Karachi over the years. This recycling industry, which is growing rapidly, acquires recyclable material from two streams. One is known as the clean stream, whereby housewives and markets sell bottles, newspapers, metal objects and cans to kabaarris, who then sell them to the recyclers. The other stream is known as the dirty stream, wherein young boys, mainly of Afghan origin, are organised by contractors to pick all recyclable material from kachra kundis or neighbourhood dumps. They carry it on bicycles to abandoned parks, empty plots or spaces under bridges, where it is sorted out into different categories and sold to the recyclers by weight.

Bones are crushed into powder and mixed with chicken feed; rags are turned into fluff by rag-pulling machines and used for upholstery; small pieces of paper are recycled into board; and plastic items are granulated and the granules are sent to the Punjab for being turned into utensils and toys. The contractors organising this activity pay the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) staff to not pick up the garbage so that the picking can be made easier. The organic waste that is left behind has, over the years, been dumped in the nullahs or has been burned. Burning has been reduced considerably due to public protests.

The homes along the nullahs also throw their waste into them. It is estimated by various reports that no more than 30 to 40 percent of waste reaches the landfill sites. By the mid-’90s, most of the nullahs of the city were full of compacted solid waste, and today children play cricket and football on them. A 2001 study by the Karachi Urban Resource Center estimated that, directly or indirectly, the recycling industry employed over 40,000 families. The number today is nearer 100,000 families.





ENCROACHMENTS AND LAND RECLAMATION

In the absence of the implementation of Karachi’s development plans and the pressure for space for commercial activity, the local government constructed many bazaars over the nullahs such as the Urdu Bazaar and the Tyre Market. Meanwhile, the Government of Sindh, for its own use, has constructed car parking facilities, offices and a MPA hostel on the nullahs, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan is constructed on a nullah, and so is part of the women’s college on Burnes Road and a bank building.

Meanwhile, in the posh areas, the VIPs had extended their homes on to the natural drainage systems and some of these were removed in 2004 by orders of the then Mayor Syed Mustafa Kamal.

Pressure for homes due to an absence of affordable housing for the poor has constantly increased in Karachi, especially in the ’90s and 2000s. As a result, solid waste has been used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite residential purposes. Such reclamation is, strictly speaking, illegal in both cases. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire KMC tractors to spread and compact it. This land is sold while the reclamation is taking place and even before it is physically visible.

It is estimated that, for parts of Macchar Colony, Sultanabad, Shireen Jinnah Colony and Keamari alone, 17 sq km of land has been reclaimed from the sea, and over 1,000 households live on it. A major part of Phase 8 of Karachi’s most elite settlement, DHA, has been reclaimed from the sea through the use of municipal solid waste.

Another major problem facing the drainage issue is that the outlets to the sea have been blocked or considerably reduced, as a result of which stormwater disposal is hindered. The Mehmoodabad nullah disposes into the Gizri Creek estuary, where DHA has developed plots for its Phase 7 scheme. A 60 ft nullah, constructed by DHA, now carries sewage and rainwater to the creek. Since this outlet is insufficient, it slows down the disposal to an extent that, at high tide during rainfall, there is a backwash into the nullah. As a result, large tracks of Mehmoodabad, Chanesar Goth and PECHS Block 6 extension are inundated, and remain as such for long periods of time.

Similarly, the Mai Kolachi Bypass and the Karachi Port Trust Officers Housing Society also block the exit of Pitcher nullah into the China Creek backwaters, because of which large areas of Saddar get flooded. A similar situation exists at the point where the Kalri nullah enters the China Creek backwaters.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.

But there are a number of other obstacles too to the journey of stormwater from the north to the sea. A major obstacle is encountered at the Northern Bypass where, because of its height above the Lyari floodplains and the absence of sufficient culverts, water accumulates, flooding large low-lying areas on both sides of the bypass. In addition, road construction in most of the low-income settlements is 3-4 ft above the level of the settlements, and there is no system of draining these settlements in case of heavy rains. As a result, they become islands of stagnant water till it is pumped out or absorbed by the land.

There are also design and technical issues that create flooding. For instance, all stormwater from buildings and real estate projects drains on to the roads on which they are located. During rains, this water either disposes into the existing sewage system (which is also on the roads) or, when rains are heavy, it turns the roads into fast-flowing rivers which mix with the sewage and create, apart from physical distress, enormous health hazards.





GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES

Government agencies have undertaken the rehabilitation and/or the building of a large number of roads. The tender documents require the construction of drains along the sides of the roads. These are invariably built and are usually of an excellent standard. However, more often than not, they do not have a disposal and usually end where the road construction or rehabilitation ends, leaving the stormwater to find its own destination.

Meanwhile, in the last decade and a half, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels, hillocks and water collection depressions. As a result, when it rains, areas immediately south of this region (such as Saadi Town) are completely submerged by floodwaters from the hills.

Areas which have not been levelled out and are next to the ones that have been levelled, collapse in the rains and, if there is housing on them, there is major loss of life and property. With more developments taking place in the Kirthar foothills, the likelihood of flooding and landslides will also increase.





THE KARACHI URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME

To overcome some of these problems, the Government of Sindh (KWSB and the local government) in the late ’80s launched the Karachi Urban Development Programme. The programme consisted of rehabilitating the old sewage treatment plant and the construction of new ones, along with the building of trunk sewers along the main roads so as to take the sewage to the treatment plants. A large Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was taken for this purpose.

The Orangi Pilot Project-Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) was consulted regarding the implementation of the Orangi Town part of the project. It noticed that the trunks did not pick up the existing sewage system in which local government and the people of Orangi had invested billions of rupees. To connect the existing system, which flowed into the nullahs, would require digging up hundreds of kilometres of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to connect to the ADB trunks. Apart from being a waste of government and people’s investment, the communities would never agree to put up with this inconvenience and the psychological impact, of seeing their work and investment destroyed, would have been devastating.

When OPP saw the entire plan for the city, it observed that what was proposed for Orangi was proposed for the entire city. Connecting the existing sewage system to the trunks would require many more ADB loans, increasing Pakistan’s foreign debt.

The capacity of Karachi’s sewage treatment plants is 151 million gallons per day. However, since the sewage does not reach the plants, no more than 25 million gallons-a-day can be treated and, since the plants are so grossly under-utilised, severe maintenance problems surface. Meanwhile, sewage continues to flow happily into the drainage system.

These problems were recognised by the OPP-PTI as early as 1988. The OPP-PTI proposed that the reality of sewage flowing into the natural drainage system be accepted, and that trunk sewers be laid in the bed of the nullahs or on either side of them. However, we did not have enough knowledge then regarding the number of nullahs, the relationship of the existing sewage systems to them and the terrain through which different nullahs flowed and, as such, this concept could not be properly framed.

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding.

The knowledge regarding these issues was developed by the seminal work done by architect Perveen Rehman, then director OPP-RTI. She identified and documented 43 nullahs and, on the basis of this knowledge, OPP worked out the details of a sewage system consisting of trunks on either of side of the nullahs and being connected near the disposal points with each other, and pumped from there to the treatment plants (See map below for OPP-RTI proposal).

This proposal was accepted and, with modifications, it formed the basis for the Greater Karachi Sewage Plan (also known as S-3) — part of which is now under construction. At a meeting where this decision was taken, the ADB consultant for the design of the ODA UK-financed trunks expressed grave concern and pointed out that Her Majesty’s government had invested 1 million pounds in the preparation of the designs.

This ignoring of ground realities and existing infrastructure has been a characteristic of foreign-funded infrastructure projects in Karachi, resulting in excessive costs, as in the case of the ADB-funded Korangi Waste Water Management Project. This was a 100 million US dollar project, of which 80 million US dollars was a loan. After OPP redesigned the project to integrate the existing system and reworked the rates, the cost of the project was reduced to 26 million US dollars, which led the then Governor of Sindh, Moinuddin Haider, to cancel the loan (for existing infrastructure at Korangi Project see map above).

In addition, all foreign-funded projects have a fairly high percentage of costs allocated for “capacity building.” Yet, over the last 40 years, no capacity to deal with the evolving situation has developed. This is because capacity building is done through foreign trips to look at “good practices” and through workshops and seminars. No permanent institution for research, monitoring and training has been established — a basic requirement for any capacity building and the establishment of a continuous culture of learning.

During the mapping of the stormwater drains, OPP-RTI had constant interaction with the local communities living along the nullahs. It was only them who knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of the various smaller drains that have disappeared. So far, how they can be made part of the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

OPP also studied how the Japanese, after the devastation of the Second World War, had dealt with a similar situation. They had secured the edges of the nullahs to prevent erosion. In appropriate places, they had covered the nullahs and used their roofs as public space and created sports grounds, children’s play areas and community spaces for older people. Unfortunately, OPP could not carry out these proposals.





QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND DESIGN STANDARDS

The present flooding has also exposed the poor quality of infrastructure built for Karachi. Roads collapsed, embankments were breached, sewage systems failed and, due to flooding, electricity had to be switched off for more than half of the city. It is yet to be ascertained if this was because of faulty design or whether design standards were inadequate to deal with the extent of flooding. If the latter, then engineers will have to work to establish appropriate standards. In the Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020, it was also proposed that dams be constructed in the foothills of the Kirthar range, to store large quantums of water. However, only one dam, the Thaddo Dam, has been constructed. Will the construction of additional dams reduce the pressure of water entering Karachi? This too needs to be ascertained.

Politicians, bureaucrats, developers and even a number of engineers have stressed that the removal of encroachments from, and the cleaning of, the nullahs is the first step towards easing the situation in Karachi. However, from what has been discussed above, the most important step that needs to be taken is to remove the encroachments at the outfalls, so that water can enter the sea. Also, it has to be understood that, if the housing along the nullahs is removed, the water will erode the edges of the nullah and cause a major disaster by flooding out the housing at the edge, as it did in 1978 and 1979, and we will be left with a huge housing and relocation problem.

It is essential that, even before attempting such an exercise, a proper documentation of the potential affectees is drawn up, with Nadra’s assistance, and encroachment removal is across the board, with the source criteria being applied for both rich and poor, unlike in the past. It is also relevant to note here that there is sufficient federal and provincial government land within the city to easily house over 80,000 families at almost no cost to the state. Proposals for this have also been floated off and on in the press.





THE NEED FOR LOCAL GOVERNANCE

Many of the problems that have been identified above cannot be dealt with together. A criteria for prioritising them will have to be developed. All of them are really a part of a larger planning process for Karachi. Such a planning process requires research, on the basis of which politicians can take informed decisions; the development of plans (with the participation of communities) by an empowered and well-staffed planning institution, and their implementation in a transparent and accountable manner. And finally, there will have to be a monitoring, operation and maintenance process, especially at the neighbourhood level.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place.

Much of this work will be have to done at the grassroots level and will entail the empowering of the Union Councils and the involvement of citizens in the formulation of the Union Council’s annual development programme. Karachi packages, as developed in the past, and projects unrelated to a larger plan, will not help in the creation of an appropriate planning process, nor will time- and cash-bound projects funded by international financial institutions such as ADB and the World Bank. History taught us these lessons long ago, but we have failed to learn from them.

What is being suggested above cannot be carried out by provincial bureaucrats or by short-term sophisticated consultants and the companies to whom contracts for delivering services have been handed out to by the Government of Sindh. Nor can a national disaster management authority develop long-term plans for disaster prevention without an implementation arrangement with the line departments and local governments. To deal with the Karachi situation, an effective local government organisation is required, which ends the fragmentation of Karachi into different planning jurisdictions, with all its departments under central control. So far, the Sindh government has been averse to this, because it wishes to control the city through a highly centralised form of governance, because it does not gain the required number of seats to promote decentralisation.

However, the prime minister has proposed autonomous city governments for the major cities of Pakistan. For this, a political consensus among the different parties would be required and, given the sentiments and the enormous resources that Karachi possesses, this would be difficult if not impossible to achieve.

The prime minister has also asked for the preparation of a Karachi Transformation Plan. It is hoped that, apart from basic rehabilitation, the plan will propose an effective local body reform, without which, in the opinion of the author, no transformation can take place. A very important ingredient for what has been suggested are human resources. For that it is necessary that a research and training institute be established, whose training would be for politicians at all levels and for staff involved in project preparation, implementation and monitoring.

An association with community leaders and activists would have to be an important part of the training. Can this be made possible over a period of time? If yes, there is hope for a better Karachi. If not, we will simply continue to muddle through.

You need to be unbearably audacious to flaunt hypocrisy in the manner most members of the National Assembly have thoughtlessly employed for “expressing solidarity” with besieged and relentlessly bombed people of Palestine.

They took more than 90 minutes to assemble for the first sitting of another session of the National Assembly Monday evening. At the outset of it, Asad Qaisar, the Speaker, announced the decision of devoting the entire sitting to “the cause of Palestine only” and invited Shehbaz Sharif, the Opposition Leader, to initiate a yawn-inducing round of trivial speechmaking.

After spending many months in jail, the PML-N leader had reached Islamabad to attend the assembly session. He might not have been here, if the government had not stopped him from flying to London, with the permission of Lahore High Court.

Seriously suspending my cynical approach to “our representatives,” I tried hard to carefully listen to each word of his speech. Except narrating facts, which even a school going kid must know regarding the history of Palestine, he never cared to furnish anything fresh and attention-worthy.

Repeatedly, he kept urging the government to “lead from the front” in furnishing solace to constantly bombed Palestinians. How to go about it and with what strategy? He had no answer to it.

Still, he did admit that “emotional speeches” wouldn’t deliver any protection to abandoned people of Palestine. But forcefully suggested that the coming Friday should be observed as “Al Quds” day. The day of solidarity should end with a visit to UN Offices in Islamabad to handover a resolution in support of the people of Palestine, unanimously prepared by all the political parties of Pakistan. The expected resolution should also ask the United Nations Security Council to instantly move to stop Israel from vicious and barbaric attacks on Palestinian territory.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, the foreign minister, on the other hand, consumed more time to reveal that Prime Minister Imran Khan had already been working around the clock to develop a workable strategy to check Israel with constant contacts with the rest of Islamic countries. Thanks to his persistence, Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) was finally motivated to hold a series of SOS meetings.

While profusely welcoming the activist role of the OIC, Shah Mahmood Qureshi also recalled with a hurt heart that the US had vetoed against a UNSC resolution, which attempted to condemn Israel’s atrocities against Palestinians but failed to explain how to convince the Biden administration to behave otherwise.

He seemed quite proud in claiming that foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s concern with grateful words. Doing this, he conveniently forgot that Israel’s recent barrages of bombs were primarily targeting Gaza-confined Palestinians and so far the people living in the West Bank had been spared. And Hamas and not the Palestinian Authority is in complete control of Gaza.

Similarly, he sounded laughably naïve while stressing that after failing in getting some relief from the UN Security Council, the OIC should now force the UN to hold an urgent General Assembly sitting. To ensure the same, he would leave for Turkey Monday night and from there intends to fly on to New York, hopefully along with the foreign ministers of Turkey and Sudan, to intensify lobbying for an emergency session of the UN General Assembly on Palestine.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi is not a novice to foreign affairs; he had been our foreign minister during the Gillani-led PPP government as well. He surely needs no tutor to discover that UN General Assembly has no mandate to actively engage in atrocity-stopping actions. That remains the exclusive prerogative of the UN Security Council.

Our Foreign Minister also felt excited about the series of protest marches in metropolitan cities like London, Paris and Berlin etc. Praising these marches, he indeed appeared completely oblivious to embarrassing indifference that many metropolitan cities of the Muslim countries were displaying these days regarding the ceaseless atrocities in Gaza.

In the end, however, he had to helplessly admit that United States of America remained the one and only country, relishing leverage vis-à-vis Israel. Keeping this in mind, he also had focused on recent events in Palestine during his telephone conversation with the US Secretary of State Sunday evening.

Referring to the same conversation, he suddenly switched to criticize the Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani, and began raising serious questions regarding his conduct during a critical phase of the Afghan issue, when the US and the NATO forces had already announced the intent of leaving Afghanistan by September 11, 2001.

His comments regarding Afghanistan made me suspect that the ‘end game’ in that war torn country was not moving according to the plan Pakistan might have imagined. Things rather appear heading to fear-inducing explosion in our immediate neighborhood. Yet, our foreign minister kept feeling too proud in suggesting as if Pakistan was set to play a leading role to protect Palestine from Israel’s atrocities.

Delivering bombastic speeches, our worthy members should also have done sincere soul searching. Around two years ago on August 5, 2019, Modi government of India had unilaterally revoked the ‘special status of the Occupied Kashmir. After announcing the said decision, it enforced a ruthless lockdown on the Valley of Kashmir. Its brute clamp down clearly emulated tactics, Zionists had been employing to encroach into Palestinian territories since 1948.

“Our representatives,” crowding the National Assembly miserably failed to imagine an effective strategy to ensure pushing back of the Indian onslaught on occupied Kashmir. With the start of 2021, we rather started to get a flood of credible-sounding stories, strongly suggesting that India and Pakistan were now seeking peace with each other through ‘backdoor negotiations.”

The nonstop flood of such stories never motivated our “supreme to all” pretending parliamentarians to force the Imran government and its foreign minister to stand up in the National Assembly or the Senate to explain even cursory details related to reported “negotiations.” While most of them keep boasting that the issue of Kashmir remains the core existential question for Pakistan. They remained equally clueless regarding the recent development in Afghanistan. Yet the same parliamentarians hardly felt any shame in flaunting “deep concerns” for the people of Palestine and boastfully pretending as if they have finally found a workable strategy to furnish solace to their wounds.","Mon, 17 May 2021 21:39:47 GMT",https://nation.com.pk/print_images/large/2021-05-18/delivering-bombastic-speeches-1621287582-6148.jpg,"['assembly', 'minister', 'bombastic', 'strategy', 'pakistan', 'speeches', 'national', 'regarding', 'foreign', 'kashmir', 'palestinian', 'delivering', 'palestine']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Indus Water Commission (PCIW) will raise the issue of delaying flood data by India during the annual meeting of the commission on March 23-24.

The meeting is taking place after a hiatus of nearly three years, with the last being held in Lahore in August 2018.

Last year's meeting, which was earlier scheduled to be held in New Delhi in March 2020, was cancelled in view of the pandemic situation.

As per the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, both the commissioners are required to meet at least once a year alternately in India and Pakistan.



Speaking to Geo News on Tuesday, Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehr Ali said the Pakistani delegation will leave for New Delhi on March 22 where the meeting would take place.

What will be discussed in the meeting?

Shah will lead the Pakistani delegation whereas the Indian side will be headed by PK Saxena.

“Controversial projects of 1000 MW Pakkal Dal and 48 MW Lower Kalnai will be discussed during the two-day meeting. Pakistan has already raised objections on the design of these projects,” he said.

The top official of the Indus Water Commission said two more water projects -Darbuk and Nemochaling – will also come under discussion, adding that the issue of delaying flood data will also be raised with New Delhi.

“India has been violating the Indus Basin Agreement in providing flood data for 2 years. Pakistan wants daily flood data from July 1 to October 10,” Mehar noted.

60,60,FL-2020-000185-PAK,"As Pakistan glacier melt surges, efforts to cut flood risk drag - Reuters",https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idUSKBN23F03B,"ISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Late last month, residents of the tiny village of Hassanabad, in Pakistan’s mountainous Hunza District, noticed floodwaters quickly rising in the stream that runs near their homes, carrying water from the towering Shishper glacier.

“The flows became so high that they eroded the land and reached 10 feet from my family’s home. We evacuated,” said Ghulam Qadir, a resident of the village.

The ensuing flood, carrying huge boulders from the melting glacier, demolished the cherry, apricot and walnut orchards many families depend on, and left homes cracked, 16 families in tents and local irrigation and hydropower systems damaged.

“The flood water broke all the retaining walls that were built last year in order to protect the village,” Qadir told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone.

“Now there is a ravine right next to our houses and we live in dread of another flood.”

The area is one of 24 valleys in northern Pakistan scheduled to receive warning systems, between 2018 and 2022, for glacial lake outburst floods using $37 million in funding from the Green Climate Fund.

But work has been delayed as a result of differences between the partners - the U.N. Development Programme-Pakistan and the federal Ministry of Climate Change - as well as by a change of government and now the coronavirus, said Ayaz Joudat, national programme director for the project.

“The delay is partly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and partly because UNDP-Pakistan would not finalise the letter of agreement signed with the Ministry of Climate Change, which would give us oversight over hiring of staff and other matters,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

That delay, however, was recently resolved, he said, and hiring now will begin at the end of June, with an aim of installing the first early warning systems on glaciers by September.

Amanullah Khan, UNDP-Pakistan’s assistant country director, agreed the delayed project was now “up and running”.

MELTING GLACIERS

With more than 7,000, Pakistan has more glaciers than anywhere except the polar regions.

But climate change is “eating away Himalayan glaciers at a dramatic rate”, a study published last year in the journal Science Advances noted.

As glacier ice melts, it can collect in large glacial lakes, which are at risk of bursting their through banks and creating deadly flash floods downstream, in places like Hassanabad.

More than 3,000 of those lakes had formed as of 2018, with 33 of them considered hazardous and more than 7 million people at risk downstream, according to UNDP.

In an effort to reduce the risks, pilot funding from the U.N. Adaptation Fund from 2011-2016 paid for two lake outburst warning systems, flood protection walls and community preparedness efforts in Chitral District and in the Gilgit Baltistan region.

The new project aims to install similar systems in 15 districts in northern Pakistan, and to build other infrastructure to reduce risks, including flood walls in villages like Hassanabad.

DANGER AHEAD

Shehzad Baig, assistant director of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority in Hunza, said the recent flood in Hassanabad was spurred not by a typical glacial lake outburst but by rapid glacier melt.

That melting is likely to pick up over the summer months, he said, noting that “June to September will be dangerous”, particularly after a winter of heavy snowfall.

Baig, who flew over the Shishper glacier on a helicopter recently for a look, said the ice still lacked an early warning monitor for outburst floods, though as a first step Pakistan’s Meteorological Department had installed an automatic weather station last June.

“A UNDP-Pakistan team came last year to study the glacier and there was talk of an (automated) early warning system that was to be installed but no action was taken,” he said.

In late May, the chairman of Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority warned that the Gilgit Baltistan region had received a third more snowfall than normal over the winter, which could raise flood risks.

Residents of Hassanabad said the planned work on a warning system can’t come soon enough, as summer heat raises the threat level.

“We don’t care about all this bureaucratic red tape. We just want better protective walls for our village and a proper early warning system,” Qadir said.

“This coming summer there will be more flooding and people will suffer”.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png?w=800,"['warning', 'cut', 'surges', 'climate', 'glacier', 'pakistan', 'change', 'village', 'efforts', 'outburst', 'flood', 'drag', 'walls', 'early', 'melt', 'systems', 'risk']", ,flood

Here she shares her views on how the largest city in Pakistan should not have ignored warnings about the climate crisis.

Karachi is drowning.

Over the last week, torrential rains have ravaged Pakistan’s cosmopolitan hub. Breaking records of over 90 years, the city has been flooded as its systems and infrastructure find themselves unable to cope with the unprecedented amount of rainfall.

But how much does this have to do with climate change?

The city’s inability to deal with rain isn’t exactly a revelation - previous years have seen monsoon seasons cause substantial damage. But this year, it’s a crisis like never before. Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has reported 63 deaths in rain related incidents already, while entire residential areas and markets have been submerged, causing millions of rupees worth of damage to houses and businesses.

The onslaught of such a disaster has come as a shock to locals who wonder why officials didn’t put preventative measures in place, with full knowledge that the rainy season was coming.

“It’s not something that’s happened recently. This has been 30-40 years in the making,” explains Vice Chairman of the Lahore Development Authority, SM Imran. The neglect of Karachi’s development is cited as the main reason behind the city’s current crisis. Despite the city’s importance to Pakistan’s economy and development, sustainable growth of the city has never been a political priority, he adds.

As roads collapse and sewage systems overflow, questions are arising as to where years worth of taxpayers money has gone. Residents of various areas in the city are experiencing three-day long power shortages and stagnant water blocking the streets.

Did Karachi ignore the warnings?

Karachi’s situation is a glaring example of what can happen when climate change warnings and sustainable growth are neglected - in favour of political optics and superficial development.

In a country that has faced significant damage in the past due to droughts, this influx of rain could have been a game changer. But instead, a lack of preparation has turned what should have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster.

To make matters worse, the drainage system which collapsed in DHA, supposedly the posh area of the city, was built in 2007 and residents were charged for it.

A lack of preparation has turned what could have been years worth of water storage into a city-wide economic disaster

Moving forward, it is imperative we understand exactly where the problem lies. The lost lives and flooding are horrific enough - but the damage they have caused may not be fixed for years to come.

Pakistan’s already debt-ridden economy will now have to face the harrowing consequences of redoing entire sewage systems, rehabilitating thousands of people and businesses and possibly risk losing their main port city.

How will the city recover?

This year’s disaster has proven that there is no time to be lost. Priorities need to be set in order for changes to be made. Instead of focusing on other aspects of infrastructure that contribute very little to the city’s growth, Imran believes the focus now needs to be on water conservation and treatment.

For Imran, Israel is a good example we can learn from. Its Ashkelon facility provided for 70 per cent of the country’s water demands through a process of seawater desalination. A city that craved rainfall is now richer in water resources. This just shows that we can harness the effects of climate change in our favour, if we know how to. What’s needed now is a complete overhaul of what we thought our future would be, explains Imran.

Karachi has been labelled “resilient” many times over the years. But as the city descends into worse conditions, its resilience is no longer a compliment but an excuse. No longer can this idea of resilience be used to ignore its exacerbating problems.

One possible solution is for local governments to do more than just pass bills. Many now believe that programmes should be put in place to teach employees how best to reuse water and treat rubbish.

Currently though, political solutions seem too little too late, and citizens are stepping up to rehabilitate the city themselves.

Citizens are coming to the rescue

Among the many initiatives taken over by relief workers and organisations, is Saturday Welfare Group (SWG). What started as a group of friends wanting to provide rehabilitation to marginalised communities in Pakistan has grown into a powerful initiative that steps up in times of crisis.

“Everyone is equal who is contributing to or working for welfare,” is their motto.

It's a motto that couldn’t be more fitting with the situation Karachi now finds itself in. Both within the country and among the Pakistani diaspora, fundraising is at an all-time high. It’s a testament to the idea that there are people who want change, and are ready to work for it - they just need an opportunity. Development in Karachi should be carried out on a much more equal scale, and perhaps those truly working for change will finally get the attention they deserve.

Recovery will be a long road, and hopefully when political action begins to reflect the needs of the hour, it will be up to residents to play their role as well. Pollution and littering is a major problem the city struggles with. As trash from the streets finds its way into drainage pipes, it blocks the very waterways that are meant to save the city from such disasters. Conservation initiatives need to be better understood.

This is a responsibility that lies with the educated strata of society, who have the power and resources to implement these initiatives and make them accessible to the masses. Feigning ignorance over harmful habits and actions is no longer a valid excuse.","Mon, 07 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/93/76/44/1000x563_cmsv2_7fe7a6a1-6ce3-5379-ad73-e8d45fe149d9-4937644.jpg,"['development', 'political', 'city', 'climate', 'change', 'water', 'damage', 'worth', 'drowning', 'karachi', 'prevented', 'citys']", ,flood

""Normal rainfall in Karachi in the month of August is 68 millimeters (6.8 centimeters). This year, we have recorded 587.5 millimeters (58.75 centimeters) so far,"" said Muhammad Riaz, the director general of Pakistan's Meteorological Department.

Last Thursday, the city received more than 23 centimeters of rain, the highest on record in a single day.

Residents complained of sewage on the streets and in water tanks. Power was out in several areas for days amid sweltering heat and humidity. The outage also caused disruptions in cellphone service, interrupting emergency management and leaving citizens out of touch with loved ones.

In some cases, the electricity cables broke, causing fears of electrocution.

""Few residents located in these zones have also requested us not to power up supply since it may be a safety hazard for them,"" tweeted Karachi's electricity provider, K-Electric.

Meanwhile, authorities said another weather system was hovering over Sindh province, increasing the likelihood of more rains in the coming days.

The large metropolis, considered to be Pakistan's economic lifeline, has faced problems of overcrowding and unplanned development since the country's independence in 1947.

""[A] very large majority of its population lives in informal settlements in poorly designed housing with inadequate services,"" according to a 2017 working paper, titled, ""Drivers of climate change vulnerability at different scales in Karachi.""

Much of the city's planning woes have been exacerbated over the decades due to corruption coupled with political rivalries among local, provincial and federal governments.

Parts of Karachi are owned by the federal government. In addition, local and provincial governments have set up parallel structures of service delivery, like trash pickup, diluting resources.

""We need to clearly understand who is responsible for what. Until the municipal functions are divided between the federal and provincial governments, problems of delivery will remain,"" Murtaza Wahab, the spokesman for Sindh government, told local news channel Geo News.

According to the working paper, bad governance and development shortcomings in Karachi ""have created vulnerabilities at different scales that are likely to exacerbate the impacts of climate change-related weather events taking place within the city and elsewhere in the country.""

Development professional Zaigham Khan said overcrowding and slum developments were a result of the city absorbing the social and economic problems of the entire country.

""If there is terrorism in FATA (erstwhile tribal area), locals move to Karachi. When there is war in Afghanistan, the most refugees arrive in Karachi. When there are floods in the country, the affected go to Karachi. If there is insurgency in Balochistan, locals escape to Karachi. If there are no jobs in southern Punjab, the preferred refuge is Karachi,"" he said.

Like other metropolitan cities of the world, he said, Karachi needs to be managed by a strong municipal government and an empowered mayor, but he added that local politics intervened in the execution of such an idea.","Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2020-08/2020-08-28T002602Z_1664829512_RC2DMI9GJKL7_RTRMADP_3_PAKISTAN-RAINS-KARACHI.JPG,"['woes', 'rains', 'city', 'problems', 'local', 'record', 'pakistan', 'water', 'rain', 'pakistans', 'flooded', 'flooding', 'karachi', 'urban', 'continue', 'provincial']", ,flood

The directives were issued by the prime minister while presiding over a meeting of the National Coordination Committee on Floods here on Monday, according to an announcement by the PM Office.

Besides the NDMA chief, the meeting was attended by federal Minister for Information Shibli Faraz, Communications Minister Murad Saeed, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda, the director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the chairmen of the National Highways Authority and Federal Flood Commission (FFC).

The provincial chief secretaries also participated in the meeting through a video link. The chief secretaries informed the prime minister about the damages caused by recent floods and rains in their respective provinces.

The NDMA chairman briefed the prime minister on the situation in various parts of the country after the recent spells of monsoon and the damages caused by these heavy rains. He also apprised the prime minister about the relief activities being carried out by the NDMA in different parts of the country affected due to rains.

Meeting reviews relief activities being carried out in rain-affected areas

The officials of the PMD and Flood Commission informed the prime minister that most parts of the country, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, had received more rains than the past. The meeting participants were informed that almost all the rivers were having medium flow of water.

The prime minister was told that there were “strong chances” that the ongoing monsoon season would come to an end by the middle of this month and the chances of more flood-like situation were very low.

The meeting’s participants were also apprised about the relief operation being carried out by the country’s armed forces.

Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister stressed the need for more coordination among all the federal and provincial departments concerned to face the challenge they were facing due to climate changes.

PM Khan was also informed that all dams in the country were full of water and the situation of water availability was satisfactory.

The country’s major reservoirs had already reached their full capacity last month following the countrywide rainfalls and both Tarbela and Mangla dams had attained their maximum conservation levels.

The FFC attributes the filling of dams to effective management of inflows and outflows of the reservoirs, especially by Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).

It has advised the dams operating authorities, including the Flood Monitoring Cell of Mangla, Irsa (Indus River System Authority) and the PMD, to take utmost care and exercise extra vigilance of the reservoirs’ operation.

The combined live storage of major reservoirs — Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — was reported at 13.425 million acre feet (MAF) on Aug 28, which accounted for 98.61 per cent of the 13.614 MAF maximum storage capacity, a record water availability during last 10 years.

According to Wapda, water available in Tarbela and Mangla dams was 2.173 MAF more when compared to last 10 years’ average. The average water availability in the two dams during the last 10 years on the day was recorded at 11.163 MAF.

This better hydrological situation will aptly fulfil the requirement of water for the country’s agriculture in the days to come. More water availability in the reservoirs will also result in more hydel generation in the coming days.

The heavy rainfall spell occurred over the past few days in various parts of Sindh, especially Karachi, had caused severe urban flooding in the provincial capital.

The prime minister had visited Karachi last week and in the presence of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah unveiled a package of Rs1.1 trillion at Governor House to resolve Karachi’s lingering and chronic issues, including provision of clean drinking water, cleaning of drains and sewage and solid waste disposal within three years.

Later, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari stated that the Sindh government would contribute Rs800 billion to the Rs1.1tr package for Karachi, saying that they “welcome the Rs300 billion funding from the federal government for Karachi’s infrastructure development”.

On Sunday, however, federal Minister for Planning and Special Initiatives Asad Umar of PTI told a press conference that the federal government would bear 62 per cent of the total amount of Rs1,100 billion announced by the prime minister.

ISLAMABAD: Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country.

Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged.

The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

""River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,"" reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history.

TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding.

The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

""Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,"" it said.

""Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,"" it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

The £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to many who have lost their homes. It comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks including hygiene kits and tarpaulins to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Lord Ahmad said:

Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands with Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.

The UK aid announced today will ensure life-saving clean water, sanitation and shelter gets to those who need it most. The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be - and the dangers of climate change.

During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.

British High Commissioner Christian Turner CMG said:

Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from COVID-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year. He discussed with the Government of Pakistan how the UK can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet the Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations, and trade ties, and he also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in South Punjab. The UK has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly 8 million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The Minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the COVID-19 surveillance centre. He met the Coordinator National Emergency Operations Centre Dr Rana Safdar who briefed the Minister on Pakistan’s response to COVID-19. Lastly, he was scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

Notes to editors:

In Sindh, according to data from the Meteorological Department, rainfall in August was the highest since recordkeeping began 89 years ago. In Karachi, rainwaters devastated factory stock and caused mass power outages. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected” and local disaster management teams together with NGOs, supported by the military, have been rescuing stranded people, providing medical aid, and food rations. Initial assessments by District authorities suggest that more than 2.5m people have been affected across the worst-hit districts of Badin, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sajawal and Sanghar. In all, monsoon rains have resulted in the death of over 230 people and damaged over 2,600 houses across Pakistan, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). The UK has committed at least £11.6 billion in International Climate Finance over the next five years, and will invest £13 million in Pakistan this year on tackling climate change. This will include supporting local communities adapt to climate change and improve resilience through emergency disaster planning and helping to increase the use of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency.

The fatality is the first confirmed death in New South Wales since the catastrophic weather event began. Authorities confirmed the Pakistani National was driving a hire car when he hit trouble and made several attempts to escape before his care experienced a possible electronic failure. He spent almost an hour on the phone to triple-0 before losing contact with emergency services who responded to reports at 6:30am on Wednesday. The Daily Telegraph is reporting the incident occurred on the corner of Cattai Ridge Road and Hidden Valley Lane in Glenorie, with the man’s body and vehicle discovered at 1:10pm yesterday.

A Pakistani national killed in Sydney floodwaters was on the phone to emergency services and tried desperately to free himself from his car but he could not get out.

Ayaz Younus, 25, was on his first day as a contractor when his Toyota Camby became trapped in floodwaters in Glenorie on Sydney’s northern outskirts.

Farhat Jaffri, from the Pakistan Association of Australia, said he had spoken to the man’s father.

Mr Younus, from Malir Cantt Karachi, was studying software engineering and had two elder brothers and one younger sister, Mr Jaffri said.

“Family has requested to send the body back to Karachi,” Mr Jaffri said.

“I have requested to Consul General to take care of this matter and offered any assistance from Pakistan Association of Australia.”

“You can only just imagine somebody fighting for their life to get out of the car – that’s what the inside damage of the car looked like,” Detective Inspector Chris Laird said as he described the horrific scene on Wednesday.

Police said the man called emergency services just before 6.30am after he became trapped in floodwaters on Cattai Ridge Road in Glenorie.

He managed to stay on the phone to Triple-0 for nearly 40 minutes until the connection was lost.

His vehicle was later found just after 1pm with his body inside.

Inspector Laird said the 25-year-old man was on the first day of a new contracting job.

“We can only speculate that he may have not known the area as locals would … he may not have seen the water as he drove in given the fact that the gates across the road were completely submerged,” he told reporters.

“Sadly, in hindsight we can always say never drive into a swollen road and that will form part of our inquiries.”

Inspector Laird described the man’s death as an “absolute tragedy” and said it was a miracle no one else had been killed in Sydney’s catastrophic floods.

“We can only speculate again that, given what I have seen and the damage to the vehicle, that it could very well be that the electrics totally failed and he was simply unable to escape from the car, which is an absolute tragedy,” he said.

“Also, the fact that he was on the phone for so long is even more tragic and is going to form part of our inquiries as to what actually went on in the car and why this tragic accident occurred.”

Inspector Laird said there were no broken windows and the man “clearly couldn’t get out”.

A report will be prepared for the coroner.

Just hours after telling reporters it was “simply a miracle” there had been no deaths in the wildly destructive floods, Premier Gladys Berejiklian told parliament the state had recorded its first fatality.

“Unfortunately, we have received news of a fatality in the northwest of Sydney flood waters,” she said during question time on Wednesday afternoon.

“Because it’s early stages, I will allow emergency services to comment at the appropriate time to ensure arrangements have been made with next of kin.”

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton also addressed the tragedy in federal parliament.

“It underscores the messages everybody from the NSW Premier, the Prime Minister down have been issuing over recent days, and that is, please, do not enter these floodwaters.”



Scott Morrison expressed his deepest condolences, on behalf of the parliament to the man’s family.

“As the floodwaters recede and the clean-up begins ... their house will be dark and their grief will be great because their loss will not recede,” Mr Morrison said.

“I just pray a blessing on their family.”

He also paid tribute to the NSW police officers who responded to the incident.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese joined the Prime Minister in expressing his regret for “this tragic loss of life”.

“A family has lost a loved one, with no doubt that although the person has not been identified, his friends, his community will be feeling this loss very soon,” Mr Albanese said.

He reiterated that water and cars “don’t mix”, reminding Australians it was better to be delayed than to take risks during the significant weather event lashing the east coast.

Mr Albanese said no more lives being lost over the past few days was a credit to Australians.

The SES has completed almost 1000 flood rescues, and about 24,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes.","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f032833c82e009bdf0c8232b26aa4ae4?width=1280,"['vehicle', 'dies', 'phone', 'services', 'car', 'sydney', 'body', 'road', 'floodwaters', 'glenorie', 'floods', 'man', 'trapped', 'mr', 'mans', 'nsw', 'pakistani']", ,flood
70,70,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Minar-i-Pakistan lawns flooded with water - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1594825,"White Star

LAHORE: The government on Tuesday flooded the Minar-i-Pakistan lawns, the venue of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)’s Dec 13 public meeting, which the opposition termed a ‘failed effort’ to sabotage its power show.

In a related move, the Buzdar administration also rushed to enforce ‘smart lockdown’ in 45 areas of Lahore, including those close to the rally’s venue. The opposition also smells a rat in this move, saying the PTI government is taking every step to stop the opposition from holding the rally here but it will fail.

The government is also taking other measures — registering cases against those taking part in the PDM corner meetings and rallies and warning the caterers to extend their services to the PDM for its rallies — ahead of its (PDM) Dec 13 power show.

The government has not yet given permission to the PDM to hold a rally at Minar-i-Pakistan citing Covid-19 measures.

Ahead of PDM’s Multan rally on Nov 30, the government had adopted similar tactics but the opposition had held the rally on the road.

Learning about the government’s tactics, the PML-N leaders rushed to Minar-i-Pakistan and shut hosepipes.

“The PTI government released water at Minar-i-Pakistan in the early hours of Tuesday. When we learnt about it we rushed there and stopped further watering (by the administration),” PML-N lawmaker from Mohni Road Bilal Yasin told reporters at the venue.

He said Imran Khan had got so upset over Maryam Nawaz’s rallies in the city on Monday that an order was placed to flood the Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday.

“I ask Imran Khan to at least respect his office of the prime minister,” he said.

Commenting upon release of water at PDM’s rally venue, Maryam Nawaz said in a tweet: “This action reflects the fear of Taabedar Khan (obedient Khan) that his government is being sent packing. The Lahore rally will be held and the government be sent home too.”

Special Assistant to CM Punjab for Information Firdous Ashiq Awan clarified that only three to four kanals of Minar-e-Pakistan were watered.

“The way life of plants is connected with water, similarly Rajkumari (Maryam)’s life is connected with lies,” she said in a tweet.

During the last three days the Lahore police registered over 20 FIRs booking over 2,000 PML-N workers and leaders for committing Covid-19 SOPs violation and road block.

PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb, Talal Chaudhry, MNA Malik Riaz and MNA Shizra Mansab are among the PML-N leaders booked.

Maryam Nawaz told reporters at Jati Umra that the FIRs had been registered against over 3,000 PML-N workers which showed how much unnerved the government had been.

The PML-N also held a convention here to mobilise workers for the Dec 13 rally.

Speaking on the occasion, Khwaja Asif said 130 MNAs of the opposition would resign and they could not be stopped from doing so.

“It is a sin to sit in the assemblies which cannot stop corruption and price hike,” he said and added the PTI had realised that these assemblies could not run any more.

Talking to reporters Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Fascist and incompetent Imran Khan is obsessed with persecuting the PML-N leadership, especially Shehbaz Sharif, while the entire nation suffers at the hands of his disastrous rule.”

She said the level of this selected prime minister was that he was threatening the vendors of chairs and tents with FIRs.

Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told Dawn that the government was taking legal action against the PDM for violating Covid-19 SOPs. “We cannot allow the opposition to violate the law,” she said and added if caterers or others provided services to the opposition for holding an assembly of more than 300 people they would also be booked under the law.

71,71,FL-2020-000185-PAK,"In Pakistan, meltwater from glaciers is causing devastating flash floods, and the dwindling of ice-shields affects the entire nation - D+C Development and Cooperation",https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/pakistan-meltwater-glaciers-causing-devastating-flash-floods-and-dwindling-ice-shields,"Flash floods are becoming more common in the Hindu Kush Himalayas. Local communities are most at risk – but glacier melt also affects people who live far away from the mountains.

More than a century ago, a catastrophe struck Barikan Kot. This mountain village was flooded by a sudden outburst of water from the Hinarchi glacier. The reason was the bursting of an ice wall which had held back a lake of meltwater that had formed on the glacier. About 100 families lost their homes and livelihoods as rocks, earth and debris were swept over the village and its orchards and fertile land.

In the past, this kind of flash flood occurred rarely. That has changed. The Bagrote valley in the Karakoram mountain range in northern Pakistan now suffers several of them every year. Global warming is affecting glaciers all over the world, and the Hindu Kush Himalaya is no exception. Especially in the summer months, melting ice leads to new glacial lakes which, in turn, can cause flash floods.

Aisha Khan of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC) – a private organisation working on climate change – warns that glacial lake-outburst floods are becoming ever more likely. “The impacts are catastrophic,” she points out. In recent years, several dozens of people have been killed, and many more families have lost their livelihoods. The local communities tend to be disadvantaged and poor. According to Aisha Khan, the challenge is to tell them in simple language why the environment is changing and what they can do to adapt.

The civil-society activist insists that women in particular must be prepared to respond appropriately. They have a crucial role to play in evacuation, first aid and rescue and relief operations, Aisha Khan says. She wants all risk-management measures to reflect both the social conditions in the village and the scientific insights.

Syed Zahid Hussain Shah agrees that the risks are increasing and must be controlled. He was the field manager of a project run by the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan office of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) that served this purpose from 2011 to 2016. He reports that the Hinarchi glacier is only 16 kilometres long today. It was about 12 % longer 30 years ago, and its ice-shield was higher too.

Pakistan has more than 7,000 glaciers. According to an estimate, there are more than 3,000 glacial lakes, of which 36 are dangerous. Some 7 million people are exposed to the risk of glacial lake-outburst floods, which typically occur in July and August, the warmest months.

The project Zahid worked for took several risk-mitigating initiatives in Bagrote valley. A bridge and protective walls were built. Moreover, streams were excavated and made deeper, so they can carry more water. The project set up four digitised weather stations that automatically relay information pertaining to possible glacial lake outbursts. Thanks to them, it has become possible to warn local communities early on.

The weather stations have helped to save many lives. Hussain Ali, who lives in a mountain village, appreciates them: “Early warning allows people to shift to safer places.” Nonetheless, he says that flash floods have killed more than 20 people in his area in recent years. Moreover, such extreme weather events have killed livestock and destroyed orchards and fields. Several dozen households were therefore forced to move from the mountain villages down into the valley, where it is easier, but nonetheless still quite difficult to eke out a living for people who have lost all assets.

The government of Pakistan and UNDP are now running a follow-up project in the region. It is called the “Scaling-up of GLOF risk reduction in Northern Pakistan (GLOF-II)” project. GLOF stands for glacial lake-outburst flood. The budget for the years 2017 to 2021 is $ 37 million. The project will cover 15 districts and benefit approximately 29 million people.

The mountain regions of Pakistan’s neighbouring countries Afghanistan, India and China face the same kind of risk for the same reasons. Irfan Tariq, a former director general of Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change, points out that “the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan mountain range is a very sensitive ecological system”. It is very difficult to control or limit the impacts of climate change on glaciers, he says, so Pakistan’s government is closely monitoring the glaciers.



The big picture

The melting of the glaciers has impacts far beyond the mountain ranges. Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas feed Asia’s most important rivers, including the Indus, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtse. Hundreds of millions of people depend on these waters. Indeed, Asian civilisations have benefited from the glaciers stabilising water supply throughout the seasons for millennia (see Sheila Mysorekar in the Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-Paper 2017/09). As the glaciers dwindle, human-built infrastructure will have to serve the functions the glaciers performed naturally in the past.

In this context, dams matter very much. Related infrastructure is vulnerable to glacial lake-outburst floods however. Should a major glacial lake outburst cause a veritable mountain tsunami, the damage may be serious. Syed Mehr Ali Shah from Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources says: “We are very much concerned with the bigger glacial lake-outburst flood events, with regards to the safety of our existing hydraulic infrastructures, which include Tarbela dam.” This dam is more than 140 metres high and serves the purposes of hydropower, irrigation and flood control.

There are several major dams in northern Pakistan, and a new one is currently being built. The wall of Diamer Bhasha dam will be more than 250 metres high. The safety of these structures is very important, says Mehr: “We need to protect them from any kind of dam-break phenomenon.” The officer expresses his confidence in the structures being strong enough to withstand typical glacial lake-outburst floods. He says the Diamer Bhasha reservoir has been designed to bear any dam-break wave that occurs due to such flood. At the same time, spillways ensure that excess water can be channelled away.

But even if dams can be built to withstand flash floods, mega dams cause environmental problems in their own right. Experts warn, moreover, that ever more sophisticated and expensive infrastructure will be needed to adapt societies to global warning. If environmental change spins out of control, adaptation will prove impossible for ever more people.

Ultimately, there is no alternative to mitigating climate change. Pakistan, however, only emits about one ton of carbon per head and year, according to Climate Analytics, an independent monitoring initiative. This comparatively small figure means that other countries which emit far more must assume responsibility and assist countries like Pakistan to build their resilience to climate change.

72,72,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Heavy rains lash Pakistan; 13 more killed - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/pakistan/heavy-rainfall-flood-ndma-punjab-6579239/,"A labourer carries sack of onion while wades through a flooded area after heavy rainfall in Lahore, Pakistan, Thursday, Aug. 20, 2020. (AP)

Incessant rains lashed Pakistan on Tuesday, killing 13 more people while the water level increased in the rivers across the country, creating a flood-like situation.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported widespread rains across the country while the Met Office forecast showed more downpour in the next 24 hours.

The NDMA data showed that 13 more people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 176 since June 15 when the monsoon season started in the country. Another 101 have been injured.

So far 72 people have been killed in Sindh, 48 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 19 in Balochistan, 16 in Punjab, 11 in Gilgit-Baltistan region and 10 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, according to the NDMA data.

The NDMA reported that 1,307 houses were fully damaged due to rains, floods and landslides while another 853 were partially damaged. The rescue and relief activities were going on and the Army troops were helping the civilian administration.

Due to the unremitting rain for the past several days, water swelled in rivers, creating a low flood like situation.

“River Indus at Taunsa is in medium flood level. River Indus at Guddu Sukkur and River Chenab at Trimmu are in low flood level. All other major rivers are at below low flood level,” reported the NDMA.

The situation in Karachi remained volatile as the mega city of over 20 million people faced the worst urban flooding in its recent history. TV footage showed all major areas inundated and efforts have been going on to pump the water out of low-lying areas.

Several posh areas like Defence Housing Authority and Clifton also could not escape flooding. The Army and civil administration are working to restore the civic network.

The Meteorological Office of the country in its forecast warned of more rains.

“Widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Kabul and Indus along with Peshawar and Rawalpindi divisions,” it said.

“Scattered wind-thunderstorm/rain with isolated heavy fall is expected over the upper catchments of rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej,” it said, adding that rain was also expected in Bannu, Kohat, Dera Ismail Khan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan administrative divisions.

However, on the positive note, the Met Office said that the “rainfall activity is likely to decrease significantly from 5 September”.

NASA also rated the month as the ninth warmest April on record. In both NOAA and NASA data, April 2021 came in as the coolest April since 2013. The relative coolness of April was partially the result of a dissipating La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific: Its cool waters helped depress global surface temperatures. April 2021 was Europe’s coolest April since 2003, according to the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.



The year-to-date period January-April ranked as Earth’s eighth warmest such period on record, falling behind 2010 as well as the six years of extreme warmth from 2015 to 2020. According to NCEI’s annual temperature outlook, the year 2021 is virtually certain to rank among the 10 warmest years on record, and 95% likely to fall in the range of fourth- to ninth-warmest on record. The NCEI outlook finds that 2021 has a less than 1% chance of becoming the warmest year on record, reflecting the modest cooling influence of the La Niña event in the Eastern Pacific at the beginning of 2021.

Figure 1. Departure of temperature from average for April 2021, the ninth-warmest April for the globe since record keeping began in 1880. Record-warm April temperatures were limited to parts of southern South America, southern Africa, and the Middle East, as well as small parts of the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic oceans. No portion of the globe was record-cold. (Image credit: NOAA/NCEI)

Global ocean temperatures during April 2021 were the 8th-warmest on record, and global land temperatures were the 12th-warmest on record. Global satellite-measured temperatures in April 2021 for the lowest eight kilometers of the atmosphere were the 20th-warmest in the 43-year record, according to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

April 2021: above-average for warmth, dryness in U.S.

The U.S. experienced above-average warmth in April, with the month ranking in the top third for warmth since records began in 1895, according to NOAA. California, Arizona, and Maine experienced a top-10 warmest April. The year-to-date period January-April ranked in the top 22% for warmth, historically.



April 2021 precipitation over the contiguous U.S. was the 14th-lowest on record, with California, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho recording a top-10 driest April. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, approximately 48% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought on May 8. This ties 2021 with 2013 for the highest drought coverage in early May since the Drought Monitor was established in 2000.



The 12-month period ending April 2021 was the driest on record for Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico, and second-driest for California and Utah. The latest seasonal drought forecast from NOAA, issued April 15, calls for drought to creep eastward into the Plains and expand northward though most of the Pacific Northwest by the end of July. Drought conditions in the U.S. had already cost at least $1 billion by the end of April, according to insurance broker Aon.

Four billion-dollar weather disasters in April; 11 so far in 2021

Four billion-dollar weather disasters affected Earth in April 2021, according to insurance broker Aon: a severe weather outbreak in the U.S., an April freeze in Europe that did heavy damage to agriculture, and droughts in the U.S. and in Mexico. Through the end of April, Earth had experienced 11 billion-dollar weather disasters, Aon reported. They tabulated a record 50 billion-dollar weather disasters during all of 2020. Below are the details on April’s disasters.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #1: Record-breaking warmth affected much of Europe in late March, promoting an early bud-out and flowering of plants. Jersey, Guernsey, Germany, Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Belgium all set records for hottest temperature ever measured in March. Unfortunately, the warm spell was followed by record-breaking cold during the first half of April. Numerous locations had record April lows, and freezing temperatures caused significant damage to flowering fruit trees, viticulture and other vegetation. Damage was estimated at over $5 billion, with France alone suffering $2.4 billion in damage. Damage was also heavy in Italy.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #2: A severe weather outbreak across the Plains on April 27-30 featured damaging tornadoes, strong straight-line winds, and large hail. Total damage was estimated at $1 billion, but there were no fatalities. Most of the damage was due to major hail storms on April 28 that affected San Antonio, TX; Fort Worth, TX; and Norman, OK. Above: Infrared satellite image of supercell thunderstorms over Texas and Oklahoma near sunset on April 28. (Image credit: NOAA)

April billion-dollar weather disaster #3: One of the most widespread and intense droughts in western U.S. history had already caused at least $1 billion in damages by the end of April, Aon estimated.

April billion-dollar weather disaster #4: According to NASA, “Mexico is experiencing one of its most widespread and intense droughts in decades. Nearly 85 percent of the country is facing drought conditions as of April 15, 2021. Large reservoirs across the country are standing at exceptionally low levels, straining water resources for drinking, farming, and irrigation. The mayor of Mexico City called it the worst drought in 30 years for the city, which is home to about 9 million people.” By the end of April, Aon estimated the year-to-date costs of Mexico’s drought at $1 billion.

Deadliest weather disaster of 2021: Cyclone Seroja

The deadliest weather disaster so far in 2021 has been Cyclone Seroja, which triggered flash flooding and massive landslides as it wandered slowly over southeastern Indonesia and Timor-Leste as a tropical depression and tropical storm on April 3-5, before making landfall in West Australia as a category 1 storm on April 11. Seroja killed 230 in Indonesia, 42 in Timor-Leste, and one in Australia. Total damage was estimated at $625 million; $240 million of the total occurred in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province.

Seroja’s total death toll of 273 makes it the fourth-deadliest tropical cyclone on record in the Australian region. (Thanks go to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s Jeff Callaghan for helping assemble the list below.)

La Niña ends

The moderate La Niña event that began in the summer of 2020 ended in April 2021, said NOAA in its May 13 monthly discussion of the state of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, which uses a more stringent threshold than NOAA for defining La Niña, reported that the 2020-2021 La Niña event ended in March.

Over the past month, sea surface temperatures in the benchmark Niño 3.4 region of the eastern tropical Pacific (5°N-5°S, 170°W-120°W) have averaged about 0.1 degrees Celsius below average, falling in the “neutral” range. The range for “weak” La Niña conditions is 0.5-1.0 degrees Celsius below average.

Forecasters at NOAA and at Columbia University’s International Research Institute for Climate and Society expect La Niña conditions to remain “neutral” during the northern summer of June-July-August (67% chance). The forecast for the fall (September-October-November) is for a 49% chance of La Niña, 43% chance of ENSO-neutral, and an 8% chance of El Niño, with the odds of La Niña rising above 50% from late autumn into winter. Historically, about half of all La Niña events have continued into or re-emerged during a second year.

Arctic sea ice: sixth-lowest April extent on record

Arctic sea ice extent during April 2021 was the sixth-lowest in the 43-year satellite record, remaining below the tenth percentile range throughout April, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. There was little change in the age distribution of the ice compared to last year; at the end of the ice growth season in mid-March, 73.3% of the Arctic Ocean domain was covered by first-year ice, while 3.5% was covered by ice 4+ years old. In March 1985, near the beginning of the ice age record, there was nearly equal amounts of first-year ice (39%) and 4+ year-old ice (30.6%).



Antarctic sea ice extent during April was above average during the beginning of the month, and close to average by the end of the month.

Hundreds of homes have been damaged or swept away. The army has joined relief and rescue operations across Pakistan, which has been hard hit by rains this summer.

Key roads that have been blocked by large rocks dislodged in mudslides are being cleared, according to Taimur Khan, spokesman for the disaster management agency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Before Thursday's updated death toll, the province had said 15 died in the floods.

Overall, about 200 people have been killed in rain-related incidents since July, when monsoon rains began lashing many areas in Pakistan. According to government officials, 101 have died in rain-related incidents in southern Sindh province, which includes the country's financial hub of Karachi.

Every year, many cities in Pakistan struggle to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about poor planning.

76,76,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest - Nikkei Asian Review,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Asia-Insight/Flooded-Asia-Climate-change-hits-region-the-hardest,"TOKYO -- A long-standing prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, an astounding one-third of the country was underwater.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organization CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of East, Southeast, and South Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India. Millions have been displaced, and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75% of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal Southeast Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paints a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300 million people live in places where climate-triggered flooding will likely occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the high-risk population globally in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K. Jha, with the World Bank's Urban and Disaster Risk Management program in East Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7 million people have been evacuated and an estimated 63 million impacted in 2020. A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in South Asia, 17 million people have been affected this year and it's likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

And while numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. And parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modeling have improved so that scientists with increasing confidence are able to estimate how much particular weather-related events are either influenced by, or have their impacts altered, by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the U.S. in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15% to 19% higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable... water cycle,"" said Oxford's Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation -- cutting greenhouse emissions -- to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it's likely historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises -- both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said the World Bank's Jha. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as "" a big problem,"" he added. And making it worse, he said, is it mostly occurs in small- and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities saw 200 million more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia, and India that are seeing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people -- and infrastructure -- in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean Program ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves -- which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland -- are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses, something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision-makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River -- which has one of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes, and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Therefore, Jha would be like to see a shift from what he calls ""gray infrastructure,"" meaning dams, canals, and large-scale water management, to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems like flood plains, wetlands, and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on gray infrastructure,"" Jha said. ""That's part of the solution, but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and gray infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous, and increasingly wealthy, continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building gray and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800 billion by between now and 2030 -- but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25 billion in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says up to 12% to 20% of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a 73 trillion won ($63 billion) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonization in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

And while that is a good start, Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said.","Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F5%252F7%252F3%252F1%252F29671375-1-eng-GB%252F20201006-AI-Historic-floods-img-Main.png?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['hits', 'infrastructure', 'climate', 'global', 'change', 'flooded', 'water', 'flooding', 'asia', 'floods', 'region', 'flood', 'river', 'hardest', 'risk']", ,none
77,77,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Sydney flood death: another man rescued day before in same place - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/25/sydney-flood-death-another-man-rescued-day-before-in-same-place,"Another driver was rescued from flood waters near Cattai Creek in Sydney’s north-west, a day before a 25-year-old man died when he became trapped in his car at the same location.

A local resident, who did not want to be named to protect his privacy, told the Guardian that he had pulled a young driver from the same location on Tuesday.

He had been moving his farming equipment on Tuesday morning when his father told him that someone appeared to be stuck in flood waters near their property on Cattai Ridge Road, close to Cattai Creek.

When they went to check it out, they saw “a young man trapped inside his car with approximately 300ml of air space left”.

“The car interior was almost full with water.”

The man used his bobcat to tow the car out of the water “with the young man visibly shaken”.

When police arrived, the resident said officers told him that the p-plate driver had been on the phone with them for “at least 45 minutes”.

The 25-year-old Pakistani national who died at the location on Wednesday morning had been on the phone with emergency services for more than 40 minutes before contact was lost.

NSW police Det Insp Chris Laird suggested his hire car’s electrical system may have failed, preventing him from escaping.

“The triple zero operator did continue to maintain contact with the 25-year-old male as he was in the car. However, at 7.04am, it’s believed contact was lost with the male. Police arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to find the car.”

Police said the man was driving a new car – a Toyota Camry – and it was unclear why he could not escape in time.

Laird said the flood gate blocking the road and signage was 10 metres underwater when they found his body.

“The actual gate blocking the road was underwater by 10 metres,” Det Insp Chris Laird said at a press conference on Wednesday.

“Given the unprecedented water levels, the gates could not be seen from the roadway at all. What has happened is a complete tragedy.”

The local resident questioned why the road had not been closed or proper signage installed to prevent other drivers making the same mistake.

“This tragedy could have been avoided had the roads been properly closed or manned. In addition, existing flood gates should be positioned above the one-in-100-year flood line.”

He also said that the very shape of the road, which dips into a valley and has many sudden turns, made it extremely dangerous during floods.

“Part of the problem was that the flood gate that closes the road was submerged under the flood waters and, upon approaching the sharp bend, there was no way for a driver to realise there was water across the road, especially in the dark early hours of the morning.”

He said that there was a barricade installed before the bend, but that when the man died there on Wednesday, the lights were not working.

“There was a part barricade 1km beforehand, but the lights were not working. The flashing lights have since been installed on Wednesday and are now working correctly.”

Police have not provided a response after being reached for comment.

Emergency services across Australia have been urging people never to drive through flood water, after another man was found dead in flood waters in the Gold Coast hinterland.

The NSW State Emergency Service has received more than 11,000 calls for assistance during the floods, including 976 rescues.

It rescued a total of 62 people on Wednesday and a total of 994 since the weather event began. More than 1,600 rescue teams have been activated across the state and more than 1,500 volunteers are currently in the field.","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/969cd513598d77df59155cdb2b6c46022f4de0df/0_360_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4f7dff4f8d12d62c805a3bb2f77edf1b,"['resident', 'place', 'driver', 'sydney', 'car', 'water', 'road', 'young', 'waters', 'flood', 'rescued', 'told', 'man', 'death', 'day']", ,none
78,78,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Karachi business grapples with the aftermath of flooding - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1576950,"KARACHI: As the water level receded, business and industry struggled to restore normalcy around the mega city. Fuel pumps ran dry, telecom towers fell out of service and many ATM machines were either not functioning or empty of cash.

Those few pumps where fuel was available were mobbed by motorbikes and cars as well as scores of people holding jerry cans to carry fuel for generators as the city-wide power outage extended beyond 24 hours.

People thronged to supermarkets and corner shops to replenish food stocks, only to find them shut or flooded, and in some cases, the large sections of the artificial ceilings had fallen in as rain water seeped through the roof.

“Fuel supplies at the terminals in Keamari are ample” an executive from a large oil marketing company told Dawn early on Friday. “But before we can start sending out tankers to replenish supplies at retail outlets, we have to test the fuel that is already there to determine whether or not it has been contaminated with flood water. If it has then the underground storage tank needs to first be emptied out before more fuel is poured into it.”

The process could take days but the executive told Dawn that fuel deliveries from the Keamari terminals to some outlets, where underground tanks were not contaminated, had begun by Friday evening and would continue overnight.

ATMs out of cash, fuel pumps dry, telecom service down

“The situation should substantially normalise by Saturday morning.”

The prolonged power outage also impacted many other services. Aisha Sarwari, spokesperson for Jazz told Dawn that “largely due to infrastructural challenges and power outages in Karachi, network disruptions are hard to contain, especially when the damage is this large-scale.”

She said knock on effects occur following prolonged power outages once the back up generators that power telecom towers start running out of fuel. Nobody from the telecom sector was willing to give an estimate for how long it will take to restore normal service, but most said it could take ‘a few working days’.

Many ATMs around the city were also not functional when people ventured out after the deluge. “ATMs work primarily on communication networks, availability of electricity and whether staff can reach the locations to replenish the cash” says Ali Habib, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer at HBL.

He said his bank was able to ensure that “at least 55 per cent of our network across the city was functional” on Friday morning.

The inundation triggered the power outages and brought movement around the city to a halt, which in turn had knock on effects on communication, banking services and fuel supply across the city. It was late into the day on Friday when normalcy began to return to the life of the city as the weekend began.

Meanwhile, the city’s utility took to social media middle of the day on Friday to say that “close to 80 per cent feeders are powered up”.

“Many parts of Defence, Clifton, Bahadurabad continue to remain submerged and our substations are also badly affected in these areas due to waterlogging,” the statement said.

By Friday night, reports of power being restored were being received from a growing number of localities around the city.

By Arif Hasan

Before 27 August, this monsoon season had brought much less rainfall to Karachi than on previous occasions. Yet, streets turned into rivers, cars and homes were washed away, and over 30 people drowned or were electrocuted.

However, on 27 August we had more rainfall in one day than the past 92 years. Entire settlements were washed out. This has raised two questions. One, despite a lower volume of rainfall, why has Karachi been devastated? And two, was the heavy rainfall of 27 August linked to climate change?

Vast population increase and lack of investment in sewers

Karachi’s storm water drains connect to two seasonal rivers, the Lyari and the Malir. Both rise in the foothills of the Kirthar range and run parallel to each other, 14-20 kilometres apart. Fifty-eight storm water drains (nalas) carry water from their catchment areas to these two rivers. Over 600 smaller drains feed into these nalas.

Before independence in 1947, Karachi’s population was only 450,000; it is now over 15 million. The city’s sewage system mostly consisted of underground earthenware pipes, and sewage biologically treated at the gutter baghicha (gutter garden).

The treated effluent was used for growing vegetables, flowers for religious ceremonies and fruit trees. The gutter garden covered just over 1,000 acres (404.7 hectares).

With Partition and the arrival of around 800,000 migrants from India and the rest of Pakistan between 1947 and 1951, the city was forced to expand. Formal and informal sectors developed far away from the gutter garden.

The Greater Karachi Resettlement Plan of 1958 created two satellite towns some 20 kilometres from Karachi. Sewage treatment plants were planned for but never constructed and their sewage flowed (and still flows) into the sea and/or the nalas.

Informal settlements and informal drains

Due to lack of housing, informal settlements developed along the nalas – into where sewage was discharged. After the mid-1960s formal sectors also began using nalas for disposal. Sludge from sewage clogged the nalas and their tributaries, and during the heavy rains of 1978-79, much of the housing along the nalas was washed away.

After that, informal settlement residents started to informally purchase solid waste from the municipal authorities and compact it along the nala edges to secure them and to create land for their homes. Nala widths decreased substantially from 20-40 meters to less than ten, and four to five metres in some places.

Deterioration of the nalas

Spatially, Karachi is a large city with only two landfill sites, both over 40 kilometres from the eastern edge of the city. Due to the time and costs to get there, garbage increasingly did not reach the landfill sites. Meanwhile, a recycling industry developed, mostly in the informal sector.

Contractors pay the Karachi Metropolitan Cooperation (KMC) officials not to collect the garbage so that recyclable material can be picked from it. The non-recyclable material is then thrown into the nalas or at various informal dumping sites along the natural drainage systems.

By the mid-1990s, most of the nalas were full of compacted solid waste. And to this day children play cricket and football on some of them.

Building over the nalas

With Karachi’s development plans stalled and space pressures for commercial activity, the local government constructed bazaars over the nalas. Meanwhile, the government of Sindh constructed car parking facilities, offices, and hostels on the nalas, and even part of the registry of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

As space for disposal of solid waste in the nalas reduced over time, solid waste was and is still used for reclaiming land from the sea for both low income and elite housing. Informal developers informally arrange for KMC trucks to deposit their solid waste on the mangrove marshes and hire tractors to compact it.

A major part of Karachi’s most elite settlement – the Defence Society – has been reclaimed from the sea through use of municipal solid waste. In addition, two of Karachi’s major outlets to the sea have been considerably reduced by developing housing for high income groups and a highway. Now, water struggles to flow out into the sea especially during high tides.

Storm water drains

To overcome these problems, in the 1980s and 90s the government of Sindh arranged for old sewage treatment plants to be rehabilitated and new ones constructed along with trunk sewers along the main roads. However, these trunks remain dry because the sewage continues to flow in the storm water drains.

The Orangi Pilot Project Research and Training Institute (OPP-RTI) has long supported communities to develop lane sewers and decided to document the storm water drains. It discovered this problem could only be tackled by cleaning and covering the drains and incrementally building trunks along the nalas. This concept was accepted by the state and is being partially implemented.

Real estate development

But now, another issue has surfaced. In the hilly formations north of the city, massive real estate development is taking place. Much of this development has demolished the geological formations that contained natural drainage channels and water collection depressions.

When it rains, areas south of this region are completely submerged by flood waters. With more developments, the likelihood of flooding will also increase.

Serious institutional issues

The central and provincial governments are controlled by different political parties. They are at constant loggerheads making it impossible for Karachi’s infrastructure problems to be tackled rationally and with sufficient finances. It also makes it impossible to develop a decentralised city government, free from direct provincial control.

Desperate to maintain its vote bank, the federal government brought in the National Disaster Management Authority to de-silt Karachi’s nalas. So far they have removed 30,000 tonnes of solid waste from 42 choking points on three nalas.

However, desilting will once again make the edges of the nalas vulnerable to erosion and destroy an unspecified number of homes – widening just one major nala will require 5,782 houses to be removed.

If the proposal for widening all the nalas to their original width is followed, around 60,000 houses will be affected. So far, a concept for the rehabilitation plan has not been developed even though promised by the government.

Tackling these issues will require a long-term plan for Karachi that is in keeping with the finances available or that can be generated. But this cannot be done without an empowered local government and participation of people living along the nalas.

OPP-RTI’s interaction with those communities found only they knew the points of maximum flooding, the behaviour pattern of the floods and of various smaller drains that had disappeared. But how to bring these communities into the planning and rehabilitation process has not been considered by the government agencies.

Meanwhile, climate change only adds to the urgency of addressing Karachi’s worsening floods.

Two medical teams provided basic outpatient medical services to more than 4,000 patients over the course of a month.

MSF also distributed relief items including kitchen, hygiene and shelter kits to more than 2,500 families affected by the floods in five union councils of Tehsil Johi. Supporting the local authorities, the international emergency humanitarian organization has worked on restoring the main water supply sources and lines that benefit over 60,000 people in different locations. Water treatment tablets have in the meantime been distributed to over 2,000 families in the area.

“Our activities in the flood-affected areas of Sindh are part of MSF’s commitment to support the Pakistani authorities in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters,” MSF country representative in Pakistan Aymen Abdullah said in a statement. “We have also donated medicines to the local authorities to support them in meeting urgent medical needs in the area.

”More than 350 villages in Sindh’s Dadu district were affected by the floods after heavy rainfall in August 2020. Dadu was one of the worst hit areas in the province and its population of over 240,000 were declared calamity-affected by the provincial government. While the floods damaged the houses, roads were also washed away thereby further limiting people’s access to healthcare facilities.

“The post-flood period is critical as there is a high risk of outbreaks of vector-borne and water-borne diseases such as malaria. The objective of our mobile clinics was to improve people’s access to healthcare by providing them with basic care at their doorstep and reduce the risk of disease outbreaks. We treated patients with acute respiratory diseases, skin infections, malaria and other illnesses,” said Anna Cilliers, MSF medical coordinator.

MSF is also supporting Sindh’s department of health in an awareness campaign on dengue fever. The cases of dengue fever in Karachi increased recently, and 12 union councils of East and South Karachi were declared hotspots.

81,81,FL-2020-000185-PAK,"Surging glacier creates lake, floods Pakistan valley - DAWN.com",https://www.dawn.com/news/1563034,"Danger of another flood as water continues to flow from the lake in Hunza valley in northern Pakistan.

""A loud rumble echoed and water started trickling down with soil and rocks. Villagers immediately left their homes and fled to safety,"" recounted Manzoor Hussain. Hussain lives in Hassanabad, a village in the Hunza valley high in the Hindu Kush Himalayas in northern Pakistan.

It was siesta time on May 30 when the rumbling started. ""It was not the first time, so people in the village knew what was happening. They were aware of glacial lake outburst floods [GLOFs]. They thought it was a GLOF at the Shishper glacier,"" said Hussain.

In fact, a lake near the Machuhar glacier had burst its banks, causing a flood that submerged farms, the local power plant and part of the Karakoram Highway. Most residents had to sleep in tents afterwards.

Was this a GLOF, where the failure of an unstable natural dam releases meltwater from a glacier? The question is complicated by the Karakoram Anomaly, which describes the advance of glaciers in the region in contrast to the retreat of other glaciers in the Himalayas and globally. Expert opinion is divided.

Zaheer Uddin Babar, the focal person for GLOFs in the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, said, ""We can’t interlink the recent incident with a GLOF. Satellite images received from SUPARCO [Pakistan’s Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission] are not indicating any glacial lake. It may be the water spilled out from a lake on the surface of the Machuhar glacier. The water flow was as low as 3,000 cusecs [cubic feet per second] only."" In some parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayas, water flow after a GLOF has been recorded at around 100,000 cusecs.

The villagers thought the May 30 incident was a GLOF because they had experienced one with a water flow of 7,000 cusecs in 2019, when a 1.5 kilometre-wide lake burst its banks. That time, a large section of the Karakoram Highway, a bridge, two power plants, some offices, over 100 houses, the water supply pumphouse and most farms were submerged.

Shishper is a surging, or advancing, glacier. It formed around the beginning of the twentieth century, when what was then the Hassanabad glacier in the north of the Hunza valley split into two. Machuhar is the other glacier formed by this split. Like the overwhelming majority of glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, Machuhar is receding due to the warming caused by climate change. There are over 15,000 glaciers in this tallest and youngest mountain range of the world, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar. The number keeps changing as receding glaciers split into two or more.

The surge of one glacier while its neighbour melts is creating a strange situation. Babar said Shishper has been surging quickly; it moved forward two kilometres in 2018-19, though there has been no indication of a surge since November 2019. But the earlier surge blocked the drainage route of the Machuhar glacier. As a result, a lake has formed at the snout, or mouth, of the Machuhar glacier, and is getting bigger as climate change gathers pace and the rate of melt increases.

Blocking the water flowing down from the Machuhar glacier also means blocking this water supply to the Hunza River, a tributary of the transboundary Indus River.

There are other glacier pairs in the same situation. Zahid Hussain, a field manager in a GLOF project, said, ""Yune glacier in Bagrot valley is also extending and it has already blocked the waters of Gurgo glacier. A huge cavity has opened up on the hillside, at the intersection of the two glaciers. There is a lake forming, which can burst its banks and can create a disaster any time.""

Muhammad Riaz, director-general of Pakistan Meteorological Department, told The Third Pole, ""There are more than 3,000 glacial lakes in the Karakoram ranges and 34-36 of them have been declared to be of high GLOF potential.""

The danger of a surging glacier

""But the glacier surge is a larger menace than GLOF,"" said Sher Mohammad, a glacier specialist at the regional International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, with its headquarters in Kathmandu. ""There are more than 200 glaciers identified in the Karakoram range with surging or surge-like history and these glaciers cover more than 40% (7,700 square kilometres) of the total glacier area in the Karakoram.""

""The exact reason for some glaciers surging in the Karakoram is still unclear,"" he added. ""It has no linear correlation with snowfall anomalies and thermal changes. However, extreme weather and climate change probably affect surges and surge dynamics, such as intensification, enhance melting, creating crevasses on glacier surfaces and changing the glacier volume.""

Asif Khan, an expert on climate change and an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said, ""Surging is a short-lived event, when a glacier moves 10 to 100 times faster than its normal velocity.""

Mohammad said the flooding on May 30 was probably triggered by a rise in temperature, causing significant glacier melt and increasing the size of the lake. Meteorological data shows a significant temperature rise in the Hunza area in late May. In the first half of June, water was still flowing down the hillside and being blocked by debris, posing a potential risk of another flood.

Shaukat Ali, a climate expert at the Islamabad-based Global Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), said, ""Surge is a phenomenon that can also be caused by extreme events of precipitation. The Karakoram Anomaly may cause surging and advancing of the Shishper glacier. Our research at GCISC shows that Gupis, Drosh, Chitral and Gilgit are the future hotspots of the highest increase in average temperature in the 21st century.""

Ali pointed out that this could lead to significant changes in future water availability in Pakistan, which is dependent almost totally on the Indus basin for irrigation and other uses. Pakistan’s agriculture sector contributes around 22% of Pakistan’s GDP, and over 45% of the country’s workforce is engaged in agriculture, directly or indirectly.

A higher glacier melting rate can also trigger GLOFs and floods downstream, leading to more infrastructure and economic losses, Ali added.

It does not always rain in Karachi during the monsoon. When it does, it floods. It was worse this year, with a three-day spell of heavy rainfall in late August leading to least 47 deaths due to drowning, electrocution, as well as house and wall collapses. Twenty districts of Sindh have been declared “calamity affected”. Personnel from the armed forces have been called out to rescue stranded people, distribute food and medical aid.

Many parts of Karachi went without electricity for 50 hours, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to ask, “What kind of service is this?”. Internet and cell phone networks were disrupted all over Pakistan’s largest city.

Women, children and the elderly waded through waist-deep sewage to reach rescue boats as rain continued to pelt down; the boats had to navigate around floating furniture, submerged cars, motorcycles, and even shipping crates pushed around by the force of the floodwater.

The meteorological department totalled August rainfall in Karachi at 484 mm (19 inches), with the highest daily rainfall of 130 mm at PAF Faisal Base on August 28.

“Last year, through the three monsoon months, the PAF Faisal Base recorded a total of 345 mm of rains; this year in just two months, over 600 mm rain has been recorded there,” Sardar Sarfaraz, the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s Karachi head told The Third Pole.

“The rains are unprecedented; and in all likelihood, this seems like an erratic event, with the last such intense rain recorded in 1931,” said Sarfaraz. “I cannot say with finality that this rainfall can definitively be attributed to climate change.”

“Due to the effect of global warming on the hydrological cycle, we will see a continued intensification of monsoons in the coming years,” predicted climate expert Imran Khalid, who heads the Environment and Climate Change section of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Development Policy Institute.

Where will the water go?

Khalid wondered, though, if Karachi would have been any better off if there was no climate change? According to him, Karachi’s woes have their roots in poor governance and planning.

“By encroaching and blocking the streams that form the natural watershed, over many decades, the authorities have set us up to fail,” he pointed out, terming the flood footage on television a manifestation of “decades of apathy and ignorance about the laws of nature”.

“If you block the flow of water, it will go around you; if it can’t go around you, it will continue to rise until it envelopes you.” The crises were “of our own making”, Khalid added, emphasising the need to incorporate laws of nature into urban planning.

Karachi has over 550 big and small storm water drains. “But over the years, some as wide as 200 feet have narrowed down to just 30 feet today, due to unauthorised construction,” admitted Karachi’s outgoing mayor Waseem Akhtar, head of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC). As he left office on August 30, he said, “Karachi is for everyone but nobody is for Karachi.”

Going about town to inspect the damage, Chief Minister Shah chided people for “building houses in the belly of the Malir river”, according to media reports. “The entire city is sinking because of your encroachments,” he reportedly said.

Noman Ahmed, dean of Architecture and Management Sciences department at Karachi’s NED University, said some encroachments happened in connivance with different government agencies, while some were “organic”.

“For example, the encroachments on Gujjar Nala was facilitated by the KMC functionaries by providing inappropriate leases,” on its edges, in areas that were not supposed to be inhabited in the first place.

“The alignment of the nalas [drains] have clearly been demarcated in all land use plans available with the different civic agencies,” said Ahmed, and therefore selling plots of land was nothing less than a “criminal act”.

He would not blame those who had bought the plots. Ahmed felt people had started building on the dry bed of Gujjar Nala because for decades there was nothing more than a thin stream. “They occupied the land without knowing how vulnerable they were to sudden inundation, and this is what happened in recent rains.”

Architect and heritage consultant Marvi Mazhar also termed “unplanned and unregulated growth, lack of monitoring and corruption” as major reasons for the havoc the rains wrought on the city of 16 million that had been heavily “concretised, with not enough soft ground left for water to be absorbed”.

The problem has persisted despite court judgments, including an order from the country’s chief justice that all illegal construction be removed from Karachi — whether on or off the drains.

Terming removal of encroachments “a very tricky affair”, Ahmed said very often debris left behind by a demolition crew caused more obstruction to water flow than the original buildings had done.

What is to be done?

“These drains can actually be added into beautification plans with plantations on either side, and run across the city like in Amsterdam,” said Mazhar. Instead, she said, they are seen and treated as an eyesore with garbage thrown alongside them, which invariably slips into the drain thereby choking it. She held both residents and the government responsible for the indifference shown towards Karachi’s garbage.

Now Prime Minister Imran Khan has said he wants a “permanent solution” to problems associated with drains, the sewage system and water supply.

Ahmed said the government should come up with a “comprehensive policy for not just all the drains but other waterways and spaces where water accumulates. Just working on a piecemeal basis will not get the desired results.”

He also pointed out that those evicted in this process must be rehabilitated. “The Sindh government has ample land in Karachi’s suburbs. If done in a step by step manner, not everyone will need to be evicted at one go or at least till the re-demarcation of the nalas takes place.”

Many residents feel the collapse of municipal services and consequent problems such as the recent flooding is because Karachi has become too unwieldy to be governed. With 19 different land-owning agencies under the three tiers of government — the city government in the hands of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, the provincial government of Pakistan Peoples Party that holds the purse strings and the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf at the centre — the city’s problems only get bounced around and the blame game continues.

Same situation all over South Asia

Substitute the names of the rivers, drains and political parties, and the same story is repeated in varying degrees across all the cities of South Asia — Rawalpindi, Mumbai, Delhi, Patna, Kolkata, Dhaka and on and on. For years, residents have been resigned to the mess and vented their ire on social media. Now they have started coming out on the streets — it happened in Kolkata after weeklong power failures in some suburbs following Cyclone Amphan; and it is happening in Karachi now. Perhaps the fact that the hardships have now spread from slums to tony neighbourhoods has something to do with it. The internet is back now, and the phones are working, but the protests continue. Their effect remains to be seen.

Floods symbolise miseries and destruction and their effects can be felt for a very long time, like wrong decisions by politicians drive nations backward and derail them from the path of progress and growth. I am worried to see the way politics is being played on floods where the governments, at both the federal and provincial levels are fighting on percentage sharing. The federal government represents the state and the state is the mother which has to be looked after by each and every citizen of the land.

I wish and hope that Imran khan should have been more tactful and gracious in working with CM Sindh, and CM Sindh should also have cooperated for the sake of the people of Karachi.

The media teams on both sides fight like kids and it looks as if both sides’ media teams are indulging in competition where they are winning at the cost of the public of Karachi who are already crushed with ethnic and poverty storms.

I hope my observations will be taken positively as Karachi is my city too, where I studied and started my civil service; I know the problems of Karachi.

My appeal to fellow politicians is to stop playing politics on floods and other natural disasters at the cost of your own poor masses.

Floods destroy everything that comes in their way and as a poor nation, we keep looking for support and help from rich countries at the cost of our self-respect.

Is it not the duty of the federal or provincial governments to sit with the map of Pakistan, analyse past destruction of the floods and design ways to channel flood water by creating channels based on surveys and hold this water in dams in all provinces?

We should know who is in the charge of it and which authority can take up with provincial authorities. Let me point out that it is the duty of “water board” which needs to be converted into Water board authority which should be empowered with adequate funding to manage the flood water and river water in such a way that each and every drop of water falls in the sea and every drop is used for agriculture to enhance our agricultural proceeds.

Despite being rich in water resources, we Pakistanis continue to face water scarcity every year because of the inability of authorities to properly use and manage these water resources for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability.

Poor water management is costing our country around 4-5 percent of GDP each year. These costs are caused by the floods and droughts that we face due to poor water supply and sanitation. We are endowed with water yet we do not make the best use of this.

The most alarming thing here is that the water crisis was rated as the biggest risk to Pakistan by the World Economic Forum and the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources. They also warned that the country could “run dry” by 2025.

Half of the annual rainfall in our country occurs in July and August, averaging about 255 millimetres in each of those two months. The remainder of the year has significantly less rain, amounting to about fifty millimetres per month.

This year in August, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall recorded over the last 90 years.

Pakistan receives 145 million-acre feet of water every year. However, only 14m acre-feet of water are preserved and we can meet the shortage if we have proper storage of rainwater and floodwater.

We have rivers and small streams coming from mountains finally meeting at “Sutledge”. The flows and diversions need to be examined scientifically with proper measurements to ensure the use of water for the betterment of local people; it is also important to analyse its miserable effects on the public and crops.

Let every town build a local rain pond which can store all the rainwater which can be used by them later for agricultural and irrigation purposes. Once a storage capacity is built, then a sprinkler irrigation system can be designed and introduced to better store and manage this precious water.

The water can also be converted into clean drinking water by using small plants. This sweet water can be used in multiple ways if properly managed by the local bodies.

We may also let the DC be the Head of a Rainwater Authority to ensure the government’s indulgence and control. It is an extensive but very simple exercise and this should be opted for on a priority.

On one hand, we are facing water scarcity due to floods and poor water management while on the other, we are also facing water terrorism from India as it wants to either just stop/block our share of water with ulterior motives when we need it, or release extra water into our rivers to increase the flow causing floods in Pakistan and we know that both of these are dangerous for Pakistan.

As we are dependent on India for water, Modi, by blocking water, wants to deprive Pakistan of water to convert her into a desert. In fact, Modi is following a full-fledged anti-Pakistan agenda.

India has worked out that the one of the national key quotients is water and hence, India will continue to block water flow from India to Pakistan. PM Modi had already thrown the first water bomb on Pakistan in 2018 by blocking our legitimate natural watercourse. India had completed its construction of Kishanganga hydropower project on the Neelam River by diverting the watercourse through a 16 km tunnel, which is a clear violation of the Indus Water Treaty between the two countries.

The Kishanganga River, upon entering Pakistani territory is recognised as Neelam River that originates from Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and flows through the Gurez Valley to join Jhelum River near Muzaffarabad, at Domail, in Azad Jammu Kashmir. The construction of Kishanganga Dam is also in violation of Article III (4) of the Indus Water Treaty, which places an obligation or restriction on India not to construct any similar projects on western rivers, that is, on Indus, Chenab and Jhelum. Also, the construction of the Kishanganga project will adversely affect the Neelum-Jhelum project, as its power generation capacity will be reduced radically. In accordance with Article III (2) of Indus Water Treaty, India is also prohibited from developing any human made obstructions that shall have or may cause a change in the volume of the natural flow of western rivers.

The project includes a 121 feet tall concrete-face rock-fill dam, which will divert a portion of the river to the south through a 24 km tunnel. The diversion reduced the flow of water into Pakistan by about 11 percent in the summer and about 27 percent in the winter, which would be contrary to the Indus Water Treaty as the western rivers belong to Pakistan. It also contends that the diversion would result in an ecological disaster for the area.

India had signed all the important Conventions that, with complete effect, would ruin our valley totally. It is sad to note that neither our previous government nor the present one ever took this matter seriously whereas the water issue is supposed to be an issue of life and death.

My above suggestions are better in both ways to use the extra water for irrigation. In this way, induction terrorism by India via water flow can be controlled and we can convert this misery into success by irrigating barren land.

We need to bring an enactment/bill or a “rainfall act” to get these activities regulated as a national priority. I am confident that this law will be of great benefit for the nation.

As per many predictions, the next wars will be over sweetwater.

I wish our defence sector takes initiatives to take help of our soldiers to develop these water channels during peacetime with the help of the local public on a volunteer basis.

Let all the provinces and the federation give serious thought to my above proposals.

I will, however, move a bill on “The Flood Control Act” in order to store rainwater throughout the country, fixing the responsibility on concerned authorities.

We have water, all types of minerals, a fertile landscape, the best brains, four seasons, the best beaches, natural gas, green mountains with blue waters and lakes, deserts and forests, but we do not have the command of unity and the skills of governance. We are still slaves of false egos and are masters of self-destruction.

It is time for the leadership to wake up and not flood their national cause and interest. Lead your nation to drive to the valley of love and not hate to protect your future generations.

“National unity Zindabad”.

86,86,FL-2020-000185-PAK,UK pledges support for flood victims in Pakistan - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1578640,"ISLAMABAD: The United Kingdom has decided to provide life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter to over 55,000 vulnerable people in Pakistan to help them recover from devastating floods.

The announcement was made by Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, minister of state for South Asia at the UK’s Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office, during a virtual visit to Pakistan where he also discussed how Britain could work with the Pakistan government to tackle climate change.

According to a statement issued by the National Emergency Operations Centre on Polio, the £800,000 UK aid package will be given through the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) and will provide immediate relief in rural Sindh to the people who have lost their homes.

This comes on top of the UK’s distribution last week of emergency stocks, including hygiene kits and tarpaulins, to over 1,118 families in flood-affected districts of Sindh. The UK will coordinate closely with Pakistani authorities to ensure that aid gets to where it is needed most.

Over 55,000 people will get life-saving drugs, clean water, sanitation and shelter

Lord Ahmad said: “Like everyone in the UK, I have been saddened to see the heart-breaking images of the flooding in Pakistan. The UK stands by Pakistan, ready to help, as entire communities have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.”

He added: “The recent monsoon flooding serves as a stark reminder of how devastating natural disasters can be — and the dangers of climate change. During my first virtual visit to Pakistan as a Minister of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, I also launched a year of climate action from the British High Commission ahead of COP26, which will save lives, create jobs and protect the environment.”

British High Commissioner Christian Turner said: “Following Pakistan’s remarkable success against Covid-19, it is important that we support strengthening systems against the devastating flooding.”

As part of Lord Ahmad’s virtual visit, the UK urged Pakistan to be ambitious and work together on a green recovery from Covid-19 as part of a UK-Pakistan year of climate change action, ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow next year.

Lord Ahmad discussed with the government of Pakistan how Britain can help the country transition to cleaner energy, emphasising that with the UK’s world-leading expertise in this area, it can help Pakistan make the most of opportunities from the rapidly falling cost of renewables.

Lord Ahmad was due to meet Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood to exchange views on bilateral relations and trade ties.

He also visited a UK-funded girls’ education programme in south Punjab.

Britain has committed to ensuring every girl gets 12 years of quality education, and in Pakistan, the UK has supported nearly eight million girls to attend primary and secondary school.

The UK minister also visited the Polio Surveillance Centre, which is also the Covid-19 surveillance centre. He met National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr Rana Safdar who briefed him on Pakistan’s response to Covid-19.

He is scheduled to take part in a roundtable for media freedom, to be attended by notable media figures and digital rights activists in Pakistan to discuss media issues and how to tackle intimidation of female journalists.

87,87,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Flood management - Newspaper - DAWN.COM - DAWN.com - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1568505,"WHAT happens when other disasters hit during a pandemic? Various parts of the country are already experiencing early monsoon rains. Rain and thunderstorms are expected across Sindh, northern Punjab, KP, Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. The Met department has alerted local authorities to beef up preparedness for urban floods in Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and other cities. The disaster management authorities now face the dilemma of managing flood disasters in the midst of a pandemic.

Last month, the Met department issued a seasonal forecast of above average rainfall during the monsoon season. As much as a 20 per cent increase in rainfall was forecast for Sindh and the Kashmir region for the July to September period. The forecast indicates a higher probability of large-scale flooding in the country.

The frequency and intensity of hazards that develop into disasters has drastically increased over the years. This is the result of a rapidly growing population, urbanisation, climate change and poverty.

In 2010, floods ravaged the valleys of Swat and Nowshera causing death and destruction and resulting in 1,156 casualties in KP alone. As the flood wave slowed in the Indus floodplains of Punjab and Sindh, numerous breaches occurred as embankments succumbed to the might of the waters. A breach at Tori inundated thousands of villages, leaving 411 people dead and 7.2 million badly affected. In all, the 2010 floods cost the country an estimated $10 billion in direct losses.

The authorities will have to rethink their strategies.

Subsequent years (2011-15) provided little reprieve and further exposed the vulnerability of communities and the economy to flooding events. Heavy rains battered the plains of Sindh in 2011, killing hundreds and rendering millions homeless. The year 2014 brought heavy downpours across Kashmir and Punjab. The untamed Chenab inundated thousands of villages in Punjab, killing hundreds. The direct economic losses of the floods since 2010 are more than $19bn, outweighing the combined losses of all past floods since 1947.

Pakistan’s flood management policy has centred on structural interventions to mitigate floods through construction of embankments, and river training structures. Non-structural interventions have made rudimentary progress in early warning systems, which have been riddled with integration, adoption and forecast reliability issues.

The Federal Flood Commission was established to coordinate flood management at a national level. It provides technical and financial support to the provincial irrigation departments. Meanwhile, the NDMA and PDMAs, mandated to “manage the whole Disaster Management Cycle”, have relegated themselves only to the response and relief phase in the case of floods. The disaster management authorities, along with Rescue 1122, the armed forces and district administration provide search and rescue, evacuations and relief. It is no wonder that flood management, which requires clear decision-making on mitigation, preparedness, early warning, communication and response, finds itself lost between different organisations of the centre and provinces.

It is now, during the pandemic, that this ‘annual surprise’ presents its deadliest twist. In case flooding is of an intensity that requires large-scale evacuations from villages, thousands of vulnerable people including the elderly, will be forced to live in closely packed relief shelters.

Relief shelters and camps, usually set up in nearby schools, would need to be expanded to ensure social distancing. Sanitation and hygiene facilities, including provision of masks, soaps and hand sanitisers at such camps would have to be ensured to prevent infection transmission. Similarly, the provision of medical facilities, healthcare supplies for the displaced, and PPE for the camp management would need to be ensured.

Globally, authorities are rethinking disaster evacuation and shelter plans in the face of simultaneous disasters in their respective regions. There are many lessons to learn from Asian countries. During the recent torrential rains and floods in the south-western Kumamoto prefecture in Japan, elderly citizens have shown reluctance in evacuating due to fears of Covid-19 exposure, preferring instead to shelter at home. The authorities prepared cardboard separation walls at evacuation shelters to maintain social distancing, and prevent the unmitigated spread of the coronavirus at temporary shelters.

In another example closer to home, Bang­la­desh authorities expanded the capacity of their shelters before Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall in May. The authorities scrambled to manufacture and distribute masks and hand sanitisers to the millions of evacue­­es, volunteers and officials. The management of Cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh has largely been hailed as a success, based on the low death toll during the super cyclone event.

88,88,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Karachi: flood management and governance - The Express Tribune,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2259093/karachi-flood-management-and-governance,"A new debate has erupted over managing floods in Karachi and the directions of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to clear waste from the drains of Karachi due to heavy rainfall. Acrimonious discussions with a blame game against each other were witnessed on TV talk shows between the representatives of the PTI government, the PPP government in Sindh as well as the MQM.

The PPP sees sinister design behind the move to undermine the authority and image of the Sindh government, portraying it as an example of poor governance. Their contention was that Lahore had also been inundated with floods but neither hue and cry was created nor was FWO sent there. Their argument had been that whatever and wherever something goes wrong, the federal government finds the Sindh government as a punching bag to divert people’s attention from their own failures. Be it the sugar crisis, wheat shortage, fuel shortage, rising food inflation or the postings and transfers, the federal government tries to pass the buck to the Sindh government.

The general public is watching all the melodrama with anguish and anxiety. The intervention of the federal government would have gone unnoticed, had it not been with a political motive, belittling the Sindh government. The federal government and provinces do not work in tight compartments, rather they supplement each other within the contours of the Constitution and law. But, when the Governor of Sindh — instead of acting as a representative of the federal government and constitutional head of the province bound to act on the advice of the Chief Executive of the province — starts issuing statements to browbeat the Chief Minister, then it certainly develops irritation and is not taken in a normal course.

No doubt, Karachi, being a metropolitan city has its own problems, but similar problems also exist in all cities of Pakistan. Karachi being the biggest city and economic hub attracts migrants from all over the country and has expanded in all directions without proper town planning. Therefor the problems of Karachi are of a greater magnitude.

Within the ambit of the Constitution it is the responsibility of the Government of Sindh and the local government to provide civic amenities to their citizens, which of course include waste management, desilting and clearance of drains. Rainfall in Karachi causing floods is not a rare phenomenon, it happens with recurrence. This nature of problem may be described as a calamity, hence falling within the purview of the NDMA. In this context, preparedness is one of the essentials of disaster management followed by prevention, mitigation of sufferings and community awareness. But, unfortunately governments have been found negligent in their preparation to deal with such crises.

Disaster management or crisis management has a direct co-relation with governance. Governance is all about delivery within time and action of all tiers of government in unison to add synergy to their efforts. In such a situation KMC, DHA, Cantonments, Port Qasim Authority, Irrigation Department and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) with a lead role of the provincial government should have set a strategy to deal with such an eventuality.

The Sindh government could have easily managed excavators, dumpers or other machinery available on rent in the market. Roughly the rent of an excavator is not more than Rs500,000 per week. If the funds were not available with the respective departments, the Chief Minister should have set aside the funds from his own discretionary grant or re-appropriated in order to escape criticism.

While the Sindh government has its own share of blame, the NDMA has its own role to play. The authority has its own National Disaster and Risk Management plan. According to the Act and plan, the PDMA and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) are the coordinating units. Therefore, NDMA has to work through those bodies. In such a scenario, NDMA should have shifted all the resources to PDMA and FWO should have also been at the disposal of the provincial government to avoid political point scoring.

Although with a knee-jerk reaction to the malaise symptomatic treatment has been meted out, the main cause has not been removed. This problem has erupted due to massive encroachments in the nullahs, drains, riverbed, poor designing and construction of roads and bridges. This again is a reflection of poor governance. Rule of law is the foundation of governance. We have all kinds of laws but implementation is missing, hence this mess. As the saying goes, “nip the evil in the bud” but the departments assigned to do the task close their eyes to the initial violation and with the passage of time the problem grows such magnitude that all wonder what to do.

Karachi being a port city is now considered to be a city of all. The population of the city is growing at a fast pace, so are the problems. Governments, particularly city governments in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, have been managing well. Why not we? A deeper study of their governance reveals the underlying factor: adherence to the rule of law. It is high time for all stakeholders, including the federal government, to implement the law and remove all encroachments done in violation of the law and set aside funds ahead of the monsoon rains. This is the only way out and a permanent solution. This applies to all cities of Pakistan, including the federal capital.

Rescue and relief efforts by the Pakistan Army continued in Sindh's Dadu district on Sunday after the recent monsoon rains breached the flood protection bund of the Nai Gaj Dam and marooned people residing in surrounding areas.

""Pakistan Army troops [are] busy in relief & rescue efforts in various areas of Dadu to help people affected by recent hill torrent and breach of Flood Protection Bund of Nai Gaj Dam,"" said the ISPR on Sunday.

According to the military's media wing, Pakistan Army's boats are rescuing stranded people and transporting them to ""safer places"". It also said that a medical camp has been established to provide care to the affectees and hot meals were being given to people.

The ISPR also said that rangers and army personnel have rescued more than 100 people from the Johi Tehsil of the district.

Later, the teams of Pakistan Army and Navy visited Dadu, Jhal Magsi along with medical and engineering teams to assist the civil administration to rescue stranded people to safer places.

“Hot meal served to 1,000 stranded people. Jhal Magsi -Gandawah main colonies have been connected,” ISPR said. It added the Pasi bridge has been opened for all kind of traffic.

“In Jhal Magsi all Hindu families struck in Wangu hills have been rescued and moved to safer places after eight hours-long rescue operation,” the ISPR said.

Giving an update on the damage, the ISPR said the N-65 near Bibi Nani bridge and Pinjra Bridge have been blocked due to the high level of water.

“Main gas transmission line damaged near Bibi Nani bridge due to rain, while Quetta - Jacobabad, Gwadar- Karachi and Sibbi- Kohlu have been blocked at various places,” it added.



PDMA dispatches more than 5000 rescue and relief items

Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh said it had dispatched six motorboats and more than 5000 rescue and relief items including tents, mosquito nets, jerrycans, water coolers and kitchen sets to Deputy Commissioner Dadu on Saturday to facilitate those affected by the flash floods in Johi area.

The PDMA also said that it was in continuous contact with the army and navy to initiate air assistance and rescue through helicopters of stranded people.

Rains breach Nai Gaj Dam, surrounding villages flooded

Rescue efforts by the army in Dadu had begun on Saturday after heavy rains breached the Nai Gaj Dam flooding the nearby villages.

The ISPR had said that the recent rains have caused damage to the Nai Gaj Dam, resulting in the breach of the flood protection bund of the dam. It had also said that at least 12 villages of the district were badly affected by the breach.

Earlier this week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had issued a warning that Karachi and lower Sindh can suffer from urban flooding in the days to come, as the fourth looming monsoon spell may wreak more havoc in the province than the earlier three spells.

The institution predicted that the fourth spell of monsoon rain in Karachi, which is forecast from August 7-8, can result in more rain than the previous three spells.

A low lying pressure system, formed in the Bay of Bengal, is expected to enter Sindh on August 6.

""Under the influence of this weather system strong monsoon currents are expected to penetrate in Sindh, South Punjab and Eastern Balochistan from Thursday (evening/night) to Saturday,"" the PMD noted in its latest advisory.

""Widespread rain/wind-thundershowers, with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are expected in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Tharparker, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Tando Allah Yar, Matiyari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Jamshoro, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad from Thursday (evening/night) to Saturday.""","Sun, 09 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2020-08-09/l_698296_030547_updates.jpg,"['nai', 'ispr', 'sindh', 'dadu', 'relief', 'carries', 'pakistan', 'army', 'operation', 'rescue', 'dam', 'stranded', 'district', 'floodstricken', 'gaj']", ,flood
90,90,FL-2020-000185-PAK,"Cheap Chinese tyres flood Pakistani markets, capture big share - ANI News",https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/cheap-chinese-tyres-flood-pakistani-markets-capture-big-share20210406220440,"Karachi [Pakistan], April 6 (ANI): Chinese tyres have captured 85 per cent of the market share in Pakistan which is a substantial 45 per cent increase from two years ago.

According to a report published in Dawn, the takeover of the local market share by a Chinese product is not uncanny and is similar to several Made in China products that have flooded local markets.

Earlier, the Chinese car tyres held 40 per cent of the market share in 2018. The share now has since increased to 85 per cent. ""In the light truck category tyres, China held a share of 30-40 per cent two years ago which has now gone up to 65-70 per cent,"" the report said.

Moreover, Beijing also dominates in truck/bus tyres with over 75 per cent market share which was merely 40 per cent two years back.



""Mushroom growth has been noted in the number of dealers who are regularly flooding the market with Chinese tyres,"" former chairman of the Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) Azim K. Yousufzai told Dawn.

The association leader said the low prices were the main reason for the surging market share of Chinese tyres. They are cheaper than European, Korean, Thai and American tyres.

On the smuggling of tyres, Yousufzai said the illegal arrival of different types of tyres has slowed down drastically owing to strict vigil at the border areas.

""Strict monitoring at the borders has brought down informal arrival of tyres from 50-60 pc to 20pc,"" he claimed.

Over the decrease in sales of Pakistani tyres, the association leader said that the government has reduced the regulatory duty (RD) to 10-20 per cent for various categories of imported tyres which is among the factors encouraging legal imports. (ANI)

1.1. Background

During the current monsoon, Sindh faced seven spells of moderate to heavy rains. These heavy rains affected several districts of Sindh including different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Sanghar, Thatta, Badin, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Tando Muhamamd Khan Jacobabad and Umerkot.

According to Pakistan Meteorological Department Karachi received the heaviest rain in a single day ever in its history when 231 mm rain lashed out in just 12 hours. Maximum rain recorded in millimetres Karachi (Surjani Town 195, Kemari 170, North Karachi 168, Nazimabad 162, Masroor Base 154, Saddar 142, Landhi 126, Airport Old Area 122, University Road & Saadi Town 105, Jinnah Terminal 104, Gulshan-e-Hadid 49) Moen Jo Daro 44, Shaheed Benazirabad 34, Sukkur 15, Larkana 07, Jacobabad 06, Chor and Hyderabad 02. Hub Dam water level crossed 338.5 feet’ after 13 years of history.

During August 2020, only Karachi received 484 mm (19 inches) rain. It is the highest rainfall record over the last 90 years. In recent most 7th spell that started on August 27 and continued, heavy rainfalls are recorded that turns the Karachi and many districts in Shambles. Karachi alone received 223 mm. of rain over 12 hours, and it caused more devastation to Karachi. Rainwater and overflowed water from nullahs and drains flooded most of the main roads and streets in residential locations, a significant number of residential areas including urban slums and villages in peri-urban areas, that gravely disrupted the people’s lives.

The misery of the people increases many folds due to long power outages and gushing flooded water on streets which causes traffic jams, resulted in difficult access for relief or rescue work in affected areas. The inundated roads caused massive traffic jams in Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Sarjani, Sohrab Goth, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, Nagin Chowrangi, Power House Chowrangi, Orangi Town, Haideri, Liaqatabad, Gulshan Iqbal, Hussain Abad, Kareem Abad, Shahrah-e-Faisal, Quaidabad, Malir National Highway, Hassan Squire, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Hadid, Defence, Clifton, Gulberg, Kashmir Colony, Saudabad, Golimar, Rizwia, Patel Para, Pak Colony, Shah Latif Town, Lyari, Sakhi Hassan, Shadman, Anda Mor and other parts of the city.

On 29th August 2020, 6 districts of Karachi are declared as “Calamity hit areas” by the Relief Commissioner - Government Sindh under Sindh National Calamities (P&R) Act 1958. According to RNA the two districts respectively Karachi East and Malir are most affected.

An eight-member official delegation from Islamabad will interact with Indian officials at the 116th Permanent Indus Commission meet during March 23-24 in the first face-to-face formal meeting since the intensification of political tension following India’s decision to change the special status of J&K and the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Pakistan is likely to bring up its concerns related to the two hydroelectric plants over two tributaries of the Chenab river. Indian officials are prepared to allay all worries by supplying all necessary information,” the source said.

At the last meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission meeting in 2018, Pakistan had reportedly raised objections to some design aspects of the 1,000 MW Pakul Dul and 48 MW Lower Kalnai plants, including the height of the reservoir, and water storage and releases that are yet to be sorted out.

As per the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, the eastern rivers of Beas, Sutlej and Ravi are under India’s control, while Pakistan controls the western rivers of Indus, Chenab and Jhelum.

India and Pakistan are also likely to discuss the two new run-of-river hydroelectric plants — Durbuk Shyok (19 MW) and Nimu-Chilling (24 MW) — in Ladakh.

The two sides may also talk about flood data arrangements with the view of the forthcoming flood season, the source added.

The Indus Commission meet, which is supposed to be held annually, got delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political tension caused by the abrogation of Article 370 and the subsequent bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories was also a likely reason for delay.","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/x71po4/article34130994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bl23indiapak,"['officials', 'plants', 'meet', 'pakistan', 'meeting', 'watersharing', 'mw', 'indus', 'hydroelectric', 'discuss', 'likely', 'commission', 'flood', 'india', 'project', 'exchange']", ,flood

ISLAMABAD: A red alert was issued Tuesday by the federal capital's administration over possible flooding caused by rains expected to lash the city this week.



The Islamabad administration said Ghauri Town, Soan Gardens, and Sectors I-8 and I-9 were forecast to be inundated with rainwater following the heavy rains.

It further underlined that the Soan and Korang rivers, as well as the Simly and Rawal dams, near Islamabad and Rawalpindi were expected to flood during the ongoing week

Flooding was also feared to occur in the kutchi abaadis (slums) in Sectors F-9, G-6, G-8, H-9, and I-9, as well as Khanna Pul, Ghauri Town, and Soan, the administration said.

It warned that opening the Simly and Rawal dams' spillways would likely inundate the Soan and Korang rivers and disrupt electricity, water, and sewerage services in the areas.

Cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and Dengue fever were reported in neighborhoods that were still flooded a week after the deluge started, city administration spokesman Ali Sajid said.

Patients with minor to severe symptoms started streaming into the hospitals on August 31, Sajid added.

The situation could worsen in the coming days if immediate measures are not taken, said Dr. Iqbal Memon, a specialist for infectious diseases.

Almost 50 people have so far been killed in the heaviest rains to ever hit the city, Pakistan's disaster management agency said.

Nearly half of the metropolis with around 20 million inhabitants was still inundated, despite heavy machinery deployed by the military and municipal authorities to drain out the water. It could take rescue agencies a few more days to pump out the stagnant water from streets and buildings, Sajid said.

Pakistan's largest charity, Edhi Foundation, also said their ambulances had picked up a large number of patients with water-borne diseases from inundated areas.

""The number [of total cases] today was double as much as on a normal day,"" Edhi's spokesman Mohamed Bilal said.

The problem was severe among children and in neighborhoods where water supply lines are mixed with those for sewerage, Bilal said.

Large Pakistani cities like Karachi have regularly faced inundation during monsoon season in recent years. The record heavy rains this year have aggravated the problem.","Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://gdb.rferl.org/274D88C0-46D1-422F-957A-8260F4529242_w1200_r1.jpg,"['rains', 'sajid', 'city', 'started', 'pakistan', 'waterborne', 'water', 'record', 'severe', 'floods', 'heavy', 'diseases', 'break', 'spokesman']", ,flood

99,99,FL-2020-000185-PAK,Ignored minority peasants crushed by poverty after Sindh floods - DAWN.com,https://www.dawn.com/news/1582827,"Marginalised minorities in rural Sindh have suffered badly in heavy rains this year due to displacement and loss of income.

“Many [government officials] turned-up and wrote down our names, but we weren’t provided relief,” said Ganga, a peasant whose poverty-stricken community in Sindh has been displaced by floods.

Ratol Kohli, an elderly member of her community, too, looked despondently at every passing vehicle. Their grievance is that, while officials jot down the names of displaced people, many have still not been given relief goods “though some people do provide us cooked rice as lunch”, she said.

Extreme weather events have been unkind to Ganga and her community in Pakistan’s second largest province, which this year witnessed unprecedented rains and flooding. While the media’s focus was on the catastrophic urban flooding in Karachi and other urban centres, the August-September spell of rain wreaked havoc in rural areas with poor drainage.

The disaster has hit the marginalised Kohli, Bheel and Meghwar communities hard, as many of these scheduled Hindu caste members work in farms without ownership of the land they till.

Kohlis, Bheels and Meghwars are considered scheduled castes in India’s caste system which follows Hindu mythology. They are voiceless in the farming sector. They live in substantial numbers in Sindh but largely below the poverty line. While Meghwars opt for other occupations, the Kohlis and Bheels remain in the agriculture sector.

The Sindh government declared 20 districts as calamity hit areas after the recent rainfall. Districts in lower Sindh, including Badin, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Sanghar and Sujawal are the worst hit. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) office recorded 348 millimetres of rainfall in August 2020 in Mirpurkhas, which in the previous year had received 150 millimetres of rain.

The rains and the ensuing disaster are reminiscent of catastrophic floods in the area in 2011, when minority communities suffered tremendous losses yet received no relief.

This year, thousands have lost their produce — cotton and chilli crops — after the excessive rainfall. Selling it would have earned them an income for which they toiled tirelessly as the sun’s heat seared their faces.

A picture of misery

“It’s been around one month [since the rains] but we have been left to fend for ourselves here,” said Ganga, one of millions displaced by rains in district Mirpurkhas which is home to Sindh’s famous mango orchards.

“Do you know how difficult it is to pick cotton and hold a baby simultaneously? We are bearing all this pain and suffering only to earn some money. Merely 10 to 15 maunds [around 40kg] of cotton is left for picking. The rest is lost,” she told The Third Pole. In other years, they have picked nearly three times this amount.

“As if this disaster-driven displacement is not enough, the police forces us to leave sections of the highways and shift to other highlands,” she said.

Even in the third week of September, long after the rains stopped, large swathes of agricultural lands are submerged by standing rainwater. Drainage remains slow, and the poor farmers who worked in what is known as the ‘breadbasket of Sindh’ sit idle.

The men, women, elderly and children sleep under the open sky. Their homes, traditionally made of mud and thatched straw, have collapsed. They lack basic civic amenities and even toilets. Their livestock and cattle suffer as mosquitoes and insects invade the environs soon after sunset, making the animals prone to skin infections.

When their homes flooded, the displaced communities temporarily shifted to highlands and roadsides with whatever belongings they could gather. They have set up improvised tents with empty sacks or polypropylene bags, plastic and pieces of cloth.

“We gathered whatever we could when it started raining heavily on Aug 24 and 25 at midnight,” said Marva Kohli.

Extensive damage leaves government helpless

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah wants international aid to ameliorate the situation in Sindh. He put the figure of people affected by rains at 2.5 million. “We need international assistance like the kind we got in 2010, when the Indus river was swollen and experienced super floods, and then in 2011 when torrential rains visited Sindh,” he said.

A September 19 assessment by his government’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) put crop damage at 1.128 million acres and affected people at 2.48 million in Sindh. It reports 151 people dead, including 49 women and 23 children. The survey suggested nearly 30,000 homes were damaged and about 50,0000 cattle perished.

Among the damaged crop, cotton — an exportable commodity — and chilli are badly hit. The province, which produced 4.2 million cotton bales in 2009-2010 has barely come close to that figure in recent years. Production figures for 2010-2020 show a 40% decline.

The Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association’s senior vice chairman Haresh Kumar puts the overall damage to cotton crop in 2020-21 at Rs 5 billion [USD 30.3 million].

Progressive farmer and the leader of a vibrant growers’ body, Syed Mehmood Nawaz Shah, too, said that while the value of Sindh’s agriculture produce in 2020-21 for summer crops is about USD 7 billion, ‘“close to USD 1 billion has been lost in recent rains and flooding”.

No relief for farmers

For the poor farmers, more hardship lies ahead.

“We have lost the produce we had grown. We will lose our share [in the crop] as it will be adjusted by the landowner towards the cost of input he invested in the crop,” said Peeru Kohli.

The immediate rehabilitation of haris (bonded farm hands) is a distant dream. Barefoot peasants enter submerged cotton fields to pick the remainder of cotton from dawn to dusk for Rs 400 (USD 2.40) per 40kg, thus exposing themselves to infection and insects.

The hari-grower relationship is not governed under any law. Haris are not registered under the record of rights as permanent tenants as per Sindh Tenancy Act 1950. In practice, peasants share expenses incurred by the landlord from the sowing to harvesting stages of the crop. All inputs are purchased by the landlord or through the area’s conventional lending system.

The local lenders charge interest at rates much higher than banks. For instance, if a local lender provides a urea bag at Rs 17,500 (USD 10.60) on credit, he will charge USD 4.5 over and above the price as interest. The borrower/farmer has to sell his produce to the very lender as a precondition. Usually, a peasant’s loan is adjusted once the crop is harvested and sold in the market or to the same lenders who then offer a lower price for the crop along with deductions. The entire practice undermines the monetary interests of haris, who have to make do with a meagre share in profit after the deduction of expenses.

According to Peeru’s calculation, the landowner invests around Rs 30,000 (USD 181) per acre in the cotton crop which he or other peasants are supposed to share equally. “With the considerable chunk of cotton or chilli gone, we end up getting zero share in the profit,” he said, adding that he will now have to ask his landlord to lend him money.

“My community fellows will be borrowing more money to earn a living till the new crop is sown and harvested.”

“Scheduled caste members can’t buy assets or even read their religious books in line within Hinduism. They are the most persecuted community within Hindus,” said Dr Sonu Khangarani, recipient of Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, Pakistan’s highest civilian honour, for his social work in 2010. “I, too, hail from the Meghwar community,” he said.

“They can’t break this vicious circle,” he added. He urged the government to build villages on highlands for these landless peasants under the federal government’s ‘five million houses’ scheme and to give them ownership of land.

Under the Sindh Industrial Relations Act 2013, peasants are defined as “industrial workers”. But seasoned labour rights leader Nasir Mansoor said that unless rules are framed in line with the 2013 Act, it remains irrelevant. “These are rules which will provide a framework to get haris enrolled under social security laws…but the government’s will is missing.”
