0,1,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran flooding kills 70 after record rainfalls - CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/07/middleeast/iran-flood-fatalities/index.html,"(CNN) Seventy people have died in flooding in Iran after record rainfalls began saturating parts of the country last month, state-run media reported.

Deaths have been recorded across 13 provinces, with the highest casualties in Fars, Lorestan, Golestan and Hamedan, state-run IRNA quotes the head of Iran's Coroner's Office, Ahmad Shojaei, as saying.

""Over 140 rivers have burst their banks and some 409 landslides have been reported in the country, it reported , adding that 78 roads had been blocked and 84 bridges in flood-stricken areas affected.

Officials on Saturday warned residents in the province of Khuzestan of rising water levels and urged them to take evacuation notices seriously, IRNA reported.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent said it was helping thousands of people affected by the flooding.

""Red Crescent volunteers and staff have evacuated hundreds of people to safety, and have distributed food and items such as tents, blankets and health kits to tens of thousands of people,"" the organization's Middle East and North Africa director, Sayed Hashem, said.

Iran accuses US of hindering aid

On April 2, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement extending condolences to the victims of the flooding in Iran and blaming its government for the disaster.

""These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness. The regime blames outside entities when, in fact, it is their mismanagement that has led to this disaster,"" he said. ""The United States stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.""

""It seems the US Secretary of State is unaware of the mismanagement of natural disasters in the US over the past two years, and hence opines -- in an unprofessional, interventionist and demagogic manner -- on Iran's management of the horrific and unprecedented floods which simultaneously afflicted 24 provinces,"" Zarif said, before referencing Hurricanes Harvey, Michael and Florence and Maria.",4/7/2019 0:00,"{'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190407193645-iran-flooding-rooftop-large-169.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190407193645-iran-flooding-rooftop-super-tease.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190325171254-iran-floods-large-169.jpg', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190407193820-iran-flooding-poldokhtar-exlarge-169.jpg', 'https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190407193517-iran-flooding-aid-delivery-large-169.jpg'}","['secretary', 'flooding', 'crescent', 'kills', 'regime', '70', 'red', 'thousands', 'rainfalls', 'iran', 'village', 'state', 'reported', 'mismanagement', 'staterun', 'record']",,,flood

2,3,FL-2019-000022-IRN,At least 62 people killed in Iran floods as US accused of blocking aid - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/04/iran-floods-death-toll-reaches-62,"The death toll from two weeks of flooding in Iran has risen to 62 as frustration mounts inside the country at the government’s handling of the crisis and an international dispute has broken out over whether renewed US sanctions are blocking aid.

Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have been engaged in a war of words over the crisis. Zarif attacked the US for “economic terrorism” and said it was blocking the shipment of vital rescue equipment.

“[Donald Trump’s] ‘maximum pressure’ is impeding aid efforts by the Iranian Red Crescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods. Blocked equipment includes relief choppers,” he said on Twitter.

He also attacked European countries for hesitating to help over fears of violating sanctions, adding: “Europe can’t muster political will to defy US.”

Pompeo responded with an attack on Iranian government failings. “These floods once again show the level of Iranian regime mismanagement in urban planning and in emergency preparedness,” he said in a statement that offered condolences and made an offer of aid, but with no details.

Inside Iran, the crisis has exposed tensions between the reformist president, Hassan Rouhani, and his hardline opponents including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), with the two camps launching public attacks on each other over management of the floods and their aftermath.

The disaster has also fuelled public anger, particularly in areas where rescue and aid services have often been slow to arrive. In one possible attempt to dampen protests, the governor of a northern province was fired for failing to return home from abroad to manage the crisis.

The flooding, which began in late March, has turned the normally joyful Persian new year, or Nowruz, celebrations into a time of mourning, deprivation and fear for many Iranians.

The devastation has not been limited to one corner of Iran; the north-east was hit first and then, with the country still reeling, the south-west was also swamped.

Deaths have been reported in more than a third of the country’s 31 provinces. Among the hardest hit areas was the city of Shiraz, where over a month’s worth of rain fell in a day, most of it in two intense 15-minute downpours.

The scale of the damage has been so bad that authorities have banned foreign journalists from visiting the worst affected area, the New York Times reported.

But terrifying videos posted on social media showed flood waters sweeping away whole houses, ripping desperate people from poles they had clung to for support and carrying cars along like children’s toys, some with people still inside.

The new death toll of 62 was given by Ahmad Shojaee, the head of the Iranian Legal Medicine Organisation. The semi-official Isna news agency reported that it was based only on bodies transferred to coroners, so may rise further.

Tens of thousands more have been displaced, and many may have been made permanently homeless by the flooding. But getting in relief supplies is likely to remain a challenge for months to come.

Thousands of roads have been blocked or washed away and 84 bridges destroyed, making rescue operations complicated, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Organisation told state TV.

“[In total] 141 rivers burst their banks and around 400 landslides were reported,” said Behnam Saeedi, a spokesman for the organisation.

The damaged roads make up about a third of the national network. Sanctions mean the country has not been able to update its fleet of rescue helicopters.

The United Nations said at the start of the crisis that it was ready to offer help, but also warned that “challenges caused by unilateral sanctions will affect the UN response and the accountability of UN to deliver the appropriate support”, the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said in a statement.

The tepid international response is in marked contrast to the crisis after the Bam earthquake in 2003, when the world raced to offer help after the historic city was nearly totally destroyed.

3,4,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran says recent floods caused up to $2.5 billion in damage - Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-floods-idUSKCN1RQ093,"LONDON (Reuters) - Floods caused by heavy rain across Iran in recent weeks have caused an estimated $2.5 billion in damage to roads, bridges, homes and agricultural land, state media cited ministers as telling lawmakers on Sunday.

The flooding, which began on March 19, has killed 76 people, forced more than 220,000 people into emergency shelters, and left aid agencies struggling to cope. The armed forces have been deployed to help those affected.

“The recent floods are unprecedented... 25 provinces and more than 4,400 villages have been affected,” Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli was quoted as saying in parliament by state news agency IRNA.

Fazli said the floods had caused around 350 trillion rials ($2.5 billion) worth of damage.

Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami said 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) of road had been damaged and more than 700 bridges completely destroyed by landslides and flood water.

The government has said it will pay compensation to all those who have incurred losses, especially farmers but the Islamic Republic’s state budget is already stretched as U.S. sanctions on its energy and banking sectors have halved Iranian oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad.

Morteza Shahidzadeh, head of Iran’s sovereign wealth fund, said President Hassan Rouhani had asked permission from the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to withdraw $2 billion from the fund for reconstruction in flood-hit areas.

Shahidzadeh said Khamenei has in principle agreed to the request.

Iranian officials have repeatedly said the massive floods have not affected production and development at any oilfields, nor impeded the flow of crude through pipelines to recipient markets.

Karim Zobeidi, an official at the National Iranian Oil Company, was cited as saying on Sunday that it was still too early to estimate the extent of the flood damage to Iran’s energy sector.

Mehr news agency also quoted Zobeidi as saying that some oil wells in western Iran had been closed as a precaution to guard against any flooding.",2019-04-14 10:37:08+00:00,{'https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190414&t=2&i=1376826932&r=LYNXNPEF3D0AA&w=800'},"['flooding', 'saying', 'floods', 'caused', 'damage', '25', 'zobeidi', 'recent', 'iran', 'oil', 'billion', 'state']",,,flood

Heavy rains and flash flooding that began in March have affected 28 of 31 provinces across the Islamic Republic of Iran. The flooding has killed 78 people and injured 1,076 people according to the authorities. It is estimated that 10 million people have been affected and that as many as 2 million may be in need of some form of assistance. At least 296,000 people reportedly remain displaced. The widespread damages to the road and transportation network are making villages and small towns inaccessible. While information on humanitarian needs is still limited, the greatest needs are reported to be in the water, sanitation and hygiene, health, shelter and agriculture sectors.

Humanitarian response

The Government of Iran, the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) and the local communities are responding to the emergency and the needs of people affected. More than 445,000 people across Iran have been assisted with food, water, shelter and emergency supplies. The Government of Iran has officially indicated that emergency equipment, health supplies and household items are most needed. United Nations is mobilizing support in coordination with the international community. IRCS reports that it has delivered more than 30 million USD in humanitarian assistance, half of which was received from people in Iran.

A Friday report by Tehran-based state-approved newspaper Hamshahri quoted the head of the agriculture ministry’s crisis management department, Seyyed Mohammad Mousavi, as estimating flood losses at 24 trillion rials, or $180 million, based on the unofficial exchange rate of 135,000 rials to the dollar quoted by bonbast.com Friday.

The Iranian official said the losses were caused primarily in nine Iranian provinces, including Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Fars, Golestan, Kermanshah, North Khorasan, Khuzestan, Mazandaran, Semnan, and Sistan and Baluchestan.

Hamshahri cited Mousavi as saying 50 percent of the agricultural losses were related to farms, 23 percent to horticulture, 17 percent to water infrastructure and delivery networks, and 10 percent to livestock and fish.

Death toll at 44

In a Thursday report, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency said floods had killed at least 44 people in 10 provinces since Monday.

In an interview with the Friday edition of VOA Persian’s News at Nine program, Washington-based climate and international security commentator Caitlin Werrell said Iran’s flooding damage was caused by a combination of two factors.

“One is the intensity of the weather event — we saw a huge amount of precipitation happen in a short period of time,” said Werrell, chief executive of The Council on Strategic Risks, a security policy institute.

“That was combined with the conditions on the ground: infrastructure and also … a drought that precedes a flood (and) means that the soil is not as absorbent as it could have been,” she added.

Updated infrastructure needed

Iranian officials acknowledged that outdated agricultural and irrigation systems and poor water management policies in the past decades contributed to nationwide water shortages last year. Below average precipitation exacerbated the situation.

Werrell also said there are steps that countries such as Iran can take to mitigate future flooding disasters, which she predicted will become more frequent as the climate changes.

“Short-term weather forecasting has gotten better, but you also can also put in place things like early warning systems for people who cannot get out of the way, things that I would encourage everybody, not just in Iran, but across the world to be doing,” she said.

Description of the disaster

Flash floods in Golestan Province, in the North of Iran, began on 16 March causing flooding and landslides. The flooding subsequently spread further north and to the eastern provinces. The IRCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) declared early warning based on metrological alerts. Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) snapped into action, disseminating community-based warnings and evacuating at-risk communities to safe shelters.

Continued rainfall has caused floods in 586 cities and villages across Iran. Flood water has destroyed infrastructure, livestock, agriculture and livelihoods, with estimated damage USD 150,000 million, in Golestan and Mazandaran Provinces alone. The disaster struck in the middle of Nowruz,

Iranian New Year holidays. National Metrological service predicts more rainfall for the coming week.

By now, IRCS has reported 45 persons dead and at least 434 persons injured. The most affected areas are Golestan, Mazandaran, North Khorasan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Fars, Kermanshah, Khozestan, Semnan, Ilam and Hamedan. To date, IRCS has assisted 156,531 flood-affected persons and is provided temporary shelter for 50,732 people. As part of response, IRCS despatched helicopters, boats, ambulances, response vehicles and teams. After early warning for at-risk communities, IRCS provided emergency search and rescue, assessment, first aid and medical evacuation. IRCS has fulfilled its mandate of lead agency for disaster response, registering those evacuated and distributing food, water and household items to all those in need.",,"{'https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1269158-MDRIR002.png?itok=SFEGKpNW', 'https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/report-small/public/resources-pdf-previews/1269158-MDRIR002.png?itok=vjoBweIK'}","['islamic', 'rainfall', 'response', 'n', 'golestan', 'floods', 'warning', 'epoa', 'persons', 'provided', 'provinces', 'plan', 'iran', 'ircs', 'dref', 'republic', 'mdrir002', 'emergency', 'north', 'water']",,,flood

Just as the United States readies to tighten the sanctions screws a little more, Iran has been hit by extreme rain, causing serious flooding. The cost has already reached hundreds of millions of dollars, it’s claimed scores of lives and has displaced tens of thousands people and the rains are still falling.

Iran floods: Homes and people swept away - BBC News Credit: BBC, YouTube

Iran doesn’t have the financial or material resources to deal with the flooding, partly due to American sanctions and partly due to the usual incompetence that characterizes Iranian governance.

The short-term fallout of the massive floods is probably manageable. But the danger that the inundation represents for Iran’s leaders in the medium and longer term is not.

The economic damage from lost agricultural production could be huge, and it's coming at a time when the economy can’t sustain yet another blow. Last year Iran’s economy contracted by 1.5%, as Trump’s sanctions kicked in. This year the International Monetary Fund estimates it will decline another 3.6%.

Meanwhile, inflation is running high into the double digits and Iran’s budget deficit was double its target in the latest reporting period.

No question about it, the Trump sanctions are having their effect. Whether they will bring Tehran back to the nuclear negotiating table or lead to regime change is anyone’s guess, but they certainly have put Iran’s leaders in a difficult and unsustainable position. Their situation is far direr than when they cracked under the pressure of the Obama sanctions in 2012-15 and reached a deal on nukes.

But what the economic pressure might not suffice to achieve, the floods could well do.

The regime is blaming U.S. sanctions for its failure to provide flood relief. But incompetence and mismanagement are playing a role, too, and that’s what Iranians on the ground are seeing.

It’s not that official incompetence and mismanagement are something new for them, but given all the others woes the ordinary Iranian is suffering, the floods could eliminate the last remaining shred of confidence they have in the regime.

Political upheaval is often sparked by such things, most notably Czar Nicholas II’s repeated failures in leading Russian troops in World War I.

While the political fallout could still be contained this time around, climate change spells more natural disaster and more risk for the regime.

Extreme drought and flooding in Iran

With its mostly arid climate, Iran is unusually vulnerable, and it has a poor history of environmental management to boot. It has already been experiencing extreme weather, with increasingly severe droughts in some places and unusually heavy rain in others.

Lake Urmia, once the largest in the Middle East, is shrinking and may disappear within the decade. Meanwhile, Iran suffered six major floods in the three years before the current deluge.

The worst is yet to come. One forecast, published by an international team in Scientific Reports which came out in February, said average temperatures in Iran in the decades ahead could increase as much as 2.75 degrees Celsius, causing and more extreme weather.

“Our study of future climate in Iran depicts a grim picture concerning more frequent extreme wet and dry periods, more extended periods of extremely hot temperatures, and higher frequency of floods across the country. Combination of these events, especially in the three Desert climate zones, may create an uninhabitable living condition,” the authors predict. [sic]

How this will all play out politically and economically in Iran involves high speculation. Some scholars say that the extended drought in Syria, most probably caused by climate change, during the years 2006-10 was a critical factor in sparking the civil war. It cut sharply into harvests, created widespread agricultural unemployment and caused mass migration to cities, most notably Daraa, the seedbed of the revolution.

Others are less certain about the links between climate and revolution in Syria, or even about the fact of a drought at all. But even researchers who dismiss the direct impact of climate concede that it was a factor that combined with government mismanagement and other economic pressures that led to a war that took perhaps half a million lives, displaced 15 million people and shattered Syria’s economy.

An outcome like that Iran would be Mike Pompeo’s wet dream, but even less apocalyptic scenarios would leave the regime in Tehran in an extremely precarious situation.

In the short run, the pressure from a flagging economy and serial natural disasters would undermine Tehran’s ability to finance its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen and help prop up the Assad regime in Syria. There are already signs that the process has begun.

In the longer run, it is difficult to imagine how Iran’s “resistance economy,” which aims to counter sanctions by becoming more self-reliant and by defying the sanctions wherever possible, will be able to cope.

The Revolutionary Guard Corps like the idea of resistance, which means more business for their corporate empire and less pesky foreign competition.

But faced with the binary choice of a) the regime at risk of being toppled or b) returning to the negotiating table, they will almost certainly choose the latter, just as they did the last time around under less arduous circumstances. The only question is whether the Trump team will agree to sit at the table with them or hold out for a).",,"{'https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.7098273/127957447.jpg?precrop=2200,1434,x0,y0&height=782&width=1200', 'https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.7098273/127957447.jpg?precrop=2200,1434,x0,y0&height=203&width=350', 'https://img.haarets.co.il/img/1.5584690/1018316866.jpg?precrop=1308,1305,x75,y243&height=100&width=100'}","['climate', 'flooding', 'floods', 'caused', 'sanctions', 'regime', 'extreme', 'irans', 'epic', 'iran', 'economy', 'playing', 'trumps', 'change', 'hands']",,,flood_and_drought

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran evacuated residents from inundated areas of the southwestern city of Ahvaz on Wednesday as the nationwide death toll from the worst flooding in 70 years reached 77, state media reported.

The state news agency IRNA said more than 200 villages were also evacuated in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, and 46,000 people were housed in emergency shelters provided by the government.

Further districts of Ahvaz were put on flood alert, the provincial governor said, as more torrential rain was forecast in coming days. A hospital in the city was evacuated on Monday.

Floods described by officials as the worst since the 1940s have hit some 1,900 cities and villages across Iran after exceptionally heavy rain since March 19. Western and southwestern areas of the country are suffering the worst.

The disaster has left aid agencies struggling to cope, and the armed forces were deployed to help flood-hit people.

Early estimates put flood losses in agriculture sector at 47 trillion rials ($350 million).

The government has told citizens, and especially flood-affected farmers, that all losses will be compensated. The Islamic Republic’s state budget is already stretched under U.S. sanctions on energy and banking sectors that have halved Iranian oil exports and restricted access to some revenues abroad.

13,14,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Nowruz floods in Iran anger many but reasons are complex - Atlantic Council,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/nowruz-floods-in-iran-anger-many-but-reasons-are-complex/,"Aerial photo of flooding in Aghqla, Golestan province (IRNA).

The Iranian new year, Nowruz, is supposed to be a time of joy and celebration when Iranians visit family and go on vacation in other provinces. But for many this year, it was a time of sorrow and loss. Heavy rains, first welcomed in the drought-stricken country, turned into catastrophic floods. Twenty-eight of Iran’s thirty-one provinces were underwater during the two-week holiday.

So far, 43 people have reportedly died in flashfloods and tens of thousands have been displaced. The historic city of Shiraz in Fars Province was the hardest hit, with 19 dead.



According to the Washington Post, “Part of what made the city so vulnerable to flooding amid seemingly less-than-impressive rain amounts is its location in the Zagros foothills.” This may have prompted a funneling effect in the capital of Fars province. The World Meteorological Organization reported that Shiraz gets an average of 1.91 inches of rain every March, but the torrential rainfall this time totaled 2.33 inches—more than a month’s worth in just a few hours.

Early investigation into the flooding also shows negligence on the part of the local government. The governor of Fars province claimed that warnings were issued two weeks prior to the floods. Angry Iranians took to social media to point out that if there was cause for concern, vulnerable streets should have been blocked. As one Iranian Twitter user (@musafa_sh) commented in Persian: “How are you able to block people on [Cyrus the Great Day] and not even allow a bicycle to enter Pasargadae, but when you know people’s lives are in danger you can’t block them then?”

Environmental experts have noted that the loss of vegetation and soil as well as deforestation have made water more likely to run off than be absorbed into the ground. The deputy for construction to Mazandaran’s governor denied any correlation. Still, over the years, the Iranian government has been guilty of poor water management and has become complacent about flooding in part due to the extensive construction of dams. At an event at the Atlantic Council on March 27, Kaveh Madani, a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of the Environment, noted that “people have lost the memory” of flood plains because of dams. With record rainfall caused in part by climate change, the dams that have been built are now insufficient to prevent flooding. But the reaction, Madani explained, is that Iran should build even more dams.

In the most recent case, it took two days for a government response to the humanitarian disaster that began to spread on March 19. It didn’t help that emergency responders were overwhelmed, and possibly understaffed due to the Nowruz holiday.

Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, was reportedly vacationing on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf when news of the floods made headlines. Reuters reported that many Iranians on social media criticized him for remaining on holiday in the south, while floods devastated the north. By March 23, Rouhani ordered the Interior Ministry to hasten plans to help residents in Golestan and Mazandaran provinces. Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri, who arrived in Golestan’s capital, Gorgan, that day, reportedly fired its governor because he didn’t cut a trip abroad short to address the devastation.

On March 26, a video emerged of the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, trudging through the murky waters of Golestan province to visit flooded areas.

It took seven days for Rouhani to finally visit provinces hard hit by the floods—likely a response to Jafari’s visit. At a National Disaster Management meeting in Golestan province on March 27, responding to criticism, Rouhani said, “I had planned to come in the first days, but ultimately due to considerations, it was decided the first vice president would travel here.”

Much of the criticism of the Rouhani administration’s slow response to the floods was found on social media and came from hardline government officials. It’s estimated that the floods caused millions of dollars in damage to farms, homes, and infrastructure. The Iranian government has pledged 7.1 trillion rials (about $169 million) in compensation to those impacted by the floods.

Pope Francis “expressed sorrow” for the Iranian flood victims and prayed for those who lost their lives, while the State Department’s Persian language Twitter account (@USAdarFarsi) tweeted condolences to the families of the flood victims on March 25 and said that the United States is “always ready to help.” (How exactly it can help given US sanctions is unclear, although some US-based NGOs reportedly have licenses to collect donations.) Austria, Armenia, and Turkey have also stepped in to offer humanitarian assistance.

Iran’s Energy Minister Reza Ardekanian, who also manages the country’s dams and water supply, blamed the floods on climate change. “Climate change is forcing itself on our country” and is part of a worldwide problem, he said. However, experts such as Madani blamed poor management of resources as well as the Iranian government’s persecution of environmentalists with ties to the West.

In the past, some Iranian officials have relied on conspiracy theories to shift the blame for environmental challenges and humanitarian disasters. In July 2018, the chief of Iran’s civil defense claimed that neighboring enemy countries, including Israel, were stealing Iran’s clouds and snow—essentially blaming outside forces for a prolonged drought.

Madani denied any notion that a conspiracy was behind the devastation by tweeting: “The recent floods in the country were not caused by rain-laden clouds, the HAARP project, or the stealing of clouds!” He repeated this comment at the Atlantic Council’s ‘Environmental Security in the Middle East’ event.

The Rouhani administration hired Madani, an Iranian-born water conservation expert, from the Imperial College London, in 2017 to deal with Iran’s water challenges but he ended up fleeing the country a year ago. Madani was constantly harassed and interrogated by the intelligence arm of the IRGC who viewed him and other environmental experts with suspicion. Since February 2018, a dozen environmentalists have been rounded up and imprisoned on bogus charges. Kavous Seyed-Emami, a prominent Canadian-Iranian academic and environmentalist, reportedly died under suspicious circumstances—leading some to believe he was tortured to death.

Meanwhile, Ahmad Reza Djalali—a Swedish-Iranian with crisis management expertise—who is facing the death penalty, was interviewed at Evin Prison through an intermediary. Djalili explained that most emergency response drills focused on earthquakes, and that the threat of floods has been largely ignored. He added that part of what contributed to the floods in Shiraz was the obstruction of flood outlets and dry river beds by construction.

So far, Rouhani’s slow response has only further angered Iranians who had already grown frustrated by his broken promises and the poor state of economy, which has been hammered by a combination of re-imposed sanctions, mismanagement, and corruption.

Recognizing climate change is a start. But a bigger gesture would be for the Iranian government to admit its own faults in contributing to the country’s environmental challenges, while consulting and working with Iran’s foremost environmental experts instead of jailing them and chasing them into exile.

Unfortunately, for the time being, the Iranian government has chosen the opposite route.

14,15,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Here's How the United States Can Help Iran's Flood Recovery — Bourse & Bazaar - Bourse & Bazaar,https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/articles/2019/4/4/heres-how-the-united-states-can-help-irans-flood-recovery,"Over the last two weeks, Iran has been ravaged by unprecedented floods, resulting in over 60 deaths and the devastation of whole communities. The natural disaster has only added to the the country’s woes, already reeling from an economic crisis brought about in part by the reimposition of the Trump administration’s decision to reimpose secondary sanctions in November 2018. The coincidence of tightening sanctions and a major natural disaster has led for calls for the Trump administration to take steps to ensure that sanctions policies do not unduly interfere with relief efforts. In the aftermath of the 2003 Bam Earthquake, the Bush administration established new licenses to ensure that the program of then-expanding US sanctions would not stymie relief efforts in Iran, which even came to include the dispatch of American search-and-rescue teams. In 2012, the Obama administration took similar steps to ensure financial aid could reach Iran in the aftermath of yet more devastating earthquakes.

So far, the Trump administration has given no indication that it intends issue new licenses to provide legal clarity to those individuals and organizations wishing to provide aid or to support relief efforts in Iran. A brief statement from Secretary of State Pompeo declared that the US “stands ready to assist and contribute to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which would then direct the money through the Iranian Red Crescent for relief.” However, in an indication of the depth of the Trump administration’s sympathies, Pompeo also claimed that “it is the [Iranian regime’s] mismanagement that has led to this disaster.”

Given the administration’s commitment to imposing “maximum pressure” on Iran through an ever-expanding sanctions program, it is highly unlikely that the administration will prove willing to make it easier for American or foreign entities to provide substantial material or financial relief for the recent floods. However, despite the Trump administration’s regrettable political stance, there are still measures that administration should take—with encouragement from Congress—to ensure that Iran is able to more effectively recover from the floods, in particular by enabling preparedness efforts in advance of the next major natural disaster.

Iran, like all countries worldwide, is facing new and growing challenges related to both climate change and natural disasters. In addressing these challenges, proactive measures of preparation, prediction, and prevention will always have a greater bearing on the protection of human life and mitigation of destruction than the provision of financial aid for relief efforts in the aftermath of a disaster. But in order to succeed in boosting national preparedness for frequent earthquakes, floods, sandstorms, and heat-waves, Iran urgently needs to upgrade its surveying and monitoring technologies to better model and predict meteorological, hydrological, and geological events.

Acquisition of these technologies has been made significantly more difficult by the recent reimposition of US secondary sanctions, meaning that even if Iran takes on board the difficult lessons of the recent floods, it will be hampered in its ability to adapt. The Trump administration should create a new general license to permit the sale of such surveying and monitoring technologies, which produce nothing more than useful information that can be used to save lives. Over the last decade, Iran has undertaken several systematic reviews of its climate change and disaster readiness. In each instance, the acquisition of better technology has been identified as key a priority for authorities.

In December 2017, Iran submitted its “Third National Communication” to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a major report which detailed the country’s assessment of the challenges posed by climate change and the status of its preparedness and remediation efforts. The report, compiled by Iran’s Department of Environment in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme, offers a sober assessment of the Iran’s failures to adequately deal with the effects of climate change—failures which stem largely from weak regulations and mismanagement. But the report also highlights how “years of economic instability and unfair sanctions have delayed mitigation and adaptation measures.” In particular, the report notes that “this situation even has prevented civil technologies transfer to Iran, which has constrained mitigation measures and actions.”

As part of the its national communication report, Iran also submitted a separate “Technological Needs Assessment.” Focused largely on technologies that would help increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions, the report also details ways in which Iran has struggled to acquire the survey and monitoring technology necessary to understand and adapt to new climate change phenomena. New technology is needed to identify “the emerging environmental phenomena and challenges such as desertification, drought, sand and dust storms… and mainstreaming environmental considerations in future national development plans.” Notably, the report also details that “climate change causes inconsistencies in historical and data series obtained from the meteorological and hydrometric monitoring stations,” a reference to the fact that Iran is seeing more unprecedented weather events. Today, Iran’s dams are nearly at capacity after historic rainfall, offering a real world example “of greater inaccuracies in estimating water return period for designing and construction of hydrostructures.”

Beyond climate change, a similar emphasis on the need to improve monitoring technologies can be seen in Iran’s official assessments of disaster readiness. Iran’s 2013 assessment report for disaster readiness, complained in accordance with the United Nation’s Hyogo Framework for Action, identified “neither comprehensive nor substantial” achievement in regards to the availability of “national and local risk assessments based on hazard data and vulnerability information.” The report’s authors point to a wide range of issues preventing effective monitoring for natural disaster risks and providing adequate warnings to the population. These challenges include a lack of satellite imagery and the software to interpret that imagery, a lack of a robust climatological models to develop seasonal forecasts, and a lack of tools to predict the severity of complex weather phenomena while they are developing. Pointing to the dual threats of earthquakes and weather-related disasters, the report notes that sanctions are “a serious hindrance in the increase of seismic monitoring instruments and upgrading early warning systems.”

The lack of sophisticated meteorological tools can also contribute to the loss of life even when there is no full-blown natural disaster. In February 2018, an Aseman Airlines ATR 72-212 aircraft crashed in Iran’s Zagros Mountains, killing all 66 people on board. The interim investigation report released last month by Iran’s Civil Aviation Organization concludes that the accident was mainly the result of “human factors,” including the actions of the cockpit crew. However, the accident transpired as the aircraft entered adverse weather conditions and the investigators have concluded that contributing factors included a lack of “significant meteorological information” about the wind conditions in the mountain area. This oversight was identified in part because data provided by Météo-France, the French national meteorological association, was more accurate in modeling the wind and ice formation conditions at the time of the accident than the data available to Iran’s own meteorological agency. The report recommends that the Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization undertake efforts to research how it can provide more sophisticated information on mountain weather hazards, something which will require new monitoring technologies.

Multiple agencies in Iran, looking at issues of climate change, disaster management, and aviation safety, have formally detailed the need for more advanced survey and monitoring technologies. They have also identified sanctions as a major impediment to the acquisition of these technologies. It is a common claim that Iranian authorities point to sanctions to deflect away from their own mismanagement. However, in regards to climate change and disaster management efforts, sanctions-related challenges have consistently been described by authorities as just one of many challenges, most of which stem for domestic failures of best-practice adoption. Additionally, the effect of sanctions on Iran’s ability to acquire these much needed surveying and monitoring technologies is readily observed in the relevant trade data.

A general license issued by US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control would drastically increase the ease with which suppliers of meteorological, geological, and hydrological monitoring equipment could determine the compliance of sales to Iranian customers. Such a license would benefit US companies as there is precedent for sales of such equipment to Iran. In 2007 and 2008, before US secondary sanctions on Iran were expanded, with just under USD 8,000 dollars worth of “surveying instruments and appliances,” specifically exported in 2007 and just under USD 80,000 exported in 2008, according to trade data from the US Census Bureau.

But more importantly, a general license would significantly impact the ability of European companies, including the European subsidiaries of American companies, to export meteorological, geological, and hydrological survey and monitoring instruments to Iran. Europe is by far the largest exporter of such technology to Iran, but it’s exports have been significantly impacted by US secondary sanctions.

A review of European exports to Iran since 2000 makes it clear that the vast majority of “hydrographic, oceanographic, hydrological, meteorological or geophysical instruments” (HS code 9015) were purchased by Iran prior to 2009, meaning that much of the technology Iran has deployed is at least a decade old. The imposition of international sanctions on Iran saw exports in these categories fall precipitously, with totals falling from a high of over EUR 16 million in 2006 to just over EUR 375,000 in 2014. A small recovery can be observed in 2016, when Iran received sanctions relief following the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but the limited recovery tallied suggests that the lingering impact of US sanctions on banking channels and the anticipation of the Trump administration’s possible withdrawal from the JCPOA dampened sales. In a concerning indication of the likely impact of the reimposition of US secondary sanctions on Iran in November 2018, European exports of goods in these categories fell to just over EUR 5,000 in December of last year, rising slightly to just over EUR 40,000 in the first month of this year. A general license would help address the decline in exports by giving legal clarity to European companies and banks regarding the status of the trade.",4/4/2019 0:00,"{'http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54db7b69e4b00a5e4b11038c/54db7d17e4b0c0e085a1149c/5ca5fe95085229c9950369a8/1554717527672/n3678872-6957971.jpg?format=1500w', 'https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1263070251316580353/RPSlBu2G_normal.png', 'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54db7b69e4b00a5e4b11038c/1467039705873-HTA9WPCR2QOGDVS3UEAZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHF0WZzC-U5-hma7j-CL7tBZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWhcwhEtWJXoshNdA9f1qD7eaDBaxyzPPG4B3J3_Z93rbSGLxshhshbJ_wH9qQkw6RPJMT2f7lX_ep8-OvJlLV7w/image-asset.png', 'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fjqrZ6wUbST26.gif', 'https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54db7b69e4b00a5e4b11038c/t/577d3dda197aea930325d703/1620839261253/?format=1500w'}","['monitoring', 'climate', 'help', 'heres', 'bazaar', 'sanctions', 'report', 'meteorological', 'disaster', 'recovery', 'flood', 'bourse', 'iran', 'technologies', 'change', 'states', 'irans', 'united']",,,none

As per the authorities including Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS), external assistance is not required at this moment, and is therefore not seeking funding or other assistance from donors and within the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement at this time.

The Situation

On 17 March 2019, flash floods showered Golestan province in the northern part of the country, leading to heavy landslide and inundation. The flood hit northern and eastern regions of the province, and Iranian Red Crescent emergency operation center declared early warning based on the metrological alarms. Over 1400 relief posts have been standing by to respond accordingly. Over ten counties of the province have been hit by the flood. National Society senior managers have been present in the field on 22nd March. Since the flooding began in Mazandaran province, relief teams have immediately responded to the affected people. The flood has subsided in most areas, but there is still inundation. The relief operations are running in two provinces and neighboring relief workers are on alert. Because of the vast areas affected, six IRCS rescue choppers have been deployed to the affected areas to quickly deliver the teams and relief items as needed. With over 98 hours flight, around 120,000 kg of food and NFI have been transferred. Also, six temporary camps have been set up in safe parts of Agh Ghala city for emergency sheltering.

Following the public requests to support the northern flood-affected people, Iranian Red Crescent announced that people could donate their cash contributions via the Iranian Red Crescent Society bank account number. Also domestic USSD code 780112# is allocated for mobile cash transfers. Affected cities include Gorgan, Bandar-e Torkaman, Azad Shahr, Aqqala, Gonbad-e kavous, Bandar-e Gaz, Ali Abad, Kalaleh, KordKouy, Minou Dasht.

According to the officials, 61,129 people have been affected by the flood and 56,841 people have been assisted.

18,19,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"Why The World Is Not Sending Aid To Iran, Devastated By Floods - RadioFarda",https://en.radiofarda.com/a/why-the-world-is-not-sending-aid-to-iran-devastated-by-floods/29854431.html,"Two weeks into devastating floods that have caused tremendous losses and damages across Iran, there is still no report about other countries extending help.

The United States, a usual volunteer to extend support after every natural disaster in Iran regardless of tense relations between the two countries during the past decades, has not been reported to have seized the opportunity on the world stage to make a publicized offer of help.

On March 25, the Persian Twitter account of the State Department made a short announcement offering sympathies and a one-sentence expression of readiness to help, but senior U.S. officials have not officially made any serious offer.

European states as well as Iran's neighbors, particularly the wealthy Persian Gulf states have also not made any official offers of help. Or, if any offer has been made, the helpers have not said anything, and Iran has not acknowledged receiving them.

British, German and French diplomats in Tehran have expressed their sympathies, but no one at higher level has made an official offer of help; let alone sending actual material support.

Turkish charities have offered assistance according to Daily Sabah newspaper and five trucks are on their way, but this is negligible considering the extent of the damage.

This is a dramatic change in the behavior of the world community. In late 2003 when a major earthquake caused devastation in Bam in southeast Iran, over 60 countries rushed to help and the United States set up a makeshift hospital in Bam to help the wounded and save lives, Iranian news agencies reported at the time.

The hospital was only part of the assistance extended by the United States at the time. Food, medicine and other supplies, as well as rescue dogs were despatched to help Iran, although diplomatic ties between Tehran and Washington had been cut off in early 1980s.

At that time, Iran's President was reformist Mohammad Khatami who had initiated the idea of ""dialogue among nations"" during a speech at the UN General Assembly.

Ten years later, U.S. media remembered this picture after Rouhani had a conversation over the phone with President Barack Obama in 2013 after another UN General Assembly meeting.

Now, only six years later, very little seems to have remained from the sense of sympathy, at least in public domain. Europeans and Americans and regional counties seem to have had enough of hate-speech and words of abuse by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.

Even Russia and China, Iran's diplomatic supporters have not sent any assistance to help victims or assist the government in dealing with floods.

In addition to Iran’s diplomatic isolation, U.S. sanctions might also be a factor in inhibiting material assistance.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement that it was ready to offer help to Iran, but “challenges caused by unilateral sanctions will affect the UN response and the accountability of UN to deliver the appropriate support”, Reuters reported on March 26.

Iran has not accepted calls for help in disasters, except when the events were overwhelming like the June 2000 earthquake in Roudbar in northern Iran and the 2003 quake in Bam. The current floods are larger in scale and have affected more people although the casualty toll may be smaller.

Tens of thousands have lost their homes, farmlands and work places and the Iranian government does not appear to be capable of offering much help although Rouhani has been promising compensation. Hundreds of thousands of people had to evacuate their homes in northern, western and southwestern Iran, where hundreds of towns and villages are submerged.

However, for a government that has failed to pay workers' wages, pensioner's pension and investor's assets in many cases during the past year, compensating losses and damages caused by the March floods seem to be too much to promise.",,"{'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29854431&SiteId=82&r=84738757&it=0&pd=20190401111032', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/46AA8D06-4E43-4E07-B84D-B66ACDFE652B.png', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/1693578759?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3awhy%20the%20world%20is%20not%20sending%20aid%20to%20iran%2c%20devastated%20by%20floods&c6=why%20the%20world%20is%20not%20sending%20aid%20to%20iran%2c%20devastated%20by%20floods&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=why%20the%20world%20is%20not%20sending%20aid%20to%20iran%2c%20devastated%20by%20floods&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=iran-in-depth&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29854431&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/D51C5515-2CD2-4580-BB87-46AE0D67AFD7.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/29A4D930-BC92-4DF8-8D17-3941AD32F6FD_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/27E68905-433F-4890-9328-EB01470D70C9_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/29A4D930-BC92-4DF8-8D17-3941AD32F6FD_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/79AEAB4C-8002-4747-8025-D5ED9247FE85_w250_r0_s.jpg'}","['diplomatic', 'sending', 'floods', 'caused', 'help', 'aid', 'iran', 'states', 'world', 'offer', 'reported', 'irans', 'united', 'devastated']",,,flood

The head of Iran’s Red Crescent Sarem Rezaee says Pol-e-Dokhtar, one of these towns, is still in super-crisis state and rescue workers are trying to bring it out of emergency conditions.

The head of Iran's emergency services said crews are doing their utmost to help residents and four helicopters have been sent to Lorestan to rescue injured people and distribute food. He added that 150 people who needed medical attention were flown to hospitals.

Some reports say that more than 55 people have died so far as a result of two weeks of floods.

The Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) once again blamed the civilian government for its inability to deal with the crisis. The commander of IRGC ground forces Mohammad Pakpoor said ""there is no management"" in the rescue and aid operations in Pol-e-Dokhtar and ""no government official would dare"" to show up in the area because ""people are in a rebellious mood"".

He insisted that ""people are in a sorry state and conditions are bad"".

Monday afternoon all communication and road connectivity with Pol-e-Dokhtar was lost, and Lorestan’s governor said that if extraordinary efforts are not made to send rescue workers and aid to the town “we will witness a great human tragedy”.

In a video taken mid-day Monday, a resident says that two-thirds of the city is under several feet of water”. The images from Monday might not tell the real extent of the crisis, which worsened later in the day.

Dozens of elite rescue workers have been sent to Pol-e-Dokhtar, with a population of just under 25,000, but there is no information yet about possible casualties.

All rivers in Lorestan have breached their banks and have turned into channels for unprecedented floods. The Marook dam in the area has been swamped by excess water, which has surpassed the top, but there is no information about the destruction caused by this incident.

It was reported on Monday that water levels in Khorramabad, the capital of Lorestan had reached 3 meters, or more than nine feet.

Water pouring over Marook Dam in Lorestan

Mahmoud Sadeghi, a member of parliament addressed Iran’s vice president in a tweet saying, “Mr. Jahangiri please come to the rescue of Lorestan province. Connection has been lost with a few towns and cities. Defenseless people are besieged by floods. All officials who are contacted say they cannot do anything”.

Another province in the grips of flood emergency is oil-producing Khuzestan. Midnight Monday it was reported that more than fifty villages have been evacuated.

Two major dams in the province are completely full and all emergency hatches are open to relieve excess water behind Karkheh and Dez. Residents on the path of the water outflow have been warned to stay away from rivers.

On Tuesday, an emergency situation was declared in the city of Shush (or ancient Shusha). Thirty villages in the area were evacuated, in addition to was announced earlier for Khuzestan.

Multiple landslides have blocked small and major roads, as well as railroads in western and southwestern Iran. The rail link between the capital Tehran and Ahvaz, the capital of Khuzestan was severed on Monday.

Roads have also been blocked in northern parts of the country. The highway from Rasht, on the Caspian Sea and Qazvin to the south has been cut.

The Alborz mountain range in the north is covered with heavy snow that is melting fast with the rains and adding to water volume in rivers.

Heavy rainfall caused overflow of the Tajan River, in northern province of Mazandaran, forcing people to evacuate the area in central parts of city of Sari.

Reports from state-run media indicate that roads leading to 70 villages in Golestan and more than 200 in Mazandaran have been flooded. 20 villages in Golestan have been evacuated.

According to the Mazandaran Crisis Management Department, the floods affected about 200 villages in the province, causing damage to 1,500 homes in urban areas and 30 to 50% of homes in rural areas. In addition, dozens of communication bridges were destroyed or damaged in neighborhoods and villages.

The head of Iran’s Crisis Management Organization reported that 40 villages in Golestan province still have no electricity.

According to Mojtaba Jamali, the Director General of the Golestan Province Crisis Management, the town of Agh Ghola in Golestan was facing the most severe problems.

Two people died after a landslide in Golestan in the past few days, Jamali announced.

Previously the minister of energy had reported that 360 villages in Golestan province and 193 villages in Mazandaran province had lost electricity.

Golestan Crisis Management Department announced on Thursday that “currently over 10 villages in this province are under water.

Videos of the recent floods show how the locals are providing help for each other when regime officials are refusing to do so.

According to the state-run Khabar Online Website, Iran floods have significantly increased in the past year with 552 cases taking place in the course of just 4 years.

The reason behind Iran’s increasing floods is the deforestation of more 30% of the northern forests, the destruction of vegetation in pastures and fields, the lack of levees, and flood walls in flood areas, the lack of river dredging, the unnatural gathering of heavy sediments behind dams, broken dams, the unconventional building of villas in agricultural land which is mostly carried out by those affiliated with the government, and the construction on river banks and river areas.

Deforestation is carried out in full by the government with “33% of forests in Iran having been destroyed”, according to state-run media. That means that the 18 million hectares of Iran’s forests have shrunk to just 12.4 million.

Last October Iran floods which hit the three provinces of Northern Khorasan, Mazandaran and Gilan provinces killed eight people.

Javid Javidnia told the Judiciary’s online news service March 24 that so far 60 accounts have been opened and some of them have already been closed.

He also told another news site that any crowd funding by individuals and organizations must be done through the Red Crescent Society or the official Aid Committee. It is not clear if ordinary donors would trust the official government agencies with their money.

Past instances of natural disasters in Iran have shown that the people prefer to contribute money via special accounts set up by celebrities, including soccer stars, wrestlers, actors and actresses, rather than paying to the state-run institutions.

Javidinia warned celebrities the accounts they have opened will be closed and the funds transferred to government agencies for helping flood victims. He referred to past instances when individuals raised funds for disasters and financial fraud took place.

Footage and images circulated on social media show hundreds of anti-riot forces deployed in the district. It is not clear if there were any incidents or not. The residents are calling for the diversion of the threatening floods toward the marshes, away from towns and villages.

In the past two days, many on social media have accused the Islamic Republic's Ministry of Oil of blocking the flood from flowing into Hour al-Azim marshes to protect oil facilities and installations from damage.

However, the Minister of Oil, Bijan Namdar Zangeneh has categorically denied the charges.

In this tweet the first video shows a large crowd in Ain 2 district of Ahvaz protesting.

Days earlier, images on social media showed violent clashes between the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Special units and people who either refuse to evacuate or protest diversion of water to farmlands.

IRGC's spokesman, Ramazan Sharif dismissed these reports as baseless, asserting that the Special Unit forces only use “verbal” persuasion to urge people to evacuate their homes.

One resident was reported killed and other injured.

Fars said authorities tried to persuade the villagers to evacuate their homes and allow the destruction of a flood barrier in return for compensation.

By Linda Bordoni

Pope Francis expressed his sorrow for the loss of life, injury and damage caused by flash floods in northern Iran that have killed at least 26 people.

In a telegramme, signed on his behalf by the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Pope Francis on Wednesday conveyed his heartfelt solidarity with all those affected and said he is praying for the deceased.

The floods are being described as an “unprecedented natural disaster”. Rescuers are still searching for survivors and hundreds have reportedly been injured in the country that is more accustomed to drought than to rain.

In his message, the Pope also said he is praying for the emergency personnel involved in rescue efforts and assured the people of Iran that he has invoked divine blessings of consolation and strength on those who grieve.

Insufficient government response

Meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani, who is accused by critics of mishandling the crisis, travelled to flooded areas to inspect the damage and promised compensation to all those affected.

Tuesday’s torrential rain struck 25 of Iran's 31 provinces, and the scale of the disaster has reportedly overwhelmed emergency services in some areas.

Dr Nina Ansary is an award-winning American-Iranian author, historian and expert on Iran. She also sits on the board of the New York-based Centre for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI). In the wake of catastrophic flooding in the beleaguered Middle Eastern nation, the researcher has spoken to Express.co.uk about the dire situation to voice concerns about the Iranian regime’s handling of the disaster which has left hundreds injured and tens of thousands displaced.

The historian questioned the inadequate response of the Iranian authorities, which she contended “do not have the best of interests of the people in mind” after floods ravaged the homes of thousands, with the historic city of Shiraz the worst hit by the devastation. Dr Ansary argued the Iranian regime has “squandered Iran’s greatest asset, its people” and did not heed weather warnings of the floods’ imminent impact on Shiraz. Condemning Hassan Rouhani’s administration she said: “They neglected to evacuate the residents of Shiraz in time so that is why the injury and loss of life were so drastic. “There was no observation of warnings, no evacuations, no precautionary measures. “This crisis has come about due to a lack of infrastructure against natural disasters, which reflects the negligence of the Iranian authorities.” READ MORE: Iran flash floods kill 17 and injure 74 - officials warn 'Stay INSIDE'

The devastating floods have wiped out entire communities

President Rouhani, who claimed the floods were an “unprecedented natural disaster”, was quoted by Iranian state media as saying: “The government will use all means and will compensate all those who have sustained damages to their houses, businesses and farms.” But his supposed words of reassurance come too late for those who blame his callous regime’s inertia in tackling the problem. At least 44 people died and more than 200 were injured, with thousands of homes damaged after the heavy flash floods triggered landslides across Iran, according to the CHRI citing Iran’s state-funded Emergency Services Organization. The devastating flash floods inflicted a huge $500million (£439million) of damage, according to the CHRI, who cited Iran’s Ministry of Agriculture and Jihad, which manages and oversees the country’s agricultural industry. Dr Ansary argued the Iranian government would rather “plunder its resources” than “attend to its own people’s needs”.

She said: “This disaster is coming at a time of heightened political tension in Iran, not to mention dire economic circumstances for the people of Iran from decades of mismanagement by the Iranian government which prefers to fund foreign terrorist organisations as opposed to attend to its own people’s needs.” In a further blow to his own citizens, Rouhani’s deputy attorney general announced a ban on celebrities raising money to help the victims, Dr Ansary explained. And the hardline authorities have also announced a crackdown on social media usage, warning citizens they could be prosecuted if they post about the disaster online. Of the suppressive measure, prominent human rights lawyer Abdolkarim Lahiji told the CHRI: “Not only has the Iranian government been negligent but it has also warned victims’ families and those who have suffered losses that they will be prosecuted if they paint a dark picture of this natural disaster and state relief efforts.

Fifty-six villages near the Dez and Karkheh rivers in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan may have to be evacuated as officials released water from two major dams along the rivers because of forecasts for more rain, the provincial governor, Gholamreza Shariati, told state television.

""Some residents are resisting [evacuation calls] because of their livestock ... and because they've experienced similar circumstances in the past,"" Shariati said, adding Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli had agreed to call an emergency in Khuzestan.

Energy Minister Reza Ardakanian, who is in charge of water resources, said authorities were working around the clock to ""control floodwaters and to minimize possible damage.""

""It's estimated that in the next five days about 3 billion cubic meters of water will flow into dam reservoirs in Khuzestan due to rainfall ... 1.8 billion of which [is above capacity and] will have to be released,"" he told state television.

In the neighboring province of Lorestan, at least eight villages and parts of the town of Dorud were being evacuated, the semiofficial news agency Fars reported.

Officials have said the government would compensate residents for flood damage.

At least 45 people were killed this week in flash floods in northern and southern Iran after the heaviest rains recorded in Iran in at least a decade, the state news agency IRNA quoted Health Minister Saeid Namaki as saying.

Western and southwestern parts of the country are expected to bear the brunt of the storms in the days ahead.

The oil-producing Khuzestan province in the southwest has seen waves of floods, with the latest inundation the result of maximum outflows from two large dams that have reached full capacity.

Karim Zobaydi a member of Iran’s National Oil Company told the government’s official news agency IRNA that oil production in some fields has come to a halt due to flooding.

Zobaydi said that oil wells have been flooded in Ab Teymour, Mansouri and Azadegan fields and in area 3 of Ahvaz some oil delivery pipes and wells have also been damaged by floods.

Ahvaz is the capital of Khuzestan province and has seen late floods in recent days due to excess water let out of dams further north.

The areas mentioned by the oil company official generally lie to the west of Karoon River. The area produces 350,000 barrels of oil per day.

Although the reduction in oil production is a significant setback, especially if the flooding leaves a long-term impact, Iran currently is unable to export at full capacity due to U.S. sanctions and can use its excess production capacity to satisfy domestic needs.",,"{'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/46AA8D06-4E43-4E07-B84D-B66ACDFE652B.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/D51C5515-2CD2-4580-BB87-46AE0D67AFD7.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4D2A144F-EC9F-44C4-84EF-271FE206D030_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/870003040?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3afloods%20disrupt%20iran%27s%20oil%20production%20in%20some%20areas%20of%20southwest&c6=floods%20disrupt%20iran%27s%20oil%20production%20in%20some%20areas%20of%20southwest&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=floods%20disrupt%20iran%27s%20oil%20production%20in%20some%20areas%20of%20southwest&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=iran-news&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29875495&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4D2A144F-EC9F-44C4-84EF-271FE206D030_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29875495&SiteId=82&r=1408646685&it=0&pd=20190411185144', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg'}","['disrupt', 'southwest', 'floods', 'seen', 'production', 'wells', 'large', 'oil', 'areas', 'iran', 'province', 'official', 'irans', 'khuzestan']",,,flood

Five trucks carrying humanitarian aid supplied by the Red Crescent headed to Iran through the Gürbulak border crossing yesterday. At least 45 people were killed this week in flash floods in northern and southern Iran after the heaviest rains recorded in Iran in at least a decade. Another 265 people were injured. Iranian officials said on Saturday it faced an emergency in a southwestern province threatened by flooding and worked to evacuate dozens of villages as forecasters predicted more heavy rains. Some 56 villages lying near the Dez and Karkheh rivers in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan may have to be evacuated as officials released water from two major dams along the rivers due to forecasts for more rain, Provincial Governor Gholamreza Shariati told state television.





Buildings, houses flooded in Iran's Golestan region, March 27, 2019. Floods killed at least 45 people in the country last week.

The Turkish Red Crescent cooperated with the Iranian Red Crescent to deliver aid to those displaced by the floods. The aid includes 320 tents, 500 beds, 100 hygiene kits, 1,625 blankets, 360 sets of kitchen utensils and 60 heaters. Anıl Kocabal, who heads the Red Crescent delegation to Iran tasked with aid delivery, told Anadolu Agency (AA) that they also launched a donation campaign to help the people of Iran affected by the disaster. ""Our first delivery will be an accommodation kit (tents) to 320 families. We cooperate with the Iranian Red Crescent so that we can reach out to everyone affected by the disaster,"" Kocabal said.

Western and southwestern parts of Iran are expected to bear the brunt of the storms in the days ahead. Police renewed calls for people to avoid unnecessary journeys even though Iran is celebrating the Nevruz New Year holiday, a time when many families travel. Iran has implemented measures to prevent rain and flooding affecting its main crude oil export terminal on Kharg Island in the Gulf, the head of the Iranian Oil Terminals Company told the semi-official news agency Mehr on Saturday.

In Colombia, TİKA delivered stationary sets to students and humanitarian aid to locals in Istmina, a town hit by floods in February and earlier this month. Istmina is located in Colombia's Choco Department where the San Juan River overflowing its banks during floods led to inundation of settlements around it. More than 7,000 people lost their homes in the disaster. There have been calls for aid to the region, especially for a population living in poverty. TİKA officials delivered stationary sets including books and notebooks to 140 students at Andres Bello primary school and agricultural equipment to people of Primavera where farmers suffered losses in floods. Two years ago, TİKA was behind another humanitarian project for victims of floods that hit southern Colombia and sent 200 aid packages to the southern city of Mocoa.

TİKA, the country's leading development aid institution, boasts a decade of increased outreach to Latin America, with 172 projects spanning Venezuela to rural Colombia. The agency left its mark in Latin American countries with a string of projects from schools to training women for employment. It serves as one of the key players in Turkey's efforts to boost its ties with regional countries, offering both instant humanitarian aid and projects focusing on development in the long run, ranging from education, health and agriculture to infrastructure.",4/1/2019 0:00,"{'https://iadsb.tmgrup.com.tr/0c05f3/0/0/0/0/1000/666?u=https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/2019/04/01/1554072593963.jpg&mw=500', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=312463015800055&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/theme_dailysabah/images/daily-sabah-logo.svg', 'https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nu4qb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0', 'https://iadsb.tmgrup.com.tr/7ad432/1200/627/0/162/1000/684?u=https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/2019/04/01/1554072591354.jpg', 'https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nu4qb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0'}","['crescent', 'floodhit', 'turkish', 'floods', 'charities', 'red', 'aid', 'colombia', 'iranian', 'iran', 'humanitarian', 'ti̇ka', 'extend', 'agency']",,,flood
28,29,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Hospital evacuated in SW Iran as floods inundate cities - Iran (Islamic Republic of) - ReliefWeb,https://reliefweb.int/report/iran-islamic-republic/hospital-evacuated-sw-iran-floods-inundate-cities,"Ahvaz, April 8, IRNA - Authorities in southwestern Iran have evacuated a hospital as devastating floods are reaching vast areas of Khouzestan Province, the latest region to be hit by floods.

“Salamat Hospital of Ahvaz has been totally evacuated because of the possibility of inundation,” Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences said on Monday.

A public relations officer at the University said all 110 patients, who had been hospitalized at Salamat Hospital, have been transferred to two other regional hospitals.

Salamat Hospital of Ahvaz is located on kilometer 7 of a road that connects the provincial capital Ahvaz to the nearby city of Andimeshk. Built in 1997, it’s dedicated to the treatment of mentally-ill people.

The evacuation comes as a new wave of floods is encroaching on large cities in Khouzestan. Officials have issued warnings to the residents of hundreds of villages and cities, that lie on the banks of two rivers Karkhe and Dez, to evacuate their homes in a bid to avoid fatalities or further damages. However, there are reports that hundreds of people are staying at their homes in spite of their warnings.

A sum of 210 villages and six cities in Khouzestan, the latest scene of devastating floods, have been inundated. An emergency situation has been declared in the province.

Red Crescent Society of Iran, armed forces as well as civil societies are all mobilized to help the people affected by the flash floods that have wreaked havoc in dozens of Iranian provinces. 70 people have lost their lives, thousands have been injured and many others have been left homeless.

29,30,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran floods highlight rivalry between IRGC and spy agency | | AW - The Arab Weekly,https://thearabweekly.com/iran-floods-highlight-rivalry-between-irgc-and-spy-agency,"Following massive floods that inundated much of Iran, leaving dozens dead and hundreds injured, Iranian President Hassan Rohani curiously tasked his intelligence minister to visit Shiraz.

This sparked speculation and even mockery among Iranian social media users. After all, why did the president not send the Roads and Transportation minister or the Energy minister, whose authorities have more bearing on the problem?

Rohani’s decision, however, was by no means accidental and must be considered an attempt by the government to steal the limelight from Iranian Major-General Mohammad Ali Jaafari, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), who shamelessly used the natural disaster as a public relations campaign against the government.

“Had other governmental organisations used their resources in the same manner as the popular volunteers, the Basij, the Revolutionary Guards and other armed forces, it would have been helpful,” Jaafari complained on live television while visiting the disaster zones.

Iranian Intelligence Minister Seyed Mahmoud Alavi displayed great empathy when facing the victims of the floods, calling the incident “the bitterest event of the year” and abstaining from responding to Jaafari’s criticism.

He even showed magnanimity by not commenting on the obvious mistakes of the IRGC’s effort, in particular, the failed attempts to channel excess water from the disaster areas, but praised the crisis management of local authorities in Shiraz.

Alavi’s competition with Jaafari for public attention symbolises the deep inter-agency rivalry between the Intelligence Ministry and the IRGC intelligence organisation. Overlapping fields of responsibility between the two organisations keep them in a constant state of rivalry for authority, funding, personnel and the like.

In recent years, the Intelligence Ministry suffered several humiliating defeats to the IRGC.

Despite the expressed opposition of the Intelligence Ministry, the IRGC Intelligence Organisation arbitrarily arrested Iranian administrators of the cloud-based instant messaging system Telegram Messenger. The Iranian Judiciary, ignoring the Intelligence Ministry, usually sentences the administrators to prison.

In another public humiliation, contrary to the expert assessment of the Intelligence Ministry, the IRGC Intelligence Organisation arrested Abd al-Rasoul Dorri Esfahani, who represented the Central Bank of Iran in the nuclear negotiations, on espionage charges. Again ignoring the Intelligence Ministry, the Judiciary sentenced Dorri Esfahani to five years in prison.

Just as damaging to the Intelligence Ministry, the IRGC Intelligence Organisation, in another attack against the Intelligence Ministry’s portfolio, appears increasingly engaged in intelligence operations against the Iranian opposition abroad. Assassinations and failed bombing plots in the Netherlands, Denmark and France point to the competition between the two agencies for control over foreign operations.

Under Alavi’s stewardship, the Intelligence Ministry has embarked on structural changes to compete with its bureaucratic nemesis and rival. As apparent in the budget of the fiscal years 1397 and 1398 (March 21, 2018-March 21, 2020), the Intelligence Ministry is divided between internal and external services, which may reflect the need for compartmentalisation.

However, the budgets include a line titled “Establishing external intelligence and security infrastructure,” which may reflect increased funding for the ministry’s activities abroad.

The budgets display several lines concerning “enforcement of information technology sovereignty,” “improved cybersecurity,” “securing vital [cyber] infrastructure” and the like. This not only indicates a natural response to digital threats to the regime but also an attempt to compete with the cybercrimes unit and the IRGC’s so-called cyber army, which increasingly unleashes its forces against the opposition both at home and abroad.

Amid the massive floods, both agencies would be wise to forget their rivalry, at least for a moment, and help the victims but that probably is too much to ask of arch-rivals.",,"{'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_03_0.jpg?itok=SBwFeiGE', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_24_0.jpg?itok=L2PFTszL', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/user_profile_200x200/public/pictures/2017-12/ali%20alfoneh.png?h=170dab77&itok=G0f6u9Gf', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_20_0.jpg?itok=BiGSs9Lc', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_04_0.jpg?itok=SMwxycMy', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_16_0.jpg?itok=Rkefr_av', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_writer_280x240x2/public/pictures/2017-12/ali%20alfoneh.png?h=170dab77&itok=zz-r2Q2d', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_05_0.jpg?itok=QQXaauUB', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_15_0.jpg?itok=quHq39AC', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_10_0.jpg?itok=HhJNjJuW', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_23_0.jpg?itok=T19v7v4s', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_21_0.jpg?itok=EAY5Isvw', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_08_0.jpg?itok=sec4AuDI', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_18_0.jpg?itok=_yE8Wx_B', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_11_0.jpg?itok=dmWKbTw9', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_06_0.jpg?itok=frDvgSpk', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_19_0.jpg?itok=TYZ_kUxU', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_14_0.jpg?itok=mvUxEoqJ', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_01_0.jpg?itok=YMMSaD0P', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_12_0.jpg?itok=Of2WbHnL', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_13_0.jpg?itok=Cgse8Ryb', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2019-04/A17.jpg?itok=rPFapkvw', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_02_0.jpg?itok=bks0JipJ', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_17_0.jpg?itok=AZNM_I_4', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_22_0.jpg?itok=vqz6DQMK', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_07_0.jpg?itok=L_Ucv2hR', 'https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/home_pdf_images_380x590/public/2019-04/issue_200_page_09_0.jpg?itok=l-Al17st'}","['rivalry', 'public', 'irgc', 'floods', 'spy', 'jaafari', 'organisation', 'ministry', 'iranian', 'iran', 'minister', 'highlight', 'opposition', 'intelligence', 'agency']",,,flood

The supplies include trauma, health, cholera and non-communicable disease kits and other commodities requested by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

The floods have been caused by extreme rainfall which began on 19 March, provoking inundations in 28 out of the country’s 31 provinces and causing widespread damage to municipal facilities, including health centres and hospitals. Many health facilities in affected areas are either fully or partially damaged, and the risk of water- and vector-borne diseases, including malaria, cholera and other communicable diseases is increasing, also due to the interruption of the water supply.

According to an official statement by the Emergency Operations Centre of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, over 1 660 100 individuals are in need of health care services. Seventy eight people are confirmed dead and 1137 injured; close to 300 000 are displaced.

“Together with the United Nations country team led by the UN Resident Coordinator Ms Ugochi Daniels, WHO will continue to provide full support to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and the people in Islamic Republic of Iran to address urgent health needs and undertake recovery measures.” said Dr Christoph Hamelmann, WHO Representative in the country. He also asked the international community to make further funding available. “We want to express again our deep condolences to all of those who have lost loved ones and will do our best to provide assistance to those in need.”

“From the first day of the flooding, WHO has led and coordinated the health response of the UN country team in support of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education,” said Laleh Najfizadeh, WHO’s Health Emergency Programme Coordinator.

Beirut/Geneva, 3 April 2019 – As the flooding emergency in Iran worsens, the world’s largest humanitarian network has released just under 500,000 Swiss francs to bolster local Red Crescent relief efforts.

The funds released from IFRC’s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) will be used to provide 3,000 families that have lost homes and livelihoods with unconditional cash grants.

Sayed Hashem, IFRC’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said:

“Iran is under water. This is an unprecedented crisis that has now touched at least 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces. While the precise impact is still to be seen, it is already very clear that the floods have caused extensive damage and suffering in villages, cities and rural areas.”

The Iranian Red Crescent is at the forefront of humanitarian response efforts. According to figures provided by the Red Crescent, more than 11,000 of their relief workers have reached more than 192,000 people across the country with life-saving care and support.

“The Red Crescent response is massive, and it is growing every day. Red Crescent volunteers and staff have evacuated hundreds of people to safety, and have distributed food and items such as tents, blankets and health kits to tens of thousands of people,” said IFRC’s Hashem.

“But the scale of this crisis means that more help is needed. So, in addition to the funds we are providing, we are also working with our Red Crescent colleagues in Iran to see how we can expand our support.”

The floods started in mid-March in Golestan Province in north-east Iran and have now spread to at least 23 of the country’s 31 provinces. They are the result of unprecedented rain fall. For example, Golestan received 70 per cent of its annual rainfall in just one day in mid-March. Further heavy rain is expected over the coming days which will likely worsen the situation even further.",,"{'https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif', 'https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Logo-Square-RGB.svg', 'https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Logo-Horizontal-RGB.svg', 'https://media.ifrc.org/ifrc/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/53732643_130283804777877_7830504417904994007_n.jpg'}","['unprecedented', 'crescent', 'relief', 'announces', 'red', 'worsens', 'ifrcs', 'rain', 'flood', 'iran', 'supportthe', 'released', 'support', 'response', 'crisis', 'ifrc', 'water']",,,flood

The official death toll stands at 45 and even in the capital Tehran more than 20 neighborhoods have received text messages warning of strong winds and storms.

IMRO has also warned eleven provinces to expect strong rainstorms and high winds, accompanied by overflowing rivers and floods. In central Iran, Yazd Isfahan, Qom, northern Fars and the Tehran region have been warned about winds with storm intensity.

Khuzestan

In the oil-producing Khuzestan region, the greatest concern is about Karkheh Dam. Authorities decided to open the emergency flood gates on Sunday to prevent water from overflowing the dam. Emergency has already been declared in the province.

Aerial video of Karkheh dam shows water almost reaching the top.

This however means flooding for villages and towns lying on the path of the out-flowing water. Thousands of people have been evacuated in the province and many roads are now buried in water.

Lorestan

In the province of Lorestan, just north of Khuzestan, five more people have been reported lost to floods.

The situation in two towns is alarming. Flood waters have swamped the town of Noorabad, and the city of Dorood with a population of 23,000 is experiencing floods and also facing danger from a nearby dam, which is almost full.

Flooding in Noorabad, Lorestan

Deputy Governor of Lorestan has announced that villages around Dorood face serious danger and at least 25,000 people must be evacuated.

Kermanshah

The new storm front has caused heavy rains in the western province of Kermanshah Sunday afternoon and evening. Jalil Balaee general director of disaster management told Tasnim news agency that an evacuation warning has been issued for 19,000 people living near rivers.

Government agencies and many businesses were closed on Sunday and will keep their doors shut on Monday.

Other Regions

In Isfahan province, officials announced that water has surpassed the 57meter-high Golpaygan dam, which can hold 36.5 million cubic meters of water.

The situation in other areas in western Iran is also critical, with rivers breaking their banks and many roads becoming impassable.

Lack of Coordination and Politicization of the Disaster

After more than a week of flooding, Iranian officials continue to contradict one another and lack of planning becomes evident.

Sunday morning local government-controlled media in Ahvaz reported that several areas of the city must be evacuated. Later the governor of the city denied these reports and insisted there is no threat to the city.

A health official in Khuzestan announced that there is danger of sewage getting mixed up with drinking water. Hours later the general director of the water department said there is no reason to be concerned and “things are under control”.

At a higher level, disagreements between President Hassan Rouhani and the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) are still reverberating. The Guard continued its controversial demolition work using explosives to relieve flood water in Golestan and Khuzestan provinces.

Hossein Shriatmadari, an ultra-hardliner close to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei criticized Rouhani for not being thankful to the IRGC for their efforts in dealing with floods.

Unlike the first days of the floods, senior political and military officials have intensified their visits to various regions, often to show their presence to the people, who are still confused and in panic to deal with the natural disaster.

However, authorities are seen as unprepared, without clear plans and emergency agencies with insufficient budgets to deal with a large scale calamity.",,"{'https://gdb.rferl.org/B1DF1166-C998-4C33-8787-5EE3D1FE6D4A_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29853031&SiteId=82&r=158120207&it=0&pd=20190331212128', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/01784F78-DF64-4FC6-912A-5BCA372269B2_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/08944684-6F9D-4C7C-A91A-3F435D3799FC_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4872982E-408F-4DDC-B2C9-C8B60BB967D4_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/E022CB35-DC0A-4AE1-8065-8520545D8EBD_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/8F10775F-57DE-44A1-8137-E1AAEFE914F3_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/ABE8E20F-FC47-4B9E-A255-AC1690444787_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/38632599?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3anew%20storm%20dumps%20more%20rain%20in%20iran%2c%20as%20dams%20threatened%20and%20government%20in%20confusion&c6=new%20storm%20dumps%20more%20rain%20in%20iran%2c%20as%20dams%20threatened%20and%20government%20in%20confusion&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=new%20storm%20dumps%20more%20rain%20in%20iran%2c%20as%20dams%20threatened%20and%20government%20in%20confusion&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=top-stories&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29853031&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/01784F78-DF64-4FC6-912A-5BCA372269B2_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/060E77F5-9D99-41FE-B2A4-9260141D9EE8_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg'}","['warned', 'storm', 'strong', 'khuzestan', 'winds', 'dams', 'officials', 'rain', 'western', 'iran', 'threatened', 'province', 'confusion', 'dumps', 'dam', 'water']",,,flood
35,36,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Scientist On Death Row In Iran Speaks To Radio Farda On Floods - RadioFarda,https://en.radiofarda.com/a/scientist-on-death-row-in-iran-speaks-to-radio-farda-on-floods/29847473.html,"While Iran is struggling with its flood crisis, a top expert who is on death row told Radio Farda from Iran’s notorious Evin prison that authorities should strengthen the country’s early warning system.

Radio Farda interviewed Ahmad Reza Jalali (Djalali), a Swedish- Iranian dual national who is facing the death sentence on charges of ""Enmity with God through espionage.""

Jalali, a medical doctor and an expert on crisis management, explained in the interview the ways of confronting the crises caused by recent floods in Iran.

During the interview, a pre-recorded message on the prison's telecom system was played automatically. The message is played during all conversations to and from the prison making it known that the person on the line is a prisoner.

The interview was conducted through a third party, as it would be impossible for media outlets to call a prisoner at Evin for an interview.

Devastating floods swept across a large part of Iran during the past week, covering 28 of the country's 31 provinces, leaving tens of people dead and causing serious damage to people's property.

Speaking from Evin prison, Jalali said that officials can reduce the extent of damage through an early warning system and prevent more damages by training the people and exercising ways of surviving the crisis.

He warned people in the flood-hit areas to be careful about possible contamination of drinking water in the affected areas.

Jalali said that because of Iran's dry climate, most emergency drills were focused on earthquakes and that officials have ignored the threat of floods.

In this interview, Jalali said that the reasons for massive floods during the past week in Iran included the destruction of natural plant coverage, obstruction of flood outlets as the case of flash flood in Shiraz and converting flood routes and dry river beds to residential areas.

Jalali also explained different ways of evacuating flood-hit areas and pumping out residual water. He called on citizens to pay careful attention to warnings issued by the authorities, and act according to their instructions.

He said gathering at flood hit areas and ""flood watching"" are the worst kind of behavior in critical conditions.

Sweden-based Ahmad Reza Jalali, a guest lecturer at the VUB (Open) university in Brussels, was arrested on charges of ""espionage"" during a visit to Iran in 2016 to take part at a scientific conference, and was subsequently sentenced to death at the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran.

Several international human rights organizations as well as UN legal experts have strongly protested against the verdict, which was later confirmed by the Iranian Supreme Court.

Jalali's lawyers say that the death sentence was handed to Jalali, based on ""confessions"" he made under duress and that they disagree with the charges made against him.

Jalali's family in Iran and Sweden have told the press that charges were made against him after he refused to obey Iranian intelligence organization's instruction to spy on other Iranian scientists abroad.",,"{'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/46AA8D06-4E43-4E07-B84D-B66ACDFE652B.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/01C87E4F-5ED3-4A96-8754-B27A54374E54_w250_r0_s.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/1507678251?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3ascientist%20on%20death%20row%20in%20iran%20speaks%20to%20radio%20farda%20on%20floods&c6=scientist%20on%20death%20row%20in%20iran%20speaks%20to%20radio%20farda%20on%20floods&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=scientist%20on%20death%20row%20in%20iran%20speaks%20to%20radio%20farda%20on%20floods&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=iran-in-depth&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29847473&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/7BE819E4-3E33-438F-9CE5-4410BAC5FBD3_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/7BE819E4-3E33-438F-9CE5-4410BAC5FBD3_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/D51C5515-2CD2-4580-BB87-46AE0D67AFD7.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29847473&SiteId=82&r=924422077&it=0&pd=20190328110723', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/7BE819E4-3E33-438F-9CE5-4410BAC5FBD3_w1200_r1.jpg'}","['speaks', 'farda', 'floods', 'prison', 'jalali', 'row', 'flood', 'iranian', 'iran', 'charges', 'interview', 'ways', 'radio', 'scientist', 'death']",,,flood
37,38,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Activists: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Fire on Protesters in Deadly Flood Confrontation - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/middle-east/voa-news-iran/activists-irans-revolutionary-guards-fire-protesters-deadly-flood,"This article originated in VOA's Persian Service.

Exiled Iranian opposition activists say Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has fired on protesters who tried to stop it from diverting floodwaters in a southwestern town, resulting in a protester's death.

The activists said the protester died after being shot by IRGC forces in Wednesday's predawn confrontation in the Dasht-e-Azadegan district of Khuzestan province. They said minority Iranian Arab residents of the area, also known as Ahwazis, were trying to stop the IRGC from destroying a dyke and diverting floodwaters into their farmland.

The Iran National Council for Free Elections opposition group said the IRCG forces wanted to divert floodwaters to prevent them from entering IRCG-controlled oil installations in the neighboring town of Susangerd. In a Wednesday Instagram post, the group said one protester was killed and several were wounded by IRGC fire.

In a series of tweets posted Thursday, London-based Ahwazi activist Karim Dahimi identified the dead protester as Aboud Jalizi and posted images of the man's body. Washington-based rights group Abdorrahman Boroumand Center shared Dahimi's reports about Jalizi on its Twitter feed and told VOA Persian that it considered Dahimi to be a reliable source. However, there was no official confirmation of the protester's death in Iranian state media.

In a nighttime video of the confrontation received by VOA Persian from an audience member in Iran, bursts of gunfire can be heard.

A Wednesday report by Iran's IRGC-affiliated Fars news agency confirmed that shots were fired in the incident and said two policemen and a villager were injured. Fars said authorities tried to persuade the villagers to evacuate their homes and allow the destruction of the dyke in return for compensation. It also said the dyke was removed later in the day.

Earlier Wednesday, Iranian state-backed news agency ISNA quoted IRGC spokesman Brig. Gen. Ramezan Sharif as denying what he called ""rumors disseminated by hostile media"" about IRGC units confronting residents in Khuzestan.

In a report published Thursday, Fars cited Iranian emergency services spokesman Mojtaba Khalidi as saying the death toll from a series of flash floods that began affecting Iran on March 19 has risen to 70, with hundreds of people injured.

Iranian leaders have drawn a torrent of criticism on social media for their perceived slow response to the disaster, which also has caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to agriculture and transportation networks around the country.",,"{'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_iran_election.jpg?itok=7pPjQiWm', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/logo.svg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/2021-05-24T105615Z_2043007219_RC2AMN9NLSWV_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-IAEA.JPG?itok=qlBojeC7', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/E5127208-E65D-45BD-AA91-0B5858D2B5BD.jpg', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_iran_flag2.jpg?itok=N88Gkoy7', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/medium/s3/2019-04/A18E9146-0791-4BF3-8C41-CE7D900FCFE0.jpg?itok=gamJzSpZ', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/ap-images/2021/05/5232c91be8ebce6d16979f0ec413cc7b.jpg?itok=nA8zkFeX', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/reuters-images/2021/04/reuters_com_2021_newsml_RC2N3N93N0U9.jpg?itok=Mu6tqUFE', 'https://www.voanews.com/core/themes/stable/images/core/throbber-active.gif', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/892x501/s3/2019-04/E5127208-E65D-45BD-AA91-0B5858D2B5BD.jpg?itok=X1X4ApYU'}","['persian', 'guards', 'confrontation', 'irgc', 'protesters', 'group', 'flood', 'iranian', 'iran', 'floodwaters', 'fars', 'revolutionary', 'deadly', 'protester', 'activists', 'irans', 'voa']",,,flood
38,39,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Demonizing and Dehumanizing Iran – LobeLog - LobeLog,https://lobelog.com/demonizing-and-dehumanizing-iran/,"by Shireen Hunter

Commenting on the devastating and widespread floods that have engulfed 26 of Iran’s 31 provinces, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo essentially blamed this huge natural disaster on the Iranian government’s mismanagement. He has a valid point. By undoing all earlier reforms, Iran’s revolutionary government allowed predatory forces to take over national and private lands and to build whatever they wanted, wherever they wanted, including in dry river beds. In a hurry to get rich, the new clerical and revolutionary elites and their offspring ignored all environmental safety measures.

Thus, throughout the last four decades there was no adequate maintenance of riverbeds, including regular cleaning and proper management of water resources. Then came a dam-building mania without sufficient study of environmental consequences. Refusal to use foreign experts on the pretext of self-sufficiency contributed to serious engineering shortcomings. The IRGC construction arm built most of these dams, which was a highly lucrative endeavor. The best example is the Gatwand dam in Khuzestan Province, which is now devastated by floods. Other mistakes have included building railroads in flood plains and paving over dry riverbeds.

Meanwhile, foreign military adventures took funds away from needed domestic water-management projects. The leadership’s foreign policy mistakes—especially fighting against so-called imperialism, or as the Supreme Leader recently said, battling evil—dried up international commerce and investment and stopped the flow of technology, even before the harshest of American sanctions were imposed.

Iran’s mistakes, however, do not excuse the heartlessness of the Trump administration’s policy of doing all it can to prevent aid to Iran’s flood victims. The American sanctions policy regarding Iran is like a medieval siege aimed at starving the enemy by exhausting its food resources until it surrenders.

Iran’s Islamic government began the process of mutual alienation that has produced the lack of U.S. compassion. Those who staged the 1979-81 hostage crisis bear a great responsibility in generating current American hostility. They are also responsible for the revolution’s radical turn that has caused tremendous damage to Iran and the Iranian people. Also, without the hostage crisis, Iraq’s Saddam Hussein could not have gotten away with invading Iran. Another factor was Ayatollah Khomeini’s decision to make the fight against America the cornerstone of the revolutionary regime in revenge for what he saw as American support for the shah.

Since the late 1980s, however, it has largely been the United States that has refused the path of reconciliation unless Iran completely surrenders. In the process, it has undermined moderate forces in Iran. Its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, which undercut those Iranians who argued that a different relationship with the United States could be possible, is only the latest example of this approach.

After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, America and some of its regional allies have found in Iran a convenient enemy figure and scapegoat for their own policy mistakes. Thus, using the Iran scarecrow, they sold billions of dollars’ worth of arms to Arabs. They’ve tried to bring about Arab-Israeli reconciliation, not as a genuine effort to resolve the Palestinian problem but rather to reinforce common enmity toward Iran. Lately, the apocalyptic outlook of some key U.S. political figures has further consolidated Iran’s enemy image.

As part of this strategy, there has been a systematic efforts in the United States for the past 30 years to demonize not only the Islamic regime but Iran and its people. Even Iran’s pre-Islamic history has not been immune to this demonization. Some years ago, a well-known Iran analyst said that Iran was responsible for the very creation of evil, not just its recognition or identification. Hollywood movies have mined the history of Greco-Persian relations, portraying Iranians as savages, conveniently forgetting how Alexander burned Persepolis and killed or exiled its inhabitants.

For centuries, much of the West has defined itself against Iran, beginning with ancient Greece. Yet Greek thought and aesthetics were influenced by Iran; Persepolis was the inspiration for the Pantheon. Iran was one of the few places in the known ancient world that Rome did not conquer. Thus, Iran has always represented an intellectual rival and not merely a military challenge to the West. Europe’s post-Christian secular identity, built on this Greco-Roman heritage, consolidated this old view of Iran in modern European minds and thus also in America’s.

Over the centuries, Iran and its indigenous culture have been much diminished. But there is still a spark underneath the ashes of a once glorious civilization, which periodically seeks a renaissance. But often it has succumbed to its own and its leaders’ weaknesses as well as the policies of other powers. In the last 250 years, this has meant colonial or neo-imperialist powers.

Given this history, current U.S. attitudes toward victims of the recent flooding is no surprise. What is important is whether Iran, as a fundamentalist Islamic state or something else, is doomed to eternal enmity with the United States or whether the two countries can find common ground. As long as the current team is in Washington and hardliners continue to sacrifice Iran’s national interest in pursuit of some unattainable Islamist utopia, there is no room for optimism.",2019-04-09 20:11:57+00:00,"{'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/Hassan_Rouhani_press_conference_following_2017_election_victory_13-150x150.jpg', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/President_Hassan_Rouhani_and_FM_Javad_Zarif_in_Saadabad_Palace_02-1-150x150.jpg', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ca91c990bbf1ebb5923dee063dd5a944?s=50&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D50&r=PG', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bd2c5ebe2053a51f4aeb09f0b0e5e160?s=50&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D50&r=PG', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/10e2d0a149b3528daa1abb0d4ab83703?s=50&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D50&r=PG', 'https://lobelog.com/avatars/img_1939-crop1.jpg', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpmerkelmacron-1-150x150.jpg', 'https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/print-button-gray.png', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/77b542aa-58d7-40f2-996c-8ee5df36bbe4.jpg', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/201197831d9e7d8e10daeb158b677870?s=50&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D50&r=PG', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/lobelog-jim-lobe-logo.png', 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d42c02585d808ee0cf830008ccc6ad9a?s=50&d=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D50&r=PG', 'https://lobelog.com/wp-content/uploads/irannnn-300x200.jpg'}","['islamic', 'american', 'history', 'policy', 'iran', 'demonizing', 'dehumanizing', 'states', 'revolutionary', 'mistakes', 'irans', 'united']",,,flood

Heavy rains outside the city of Shiraz triggered the sudden flooding, according to the head of Iran’s emergency medical services, Pirhossein Koulivand.

State TV earlier said most of the people killed had been trying to take videos of the flooding on their phones.

The provinces of Fars, Kurdistan, Qom and Isfahan were on alert for imminent flooding, and the water authority in the capital, Tehran, said floods were a possibility there as well.

Enayatollah Rahimi, governor of Fars province, said the flooding is under control and aid work is in progress, but asked people “to stay in their homes,” the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.

The northern provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran have been struggling with flooding for over a week, and five people have been killed, according to the state-run Press TV channel.

Over 56,000 people have been affected in various cities and rural areas in the two provinces as a result of heavy rainfall that hit on March 19 and 20.

Iran’s metrology department had warned about the heavy rains in various areas across Iran.

41,42,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran's Hurricane Katrina moment - Atlantic Council,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/iran-s-hurricane-katrina-moment/,"A man paddles through the flood waters in Gorgan, Golestan province (IRNA)

Iranian authorities barred international journalists from covering the disastrous floods that have stricken most of the country’s provinces and caused death and mayhem during the normally festive two-week Nowruz holidays that follow the Iranian new year. Not even the smattering of foreign journalists still huddled precariously in Tehran were granted permission to head to Golestan and Mazandaran provinces or even Shiraz to speak with victims, rescue workers, and good Samaritans—something reporters do during natural disasters all over the world, including recent floods in Nebraska and Mozambique.

So tightly and firmly do Iranian authorities want to maintain control over the messaging over the flood that, with the exception of reporters from state television and the official state news agency, even Iranian journalists were kept away for President Hassan Rouhani’s visit to the disaster scenes in the southern province of Khuzestan. This came after angry protesters confronted Rouhani during his visit to flood zones in Golestan. “I have three children,” one woman cried to him. “Attend to our suffering!”

To find out what’s happening in Iran in the wake of the floods, the world is forced to piece together a narrative based on amateur video trickling out of the country on social media and messaging apps.

And what a story the videos tell.

Horrific images include Iranians clinging for dear life on traffic posts as floods wash away others away, entire towns inundated with muddy water, Iranian motorists stuck inside their cars as unceasing waters carried them off. In all at least 44 people were killed in the nationwide floods. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of transportation infrastructure has been destroyed, including 314 bridges, according to local press.

But the videos also showed scenes of heroism and solidarity. A man in Fars province struggles to save a woman and child being swept away by floodwaters. Villagers in Kermanshah province work together to save farm animals from drowning.

Meanwhile authorities looked pathetic. In an ostensible attempt to prevent fraud, but also to ban heroes from emerging outside the elite circle of power, the judiciary banned celebrities from raising funds for the flood victims, instead demanding that all donations go to the government or official charities.

Mostly bigwigs showed up at the flood zone for infuriating photo ops, in what will likely be remembered throughout Iran as the country’s Hurricane Katrina moment, when the administration of George W. Bush so badly bungled its response to the 2005 Louisiana hurricane that it defined the rest of his presidency.

In one scene in Iran, a bigtime Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) officer meekly dips his hand into the floodwater, as if by his very gesture he could reverse the tide.

Heavy rains continue to batter most Iranian provinces.

Clearly the regime was caught unaware and unprepared for the disaster in part because of the Nowruz holidays. The governor of Golestan province, now fired, was apparently abroad somewhere. Rouhani himself was resting on Qeshm Island in the Persian Gulf.

But holidays didn’t stop ever-vigilante IRGC thugs from stopping and arresting Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from departing unhindered from Tehran as she visited her family during Nowruz holidays in April 2016. If they were so tightly prepared that they could identify a young mother traveling with her 22-month-old daughter as a threat to national security, they could surely have foreseen heavy storms meteorologists had been warning of for days, and gathered bags of sand and mobilized officials ahead of the deluge. That’s especially true since places like the north of Iran regularly suffer from flooding.

The regime claims to have maximum control over all aspects of life in Iran. Though that sounds totalitarian to non-Iranians, the promise of security and stability appeals to many inside the country collectively traumatized by the the chaotic disasters that befell Iran in the twentieth century.

But the floods showed what a paper tiger the regime is. People are largely left to fend for themselves as ineffectual hardline regime stalwarts bark orders or stage photo ops.

Like the military-dominated regimes in Egypt and Algeria, Iran under the sway of the IRGC is weak and incompetent. It’s also brittle. State television on March 29 cut off a live broadcast of a crisis management meeting chaired by Rouhani after one official complained about a lack of opportunity for participants to express their concerns about the floods.

A defensive Rouhani said it was “impossible” to prevent floods, pointing to the 2011 tsunami in Japan and even the recent floods in Nebraska as examples.

But Iranians are outraged. Even if unpreventable, how could a regime that spends so many resources on controversial troop deployments and missile advancements claim not to be able to mitigate the damage. One Iranian man posted a video of himself directly addressing Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the leaders of the IRGC.

“You gave so much for Syria, what did you get out of it?” he says. “People are being destroyed by this flooding. Our own children are drowning. You who didn’t want Israel to exist in twenty years, with this situation, our country won’t see another year.”

There’s only one way for Iran to take advantage of the floods, and that is if the Trump administration begins mouthing off about the issue. That will give the regime the ability to cast the many critical of its performance as stooges of the west.

US policymakers should understand that Iran’s inability to respond to the floods in the most basic way, and it’s unwillingness to listen to the environmental scientists who have for years warned of Iran’s impending water management crises, is a far bigger condemnation of the regime than any tweet by National Security Advisor John Bolton or State Department press release.

Slideshow ( 2 images )

Flooding caused by heavy rains started spreading on Thursday and left a trail of devastation across seven provinces, said Hasibullah Shir Khani, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s National Disaster Management Authority.

Another 12 people were missing and more than 700 houses were destroyed or severely damaged, he added.

The floods worsen an already desperate situation. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced in the region by last year’s severe drought and the 17-year-long war with the Taliban.

Floods in early March caused further destruction and put this year’s wheat harvest at risk.

“My house and my farmland have been destroyed by floods. If you go and see the destruction it makes you cry,” said Shir Ahmad, who lives in a village in Herat province, which borders Iran.

Children waded through muddy, knee-deep floodwaters that flowed through tent camps for displaced people after the rain stopped. Some families strung salvageable clothes and bedding to dry.

Floods have destroyed hundreds of homes, some historic sites, thousands of acres of farmland, bridges and highways, said Jilani Farhad, a spokesman for the province.

Floods are a common occurrence in Afghanistan, although not usually this severe. The country has little infrastructure, such as ditches and sewers, to manage water run-off from rain or melting snow.

“There is huge destruction caused by floods,” said Ahmad Jawed Nadem, head of refugees and repatriation for Herat. In one area, he said he saw more than 200 destroyed houses.

In Herat alone, eight people were killed, said Dr. Abdul Hakim Tamana, head of public health for the province.

“They had the drought problem, and the floods and the conflict. They are very poor people and they lose all they have,” the Afghan Red Crescent Society’s secretary general Nilab Mobarez said.

“It’s not as simple as they will go on with their lives.”

World Vision said it appeared tens of thousands of Afghans were affected. Some residents of Badghis province were calling it the worst storm in 20 years, it said.

Some of these, who are mostly volunteers, rode in small boats to deliver necessary elements to the people stranded in the flood waters like fresh food, blankets, drinking water, and even toys for children to keep their hearts warm during such tough times. The Setad's medical team set up temporary clinics to help treat the injured and deliver medicine and treatment to the sick. The Setad also provided 15,000 families with house equipment to replace what the floods had destroyed, such as fridges, washing machines, carpets, and other necessary elements. Many of these families living in rural areas raised cattle, where more than 9,000 of cattle were killed during the natural disaster. The Setad was able to replace 4,000 of these, instantly providing many of the families with their previous work so that they would not end up jobless. Most of the services of Setad are delivered through the Barakat Foundation.

The officials of the organization promised that as soon as the areas are cleaned and normal life is retained after the floods, they will be able to provide some 3,000 job opportunities to the citizens of these areas.

According to sources, the Setad organization has also been delivering help to the citizens south of the country. So it is not only Aggala town benefiting from their services, but also Shalamsheh in the Southern province of Khouzistan.

Also, compressors and rebuilding and reconstruction equipment were provided by the Setad to help accelerate the process of reconstruction and help the people resume their normal lives. Other areas, too, including Shiraz, Ilam, Lorestan, and others, are benefiting from the services of the organization, which aims at resolving the problems on the different levels with the help of the mobilization forces.

Before flooding hit the country, Setad insured 140,000 rural homes in Khouzistan under the Barakat Insurance plan. The damaged homes will be repaid to rebuild their homes in the area.

For those who do not know, in general, Setad's main activities are aimed to create jobs for people and the economic and social empowerment of deprived people.

Implementation of construction and infrastructure projects, creating jobs in deprived areas, providing house equipment and paying for the treatment of patients with serious illnesses are among the other activities of Setad.

TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The heavy downpours and massive flooding in most parts of Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan have reached an alarming level.

Volume of major water reservoirs and rivers have critically increased, causing the authorities to evacuate more residential areas adjacent to the dams and rivers.

The water volume in Karun, Iran's major river, has increased to an alarming level of 3,200 cubic meters per second, local media reported Tuesday.

Besides, Karkheh Dam, a large multi-purpose dam built on the Karkheh River, has been filled to the maximum level of its capacity, said Gholamreza Shariati, governor of Khuzestan.

Habitats in the towns of Soosangerd, Bostan and Hamidiya and some villages are at the risk of facing river overflows and dam outpours.

Women, children and the elderly in those areas have been relocated despite some resistance to leave homes.

Shariati has said the young men can stay in their towns or villages to help the rescue and relief operators protect their homes and cities against the floods.

The unprecedented rains over the past weeks in the province have damaged the infrastructures, including the roads and bridges, and incurred millions of U.S. dollars of losses to the agricultural sector.

At least 70 people have been killed and hundreds of others injured since intense rains started to hit some 21 provinces in the north, west and southwest of Iran three weeks ago.",4/10/2019 0:00,"{'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137960493_1314756355_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/10/137963497_15548903773841n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137960448_1554726496007_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137959888_1554706516942_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137955524_1554557997937_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137963904_1554853511306_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137957763_1554644566601_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137963906_1554853229302_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/static/images/Eng_xhApp_v1.png', 'http://www.newsimg.cn/english/20170321/images/close.png', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/20161108new/images/logo.jpg', 'http://webd.home.news.cn/1.gif?z=1&_wdxid=010020070750000000000000011100001379634971', 'http://www.newsimg.cn/english/20170321/images/banner.png', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137962753_1554798638795_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137963529_1554852252750_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/titlepic/137958178_1554678758311_title1n.jpg', 'http://www.newsimg.cn/english/20170321/images/menu.png'}","['xinhua', 'flooding', 'dam', 'downpours', 'southwestern', 'reach', 'level', 'province', 'river', 'weeks', 'alarming', 'irans', 'khuzestan']",,,flood

Highlights

Heavy seasonal rains caused flooding and damage in several governorates over a 10-day period

Central and northern governorates worst-affected, primarily regions through which the Tigris River runs and those areas adjacent to Iran

Governmental crisis cells have been activated in both federal Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq where necessary

Humanitarian response needs are largely being met by Civil Defense teams and NGOs; OCHA is monitoring sectoral needs

Mosul Dam deemed “safe,” and in no danger of exceeding its capacity; other dams throughout Iraq at or near capacity, but authorities report water levels are within manageable levels

Limited damage reported in a small number of IDP camps; contingency planning and preparedness measures had been put in place after earlier flooding episodes

Situation Overview

On 24-March-2019, meteorological authorities alerted the public to the possibility of heavy rains and flooding throughout Iraq. Severe weather is a normal feature of Iraq’s winter season, and this most recent episode follows other periods of torrential rainfall in November/December 2018. However, the Government of Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government, and humanitarian actors had engaged in contingency planning and preparedness measures to ensure they were better equipped to deploy emergency response activities in reaction to the latest bout of flooding.

Heavy storms continually recurred throughout the country during the period from 24-March to 2-April when severe weather finally eased. The effects of the storms were recorded in multiple governorates, including Anbar, Basra, Dahuk, Diyala, Kirkuk, Missan, Muthanna, Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Sulaymaniyah, and Wassit; however, the harshest impacts appeared to be in central and northern governorates, primarily regions through which the Tigris River runs, and those areas adjacent to Iran. (The Iranian provinces of Lorestan, Khuzestan and Ilam, which border eastern Iraq, were also profoundly affected by severe weather; the Government of Iran did not formally request international assistance, but OCHA has temporarily surged staff to assist in monitoring the response, which was welcomed by the authorities.)

While flooding in Mosul (Ninewa governorate), caused the closure of five main bridges (Alnasr, Alhurriyya, Qanatir, Suwais and Qayyarah), municipal authorities gave assurances on 2-April that Mosul Dam—Iraq’s largest, which supplies hydroelectric power to Mosul city—was functioning normally. Other dams throughout Iraq, particularly in Diyala governorate, were operating at or near capacity; however, provincial leadership expressed confidence that standard discharge and overflow functions would suffice to meet any surplus.

No fatalities have been recorded due to the recent period of severe weather in Iraq, although approximately 90 casualties have been reported in Iran and Afghanistan due to related heavy rains and flooding.

Kirkuk, Salah al-Din and Sulaymaniyah governorates were among those most acutely impacted by the severe weather.

The Aon report described other major catastrophe events during the month including:

Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on March 15 with wind speeds reaching 115 mph. The storm caused storm surge, heavy rain and wind damage, while lingering rainfall led to catastrophic flooding and a humanitarian crisis across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. More than 1,100 people were killed across Southern Africa and hundreds more are missing. More than 3 million people were affected. Total economic damage to infrastructure in Mozambique alone was estimated at US$1 billion.

Windstorm Eberhard swept through parts of Western and Central Europe on March 10, bringing widespread damage and disruption. Two people were killed. The storm resulted in nearly one million power outages and tens of thousands of filed property claims. The hardest-hit areas were in Germany. With economic and insured losses minimally expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of euros, Eberhard became the costliest event of the 2018/19 windstorm season in Europe.

50,51,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Deadly flooding around the world is a warning of the cascading impacts of climate change - ThinkProgress,https://archive.thinkprogress.org/deadly-flooding-climate-change-impacts/,"The cascading effects of deadly floods currently impacting millions of people around the world is a sign, experts say, of just how much work needs to be done to prepare for what climate change has in store.

Decimated crops will lead to increased food insecurity, stagnant waters will spread diseases, and as homes, schools, and businesses are swept away by the floodwaters, many will flee — if they’re able to. And all of this is taking place right now, not just in the United States, but across Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Iran.

At the same time flash floods from torrential downpours hit 25 of Iran’s 35 provinces, and Cyclone Idai made landfall in southeastern Africa, the Midwestern United States was submerged by a combination of melting snow and a “bomb cyclone” that brought the worst flooding in half a century to Nebraska.

The damages to homes and farms in the Midwest are expected to total at least $3 billion. Cyclone Idai, the worst disaster to hit the region in 20 years, was said to have destroyed 90% of Beira, Mozambique, the country’s fourth largest city and home to 1.5 million people. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people have been displaced by floods in Iran amid fresh warnings that some dams could overflow.

Collectively, more than a 1,000 people have died as a result of these floods, and thousands of others are likely still missing.

“The floods should be a serious wake up call for all of us,” said Yassamin Ansari, principal adviser at climate group Mission 2020. Ansari was on the climate team that helped advise United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the landmark Paris climate agreement.

“Just like the devastating recent fires in California, the floods show that climate change is here now and none of us are immune to it,” she said. “And this is just the beginning.”

While studies evaluating the degree to which climate change influenced any one of these particular events have yet to be done, what science has confirmed is that a warming atmosphere and hotter oceans means more intense storms.

“At the very basic level, what we can say is that the warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, so we are expecting to see events that are more severe,” Deepti Singh, assistant professor at Washington State University Vancouver’s School of the Environment, explained to ThinkProgress.

Singh, an expert in human-caused extreme weather, pointed to the fact that data already shows the intensity of precipitation events in the Midwest has increased by 42% compared to earlier in the 20th century. And as the congressionally-mandated National Climate Assessment warned last fall, climate change is only going to make flooding in the region worse. That’s not a distant threat; more unprecedented flooding is expected this spring, according to a recent government forecast.

Warmer waters also fuel cyclones and hurricanes, making the storms wetter and stronger as climate change intensifies. And as seas rise, so do storm surges, bringing more water onto the land.

But it’s not just the immediate impact of vast swaths of land suddenly becoming muddy lakes that matters. It’s what comes next that will have an even longer impact — weeks, months, or even years after the waters recede.

“Climate change is a reality and the extent of devastation and toll upon lives and livelihoods is a clear sign that we are unprepared,” Gautam Narasimhan, UNICEF’s senior climate adviser, and Antony Spalton, resilience specialist, told ThinkProgress via email.

First came the cholera

Treating disease is one of the most pressing “secondary impacts” that come after the initial impacts associated with simply surviving the storm.

In what health officials have called a second disaster, more than 1,700 people are thought to have been infected with cholera in Mozambique since an outbreak was declared at the end of March.

Other health risks include diarrhea along with diseases spread by mosquitoes — such as dengue, malaria, or West Nile fever — which make breeding grounds of standing water.

According to Narasimhan and Spalton, medical experts estimate that 90% of the “disease burden from climate change” will be borne by children under the age of five. In Mozambique alone, UNICEF estimates there are 900,000 children that need urgent disaster assistance.

The impact from these disease outbreaks can last a long time. In 2005, for instance, India experienced one of its worst flooding events in Mumbai. Several months later people were still dealing with persistent health impacts from waterborne diseases.

So, while the initial flood event might be short-lived, “we see the impacts of that for several months or even years following these events,” said Singh. “We’re not prepared for that, and that’s kind of affecting the impact that this disaster [in southeastern Africa] is having right now.”

Food supply shock

In the case of all three floods, each came after a period of intense drought. This “whiplash” between very dry periods, followed by very wet periods, is exactly what we can expect from climate change, said Singh. And with dry soil comes greater risk of erosion and more flooding since the ground doesn’t absorb water as well.

All of this puts the food supply at risk. After a difficult dry period impacting crops, now suddenly the water is washing out a lot of farmland right when the crops that did grow are supposed to be harvested. “This is just going to aggravate food insecurity,” said Singh, particularly in southeastern Africa and Iran.

Farmers in Zimbabwe’s worst-hit areas said the cyclone hit on the eve of harvest, after what had already been a poor crop year due to an El Nino-induced drought. And early estimates put the losses to Iran’s agriculture sector at $350 million.

In the Midwest, farmers are also bracing for a serious financial hit. Earlier this week, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture won’t be compensating farmers in Nebraska and Iowa for losses to crops that had already been harvested and stored in now water-logged grain bins, silos, or other storage areas.

So, when it comes to questions about how best to prepare, they key is not only better early warning systems and weather predictions, it’s also about safeguards like crop insurance and mechanisms to support economic losses, said Singh.

Impacts to agricultural productivity can also drive migration away from farmlands toward urban areas, said Narasimhan and Spalton of longer-term systemic impacts from floods. In addition, these various climate-induced changes to agricultural productivity can weaken or reduce the nutritional value of the food.

Roads, schools, and levees

It’s estimated that more than 32,000 classrooms have been damaged in Mozambique, along with 54 health facilities. “Beyond the immediate loss of access to education and health services, the knock-on impacts of, for example, not completing a quality education are significant in terms of livelihoods and job opportunities for this generation of young people,” explained Narasimhan and Spalton.

To better mitigate this in the future, they recommend that schools be built above flood levels, preparedness drills be put in place, and that school curricula include climate adaptation lessons.

Beyond homes, businesses, and schools, much of the damage currently incurred is to infrastructure directly related to protecting people from flooding. In the Midwest, dozens of levees have been destroyed; if not immediately repaired, a broken levee system will spell trouble for the rest of the spring flooding season. (It typically takes about six months to repair a levee.)

Meanwhile, in Iran’s southwestern province of Khuzestan, it was reported this week that dams were just two feet from cresting. Electricity and telecommunications had been cut in affected areas, local media reported this week, while roads washed away and people took to their rooftops, waiting to be rescued. More rainfall is expected over the weekend.

‘It’s on us’ to act

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether it’s North America, Africa, or the Middle East, there is no escape from climate change.

“Even if you’re living in the developed world, we’re already seeing some of the consequences of climate change… [we’re] still vulnerable to these kinds of disasters,” said Singh.

“The other aspect of it is the injustice of climate change,” she continued. “There are people in places who have contributed the least to the issue that are being affected the most severely, that are the most vulnerable.”

Poverty alleviation, she said, is therefore “probably one of the most important things we can do” to help better-prepare and protect vulnerable populations. Many people impacted by these floods won’t have additional resources to immediately recover, especially if their livelihoods were primarily dependent on agriculture. And while some may want to relocate, that might not always be an option. “Do they have the ability to go relocate somewhere else?” asked Singh.

“As somebody once said, disasters seek out the most vulnerable and ensure they remain so,” Narasimhan and Spalton said.

And it isn’t just a question of reducing emissions, Ansari said. While curbing greenhouse gases is certainly important, and necessary, so too is adaptation and resilience. “The longer we delay adaptation, the more expensive it will be both in terms of money and lives cost,” she said. “We have to radically accelerate actions on both fronts.”

“This isn’t a problem to be left for future generations to solve,” she added. “It’s on us.”",,{'https://archive.thinkprogress.org/uploads/2019/04/flooding-climate-change-global-world-international-impacts-unprepared.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1'},"['climate', 'flooding', 'floods', 'warning', 'impacts', 'cascading', 'narasimhan', 'mozambique', 'events', 'world', 'deadly', 'change', 'health', 'cyclone']",,,flood

Red Crescent is in the region to support the affected households.

Two Red Crescent helicopters are present in the province but air relief services are being carried out with difficulty due to harsh weather conditions. Also, because of the cutting off of connection paths, the relief operations are being carried out slowly on land.

Sarem Rezayi, Managing Director of Lorestan provincial Red Crescent branch, said: “Currently the connection paths of 15 villages are severed in Pol-dokhtar. There is no access to 250 households in Aligudarz due to snowfall. In Noor-abad, there are 456 villages that have become inaccessible by flash floods and heavy snowfall.”

Since 25 March, heavy rains have began in Lorestan Province, causing flooding and inundation in many villages.

Since then, Red Crescent aid workers have rendered relief services such as emergency sheltering, pumping water out of houses, distributing basic relief items and assisting those affected in the connection arteries.

Relief workers offered services to 2,133 households, including 7,000 affected people, and provided emergency shelter to 2,500 people.

53,54,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Fears of flash floods in Iraq as torrential rains continue - Kurdistan24,https://www.kurdistan24.net/en/story/19250-Fears-of-flash-floods-in-Iraq-as-torrential-rains-continue,"ERBIL (Kurdistan 24) – Meteorological authorities in Iraq on Friday warned of a fresh bout of torrential rain that could lead to flash floods in some parts of the country and a possible cross-border spillover from current deadly flooding in Iran.

Many parts of Iran and Iraq have been the sites of intermittent but often extreme rainfall for the past two weeks. In Iran, it has proven itself to be a significant natural disaster, as the ensuing floods have claimed the lives of at least 44 people as of Thursday, according to national media reports.

With water at critically high levels in flood-struck areas in Iran, the Iraqi Board of Meteorology and Seismic Monitoring announced that it expects the floodwaters could “flow across the border” and into nearby Iraqi towns and cities in the provinces of Diyala, Wasit, and Maysan.

In Kirkuk Province, the Directorate of Water Resources in a statement warned local authorities and residents of heavy rainfall they projected would be ongoing from Sunday through Monday. The directorate said the burst of precipitation may cause already high water levels to soar in a tributary of the Tigris River known as the Lower Zab, likely flooding areas near the towns of Altun Kupri (Pirde) and Dibis, which overlook the river.

This issue is further compounded as the authorities of Dukan Dam, about 100 kilometers upstream, discharged the near-full reservoir out of fear of its overflowing due to similar actions taken by the Iranian side in the wake of flash floods which have the effect of raising water levels downriver.

“Therefore, we recommend that local governments in these districts and subdistricts inform civilians to keep away from the Lower Zab River immediately,” the directorate’s statement read.

In the surrounding areas of the Dukan Lake, the rising water levels have caused significant damage to many nearby villages and towns, including agricultural fields and houses.

On Friday, a Kurdish family was forced to evacuate their home after floods nearly submerged their whole house. “We are a family of 12 and have always lived here, throughout all the seasons, relying on farming and livestock,” Mohammed Hussein Ibrahim told Kurdistan 24 on Thursday while standing on the rooftop of his flooded house.

The effects of the storms were recorded in multiple governorates, including Anbar, Basra, Dahuk, Diyala, Kirkuk, Missan, Muthanna, Ninewa, Salah al-Din, Sulaymaniyah, and Wassit; however, the harshest impacts appeared to be in central and northern governorates, primarily regions through which the Tigris River runs, and those areas adjacent to Iran...While flooding in Mosul (Ninewa governorate), caused the closure of five main bridges (Alnasr, Alhurriyya, Qanatir, Suwais and Qayyarah), municipal authorities gave assurances on 2-April that Mosul Dam—Iraq’s largest, which supplies hydroelectric power to Mosul city—was functioning normally. Other dams throughout Iraq, particularly in Diyala governorate, were operating at or near capacity; however, provincial leadership expressed confidence that standard discharge and overflow functions would suffice to meet any surplus. No fatalities have been recorded due to the recent period of severe weather in Iraq[.] (OCHA, 3 Apr 2019)

The Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) has announced the displacement of more than (270) families from their homes due to the floods that swept through the villages of (Baiji, Ashtayh, Srin, Arbazia) belonging to the districts of Salah governorate. The IRCS has reported in a statement that its teams have rushed to provide assistance and supplies to families which their houses have been swept by torrents, the continuing heavy rain led to the displacement of (154) families from the Karamat area and east of the village of Baaiji to their families and relatives in the village of Mazra’a and the modern neighborhood, the floods caused the sinking of most of their farms, which are estimated at 30 dunums, also 60 houses besieged by water, 75 families have been displaced from the village of Arbazia to their relatives, In addition, 49 families have also been displaced from Al Sreen village to the mountain area, also five families from Al-Ashitah village were displaced due to floods that surrounded their homes.

Recent flooding along the Tigris River has resulted in the displacement of 545 families in Maysan Governorate, with a further 2 000 families at risk following reported damage to a small number of IDP camps.. [IRCS] reports that heavy rain caused damage to more than 60 families after the villages of Huweder, Dawai, and Shafta (Diyala Governorate) were flooded. Food parcels have been distributed to at least 270 families affected in Salah al-Din Governorate. For the next five days, moderate to heavy rainfall is forecast over the south-eastern governorates of Iraq. (ECHO, 9 Apr 2019)

Elevated water levels in the Tigris River and its tributaries continue to cause flooding and displacement in several governorates. Salah al-Din in central Iraq and Missan in the south are currently those reporting the heaviest impact, with more limited effects reported in Basra, Diyala, Thi-Qar and Wassit. (OCHA, 18 Apr 2019)

Heavy seasonal rains in Iraq and neighbouring countries during March/April 2019 caused flooding in several governorates in Iraq. Salah al-Din in central Iraq and Basra and Missan in the south reported the heaviest impact, with thousands of families temporarily displaced, residing with relatives or in municipal buildings. Sulaymaniyah reported limited displacement, but substantial damage to infrastructure, and flooded agricultural areas. The flooding in the southern governorates was somewhat anticipated, as many of the affected families are residing in low-lying marshland areas, in non-compliance of local laws. These areas are subject to annual inundations during Iraq’s rainy season; however, the floods were heavier in 2019 than in years past. Most of the displaced have returned home, but several water treatment plants are offline throughout the country as a result of the floods, disrupting clean water supplies in some governorates. Relevant UN agencies and NGOs who work in the WASH sector responded where necessary with water trucking, provisions of chemicals for water treatment facilities, and sanitation services. The Government of Iraq and Kurdistan Regional Government acted as first responders, with some governorates requesting additional support from humanitarian partners.

Furthermore, according to Gholamreza Shariati, the volume of water in Iran's biggest and only navigable river, Karoon, is increasing at an alarming rate of 3200 cubic meters per second.

""An evacuation order has been issued for people living in the towns of Soosangerd, Bostan, Rafee’, Koot Seyyed Na'eem, Abu Humaydha, and Hamidiya,"" local news outlets cited Shariati as saying.

It is necessary for women, children, and the elderly to leave those areas, the governor stressed, saying young people can stay and protect the cities by making flood barriers, the governor maintained.

The city of Sheiban, north of Khuzestan capital city of Ahvaz, is already evacuated, while flood alarms have been raised in other cities, including Darkhovein.

Flood waters in Ahvaz streets, April 8.

""While the inflow and outflow of water at the Dez dam have declined and the situation is under control, the other major dam on the Karkhe River has overflown, “Shariati cautioned, adding, ”The reservoir of Kharkheh dam is overflowing, and we should plan ahead, hoping to find a way to address the problem"".

Meanwhile, a lawmaker from Ahvaz said, ""The whole city of Sousangerd might be engulfed in water, and people should comply with the orders of the Crisis Management Department, and evacuate their homes.""

People of the city of Sheiban were forced to evacuate their homes after the floodgates near the city broke down, but, Shariati asserted that efforts to repair the canal are underway.

The province's capital city, Ahvaz, was also at the mercy of floods, after a part of the town, close to the road leading to the city of Andimeshk was submerged.

""We have succeeded to divert a part of the water toward the neighboring plains, but some parts of Ahvaz will inevitably be inundated,"" Shariati acknowledged.

In recent days several authorities, including the speaker of parliament and the chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, have visited the major dams in Khuzestan, hoping to find a way to prevent overflowing which cab lead to more floods.

The Minister of Interior, Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, warned last Friday, April 5, that 400,000 of the residents of Khuzestan were ""seriously threatened"" by flash floods.

Sewage has backed up and filled some areas of Ahvaz. April 8

The director of Khuzestan's Department of Crisis Management announced on Monday, April 8, that 210 villages have been evacuated, and 43,000 people have been moved to emergency shelters in the oil-rich province, so far.

In the meantime, the Mayor of Darkhovein has admitted that his city is gravely threatened by possible floods.

In the meantime, in a letter to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday requested permission to grant some €2 billion (approximately $2.6 billion) from the National Development Fund of Iran (NDFI) for renovation of flood-stricken areas, a parliament member told local reporters.

Iranian authorities have repeatedly admitted in the past weeks that the cash strapped Islamic republic cannot afford to compensate the losses of the recent flash-floods that began March 18.

58,59,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iranians Return To Banned Telegram As It Proves Effective In Flood Relief - RadioFarda,https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iranians-return-to-banned-telegram-as-it-proves-effective-in-flood-relief/29874542.html,"One year after popular messaging service Telegram was banned in Iran in the aftermath of early 2018 mass protests, social media users have been returning to the popular platform.

The government suspected that Telegram, and social media in general, were used to mobilize crowds and organize protests in late 2017 and early 2018 in over 100 Iranian cities.

When the ban went into effect, most government agencies and a few million users dropped Telegram and authorities tried to market domestic messaging apps that they could control.

But after a year, now top government agencies including the national state-run TV and the Iranian Presidency's press office have quietly have returned to Telegram.

One reason was Telegram's effectiveness in disseminating information during devastating floods that his Iran in March and April.

​The change took place in spite of hardliners' attempt to push the people toward state-controlled homegrown messaging services.

Iranian official news agency IRNA reported the online migration on Sunday April 7 with revealing infographics and a self-explanatory headline: ""People Return to Telegram.""

However, users resort to Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to circumvent the state blockage of the app.

In a caption underneath an infographic that shows renewed Iranian activity on Telegram, IRNA wrote: ""The government was not able to prevent people's presence on Telegram.""

Semi-official news agency ISNA's polling service ISPA also offered a series of facts and figures about the migration back to Telegram, observing that ""In March 2018 some 60 percent of Iranians used Telegram, but the figure dropped to 56 percent in March 2019,"" although the the drop was not significant after the one-year ban.

An ISPA infographic shows that during the past year and while Telegram was officially banned, it was still more popular than other platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and the homegrown messaging service Soroush.

This comes while Instagram was not banned, WhatsApp was only partially limited and Soroush offered many incentives to lure Iranian social media users.

Discussing the statistics released by ISPA, some among Iranian media outlets ask if the ban was ineffective then why Telegram is still being filtered, and why so much money has been spent on the ineffective and unpopular homegrown messaging services.

The return of Iranian state TV's news agency to Telegram is one of the strangest comebacks to the platform, as it was the state TV that sponsored the development of the homegrown platform Soroush.

Shahrvand newspaper on April 8 questiones the decisions made by the state TV to effectively abandon the messaging service it has invested on.

Shahrvand wrote that the investment should have been made on educating people and promoting media literacy.

In the meantime, it appears that Telegram has been more successful than official media in reporting the news of recent floods in Iran. News dissemination on the events surrounding the floods was done mainly on banned social media and social networking platforms.

Pro-reform news website Fararu wrote: ""When Lorestan province was flooded, there was no news of the event on the state TV which has bureaus and correspondents all over Iran."" Fararu, further criticized Iran's state TV for failing to report on the floods in Pol-e-Dokhtar, Mamoulan and elsewhere and instead broadcast exaggerated accounts of official measures.

Meanwhile, the Rouhani administration-owned newspaper Iran wrote that it was strange to see that even top state officials turned to banned social media in order to convey their messages effectively.

Nevertheless, Shahrvand wrote that it is unlikely to see the Iranian Judiciary taking back its May 2018 ban on Telegram.

Even in flood-hit areas people who had a chance to connect to the Internet, had to use VPNs in order to use social media for messaging and news dissemination or for calling for help. The situation led reformist MP Mahmoud Sadeqi to call for even a temporary lifting of the ban on Telegram to facilitate relief work.

International institutions and human rights watchdogs have pronounced censorship and filtering of social media tantamount to ""violation of basic human rights such as freedom of expression.""

Some of Iran's high-ranking officials have said that the policy of filtering and censorship during the past four decades is a failed policy. President Hassan Rouhani said in this regard in February: ""We have to admit that this was a mistake.""",,"{'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29874542&SiteId=82&r=288938930&it=0&pd=20190411091621', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/EF5E6802-E43D-47EF-B290-720C3D9CD8EA_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/045A1383-A3D8-4CD7-8FA1-EA681659F5C7_cx0_cy6_cw0_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4872982E-408F-4DDC-B2C9-C8B60BB967D4_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/09C2BED3-E0F3-4373-BA8D-AEA529E14EE7_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/045A1383-A3D8-4CD7-8FA1-EA681659F5C7_cx0_cy6_cw0_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/576D7229-71EB-470D-A133-AE2E324D860C_w250_r0_s.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/32EE9EDC-A12A-4443-8726-E91702744EC2_w100_r1.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/1546407041?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3airanians%20return%20to%20banned%20telegram%20as%20it%20proves%20effective%20in%20flood%20relief&c6=iranians%20return%20to%20banned%20telegram%20as%20it%20proves%20effective%20in%20flood%20relief&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=iranians%20return%20to%20banned%20telegram%20as%20it%20proves%20effective%20in%20flood%20relief&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=top-stories&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29874542&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17'}","['relief', 'effective', 'messaging', 'tv', 'return', 'flood', 'iranian', 'telegram', 'iranians', 'iran', 'state', 'social', 'banned', 'media', 'proves', 'wrote']",,,flood
59,60,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"US Envoy to Iran: More Sanctions, No New Oil Waivers - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-envoy-iran-more-sanctions-no-new-oil-waivers,"STATE DEPARTMENT - The United States will redraw government maps consistent with Washington’s decision to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. The move comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump signed a proclamation Monday officially granting U.S. recognition of the Golan Heights as Israeli territory.

VOA’s State Department correspondent Nike Ching sat down Wednesday with Brian Hook, the State Department’s special representative for Iran, to discuss U.S. actions affecting Israel and Iran. The following are excerpts from the interview.

The U.S. State Department's map of Israel already The U.S. State Department's map of Israel already showing Jerusalem as the capital but the Golan Heights still as Israeli-occupied territory (screenshot of State Department map, taken March 27, 2019). The U.S. State Department's map of Israel already showing Jerusalem as the capital but the Golan Heights still as Israeli-occupied territory (screenshot of State Department map, taken March 27, 2019).

?Ching: How will President Trump’s executive order change the way the U.S. displays the Golan Heights on its official maps of Israel? What is the time frame that we can expect the maps to be updated?

Hook: The president did sign an executive order recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. We think that this reflects, it’s a reflection of reality and the facts on the ground, and the need for Israel to have secure and defensible borders. As a consequence of the executive order, the State Department will be redrawing the official U.S. government maps to recognize this. And those will be released as soon as they are ready.

Ching: Last November, the U.S. issued sanction waivers to eight economies, including Iran’s major oil buyers in Asia: China, Korea, India, Japan and Taiwan. The waivers expire in May. Is the U.S. considering extending them?

Hook: The policy of the United States is that we are not looking to grant any new oil waivers. We did have to grant eight oil waivers in order to avoid shocking the global oil markets and causing a dramatic increase in the price of oil. We have taken off roughly 1½ million barrels of Iranian crude, and we have avoided a price increase in oil. And that’s not an accident. We’ve done it very well and very carefully. 2019 is going to be a much better market for global oil supply, and the forecasters say that there will be more supply than demand. That gives us much better market conditions to accelerate our path to zero imports. But we have already taken off more than half of Iran’s oil exports in just a very few months. The prior administration granted 20 oil waivers to 20 countries over three years. We are down to a handful of countries. There are 23 countries that used to be importing Iranian crude who are now at zero. So, Secretary [of State Mike] Pompeo was very committed to that. We don’t preview our decisions. The current oil waivers expire on May 2. And so the secretary, in consultation with the president, will make a final decision.

Ching: On Tuesday, the U.S. imposed new sanctions against networks supporting Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. What are they, and how are they different from past sanctions?

Hook: You’ve got three organizations in Iran that are prohibited from accessing the U.S. financial system in order to get money, because these three organizations are engaged in weapons of mass destruction, proliferation and/or terrorism. So, these three organizations — the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, ANSAR bank and the Iran Ministry of Defense — have all been sanctioned.

What Iran did to try to get around our sanctions was they created four front companies. And over the last year and a half, they used these front companies to get $800 million, which then was spent on military vehicles for the Ministry of Defense, and the other money went to funding IRGC operations. Now, the lesson here for nations around the world is that the Iranian regime uses front companies to disguise their true identity. And that’s very dangerous for corporations around the world who want to do business with Iran. When you do business with Iran, you never know if you’re facilitating commerce, or terrorism, or WMD proliferation. We exposed this vast network of front companies, and now we’ve sanctioned all of these individuals. Twenty-four or 25 people and organizations were sanctioned.

Ching: There have been talks about why the U.S. does not revoke the visas of the children of Iranian authorities who are studying at U.S. universities or relative who simply live here and work. Is the U.S. prepared to revoke those types of visa as a form of punishment and deterrent to Iran taking dual nationals hostage? What has the State Department done in this regard?”

Hook: We do make exceptions for student visas and exchange visas. We are aware of the question that you talked about. And we are taking a look at our visa policy to figure out.

I mean, part of it is the first responsibility we have is to protect American people. And when you're the leading state sponsored terrorism in the world that has consequences on our visa policy, even though we make exceptions for it. And so there may be other people here who are here because they become American citizens. They married an American--there are a range of categories as to why people are here.

We have heard these concerns, we are taking a look at it. That's as much as I can say now.

?Ching: With U.S. sanctions cutting off Iran economically, isn’t that, in essence, punishing common people in Iran and creating more anger against the U.S.?

Hook: I get that question a lot from the press. I don’t ever get it from the Iranian people. The Iranian people know where to place the blame on their economic troubles, and it’s President [Hassan] Rouhani. They know President Rouhani has failed to deliver on his economic promises. It’s also the case that for the 40-year history of this regime, they have prioritized their foreign policy over their domestic policy, and they have severely mismanaged their economy. When you look at the standard of living today, in many cases, it’s lower than it was before the revolution. The Iranian people know that. They don’t confuse us with the Iranian regime. They have run their economy into the ground. They’ve run their environment into the ground, because they care more about revolution abroad than their own people at home.

Flash floods, brought by heavy rains that began Friday, have killed at least 35 people in at least five western and northern Afghanistan provinces. The flooding destroyed homes and cut off access to remote villages across parts of the country, officials say.

Heavy flooding killed at least 12 people in the northern province of Faryab and 10 people in the western province of Herat, Hashmat Bahaduri, a spokesman for Afghanistan's National Disaster Management Authority (ANDMA) said Saturday.

Eight people were killed in Badghis Province in the west and five in Balkh Province in the north, Bahaduri said, adding that more than 3,000 houses had been destroyed.

More than 10 people were reportedly missing.

Video taken in Herat province showed cars buried in mud, mud houses strewn with debris, and people trying to rescue whatever was left of their property.

""We have lost everything here and have nothing left to survive on,"" Bibi Gul, a Herat resident whose home was destroyed, told AFP.

Fazel Ahmad, another resident, told AFP, ""Cows, sheep and even our pigeons are under the debris.""

Floods have destroyed hundreds of homes, some historic sites, thousands of acres of farmland, bridges, and highways, Jilani Farhad, a spokesman for the western province of Herat, said.

Mir Gulabuddin Miri, director of the Afghan Red Crescent in Herat, said access to some areas had been cut off, preventing teams from reaching affected people.

62,63,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Next Post 11 women among those killed in the flash floods in Shiraz - NCRI Women's Committee,https://women.ncr-iran.org/2019/04/05/11-women-among-those-killed-in-the-flash-floods-in-shiraz/,"The names of 11 women, killed at Shiraz city’s flood were announced on April 4, 2019.

The names of the 11 women announced by the director of General Corner’s Office of Fars province are as follow:

Leila Ranjbar; from Shiraz Nilofar Godarzi; from Marvdasht Yasin Haghighat; from Karaj Sanaz Kyani; from Amol Raheleh Taimouri; from Isfahan Laya Narimani; from Isfahan Khadijeh Ibrahimi; from Amol Zahra Aughel Zadeh; from Shiraz Farideh Molodi; from Sa’adat Shahr Atena Sadoghi; from Alborz Roohangiz Moori

It is to be said that due to the New Year holidays many of the victims were visiting Shiraz from other cities.

Ms. Atena Sadoghi lost her life on April 1, at the Namazi Hospital of Shiraz and Ms. Roohangiz Moori passed away on April 2 at the city’s Faghihi Hospital. (The state-run ROKNA News Agency- April 4, 2019)

The agency also reported on April 3, that a 35-year-old woman and a man have lost their lives being buried under the wreckage of a house when it collapsed by flood.

Previous news indicated that 8 women in Shiraz, one in Lorestan, two in Mazandaran, a 20-year-old in Koohdasht of Lorestan, and two girl children in Hamedan and Khuzestan had been killed in the flash floods. This brings the number of women’s death toll during the flood crisis to 18.

By covering up the true number of the casualties and the missing people, the regime is trying to minimize the scale of damages and losses caused by the flood.

On April 3, the regime’s state-run TV citing the Emergency Organization, stated that the casualty toll has been 66 deaths and 478 wounded.

At the recent flood in Lorestan Province, no aid came from the government. When encountering the Lorestan’s governor and its MP, the angry, discontent residents of Pol-e Dokhtar protested against the fact, and counted the officials as responsible for their dire condition.

20.000 people have completely lost their homes in Lorestan’s flood.

In an interview with Radio Farda, Ignatius Ivlev-Yorke, public relation officer of ICRC said that the president of the organization Peter Maurer never mentioned any specific country when he spoke at the UN on Monday.

Zarif had claimed in a tweet Tuesday that Maurer told the UN Security Council U.S. sanctions are preventing the Iranian Red Crescent from providing effective relief assistance to the victims of two-week-long floods, which have brought unprecedented destruction to many regions in Iran.

Ivlev-Yorke said that ICRC is concerned about sanctions affecting assistance in general, but Maurer did not mention any specific country or a specific case at the UN.

He also added that ICRC’s representatives in Iran are closely monitoring the situation in cooperation with the Red Crescent, which “has already mobilized their staff and volunteers” to assist flood-stricken areas. ICRC is ready to explore all possibilities with its Iranian counterparts “if so required”, Ivlev-Yorke said.

Asked if ICRC sees any sanctions-related limitation with providing aid to Iran, he answered, “From our point of view we do not any limitations at this stage to our assistance to the Iranian Red Crescent Society.""",,"{'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_iran_election.jpg?itok=7pPjQiWm', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/logo.svg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/2021-05-24T105615Z_2043007219_RC2AMN9NLSWV_RTRMADP_3_IRAN-NUCLEAR-IAEA.JPG?itok=qlBojeC7', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/E34D7BD5-667D-4A9E-AAEF-BA3D3F00950A.jpg?itok=29iQF9z8', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 269 177'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/ap-images/2021/05/5232c91be8ebce6d16979f0ec413cc7b.jpg?itok=nA8zkFeX', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/images/Author__Placeholder.png', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/0B4F57A6-B9AB-46D7-B0E2-E40FB0863F1B.jpg?itok=2jzpluUu', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_iran_flag2.jpg?itok=N88Gkoy7', 'https://www.voanews.com/img/snippet/PangeaVideoBig.png', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/medium/s3/2019-04/A18E9146-0791-4BF3-8C41-CE7D900FCFE0.jpg?itok=gamJzSpZ', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/892x501/s3/2019-04/047E9D3B-1CD2-4654-BDF9-7031A9B0996A.jpg?itok=vSylG6K4', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/reuters-images/2021/04/reuters_com_2021_newsml_RC2N3N93N0U9.jpg?itok=Mu6tqUFE', 'https://www.voanews.com/core/themes/stable/images/core/throbber-active.gif', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/B9108C2E-75B5-4083-A096-1B0C41234246.jpg?itok=JyJxfk9R', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/047E9D3B-1CD2-4654-BDF9-7031A9B0996A.jpg'}","['crescent', 'relief', 'sanctions', 'red', 'impeding', 'aid', 'icrc', 'iranian', 'assistance', 'iran', 'providing', 'international', 'cross', 'spoke', 'maurer', 'specific', 'denies']",,,flood

At least 70 villages in Golestan and more than 200 in Mazandaran are inundated. Aqqala is the worst hit where landslides have killed two people, director general of Golestan province's crisis management department Mojtaba Jamali said.

High water has forced evacuations of several small farm communities as all farmland has been swamped, according to local reports.

Footage from both provinces showed massive flows of water running over roads and streets, with cars being washed away, people struggling to walk, and traffic being disrupted.

66,67,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Shiraz Floods: Safeguarding Human Rights When Natural Disasters Hit - Center for Human Rights in Iran,https://iranhumanrights.org/2019/03/shiraz-floods-four-ways-to-safeguard-human-rights-in-natural-disasters/,"At least 19 people have died in Shiraz, the capital of Iran’s Fars Province, as a result of flash flooding from a sudden, heavy downpour of rain. State media reports indicate at least 100 others have been injured and thousands of homes have been damaged there. The provinces of Golestan and Mazandaran in the north have also been impacted by flooding.

Research by the UN and humanitarian aid organizations show that natural disasters heighten the risk of grave human rights violations, including discrimination and gender-based violence.

Guidelines adopted in 2006 by a forum of UN and non-UN humanitarian partners, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), promote a rights-based approach to disaster relief efforts. Following are excerpts from those guidelines.

Measures to Prevent Violence and Discrimination

1) “Protection of Life; Security and Physical Integrity of the Person; and Family Ties”

The IASC notes that when necessary, evacuations “should be carried out in a manner that fully respects the rights to life, dignity, liberty and security of those affected and that does not discriminate against anyone.”

This requires communicating the reason for the evacuation in a language that people can understand as well as ensuring families are not separated. Relief actors also have a responsibility to protect people’s security before and after the emergency phase including against gender-based violence.

Preventative measures include:

Identifying and mapping persons particularly exposed to the risk of violence, for instance single women or girls, single parent households, single or non-accompanied children, older persons, persons with disabilities, etc.;

Advocating for additional deployment of law enforcement personnel able to provide the necessary protection to areas or sites at risk of or experiencing instances of gender-based violence, robberies, looting, etc. or a general break-down of law and order;

Conducting awareness raising among persons who are exposed to new specific

protection needs as a consequence of the disaster about these new risks, e.g.

exploitation, trafficking, etc.

Avoiding large or overcrowded collective shelters; and

Including representatives of affected populations, including women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities in the design of camps and collective centres, in particular regarding: Design, location and lay-out of shelter; Lighting, fencing and other security measures; and Safe location of and access to food distribution and water points



2) “Protection of rights related to the Provision of Food; Health; Shelter; and Education”

The IASC states that “humanitarian goods and services should be provided on the basis of assessed needs, without any distinction of any kind other than that of differing needs and without any discrimination as to race, color, sex, language, disability, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, age, or other status.”

Measures for preventing discrimination in natural disaster relief efforts include:

Use of proven assessment tools that include all categories of persons with special needs and allow objective identification of needs;

Specific monitoring whether persons with special needs, older persons, persons with disabilities, sick persons or female-headed households with infants and young children have equal access to food, water, health and other humanitarian services and, if not, giving them priority access, or setting up separate distribution points/separate hours for distribution of goods and for services, etc.;

Systematic inclusion of female-headed households, unaccompanied children, older persons, persons with disabilities and other persons with special needs in the distribution of humanitarian goods;

Securing distribution points against rioters or others ready to use violence; and

Monitoring of risks for beneficiaries after distributions

3) “Protection of Rights Related to Housing; Land and Property; Livelihoods and Secondary and Higher Education”

The IASC guidelines also note that relief efforts should respect and protect the right to property. To do so relief actors should:



Establish photographic records of landmarks and possessions left behind;

Use standard forms to record property left behind by the displaced;

Advocate for the deployment of police forces to areas where destruction or looting may take place; and

Ensure access of owners to effective remedies to bring complaints against persons illegally occupying or using their property

4) Protection of Rights Related to Documentation; Movement; Re-Establishment of Family ties; Expression and Opinion, and Elections

The IASC also states that affected persons and communities should be “allowed and enabled to give feedback and raise complaints or grievances on the disaster relief and recovery response.”

This requires establishing mechanisms and opportunities “for affected persons to conduct peaceful assemblies or to form associations for this purpose” by:",2019-03-26 16:35:32-04:00,"{'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/nasrin-sotoudeh-nyt-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Labor-Day-Iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://app.icontact.com/icp/core/signup/tracking.gif?id=117&cid=333585&lid=108255', 'https://www.iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/001-en-4-1.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-tech-sanctions-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Dual-nationals-nuclear-talks-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Navid-Arkari-iran-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Navid-Arkari-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/001-en-4-1-1024x512.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-farmers-water-protests-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Dual-nationals-zaghari-taghavi-raoof-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-IRIB-films-series-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/High-School-Protests-Iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-workers-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-china-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/10704075_689349141164067_5811827587714389388_n-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Farakhan-en-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-humanrights-letter-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Tech-3-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Alireza-Anjavi-en-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Bahman-Jafari-en-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Referandum-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Lawyer-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Corona-en-1-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Mohammad-Dadsetankhah-en-1-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-letter-biden-human-rights-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Borhan-Mansournia-en-263x187.jpg', 'https://www.iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/CHRI-Logo-282px.png', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Yunesi-moradi-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardian-Council-election-94x73.jpg'}","['hit', 'relief', 'iasc', 'rights', 'floods', 'protection', 'distribution', 'violence', 'shiraz', 'natural', 'human', 'disasters', 'humanitarian', 'persons', 'security', 'needs', 'safeguarding']",,,none
67,68,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Revolutionary Guards Arrest 11 Arab-Iranian Flood Volunteers in Khuzestan Province - Center for Human Rights in Iran,https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2019/04/revolutionary-guards-arrest-11-arab-iranian-flood-volunteers-in-khuzestan-province/,"Agents of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC) Intelligence Organization arrested at least 11 Arab-Iranian volunteers as they were trying to help people in Iran’s flood-stricken village of Gurieh, Khuzestan Province, according to Karim Dahimi, a London-based minority rights activist.

On April 7, 2019, nine of them were arrested as they arrived from the city of Mahshahr, said Dahimi, who spoke with the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) on April 10.

“Today, I was informed that a group of young Arabs in the city of Hamidiyeh wanted to take food items and blankets to the flood victims but they were stopped by the security forces,” Dahimi said.

Dahimi said he did not have information about their identities or places of detention but added that two other rescue workers, Ahmad Ka’bi and Yaghoub Ka’bi (relation unknown), were detained the following day in the same village.

“Ahmad and Yaghoub Ka’bi were helping with rescue operations when they were arrested for unknown reasons,” Dahimi told CHRI. “According to information from our friends in the village, the Arab youths wanted to distribute food and other goods they had collected for the victims but there was an argument with the authorities and they got arrested.”

According to Dahimi, both had previously advocated minority rights in Shushtar.

Since late March 2019, flash floods have claimed at least 77 lives and injured more than 1,000 people, the head of Iran’s Emergency Medical Services, Pir-Hossein Kolivand, told Parliament on April 9.

On April 8, a video was widely shared on Persian social media appearing to show an elderly Arab man being disparaged by Khuzestan’s Governor Gholamreza Shariati.

“You won’t help us because we are Arab,” an old man tells the governor. “We have nothing left. Why do you help Syria but not us?”

The governor replied, “Don’t talk nonsense. You’re a rude opponent of the state. Get out of here!”

Commenting on the governor’s reaction, journalist Mehdi Ghadimi tweeted:

“Watching the governor being so disrespectful to a protesting flood victim was one of the worst moments of these past few weeks. When there are rumors that flood waters are being redirected toward Arab villages and threatening lives, the authorities have to build trust instead of making enemies out of tired, angry people.”

Former political prisoner Abdollah Momeni wrote: “… Governor Shariati’s response to the poor old man is a sign of the deteriorating moral fiber among some of the government officials that is grinding the soul of the Iranian people. They are so consumed with power that morality has died inside them.”

69,70,FL-2019-000022-IRN,The unexpected cruelty of sanctions - The Week Magazine,https://theweek.com/articles/832533/unexpected-cruelty-sanctions,"Sometimes, as the leader of a global superpower, you very much want to coerce the behavior of another government, only to find your tedious public is not enthusiastic about the prospect of military intervention, probably because of the seven or so wars you're already fighting. A quandary!

Luckily for you, sanctions are a politically viable option instead. Especially when targeted at specific industries, state agencies, or officials, sanctions are cast as a shrewd and humane alternative to open conflict. We can make life difficult for corrupt politicians or halt oil sales or limit military build-up without hurting ordinary people, who likely have little control over their leaders' choices. All the coercion, none of the humanitarian consequences.

It sounds good in theory. It sounds clean and altruistic, foreign policy without the bloodshed. And though it's obviously true that sanctions do not mete out the direct damage of airstrikes or invasion, they are not the humanitarian alternative they're often made out to be. Even targeted sanctions can have grave unintended consequences for innocent civilians, as present circumstances in Iran and Venezuela reveal.

Drenched in heavy rains and spring snow melt, Iran is flooding. The country has suffered three major floods in the past two weeks, with 23 of 31 provinces affected as of this writing. Hundreds of villages and several cities are submerged. ""In [the provincial capital city of] Khorramabad the water has risen by as much as three meters in parts,"" state media reported Monday, and some areas are ""completely submerged with residents stranded on their rooftops."" Tens of thousands of people have been displaced, and dozens have died.

The death toll could well grow, partly because international aid has been limited. ""Two weeks into devastating floods that have caused tremendous losses and damages across Iran, there is still no report about other countries extending help,"" reports Radio Farda, a Persian-language subsidiary of the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. To all appearances, ""European states as well as Iran's neighbors, particularly the wealthy Persian Gulf states, have also not made any official offers of help,"" the story says, some Turkish charities excepted.

More help is not forthcoming, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, because ""challenges caused by unilateral sanctions will affect the U.N. response and the accountability of the U.N. to deliver the appropriate support."" The unilateral sanctions in question are those imposed by the Trump administration following President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal.

In a tweeted statement, Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, made the same charge more bluntly: Trump's sanctions are ""impeding aid efforts by #IranianRedCrescent to all communities devastated by unprecedented floods,"" he said, an account the Red Crescent has confirmed, specifically pointing to limitations on Iranian access to the SWIFT banking system, through which the charity was previously transferring aid money to Iran. (Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said support could be directed to Iran's Red Crescent through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, but it is not clear how the transfer would happen in practice.) Zarif also claimed rescue helicopters are unable to reach flooding victims because sanctions have left Tehran's fleet in disrepair.

Half a world away, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela are indirectly worsening the chronic food shortages that are already starving Venezuelan children to death. ""Though the United States was not responsible for the collapse of Venezuela's economy — that was a pure product of Hugo Chávez's potted version of socialism — the sanctions it imposed on Venezuelan oil in late January could compound the humanitarian crisis,"" explains The Washington Post's Jackson Diehl. Oil exports are Venezuela's ""only significant source of hard currency,"" so as U.S. sanctions push export levels down, ""Venezuelan imports of food and medicine, already disastrously insufficient, will drop off a cliff.""

Removing these sanctions wouldn't magically restore Venezuela to abundance and stability — but neither will imposing them. Historically, sanctions have a pretty poor record of effectiveness. One study of 85 sanctions systems published in International Security identified just four successes. Sanctions are ""not likely to achieve major foreign policy goals,"" the survey concluded, but they reliably ""inflict significant human costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent civilians who have little influence on their government's behavior.""

U.S. sanctions on Iran never forced Tehran to democratize, but they did prove deadly for Iranian innocents long before this spring's floods. And in Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro has used U.S. pressure as propaganda to shore up his own power, depicting himself as a bulwark against the ""imperialist"" ""gringos."" What if the sanctions ""plan doesn't work? Suppose the [Maduro] government holds on, and then you've duplicated the suffering and you haven't solved the problem,"" Crisis Group analyst Phil Gunson, who is based in Caracas, told the Miami Herald. ""The prospect that it can be apocalyptic but not produce an outcome can be quite scary.""

Sanctioning Venezuela's nationalized oil industry, which supports the Maduro regime, or limiting Iran's access to international financial institutions to discourage nuclear weapons development may sound like straightforward ways to coerce bad actors in these two countries without harming civilians. But the reality of sanctions isn't that simple. They're often unintentionally inhumane and rarely effective.

Sanctions may be a lesser evil than war, but that does not mean they cannot be cruel.",2019-04-03 05:50:01-04:00,"{'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=465576534193662&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://theweek.com/bundles/twsite/images/empty-src.png', 'https://images.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/sanctions2.jpg?itok=RnwfeTUR'}","['venezuela', 'floods', 'sanctions', 'red', 'cruelty', 'iran', 'oil', 'international', 'states', 'unexpected', 'humanitarian', 'irans']",,,flood

The quake hit Iran at 2:26 p.m. local time with its epicenter being near the town of Sumar, southwestern Kermanshah (Kermashan) Province.

The location is just kilometers away from border areas near the Iraqi city of Mandali in Iraq's eastern Diyala Province, where tremors were measured at a magnitude of 4.9.

The shocks were felt in Iraq as far away as the capital of Baghdad. Lying on a major geological fault-line, earthquakes are a common occurrence in the Rojhilati province of Kermanshan.

Local sources in Kermashan told Kurdistan 24 that when with the tremor hit, all communication devices became temporarily out of service.

“Thus far, four earthquakes have hit [the] region,” Khaledi, spokesperson for the Iranian National Emergency department was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency in reference to the initial incident and its aftershocks in areas near Sumar.

Khaledi added that no casualties had yet been reported. “It is important to note that this area has a very low population density, which greatly reduces the likelihood of injury.”

Tasnim claimed that the country’s Red Crescent Society, tasked with performing relief and rescue operations to help those injured in natural disasters and accidents, had deployed teams to the area to assess the situation.

The quakes come at a time when national emergency services are already spread thin. Many villages in the country’s western provinces of Lorestan and Khuzestan and Golestan in the north are still in the process of evacuation due to major flooding that has killed dozens of people.

Local media has reported that the three provinces have declared a state of emergency while the country as a whole remains on a flood alert.

He made the remark at a time when more than 70 people have dies in floods and the government has urged residents of many towns and villages to evacuate to escape unprecedented floods.

Khuzestan’s Karkheh Dam is considered to be in a precarious situation as its reservoir is full and some claim to have seen cracks developing on its earthen walls.

75,76,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"With Focus on Economic Relations, Iran-Iraq Ties Move Into the 'Daylight' — Bourse & Bazaar - Bourse & Bazaar",https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/articles/2019/4/1/with-focus-on-economic-relations-iran-iraq-ties-move-into-the-daylight,"Expectations were high when Iranian president Hassan Rouhani visited neighboring Iraq last month. During the trip, his first as president, Rouhani signed multiple trade deals with Iraq, where the return of peace and stability has renewed the government’s focus on economic development. The deals covered a variety of sectors including railway construction, electricity infrastructure, and engineering services.

Today, the volume of annual bilateral trade between Iran and Iraq stands at around USD 12 billion. But Rouhani has targeted ambitious growth, saying the two sides should aim to reach USD 20 billion in trade.

The deputy governor-general of Iran's southeastern Khuzestan province—close to the Iraqi border—said Rouhani's trip prepared the ground for the growth of trade in the Arvand Free Economic Zone. Agreements to complete a railway link connecting the southwestern Iranian town of Shalamcheh to the Iraqi Port of Basra and the decision to eliminate visa fees for travelers were among the most notable achievements of the trip. The tourism sector is booming as Iraqis find it increasingly appealing to visit cities in Iran’s west as well as the northeastern holy city of Mashhad, a popular destination for Iraq's Shiite pilgrims. Iranian pilgrims also travel to Iraq in huge numbers, visiting shrines in Najaf and Karbala.

Any planned growth in bilateral trade will depend on Iran and Iraq addressing a range of financial disagreements, exacerbated in part by US secondary sanctions. Since the reimposition of sanctions by the Trump administration in November, complaints have grown among Iranian stakeholders—including oil minister Bijan Zanganeh—that Badghad was effectively siding with Washington given non-payment of rising debts. Prior to Rouhani’s visit, Iran’s central bank governor, Abdolnasser Hemmati, traveled to Baghdad for technical meetings and secured commitments that Iraq would pay significant arrears related to the import of Iranian natural gas and electricity. A few weeks later, Rouhani told his Iraqi counterpart, Barham Salih that using national currencies in banking transactions would help protect bilateral trade from sanctions pressures.

Just last week, Rouhani stressed in a phone conversation with Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi that an agreement to dredge the Arvand River—signed during his visit to Baghdad—was being implemented. Rouhani was speaking in the context of recent deadly floods that have left behind a trail of death and destruction in several Iranian provinces. During the phone call, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi noted that Iraqis have warmly welcomed proposals that would see a greater presence of Iranian firms in their country.

For its part, the Iraqi government has sought to reassure Iran of its commitment to expanded economic ties with Iran, despite Iraq’s continued reliance on security and economic support from the US. ""Iraq insists that the interests of our friendly and neighboring country must be met. We will do our best to reduce tensions in this regard and decrease the damage that will be done to the Iranian nation,"" declared President Salih.

Overall, Rouhani’s visit won praise across Iran’s political landscape. Hardline newspaper Kayhan, usually highly critical of the Rouhani administration, described the president’s visit as “an act of resistance” to US pressure, which served to “provide relief to the economy.” Financial newspaper Donya-e-Eqtesad, similarly highlighted “Tehran's message to Washington from within Baghdad.”

Iranian media also took pride in comparing Rouhani’s visit to the recent visit to Baghdad of US President Donald Trump. Iran’s state television focused on a series of comments Trump made following his return from Iraq, in which he complains about the secretive style of his visit. Trump sneaked into Iraq ""in the dark"" while Rouhani landed in ""broad daylight,” boasted several Iranian papers. The obvious displeasure of US officials at Iraq’s warm welcome of Rouhani also featured in reports about the trip.

Iran’s reinvigorated diplomacy towards Iraq reflects a new diplomatic and economic strategy towards its onetime foe. By placing a greater priority in ties with Iraq, Iran is seeking to both mitigate the impact of US sanctions, while also countering US influence. In some ways, this strategy is a continuation of the tug of war between the US and Iran which began in the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003.

For some Iraqis, this contest for influence reflects an unacceptable threat to Iraq’s sovereignty. Even the country's top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani raised the matter with Rouhani when the latter visited the holy city of Najaf. The highly revered religious leader stressed Iraq's sovereignty in his meeting with Rouhani, the first Iranian president to have secured such an audience.

Emerging from nearly two decades of conflict, first during the Iraq War and then during the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS), Iraq is now entering a post-war era in which reconstruction will be the foremost political priority. Iran, which played a role in the defeat of ISIS, sees for itself a constructive role in this new phase of Iraq’s development. It remains to be seen to what extent U.S. economic sanctions and political opposition prevent tighter bilateral ties between Iraq and Iran.

77,78,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran Army deploys heavy-duty dredger to flood-hit province - PRESSTV,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/04/05/592651/Iran-flood-Armydredger-Gorganroud-Caspian-Sea,"Iran’s Army has deployed a special, heavy-duty dredger to a northern province severely hit by recent flooding to speed up the redirecting of floodwaters to the sea.

Chief Commander of the Iranian Army Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, who is on his second visit to the flooded areas of Iran’s Golestan Province, said on Friday that the dredger had been launched in order to allow larger amounts of water to be re-channeled downstream and toward the Caspian Sea through a major river in the area.

The operation will help redirect floodwaters from the badly-hit cities of Aq Qala and Gamishan through the Gorganroud River toward the sea further north.

The Caspian littoral — where Golestan Province is located — is one of Iran’s two low-lying regions.

The province was hit with heavy rainfall beginning on March 19. Rivers and smaller streams overflew their banks as a result. Some three dams in the region also burst. But the flooding was not confined to Golestan. At least 22 other provinces, out of the country’s 31, have seen heavy downpours and often flooding.

Major General Mousavi explained that the dredger could operate in rivers and shallow waters, cutting up hard sediment and rocks and churning them away to the sides of the waterbed.

“Given that the rivers of the region adjacent to the Caspian Sea basin require dredging, [the machine] will also be used in other regions [in Iran’s north] after finishing its operations in this channel,” Mousavi added.

That operation would in turn make it easier for loaders to work to widen the channel of water, according to the Iranian Army chief.

The dredger of the Iranian Army was earlier transported to the region from the southeastern city of Khorramshahr by three Iranian Air Force transport planes.

Meanwhile, relief efforts continue across the country, with professional and voluntary relief teams being sent to many flood-stricken areas. Helicopters have also been used to get aid to locations made inaccessible via land due to the floods.

Much effort is also being put in enforcing existing dikes and building new ones to withstand potentially more flooding in populous areas.

Unprotected areas at risk of flooding have been evacuated.

The unprecedented rainfall has caused major floods in the provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Gilan, Kordestan, Lorestan, Fars, Northern Khorasan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, and Sistan-and-Baluchestan.

Estimates by government agencies suggest that the floods have taken the lives of at least 67 people, injured nearly 800, and destroyed over 25,000 houses around the country.

Lorestan is said to have suffered the second highest amount of casualties after Fars Province, based on official reports.",4/5/2019 0:00,"{'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190405/51e73459-5207-44d0-a8e3-6b1472e3f0c1.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/22/1aca0468-42ac-48cf-a502-36df1e065a95.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/logo-app/LOGO_192x192.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/twitter-complex.png', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/radio.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190401/906ae784-4466-4ed3-8395-a1de354d1030.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190405/ff913929-51b6-4768-a983-6abf99deff15.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190402/cacc035c-d5b1-413c-8da1-fc4f2917062e.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/22/1b5b0173-8c36-4eed-9833-1f47ef6b852e.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=I6qat1Y1Mn20Io', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190403/b4eb1419-f765-4f82-807e-9ad2697441f7.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190402/b3e7d489-6ab8-41d9-b3d2-0a009d5f5b0f.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/small-banner-for-website-pages.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190404/ea2c52af-25b4-40e8-8cbb-c4a4a7eb80c4.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/LOGO-NEW1.png', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/facebook-complex.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190403/b46e20f3-63ec-455c-b094-b614a049c335.jpg', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190405/25800864-753f-4af0-8641-ad1bd71a60ed.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/live2.gif', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/24/f51a84a0-bb47-402e-9747-3e95142fcff9.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/youtube-complex.png', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190331/23fbdec0-8519-4724-a367-83962fb848d3.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/LOGO.gif'}","['golestan', 'flooding', 'floodhit', 'dredger', 'major', 'iranian', 'iran', 'areas', 'province', 'heavyduty', 'mousavi', 'irans', 'army', 'deploys']",,,flood
78,79,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Environmental challenges plague Iran and the rest of the Middle East - Atlantic Council,https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/environmental-challenges-plague-iran-and-the-rest-of-the-middle-east/,"From left: Barbara Slavin, Kaveh Madani, Peter Gleick, and Caitlin Werrell (Atlantic Council)

In the wake of record floods in Iran that have killed more than two dozen people, new attention has focused on the environmental challenges facing the Middle East.

The issues facing the region are complex and reflect a number of factors, according to experts who spoke on March 27 at the Atlantic Council. Among them are climate change, water scarcity, mismanagement, and poor governance. These challenges have become politicized in both the region and in the United States, and have undermined international cooperation to address them.



Water has been a source of conflict since ancient times, explained Peter Gleick, president emeritus and co-founder of the Pacific Institute. Water has been a trigger for conflict, a weapon used during conflict, a target and casualty of war. According to data from the Pacific Institute, there is an increase in the actual number of violent events associated with water resources. While this increase is visible throughout the world, the greatest number of conflicts are in Western Asia, which includes the Middle East.

Rapidly changing climate patterns have exacerbated problems with record droughts, floods and heat waves, said Caitlin Werrell, chief executive officer of the Council on Strategic Risks and co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security. For the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the primary risks manifest through temperature increases, erratic rainfall, and sea level rise. These threats will put major strains on food, water, energy, and healthcare systems of countries throughout the region, increasing state fragility, unrest, and the likelihood of conflict.

Werrell cited case studies in Egypt and Syria that foreshadowed the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Egypt, a net wheat importer, experienced a 300 percent increase in the price of bread in 2010. Global wheat prices rose due to droughts in China and heat waves in Russia, which devastated harvests. The rise in bread prices led to “protests and riots, particularly in rural areas… The rise in food prices helps broaden the appeal for the country’s spring, beyond Tahrir Square and urban areas,” Werrell added. She also warned that cities such as Alexandria are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. A half-meter increase could displace two million people and introduce salt water into the Nile Delta where Egypt conducts 30 – 40 percent of its agriculture, employing a third of its population. In the Syria case, extreme droughts from 2007 – 2010, were made three times more likely due to climate change and caused 75 percent of the most vulnerable farmers to experience total crop failure, displacing 1.5 – 2 million people.

Regarding Iran, the director of the Future of Iran Initiative, Barbara Slavin commented, “Climate change is clearly a major threat to the entire world, but it is also a convenient political excuse for people that do not want to address their own mismanagement of resources.”

Kaveh Madani, a former deputy head of Iran’s Department of the Environment who is now a senior fellow at Yale University agreed that “Iran is ahead of the curve in terms of problem production,” but said that other countries in the region are “not any better, some indeed much worse.” He gave as an example the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is not suffering from economic sanctions or isolation from the West. However, the UAE has overbuilt its cities and must contend with air pollution and brine from desalinization plants sullying the Persian Gulf.

In some ways, Iran is ahead of the region because of greater environmental consciousness. Madani suggested that the drying up of water sources such as Lake Urmia in Iran’s northwest, was a “turning point.” There are now 850 registered environmental NGOs in Iran, but their work is hampered by politicization and securitization of the issue, he said. Iranians, particularly women, “are very active in the environmental space but people don’t know what will get them into trouble.” A number of environmentalists are in jail and the head of a prominent NGO, Kavous Seyed-Emami, died in prison last year under suspicious circumstances.

Madani, himself, was forced to leave Iran a year ago after being interrogated. The Iranian government is suspicious about the environment and the way in which hostile governments are trying to use the issue to undermine support for the Islamic Republic, he explained. Madani criticized a recent message from the State Department’s Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, which blamed many of Iran’s problems on the over-construction of dams. Many of those dams were planned before the 1979 revolution, Madani noted.

The ability of environmental issues to mobilize and unite people is also something that frightens authoritarian governments, he explained. “It creates paranoia. [Security services] think that every NGO which is in touch with outsiders has an agenda.”

In the past, the US and Iran had a robust program of academic exchanges on issues such as water management, but such programs were halted after the Trump administration came into office. While there is talk of reviving such programs, it would be difficult in the current tense environment following US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.

Werrell suggested that one answer might be “data diplomacy,” sharing information from improved technology such as the ability to measure ground water levels from satellites in space, to help countries better manage limited resources.

Gleick cited other advances such as the ability to grow more food with less water, storm water capture, and waste water treatment and reuse which could help alleviate the stresses of so-called ‘peak water,’ a condition in which the supplies of fresh water are not replenished at the rate they are consumed. Gleick also spoke of “green financing” to support bottom-up ventures to help vulnerable countries deal with environmental challenges.

79,80,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iranians Threatened With Prosecution for Online Postings of Disastrous Flooding - Center for Human Rights in Iran,https://iranhumanrights.org/2019/03/iranians-threatened-with-prosecution-for-online-postings-of-disastrous-flooding/,"Iranian authorities have warned citizens that they could be prosecuted for their online postings about the flooding that has resulted in dozens of deaths and destroyed homes and infrastructure in several provinces throughout the country.

“Not only has the Iranian government been negligent, it has also warned victims’ families and those who have suffered losses that they will be prosecuted if they paint a dark picture of this [natural disaster and state relief efforts],” prominent human rights lawyer Abdolkarim Lahiji told the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).

“The government wants to shift the blame to the people and unleash the police against them,” he added. “We are dealing with a regime that considers it a crime to inform the public about natural disasters and criticize.”

The starkest warning was issued by the state’s cyber police force, referred to by the acronym of FATA, on March 27, 2019.

“All police units in the provinces have been instructed to monitor social media and take swift action against those who publish images and spread rumors that disturb public opinion and disrupt the peace in society,” said Ramin Pashaie, FATA’s deputy chief, on March 27.

Pashaie also accused those who have shared photos and video footage of the damage, particularly from the hardest-hit city of Shiraz, Fars Province, of doing so for personal gain.

“We ask our dear citizens to not pay attention to news from unknown sources on social media because many of these individuals want to take advantage of the recent floods in order to increase their audience and followers,” he said.

According to the state-funded Emergency Services Organization, 44 people had died as a result of flash flooding in Fars, Mazandaran and Golestan provinces as of March 25, including 21 people in Fars.

Iran’s Ministry of Agriculture and Jihad, which manages and oversees the country’s agricultural industry, also announced on March 28 that the sector had so far suffered 2.4 trillion tomans ($573.7 million USD) in damages.

Article 18 of the Computer Crimes Law allows people to be prosecuted for publicly posting material online deemed objectionable by the state under the charge of “dissemination of lies” (with the intention of disturbing the public state of mind).

But not all Iranian authorities have supported the warning.

Lotfollah Dejkam, the Friday prayer leader of Shiraz (he is also Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s representative in Fars Province), said people have a right to be angry at officials for having made poor city planning decisions that have worsened the impact of the floods.

“We cannot just be sit by and watch what’s going on,” he said in a meeting with provincial officials on March 27. “The people have a right to curse and hurl every bad word at us.”

“The floods overflowed because the municipality built buildings over the ravines,” he added “Why did they block the flood’s path near the Quran Gate? Where was the flood water supposed to go?”",2019-03-29 15:51:47-04:00,"{'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/nasrin-sotoudeh-nyt-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Labor-Day-Iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://app.icontact.com/icp/core/signup/tracking.gif?id=117&cid=333585&lid=108255', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-tech-sanctions-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Dual-nationals-nuclear-talks-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Navid-Arkari-iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-farmers-water-protests-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Dual-nationals-zaghari-taghavi-raoof-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-IRIB-films-series-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/High-School-Protests-Iran-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Lawyers-in-Iran-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-workers-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Iran-china-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/10704075_689349141164067_5811827587714389388_n-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Abdolkarim_Lahiji-2-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-humanrights-letter-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Tech-3-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Alireza-Anjavi-en-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Referandum-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Lawyer-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Corona-en-1-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/iran-letter-biden-human-rights-94x73.jpg', 'https://www.iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/CHRI-Logo-282px.png', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/57851378.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Yunesi-moradi-en-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/Guardian-Council-election-94x73.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/001-en-4-1-263x187.jpg', 'https://iranhumanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/001-en-14-263x187.jpg'}","['public', 'flooding', 'warned', 'provinces', 'prosecuted', 'floods', 'prosecution', 'iranian', 'iranians', 'online', 'threatened', 'fars', 'social', 'state', 'disastrous', 'suffered', 'postings']",,,flood

84,85,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Leaders Accused Of Being Tone Deaf In Reaction To Devastating Floods - RadioFarda,https://en.radiofarda.com/a/leaders-accused-of-being-tone-deaf-in-reaction-to-devastating-floods/29845389.html,"Iranian social media users are accusing their leaders of being out of touch after several politicians displayed glib reactions to massive floods that inundated much of the country last week, leaving dozens dead and hundreds injured.

The floods, which affected 28 of Iran’s 31 provinces, began during the Noruz Persian New Year celebrations March 21.

Days after the worst had passed, Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani was the first high-ranking official to visit the devastation, making a trip to the flooded areas in his native province Mazandaran, as well as Golestan, where several towns are submerged.

Videos on social media show him walking among a circle of aides and bodyguards. A woman approaches and complains that she has lost everything and has nothing to eat. Larijani says: ""Thank God that you are unhurt,"" and continues without looking at the woman.

Another tweeted video of the same interaction shows a cleric who tells the woman angrily not to approach Larijani, a member of the opposite sex.

Hundreds of Twitter users have lashed out at Larijani for his unsympathetic behavior, concluding that such scenes reveal the deep divide between the Islamic Republic’s officials and the people.

In another video, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Commander-in-Chief Mohammad Ali Jafari walks in shallow waters with a smile on his face with his bodyguards and plays in the flood water. A Twitter user says jokingly that this ""intelligent move” by Jafari has stemmed the tide of the flood.

Also, there are several jokes and sarcastic comments about Vice-President Es'haq Jahangiri spending the night in his comfortable office and telling the people outside to be mindful of the flood. Many asked what can they do when the “mighty” Islamic Republic itself is incapable of helping its citizens.

Another Twitter user complained of officials and celebrities proudly displaying wet trousers on social media to show they had helped in the flood-hit areas, even though they were in places where the water had already subsided.

Many others harshly criticized officials for not predicting and warning people about the floods. Many asked why roads in the city of Shiraz, where hundreds of cars were swept away by the water, killing 19 according to official figures, were not closed to traffic before the floods hit.

Many called Islamic Republic’s spending on morality police tasked with keeping the sexes separate absurd when there was apparently no money for an early warning system to save lives in the event of a natural disaster.

Many social media users observed that residents, often themselves victims of the floods, rushed to help others, while the military did very little, even after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Kahmenei ordered them to come the people’s aid.

In Shiraz, home owners, mechanics, restaurant owners, and other businesses offered free services to the thousands of stranded tourists who had come to the city for the New Year’s festivities.

One of the main targets for criticism on social media is a rail line constructed by the IRGC in the flood-stricken city of Aq Qala in the north without any bridge to allow flood water to pass through and pour into the Caspian Sea. IRGC forces were forced to detonate explosives to create an outlet for the water, ruining the rail line in the process.

But instead of draining properly, the explosions that destroyed the railway diverted water to the nearby town of Gomishan, causing it to flood.

Meanwhile, many social media users criticized President Hassan Rouhani for his failure to visit the flood-hit areas sooner, and for sending his Intelligence Minister to survey the damage rather than the Roads and Transportation Minister or Energy Minister, whose authority has more bearing on the problem.",,"{'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29845389&SiteId=82&r=271633299&it=0&pd=20190327124928', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4872982E-408F-4DDC-B2C9-C8B60BB967D4_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/1109945373?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3aleaders%20accused%20of%20being%20tone%20deaf%20in%20reaction%20to%20devastating%20floods&c6=leaders%20accused%20of%20being%20tone%20deaf%20in%20reaction%20to%20devastating%20floods&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=leaders%20accused%20of%20being%20tone%20deaf%20in%20reaction%20to%20devastating%20floods&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=top-stories&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29845389&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/4872982E-408F-4DDC-B2C9-C8B60BB967D4_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg'}","['tone', 'larijani', 'islamic', 'twitter', 'floods', 'deaf', 'users', 'devastating', 'minister', 'media', 'reaction', 'officials', 'social', 'accused', 'leaders', 'water']",,,flood
86,87,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Pence Tours Hard-hit Nebraska as Midwest Reels From Historic Floods - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/pence-tours-hard-hit-nebraska-midwest-reels-historic-floods,"Vice President Mike Pence arrived in Nebraska on Tuesday to take stock of the devastation unleashed across the U.S. Midwest by floods that have killed four people, left one missing and caused more than a billion dollars in damage to crops, livestock and roads.

The floodwaters have inundated a large swath of farm states Iowa and Nebraska along the Missouri River, North America's longest river, prompting half of Iowa's 99 counties to declare states of emergency.

""Touched down in Omaha, Nebraska to survey flood damage & thank volunteers & emergency personnel,"" Pence said on Twitter, in a post that included photos of him meeting with the governors of both states and lawmakers.

""The hearts of the American people are with those who have been impacted across the Midwest!"" Pence said in the tweet.

Nebraska, Iowa and Wisconsin have all declared states of emergency in the floods, which stem from a powerful winter hurricane known as a ""bomb cyclone"" that slammed into the U.S. Farm Belt last week, killing untold numbers of livestock, destroying grains and soybeans in storage, and cutting off access to farms because of road and rail damage.

The latest confirmed death was identified by the sheriff in Fremont County, Iowa, as 55-year-old Aleido Rojas Galan, who was pulled from floodwaters along with another man on Friday and later succumbed to injuries.

A Nebraska man who has been missing since the collapse of the Spencer Dam last week on the Niobrara River was identified by the Omaha World-Herald newspaper as Kenny Angel.

Authorities said they had rescued nearly 300 people in Nebraska alone, with some rivers continuing to rise.

Rescuers could be seen in boats pulling pets from flooded homes. Some roadways crumbled to rubble, while sections of others were submerged. In Hamburg, Iowa, floodwaters covered buildings.

In Brownville, Nebraska, floodwaters lapped at the edge of the small town of 132 people, closing the main bridge across the Missouri River.

$1 Billion in Damage

""It's a lot worse than I've ever seen it,"" said Malina Wheeldon, who went ahead with the scheduled opening of her new Euphoric Soul Salon & Boutique business despite the floods. Her husband, Justin, who grew up in Brownville, agreed, saying he had lived through the floods of 1993, 2010 and 2011.

""About every five years now, we have a 100-year flood,"" he said.

The Missouri was expected to crest at 47.5 feet (14.5 m) on Tuesday, breaking its 2011 record by more than a foot (31 cm), the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said. The flooding was expected to continue through Thursday.

Nebraska officials estimated more than $1 billion in flood damage for the state's agricultural sector so far, according to Craig Head, vice president of issue management at the Nebraska Farm Bureau. Head said the number was expected to grow as floodwaters recede.

""It's really too early to know for sure how bad this is going to get. But one thing we do know: It's catastrophic for farmers,"" said Matt Perdue, government relations director for the National Farmers Union trade group. ""We're hoping it's only $1 billion, but that's only a hope.""

Nebraska officials estimate the floods have caused $553 million in damage to public infrastructure and other assets, as well as $89 million in privately owned assets, according to the state's Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday.

The water also covered about a third of Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska, home to the U.S. Strategic Command, whose responsibilities include defending against and responding to nuclear attacks.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is distributing 400,000 sandbags to operators of 12 levees along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas that were in danger of being breached by floodwaters, the Army Corps said in a news release on Tuesday.

In Niobrara, Nebraska, south of the Missouri River near the border with South Dakota, Mayor Jody Stark said flooding that began on Thursday had devastated his community of 350 people, with businesses being the hardest hit.

""Our road system is shot pretty much in every direction coming into town,"" Stark said.

""It's one day at a time. We will do what we can to get back on our feet,"" Stark said. ""It's just so heartbreaking. It's going to be tough, but hopefully we can all get through it.""

The floodwaters were the result of snowmelt following heavy rains last week and warm weather, said Bob Oravec, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.

Roads leading to the Nebraska Public Power District's Cooper nuclear plant near Brownville were engulfed by floodwaters from the Missouri, but the facility was still operating safely at full power on Tuesday.

The plant operator was flying staff members and supplies to the plant with helicopters, said power district spokesman Mark Becker.",,"{'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_floyd2.jpg?itok=NDv0f9He', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/logo.svg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/5E3FEFEA-2B4B-4195-B797-D92F83FCB614.jpg?itok=lZZqi8P1', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/reuters-pictures/2019/11/RTX79RHR.jpg?itok=_LNRDkW5', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/718x474/s3/2020-06/AP_20154425488954.jpg?itok=ntLlgWfY', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/D4F8B4FF-275E-48D2-B1BD-3A510E14936D.jpg', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 269 177'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/6F378C1E-BB38-406E-A02A-744D096EE314.jpg?itok=tSg_xZ6v', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E"", ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 718 474'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144653264128.jpg?itok=Dwj8rEJa', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_737px_wide/s3/2019-04/D4F8B4FF-275E-48D2-B1BD-3A510E14936D.jpg?itok=CPTh4fHY', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21116836146190.jpg?itok=FXTSRaQt', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144573359020.jpg?itok=DQvhdXKD', 'https://www.voanews.com/core/themes/stable/images/core/throbber-active.gif', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_737px_wide/s3/2019-04/6F378C1E-BB38-406E-A02A-744D096EE314.jpg?itok=y30erkm3', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/892x501/s3/2019-04/DA7A5438-B308-422F-BC6F-8824E6BB9D35.jpg?itok=cPT95Ppq'}","['flooding', 'floods', 'nebraska', 'ashland', 'missouri', 'pence', 'historic', 'floodwaters', 'iowa', 'states', 'national', 'midwest', 'hardhit', 'tours', 'river', 'reels']",,,flood
87,88,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Four dead in Pishin as flood system enters Balochistan from Iran - Geo News,https://www.geo.tv/latest/234089-four-dead-as-rain-storm-entering-balochistan-from-iran-sweeps-away-car-in-pishin,"Geo News/Screenshot via Geo.tv

QUETTA: At least four people died and one injured as a flash flood ""system"" — that entered Balochistan after wreaking havoc in Iran — swept away a car Saturday evening in the Pishin district, authorities said.

According to Levies officials, the flood in Khanai Baba River hit the car of Abdul Noman and his family, all residents of Kuchlak and who were on their way to attend a wedding in Khanozai, and swept it away in its strong currents.



Abdul Noman, alongside his grandchildren Ubaid Khan, Saraun Khan, and Saffan Khan, were all in the car when the flood took it and declared dead later. A woman nearby was injured but saved by the rescue personnel.



The woman who was saved was transferred to a local hospital and was being tended to.

More than 150 Hindu pilgrims rescued from Bolan: ISPR

According to Inter-Services Public Relations, more than 150 Hindu pilgrims were rescued and shifted to a safe place through helicopters.

The ISPR said that the rescue activities, due to flash floods in Sibbi and Kalat, have been continuing since past 36 hours.

The Balochistan government, district administration, and Pakistan Army took part in the rescue mission in the province.

Iran storm 'system' enters Pakistan

Last week, Iranian officials said the disaster had so far killed 62 people, left aid agencies struggling to cope, and seen 86,000 people moved to emergency shelters.

The flooding had also caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to Iranian agriculture as the parliament speaker questioned whether government funds would be adequate to compensate communities and farmers.

About 1,900 cities and villages have been affected by floods and exceptionally heavy rains since March 19.

Now, however, that the clouds system has entered Balochistan, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) have forecasted storms and heavy rains and said it was expected to stay for at least a couple of days.

Both organisations have predicted heavy rainfall for the next two to three days in various Balochistan districts, including Sherani, Zhob, Musakhel, Qila Saifullah, Loralai, Barkhan, Pishin, Quetta, Qilla Abdullah, Mastung, Chagai, Sibi, Ziarat, Harnai Khuzdar, Nasirabad, Kharan, Turbat, and Awaran.

In addition, the canals and rivulets in the province are expected to overflow and, thus, warnings have been issued.

The PDMA, on the other hand, has issued an alert given the forecast of heavy rains in the coming week. It has further written a letter to the deputy commissioners of all districts in Balochistan, advising the imposition of Section 144 on all picnic points.

Moreover, the Gwadar district administration, in light of extreme stormy rains, has advised all fisherfolk to stay out of the sea today and tomorrow.",,"{'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/reporters/9_045859_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-25/s_351738_051017_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/logo-green-white.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-blue.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-twitter.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-whatsapp.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351686_092106_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/desktop_search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS1.png', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-green.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351667_062003_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2019-04-14/234089_063954_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/time.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/print.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/reporters/6_122513_reporter.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351660_054942_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-25/s_351734_040415_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351654_052932_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-menus-icons/search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351673_074735_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/detail-facebook.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351700_111819_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-loader.gif', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2019-04-14/234089_7142338_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-25/s_351739_060028_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-white.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351692_095307_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-25/s_351736_053734_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/geo-logo.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351701_113704_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/Menu-green.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351706_114714_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351671_070308_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-blue.svg?124', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/logo-blue.svg?111', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351691_095232_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2021-05-24/l_351682_083909_updates.jpg', 'https://www.geo.tv//assets/front/images/geo-menus-icons/search.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/close.svg', 'https://www.geo.tv/assets/front/images/GEO-TV-ICONS2.png'}","['car', 'woman', 'rains', 'rescue', 'flood', 'system', 'iran', 'enters', 'dead', 'heavy', 'khan', 'pishin', 'balochistan', 'district']",,,flood
88,89,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"Midwest Livestock Industry Hit Hard from Blizzard, Floods - DTN The Progressive Farmer",https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/livestock/article/2019/03/25/midwest-livestock-industry-hit-hard,"Private disaster aid continues to pour into all three states in various ways, including farmers sending hay and feed to help producers with stranded livestock. Convoys of hay bales have been streaming in. The Nebraska National Guard has been air dropping bales of hay to livestock in parts of the state.

A Colfax County, Nebraska, rancher boarded a Chinook helicopter with the National Guard on the morning of March 20, hoping to be able to drop hay to his flood-stranded cattle north of the Platte River in northeast Nebraska.

""We haven't done anything like this in 50 or 60 years,"" Nebraska National Guard Major General Daryl L. Bohac told reporters during a news conference in Lincoln that day as he related the story.

LITTLE TIME TO PREPARE

Some cattlemen had only a few minutes or hours to escape the water and limited time to move their livestock to safety. In the last two weeks, ranchers tried to dig out their buried cattle from the snowdrifts, or rescue their panicked cattle from floodwaters.

However, thousands of cows and their vulnerable new calves have been lost.

On March 15, the Nebraska State Patrol shared a Facebook video of what could be seen from a helicopter flying over the flooded areas. ""From the Fremont area this morning. Each of those little islands had dozens of cattle on it, stranded with no place to go,"" wrote the Patrol. ""Our thoughts are with our ag and livestock producers as they will be greatly affected by this.""

Pete McClymont, the executive vice president of the Nebraska Cattlemen, told DTN the punishing weather from the blizzard and floods is creating a lot of stress for livestock producers.

""Even the best livestock managers are going to have issues in these types of conditions,"" McClymont said.

CONCERNS ON CLEANING UP

Farmers and ranchers will need to take care as they clean up from the floods.

Personal protective gear -- such as clothing, helmets, goggles or other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury or infection -- will be needed, said Chad Roy, professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane School of Medicine in New Orleans. He spoke at a webinar put on by the AgriSafe Network on March 21.

""Contaminants from flood water is a witch's brew,"" Roy said.

Floodwaters in rural areas can contain many different contaminants from various sources. This includes ag chemicals, fuels, animal and human waste, and even decomposing livestock.

E. coli, for instance, can be liberated when animals die and can be in the floodwaters.

The Environmental Protection Agency has already announced it is testing drinking water in the Nebraska flood zone, including sampling private drinking water wells. Late last week, EPA said it had found high levels of E. coli contaminating standing water in Fremont, Nebraska.

Repeated exposure without protective equipment could lead to issues with infections, Roy said.

STRESSED LIVESTOCK

There is also danger in working with animals who survived the floods but remain stressed.

Aaron Yoder, associate professor of environmental, agricultural and occupational health for the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) Extension, said those working around livestock need to be cautious when handling these animals because they have just gone through a traumatic event, and they may still be panicking. Get the scene stabilized, feed the animals and keep everyone safe, Yoder recommended.

HELP AVAILABLE

Livestock owners who suffered animal or poultry fatalities because of the flooding may qualify for USDA's Livestock Indemnity Program, which would pay producers for up to 75% of their market losses. This is available for beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs, poultry and other forms of livestock. (https://www.fsa.usda.gov/…)

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) urges farmers to work with their insurance providers and take inventory of any damage. The department's website, https://iowaagriculture.gov/…, provides a list of resources for those impacted.

In Nebraska, the University of Nebraska has set up a website to provide resources, including places to donate or volunteer: https://flood.unl.edu/…

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture is ready to help producers affected by the blizzards and flooding who need hay, feedstuffs, fencing materials, volunteer help and equipment.

Callers to the department at 1-800-831-0550 should be prepared to share their name, contact information, type and number of livestock, location (including county), the type of assistance needed and how urgent the need is.

Nebraska Department of Ag staff will gather the information and identify needs to react accordingly, including the use of the National Guard and other state resources.

A list of disaster relief resources for Nebraska farmers and ranchers also is available online at: https://buff.ly/…. The website includes links to USDA Farm Service Agency programs, including the Livestock Indemnity Program and information from the Nebraska Extension.

OPERATION HAY LIFT

North Dakota-based nonprofit Farm Rescue is launching Operation Hay Lift. The group launched its efforts in 2017 in response to drought conditions, delivering hay to ranchers in need.

Farm Rescue has been coordinating a similar effort for Nebraska ranchers. You can find more information about Farm Rescue at http://farmrescue.org/….

USDA continues to encourage farmers and ranchers to contact their local Farm Service Agency offices to see what kind of resources are available to them. USDA stated it has an emergency loan program with up to $500,000 to help farmers recover from production and physical losses. The loan program is triggered by the federal disaster declaration that President Trump approved for Iowa and Nebraska. (https://www.fsa.usda.gov/…)

People wishing to receive or offer help can see more at (https://www.dtnpf.com/…), although people are also cautioned to be careful and protect themselves against scams or fraud.

90,91,FL-2019-000022-IRN,LinkedIn: US Midwest Floods Prompting Workers to Migrate to Safer Ground - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/usa/linkedin-us-midwest-floods-prompting-workers-migrate-safer-ground,"NEW YORK - Deadly floods in the U.S. that bear the fingerprints of climate change are prompting an exodus of workers from the Midwest, the world's biggest professional social network, LinkedIn, said Wednesday.

The website, on which millions of U.S. workers maintain profiles, said data showed a spike in members changing their work location from areas flooded last month to cities in the Southwest and on the West Coast.

""When you look at the most real-time data that we have, and that's our 'job starts', we've seen those come down quite a bit in the cities that have been hit,"" said Guy Berger, chief economist at LinkedIn.

The finding emerged from a LinkedIn analysis of user-generated data. LinkedIn users can share their location and job information — such as when they start a new job — on their profile.

Hiring rates tracked through the platform dropped across the Midwest, LinkedIn said in its April U.S. workforce report, published Monday.

Omaha, Nebraska, and Fargo, North Dakota, registered among the most extreme decreases in hiring rates at nearly 8 and 14 percent respectively, it said.

The findings were based on the more than 155 million profiles of U.S. workers that are listed on the site, the company said.

The U.S. labor force — employed and unemployed people — totaled 163 million people last month, according to the Department of Labor.

Climate change had a hand in the record floods that have damaged crops and drowned livestock along the Missouri, Red and Mississippi rivers, especially in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri, scientists have said.

Fargo was also among communities impacted, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

LinkedIn's workforce report said that it has noticed ""migration trends"" following other natural disasters, such as Hurricane Irma, which hit the U.S. East Coast in 2017.

Workers would likely move to such cities as Denver, Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix and Seattle, largely due to their proximity, affordability and growing economies, Berger predicted.

It was unclear how permanent the retreat of workers from Midwest areas that were recently flooded would prove to be, Berger said.

But a repeat of extreme weather events could lead to ""a sustained bleed of talent,"" he said.

A handful of American cities, from Duluth, Minnesota, to Cincinnati, Ohio, have begun promoting themselves as future havens for U.S. climate migrants as climate change is predicted to cause intense natural disasters elsewhere.",,"{'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_floyd2.jpg?itok=NDv0f9He', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_737px_wide/s3/2019-04/756034D8-BE14-4C1E-90FB-EE5E1820F317.jpg?itok=CVuw6hay', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/logo.svg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/892x501/s3/2019-06/EA3EA74A-F649-4252-B012-2C2DCA046E9A.jpg?itok=6Fg5_Msi', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/reuters-pictures/2019/11/RTX79RHR.jpg?itok=_LNRDkW5', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/718x474/s3/2020-06/AP_20154425488954.jpg?itok=ntLlgWfY', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E"", ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 718 474'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144653264128.jpg?itok=Dwj8rEJa', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21116836146190.jpg?itok=FXTSRaQt', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-06/EA3EA74A-F649-4252-B012-2C2DCA046E9A.jpg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144573359020.jpg?itok=DQvhdXKD', 'https://www.voanews.com/core/themes/stable/images/core/throbber-active.gif'}","['linkedin', 'cities', 'flooding', 'floods', 'data', 'ground', 'workers', 'prompting', 'missouri', 'shows', 'iowa', 'migrate', 'job', 'midwest', 'safer']",,,flood
91,92,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iranian people join armed forces to aid flood-hit provinces - PRESSTV,https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/03/25/591856/Iran-flood-relief-Golesan-Mazandaran,"Iranian people from all walks of life are joining the government and the armed forces in a nationwide relief campaign to help thousands of fellow countrymen and women affected by historic floods in two northern provinces.

Over 56,000 people have been affected in various cities and rural areas in Golestan and Mazandaran as a result of heavy rainfall that hit the two provinces on March 19 and 20. The severe flooding has so far killed at least five people.

On Monday, Iranian social media users launched an online effort using the Persian hashtag #رفیق_گلستان_باشیم (Let’s be friends with Golestan) in coordination with the Imam Khomeini Relief Foundation (IKRF).

The campaign is aimed at raising money and gathering basic commodities required to start the reconstruction and rehousing operations. IKRF offices around the country are ready to receive the aid items and deliver them to the flooded areas.

The Iranian Red Crescent Society, a non-governmental organization (NGO), launched a similar campaign on Sunday.

Residents in Aqqala in Iran's Golestan province are moved to safety.

On Saturday, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei called on officials and the nation to assist the flood-affected people.

The Leader’s official website has since been updated with a new feature that allows direct contribution to relief efforts.

Iranian celebrity figures have also joined in on the effort by encouraging their huge online fanbase to help relieve the difficult situation.

It was reported on Monday that donors have already contributed large sums of money to speed up the reconstruction process in Mazandaran.

Senior official Kamal Akbari said the Ministry of Interior had received numerous requests from NGOs offering voluntary aid services in flood-hit areas, adding they will begin their work from Tuesday.

Armed forces at work

Major General Mohammad Baqeri, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said Saturday that he had ordered additional and coordinated efforts to help the relief campaign.

Commander of Iran's Basij resistance force Gholamhossein Gheybparvar speaks to residents in Aqqala which has been inundated by historic floods.

He has authorized commanders in the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), the Iranian army, police, and the defense ministry to use forces under their command to provide “full and organized” assistance in flood-hit areas in a coordinated manner.

Baqeri has appointed his deputy, Major General Ataollah Salehi, as the field commander at the head of a group of high-ranking military chiefs to coordinate relief efforts between the armed forces and civilian organizations on the ground.

Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, who has been touring the flood-hit regions, told reporters that relief efforts have been going forward at a strong pace thanks to coordination among all sides.

Authorities in Aqqala, one of the cities hardest hit by flooding, said they had to detonate a small part of the railway network in the area in order to speed up drainage and prevent greater damage to the tracks.

During the operation, explosives were placed underneath the tracks to help drain the flood waters.

According to local officials, no parts of the tracks were damaged in the explosion and the network would resume operations soon.",3/25/2019 0:00,"{'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190324/43bd6c02-2efd-4ad4-94e0-1694d52805ca.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/photo/20190325/5b9d07bc-0813-43bf-8511-28cc0ed90c38.jpg', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/6c408b21-9234-4671-a1bd-0e8794537f32.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/logo-app/LOGO_192x192.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/22/1aca0468-42ac-48cf-a502-36df1e065a95.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/twitter-complex.png', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/radio.jpg', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/d72c7121-46a5-4b20-9222-1d6c37f90c59.jpg', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/22/1b5b0173-8c36-4eed-9833-1f47ef6b852e.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=I6qat1Y1Mn20Io', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/991d2eb3-83f0-4eb6-86ac-d84b6fe65221.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/small-banner-for-website-pages.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/LOGO-NEW1.png', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/facebook-complex.png', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/d30bba03-0c18-4295-bf35-4dabfdaa7b40.jpg', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/c573a9db-9515-43d8-8d38-1b56f5d9520f.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/live2.gif', 'https://cdn.presstv.com/Photo/2021/5/24/f51a84a0-bb47-402e-9747-3e95142fcff9.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/youtube-complex.png', 'http://217.218.67.233//photo/20190325/697069b0-74f4-4766-9077-998c08199974.jpg', 'https://www.presstv.com/custom/images/site/LOGO.gif'}","['join', 'relief', 'floodhit', 'provinces', 'help', 'red', 'aid', 'iranian', 'forces', 'armed', 'areas', 'parts', 'society']",,,flood

The government has recorded at least 56 deaths and over 500 injuries, as of Wednesday. Forecasters have warned that more rain is on the way.

Many of those affected are in evacuation camps because of floods that have destroyed their houses, damaged roads, washed away bridges and killed livestock.

Weather experts say the flooding was a result of a tropical cyclone that blew in from neighboring Mozambique.

MacDonald Clemence, one of the victims, said it was at midnight while he was fast asleep when he was awakened by the sound of something falling down with a thud. He immediately woke others and found that it was a wall of their house, and immediately sought refuge at a chief’s house until the following morning when they were told to stay at camp set up in Nsanje.

The roaring water which entered his house swallowed almost everything he had, but he managed to escape with his two children.

He said they are now hoping to receive food and blankets, and arrange a place in the upper land where to resettle.

Malawi President Peter Mutharika has declared the 14 affected districts disaster areas and issued an urgent appeal for help.

But the delivery of relief items that have started to trickle in is being hampered by flooded roads.

Francis Kadzokoya, a disaster risk management officer, said many relief items might have to be delivered by air.

“Probably we would want to call upon our mother department to help us with a helicopter so that we should be airlifting some of the relief items to the camps which cannot be accessed by the road,” said Kadzokoya.

Meanwhile, community health workers have been deployed in the camps to treat those in need of medical care and advise people on practices that help prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases.

Bram Makawi, a senior disease control surveillance officer in the Ministry of Health, said efforts are underway to prevent ailments like malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and eye infections.

Similar floods in southern Malawi four years ago killed 276 people and displaced 230,000 others.

Kadzokoya said the government is now planning to start relocating people from flood-prone areas to higher ground.

“I think we would actually do away with the aftermath of these serious disasters like the one we experienced in 2015, and even these we have just experienced in March 2019.”

However, forecasters have warned of another week of steady rain starting March 14 in parts of southern and northern Malawi.

As floodwaters began to recede in much of the area inundated by the aftermath of a storm dubbed a ""bomb cyclone,"" Nebraska officials were taking in the damage in a state where 64 of the 93 counties have declared emergencies.

""This is clearly the most widespread disaster we have had in our state's history,"" in terms of sheer size, Governor Pete Ricketts told reporters on an afternoon briefing call.

State officials said on the call that 290 people had been rescued by the Nebraska State Patrol, National Guard troops, and urban search and rescue teams.

Damage to the state's livestock sector was estimated at about $400 million, while the full impact on the spring planting season was not yet clear, said Steve Wellman, director of the Nebraska Department of Agriculture.

The state's highway system suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, said Kyle Schneweis, director of the state Department of Transportation, with more than 200 miles of roadways needing repair or replacement. Some 540 miles of highways remained closed, he said, down from 1,500 at the peak of flooding.

The three known fatalities included an 80-year-old woman who perished at her Columbus, Nebraska, home, despite attempts to rescue her from rising floodwaters, said Colonel John Bolduc of the Nebraska State Patrol.

Bolduc said a young man from Norfolk, Nebraska, was swept away and killed after driving his car into moving water, and a Columbus man died when the tractor he was using to help free a stranded driver overturned.

One person was missing and presumed dead following the collapse of the Spencer Dam along Niobrara River in southwest Nebraska, Buldoc said.

Vice President to Visit

The Missouri River, the longest in North America, has flooded much of Nebraska between Omaha and Kansas City at the Missouri state line.

The river was expected to crest at 47.5 feet (14.48 m) on Tuesday, breaking the previous record, set in 2011, by more than a foot, the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency said in the latest bulletin on its web page.

Ricketts said he had requested emergency assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and been in contact with the Trump administration.

Vice President Mike Pence would travel to Nebraska on Tuesday to survey the damage, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter. Ricketts and Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds have both declared states of emergency

The Missouri River's overflowing banks cut off roads leading to the Cooper nuclear plant, near Brownville, Nebraska, forcing operators to fly in staff and supplies by helicopter. The plant continued to operate safely, its operator said.

Water also covered one-third of that state's Offutt Air Force Base, near Bellevue, home to the U.S. Strategic Command.

At least 30 buildings were flooded by up to eight feet of water and 30 more structures damaged on the base, the Omaha World-Herald reported, citing a base spokeswoman.

The National Weather Service reported some of the region's larger rivers were running at record high levels, causing levee breaks. Some small towns and communities have been cut off by floods while others were short of fresh drinking water.

Streets in Lincoln, Nebraska's capital, were barely visible as high water surrounded homes, cars and trees, according to photos released to Reuters by state authorities. Elsewhere in the state, one highway near Waterloo was submerged, and piles of debris and damaged roads were visible in Niobrara.

Floodwater climbed up the sides of buildings at Camp Ashland, an Army National Guard facility in Ashland, Nebraska.

Warmer temperatures will speed the pace of snow melt across the region and add to already swollen rivers, the NWS said, possibly forcing more evacuations in communities along the Missouri River on the Nebraska and Iowa border, as well as along the Elkhorn and Platte rivers in Nebraska.

97,98,FL-2019-000022-IRN,Iran Bans Export Of Onions And Potatoes To Keep Prices Low - RadioFarda,https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-bans-export-of-onions-and-potatoes-to-keep-prices-low/29852415.html,"The Iranian Ministry of Industry, Mining and Commerce has banned the export of onions and potatoes. The ban will become effective on April 4.

Prices for for onions and potatoes have risen to unusual levels in the Iran in recent weeks. One kilogram of onions is now 160,000 rials (roughly $1.25), which is a high price as minimum wage earners make ends meet with around $100 per months.

The ministry said the ban was imposed in order to regulate domestic markets.

The main reason for the price rise is the imbalance between local prices compared with prices in neighboring countries. As the Iranian currency has lost its value against the dollar, merchants make more money by exporting certain food items, such as vegetables or meat.

There have been reports that even meat imported to keep prices low is exported by influential people, to pocket the difference.

At the same time, Iranian authorities lifted the ban on exporting tomatoes.

Recent floods across Iran has washed away plantation areas, leaving a bleak prospect for the domestic agricultural products, and most certainly, Iran has to import vegetables for the next year as flooded agricultural lands will not be usable for some time.",,"{'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print_color.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/46AA8D06-4E43-4E07-B84D-B66ACDFE652B.png', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/ABE8E20F-FC47-4B9E-A255-AC1690444787_w1200_r1.jpg', 'https://bbg.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/b/ss/bbgrrfefardaeng-bbgprod-bbgentityrferl-bbgunitradiofarda/1/G.4--NS/1120810709?pageName=rfe%3afar%3ar%3aarticle%3airan%20bans%20export%20of%20onions%20and%20potatoes%20to%20keep%20prices%20low&c6=iran%20bans%20export%20of%20onions%20and%20potatoes%20to%20keep%20prices%20low&v6=D=c6&g=https%3a%2f%2fen.radiofarda.com&c1=D=g&v1=D=g&events=event1&c7=iran%20bans%20export%20of%20onions%20and%20potatoes%20to%20keep%20prices%20low&v7=D=c7&c16=radio%20farda&v16=D=c16&c5=iran-news&v5=D=c5&ch=english&v15=D=ch&c15=D=ch&c4=article&v4=D=c4&c14=29852415&v14=D=c14&c20=no&c17=responsive&v17=D=c17', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-print.gif', 'https://livetracker.rfe.pangea-cms.com/counter.lt?PageType=1&RecordId=29852415&SiteId=82&r=2010826245&it=0&pd=20190331093437', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/ABE8E20F-FC47-4B9E-A255-AC1690444787_w250_r1_s.jpg', 'https://gdb.rferl.org/D51C5515-2CD2-4580-BB87-46AE0D67AFD7.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/img/player-spinner.png', 'https://en.radiofarda.com/Content/responsive/RFE/en-IR/img/logo-compact.svg'}","['onions', 'low', 'exporting', 'ban', 'prices', 'vegetables', 'price', 'ministry', 'iranian', 'iran', 'export', 'bans', 'potatoes']",,,flood
98,99,FL-2019-000022-IRN,"After Devastating Floods, US Midwest Farms Need Funds to Recover - Voice of America",https://www.voanews.com/usa/after-devastating-floods-us-midwest-farms-need-funds-recover,"Missouri farmer Richard Oswald needs a lot of help to recover from flooding that left his home and farm looking like a manmade island in an inland sea.

Relief groups are giving tetanus shots and handing out free meals and cleaning supplies near his farm in the Langdon-Rock Port area, about 100 miles (161 km) northwest of Kansas City.

But what Oswald really needs is money.

Hit by the worst flooding in living memory, he and thousands of other farmers along the Missouri River will each require hundreds of thousands of dollars in disaster funds or loans to start over.

""The typical response on flood relief is groups like the Red Cross show up with paper towels and rubber gloves and scrub buckets,"" said Oswald, 69, who does not expect to be able to get to his home or land for weeks. ""The biggest thing farmers need is cash, or ways to access funds.""

'Bounce Back'

Slammed by a trade war and low commodity prices, Midwest family farms have been in the red and in decline for the last five years. The number of U.S farms fell by 100,000 between 2010 and 2017, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.

Thousands more will now go under without emergency financial support for flooding, pummeling heartland economies almost entirely dependent on agriculture, farmers and aid groups said.

It is a call federal and state agencies, as well as non-governmental and faith-based relief groups are answering.

President Donald Trump has approved disaster declarations for Nebraska and Iowa, making federal disaster funding available in flood-hit areas. Missouri Governor Mike Parson declared a state of emergency, paving the way for similar actions in his state.

""I know we aim for bringing everything back up to where it was,"" said Rosalynn Days-Austin, a USDA emergency coordinator helping direct Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) efforts in flood-affected areas. ""Sometimes that's not always possible, for a variety of reasons, but the goal is definitely to help them bounce back from their loss.""

Cash Preferred

Relief groups like Farm Aid are tending to the immediate needs of farmers, distributing tens of thousands of dollars in ""emergency grants"" - $500 gifts from cash donations that help families pay for things like groceries. After that, the group and its partners advise farming families on how to access federal disaster funds they hope are coming soon.

""What we're hearing, because of the snowpack and rain and the wet ground, is that farmers are going to be dealing with this throughout the spring. So we're in it for the long haul,"" said Jennifer Fahy, a spokeswoman for the group established by country singer and activist Willie Nelson.

US Forecasters Say Unprecedented Spring Flooding Possible The stage is set for unprecedented major flooding this spring for most of the nation, U.S. weather officials said Thursday. More than 200 million Americans are at risk for some kind of flooding, with 13 million of them at risk of major inundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its spring weather outlook .

More than 200 million Americans are at risk for some kind of flooding, with 13 million of them at risk of major inundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its spring weather outlook .

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) is coordinating a long-term response to get displaced families housed, navigate the red tape of insurance companies and federal agencies and tend to the mental health needs of people who have suffered extreme trauma, said Bishop Brian Maas.

""We have national partners and coalitions within the state,"" said Maas, who is asking people to hold off donating more material goods, for now. ""There will be stresses because we've not done anything of this magnitude.

""Now we have mountains of cleaning supplies and so forth that can't be used,"" Maas said, appealing to people to get back in touch in a month to see how they can donate then. ""Cash is the most flexible way to respond.""

'FEMA is Worthless'

Another immediate need is feed for livestock.

Relief organization Farm Rescue is collecting donations of hay in the Dakotas and trucking it to farmers whose cattle are starving after their feed stands were submerged in floodwater.

""I don't know of anything this widespread that has ever affected so many people in our service area,"" said Dan Erdmann, a spokesman for the group which helps family farms get through crises ranging from natural disasters to medical emergencies.

Farm workers, some of them undocumented and legal migrants, have been hit hard. Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska is looking at housing assistance for displaced people who previously paid around $300 a month rent and now face rents triple that due to a dearth in properties, said Stacy Martin, chief executive of the social services charity.

While relief groups tend to urgent needs, farmers like Scott Olson say more federal relief money is needed at a time when low crop prices and high debt levels are limiting farmers' access to credit. He is counting on a farm relief bill in Congress for extra disaster compensation after he successfully lobbied in Washington for similar funds following 2011 flooding.

""Flood insurance isn't going to cover this worth a darn. FEMA is worthless,"" said Olson, who farms 3,000 acres near Tekamah, Nebraska and runs a farm equipment business. ""They don't have any money, nobody has any money.""",,"{'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/ap_floyd2.jpg?itok=NDv0f9He', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 269 177'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/D4F8B4FF-275E-48D2-B1BD-3A510E14936D.jpg?itok=TFaIFAJ9', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 192 108'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21116836146190.jpg?itok=FXTSRaQt', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/E49DF5BB-5B3A-49BC-B442-19D3C839E18E.jpg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/892x501/s3/2019-04/E49DF5BB-5B3A-49BC-B442-19D3C839E18E.jpg?itok=7prMhUDz', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/221x146/s3/2019-04/EC57DF53-28F9-4892-B236-11F97DE4D541.jpg?itok=agU1VTAN', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/718x474/s3/2020-06/AP_20154425488954.jpg?itok=ntLlgWfY', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144573359020.jpg?itok=DQvhdXKD', 'https://www.voanews.com/themes/custom/voa/logo.svg', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/reuters-pictures/2019/11/RTX79RHR.jpg?itok=_LNRDkW5', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 221 146'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/6F378C1E-BB38-406E-A02A-744D096EE314.jpg?itok=tSg_xZ6v', ""data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 718 474'%2F%3E"", 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/192x108/s3/2021-05/AP21144653264128.jpg?itok=Dwj8rEJa', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced_737px_wide/s3/2019-04/D4F8B4FF-275E-48D2-B1BD-3A510E14936D.jpg?itok=CPTh4fHY', 'https://www.voanews.com/core/themes/stable/images/core/throbber-active.gif', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/4AB5EC6C-4B54-435D-AA23-3EFBC381225A.jpg?itok=_wsxpA3-', 'https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/269x177/s3/2019-04/5E3FEFEA-2B4B-4195-B797-D92F83FCB614.jpg?itok=lZZqi8P1'}","['flooding', 'farms', 'relief', 'floods', 'spring', 'need', 'groups', 'missouri', 'devastating', 'farm', 'federal', 'emergency', 'farmers', 'recover', 'midwest', 'needs', 'funds']",,,flood
