""Rescue operations are still underway to search for other victims, while dozens of houses are damaged and buried in the landslide and thousands of homes are inundated,"" Nugroho said in a statement.

Torrential rain on Saturday triggered the unexpected flooding across the province, causing deadly landslides. In one instance, a mud avalanche buried five people in their homes as it swept across a village.

In another district, ""a huge landslide struck the cars and people on the street. Nine bodies were retrieved,"" Nugroho added.

The country's disaster mitigation agency sent five emergency rescue teams to assist regional bodies in searching for survivors and evacuating victims.

Authorities erected temporary shelters to house those fleeing the natural disaster.

""Purworejo district is the hardest hit with the most people killed in numerous villages in the district,"" Nugroho said.

The vast tropical archipelago is especially prone to landslides caused by extreme weather.

In 2014, over 70 people went missing after a mudslide buried 105 houses in the village of Jemblung in Central Java.

Heavy rains that showered Surakarta, Central Java, from Saturday afternoon through to early Sunday have caused floods that are 50 to 100 centimeters deep in several areas across the city. The flooding, to which the overflowing Bengawan Solo River contributed, has inundated hundreds of houses, forcing more than 2,000 people to take refuge elsewhere.

Three districts, namely Jebres, Pasar Kliwon and Serengan, are the most affected by the flooding and within them the hardest hit areas are Pucangsawit, Sewu, Sangkrah, Semanggi, Kedunglumbu, Joyontakan, Gandekan, and Gulon.

The floodwaters reportedly began to inundate residential neighborhoods at around 8 a.m. local time on Saturday, after which the water levels continued to rise until Sunday afternoon, forcing more residents to relocate. Search and Rescue Agency (SAR) teams were dispatched to assist the residents, especially women, children and the elderly, using rubber boats.

“We’re worried that the floodwater will not yet recede tomorrow [Monday] so it would be better for us to relocate,” said Rubiyah, 55, a Joyotakan resident.

On Sunday evening, hundreds of Joyotakan residents still packed evacuation posts on river dikes and sidewalks and in schoolyards.

Volunteers from the Surakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) and the city’s Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) have set up evacuation tents and dispatched public kitchen vehicles.

“We dispatched the vehicles to several flooded locations. We don’t erect public kitchen tents anymore to serve food to refugees. It’s much more efficient and effective to use public kitchen vehicles to provide the services,” said Surakarta Deputy Mayor Achmad Purnomo when he visited flooded areas in Joyotakan.

PMI Surakarta secretary Sumartono Hadinoto said the humanitarian aid agency had sent food supplies to the flood victims. He said it was predicted the number of evacuees would continue to increase as many residents were still trapped in their houses. The floods also hit Solo Baru, an elite residential neighborhood in Surakarta.

The Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned people to be wary about potential natural disasters as a result of the heavy downpours expected to recur over the weekend.

The BMKG has predicted there will be heavy rain from June 17 to 20 in several areas in Indonesia based on atmospheric indications, Yunus S. Swarinoto, meteorology deputy at the agency said in a press statement on Friday.

There is also potential for thunder storms and high winds during the rain, Yunus said.

""We strongly urge people to be aware of potential flooding, flash floods, landslides and fallen trees,"" he said in the statement.

Areas predicted to have a high intensity of rain include Aceh, North Sumatra, West Sumatra, Riau, Bengkulu, Bangka Belitung, South Sumatra, Lampung, Jakarta, Banten, West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, East Java, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, Maluku and Papua.

The BMKG has also warned sea transportation operators to watch out for heavy rain and heavy swells in the southern part of Sumatra, Java, Bali and East Nusa Tenggara.

People can contact the BMKG on its 24-hour call center 021-6546315/18 to get the latest information on weather forecasts or log on to its official website web.meteo.bmkg.go.id.

3,3,FF-2016-000062-IDN,64 dead in Indonesia landslides as La Nina brings heavy rains - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/64-dead-in-indonesia-landslides-as-la-nina-brings-heavy-rains/,"Central Java was hit the hardest, with 59 people confirmed dead in the province.

At least five people were killed in the Sangihe Islands in Sulawesi.

An environment ministry adviser is calling for natural resource extraction in Java, the world’s most crowded island, to be reigned in.

Last year, an extended dry season brought on by El Nino set the stage for one of the worst natural disasters Indonesia has seen, the devastating forest and peatland fires that burned an area the size of Macedonia.

This year, an extra-wet dry season brought on by La Nina is bringing calamity in a different form: floods and landslides.

At least 64 people were killed this month in landslides and flash floods and thousands more were displaced, the nation’s disaster management chief, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said on Friday.

Central Java caught it the worst, with 59 dead in the province, including 43 casualties in Purworejo district, which has declared a state of emergency.

At least five more died in the Sangihe Islands in North Sulawesi.

Ninety-nine people have been killed by landslides this year, Nugroho said, and more than 2,000 had died or gone missing since 2005.

The landslides, he added, were expected to peak from December to March 2017.

The government has installed Landslide Early Warning Systems in parts of the country, but many of them are not working well, according to Nugroho.

Community and local government preparedness were also low, he said, based on surveys by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and UNESCO.

He called for the government to raise the National Disaster Mitigation Agency’s budget.

“Ideally, 1% of the budget would be earmarked for dealing with national disasters,” he said. “Now it’s .02-.07%.”

Massive development on Java, the world’s most crowded island, has tended to neglect the environment, according to Soeryo Adiwibowo, a Bogor Agricultural Institute professor and senior Environment and Forestry Ministry advisor.

In the 19th century, Java’s forests spanned 10 million hectares, an area the size of South Korea. By 1989 they covered only 1 million hectares, and in 2005 they spanned 400,000 hectares.

Deforestation creates the condition for landslides because trees hold the soil in place.

“Natural disasters will continue to increase if the carrying capacity of the environment is not taken into account,” Adiwibowo said.

The area around Java’s South Coast Road was shaping up to be a new growth center, he added.

A 2008 study by Adiwibowo and colleagues, which found that Java was being dangerous overexploited, “did not get a good response from the government,” he said.

The professor said the cement industry should not continue in Java and asked the government to issue a negative investment list for the island to clamp down on natural resource extraction.

“China already made a negative investment list, including for the cement industry, so now they’re all flocking to Java.”

4,4,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Natural Disasters Have High Negative Impact on Children and Schools in Asia Pacific - The Wire,https://thewire.in/environment/natural-disasters-have-high-negative-impact-on-children-and-schools-in-asia-pacific,"Bangkok: A greater humanitarian focus on schools before, during and after natural disasters will save lives, protect children and benefit communities and countries, Save the Children says in a report due out this week.

The report details the impact on education of earthquakes, floods and storms that struck Nepal, Myanmar, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vanuatu last year.

The disasters range from large humanitarian crises – such as the massive twin quakes in Nepal that killed 8,900 people – to the seasonal floods and storms that batter the Asia-Pacific region.

“The earthquake in Nepal had a huge impact on the country and received international media attention,” said author of the report, Sarah Ireland, by phone from Melbourne.

“Floods in Indonesia happen every year, and we often don’t hear about them,” she added.

Researchers estimate the lives of 200 million children per year will be severely disrupted by disasters in coming decades.

Here are facts and figures from Save the Children’s report.

Indonesia

Between January and August 2015, Indonesia experienced 1,160 disasters, including drought, forest fires, volcanic eruptions, landslides and floods.

Also during that period, there were 373 floods, affecting 607,000 people, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Rains in January 2015, submerged roads in Jakarta, and more downpours in February caused further flooding, affecting more than 27,000 people.

The floods affected 351 schools in northern Jakarta. Inaccessible and submerged, some were closed for up to two weeks.

Vanuatu

The Pacific island nation of Vanuatu is home to about 250,000 people, with 64% of the population exposed to natural hazards each year, including storms, floods, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.

Cyclone Pam, a category 5 storm in March 2015, triggered floods that destroyed infrastructure, homes and livelihoods, affecting 80% of Vanuatu’s people and leaving half the population in need of emergency assistance.

More than half of schools were damaged or destroyed, and 34,500 children were affected.

Schools were closed for up to 30 days, and 34 schools were used as evacuation centres.

Nepal

A 7.8 magnitude earthquake on April 25, 2015, followed by a 7.3 magnitude quake on May 12, 2015, killed 8,900 people, destroyed 605,000 homes and damaged 288,000 more.

About 3.2 million children were affected by the quakes, and of those, 870,000 were left without permanent classrooms.

More than 8,200 public primary and secondary schools were damaged in the quakes.

Nearly 52,200 classrooms were damaged or destroyed.

Myanmar

In June 2015, seasonal rains triggered heavy flooding in parts of Myanmar.

At the end of July, Cyclone Komen brought heavy rains and strong winds, resulting in severe, widespread flooding that affected more than nine million people across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions.

From June to October, the floods displaced about 1.7 million people and damaged 4,116 schools.

About 250,000 children could not attend school because of the floods.

Philippines

In 2015, 14 typhoons and tropical storms hit the Philippines.

Between 2007 and 2011, 10.8 million students in the Philippines were impacted by disasters, and 8,472 schools were used as evacuation centres.

Typhoon Koppu, a category 3 storm in mid-October, hit central Luzon, north of Manila, causing widespread floods and landslides.

The typhoon displaced one million people and damaged 803 schools, which were closed an average of two weeks, while 138 schools were used as evacuation centres.

5,5,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Indonesia's historic shift to an urban economy - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/indonesias-historic-shift-to-an-urban-economy/a-19345723,"Indonesia is experiencing a major and rapid structural change, from a predominantly rural and farm-based economy to an urban services-based economy, concluded a recent World Bank report titled Indonesia's Urban Story.

Cities in Indonesia are expanding at a rate of 4.1 percent per year, the report stated. It also estimated that by 2025, in less than 10 years, about 68 percent of the Southeast Asian nation's population would be living in urban areas.

The country's urbanization is among the fastest in the world, with the size of its urban land increasing by around 1,100 square kilometers between 2000 and 2010 – second only to China.

Urbanization, many economists argue, promotes economic growth and boosts incomes. ""Cities increase formal employment and productivity - these gains can strengthen Indonesia's ability to generate and share prosperity,"" said the WB study.

However, such masses of people moving from villages to cities present not only opportunities but also a multitude of challenges such as growing congestion and worsening pollution levels.

Infrastructure deficit

A deficit in urban infrastructure is constraining Indonesia's cities, the report noted. ""The quality of urban infrastructure is poor in Indonesia, and access to basic services, such as clean water, sanitation, electricity and transportation, has remained generally limited and not well distributed.""

The study revealed that only 48 percent of urban households now have access to safe water, compared to 50 percent over a decade ago. Meanwhile, sewerage coverage exists in just 11 of the nation's 98 cities and only two percent of city dwellers have access to centralized sanitation systems.

Indonesia has a severe infrastructure problem and the cities are already stretched, says Paul Rowland, a Jakarta-based independent political analyst.

""Housing is already at a premium as land prices have skyrocketed in the past decade and government cannot keep up with the demand for housing in what are already some of the world's most densely populated urban areas,"" he told DW.

""Urban sprawl and unregulated development in the suburban areas of Jakarta and Bandung have also resulted in landslides and more downstream flooding,"" Rowland added.

Underinvestment

The country's weak urban infrastructure is an outcome of decades of underinvestment, experts say, stressing that insufficient investments leave many communities vulnerable to poverty.

While Indonesia's economy expanded by an average of 5.8 percent in the mid to late 2000s, its infrastructure stock rose by just three percent. In contrast, China's spending on infrastructure over the past decade amounted to around 10 percent of its economic output.

""The lack of infrastructure capital is clearly a major constraint, especially in large metropolitan cities, which are stagnating while small cities lack in their delivery of basic services,"" says Sumedh Deorukhkar, Asia economist at BBVA Research.

Recognizing the need to respond to the nation's infrastructure deficit, the Indonesian government has ramped up its spending in recent months.

""The government over the past year has announced a spate of measures aimed at enhancing consumer purchasing power as well as boosting investment activity and industrial competitiveness,"" Deorukhkar noted.

Managing the process

But despite the acceleration in infrastructure spending, Indonesia still needs to plan and implement major medium-term urban infrastructure development to cope with the rapid increase in projected urban populations, says Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific Chief Economist at IHS Global Insight.

This will require sustained medium-term infrastructure development for urban water supply and sanitation, affordable housing, power generation, ports, airports and urban public transportation systems, he told DW. ""The development of modern smart city infrastructure and building of advanced urban townships will help to accelerate industrial development and inward foreign investment by multinationals.""

This is particularly important to deal with the challenge of promoting industrialization and creating enough jobs in urban areas to absorb the fast-growing numbers of workers.

If Indonesia is successful in industrializing its economy and boosting industrial output for both the fast-growing domestic consumer market and for exports, this will result in strong migration flows of rural workers into cities, Biswas said. ""Indonesia's future industrialization and urbanization will occur in tandem.""

A failure to effectively plan and manage the process of urbanization would lead to tremendous economic and social troubles, warn experts. The problems include sprawling urban slums, high rates of unemployment, poverty and crime.

Political impact

Besides decrepit infrastructure, issues related to land acquisition, access to formal credit facilities and rigid labor laws also dampen the positive impact generated from urbanization, analyst Deorukhkar said.

Rowland believes increasing urbanization has had an impact on politics in the country's urban areas. He says, in the past few years, voters have elected reformers to head Indonesia's three largest cities and they are making a difference by improving services and beginning to tackle longstanding issues like traffic, flooding and pollution.

""With increasing urbanization, it is to be hoped that the identity and crony politics of the past will begin to lose sway.""","Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19328542_6.jpg,"['areas', 'indonesias', 'urbanization', 'urban', 'indonesia', 'cities', 'economy', 'shift', 'past', 'historic', 'development', 'infrastructure']", ,none

9,9,FF-2016-000062-IDN,"Indonesia, South Korea central bank websites hit by cyber attacks; no losses - Reuters",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-banks-cyber-idUSKCN0Z70KI,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - The central banks of Indonesia and South Korea have been hit by cyber attacks on their public websites since activist hacking group Anonymous pledged last month to target banks across the world, senior officials in the two countries told Reuters.

In response to the attempted hacks, Bank Indonesia (BI) has blocked 149 regions that don’t usually access its website, including several small African countries, Deputy Governor Ronald Waas said in an interview late on Monday.

He said several central banks were hit by similar attacks and were sharing the IP addresses used by the perpetrators.

Central banks have been on high alert in the wake of revelations that hackers issued fraudulent money transfers to steal $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank in February.

No money was lost in the attacks on Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea, which were mainly DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attempts, the officials said.

There was no word on who the hackers were.

Waas said the cyber attacks were unsuccessful because of the cooperation between central banks.

“There is regional cooperation between central banks. Those who have gotten hit are sharing their experiences,” he said.

Anonymous, a loosely associated international network of activists and hackers, originated in 2003. It said in a YouTube video posted in early May that it would launch a 30-day campaign to attack central bank sites in what it dubbed as Operation Icarus.

DDoS is its preferred method of attack, disabling websites by flooding them with internet requests, overwhelming the servers temporarily. Sometimes the hackers succeed in gaining access to data, but rarely do they penetrate more critical systems in such attacks.

Bank of Korea officials told Reuters there was at least one DDoS attack on the bank’s website in May. No harm was done, they said.

“In May, we’ve had so many disturbances,” Benny Sadwiko, who is leading Bank Indonesia’s cyber security efforts, told Reuters.

“They are trying to attack the reputation of the banks. So we’re blocking IP addresses from countries that don’t usually access us.”

In just half a day on Monday, Bank Indonesia detected 273 viruses and 67,000 spam emails to its email server and website, officials said.

In early May, Greece’s central bank said that its website became the target of a cyber attack by Anonymous for a few minutes before the bank’s security systems managed to tackle it. The Central Bank of Cyprus has also said its website briefly came under attack in May.","Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160621&t=2&i=1142182052&r=LYNXNPEC5K09P&w=800,"['hit', 'banks', 'indonesia', 'losses', 'attacks', 'website', 'cyber', 'attack', 'websites', 'hackers', 'central', 'bank', 'korea', 'officials', 'south']", ,none
10,10,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Inside Indonesia - Inside Indonesia,https://www.insideindonesia.org/samarinda-s-deadly-mining-pits,"Tessa Toumbourou

On 23 March 2016 two high school students – Noval Slamat Riyadi, aged 16, and Diki Aditya Pratama, aged 15 – were found drowned in an abandoned mining pit in Kutai Kartanegara, East Kalimantan. The teenagers’ deaths bring to 22 the number of children that have drowned in unused, water-filled mining holes in East Kalimantan since 2011. Only three months prior, a 13-year-old, Aprilia Wulandari, was found drowned in a soccer field-sized mine pit on the outskirts of Samarinda, the regional capital of East Kalimantan. Aprilia was reportedly playing with friends on her way home from school when she fell into the unmarked pit.



One hundred-and-fifty such pits scar Samarinda’s landscape, with an estimated 500 in total across East Kalimantan, according to the regional branch of the Network for Mining Advocacy (JATAM). JATAM recently released a confronting YouTube film with interviews of the families who have lost children to mining pits.



Decentralisation laws, particularly the 2009 Minerals and Coal Mining Law, gave district and municipal administrations the authority to issue mining permits. As a result, mining has exploded across Indonesia. In East Kalimantan alone, nearly 50 per cent of the province is now covered in coal mining permits, threatening agricultural land and conservation areas. New powers for allowing district governments to issue permits did not, however, correspond with an increase in budget or capacity for local management and monitoring of mining operations or clean-up activities. The results are devastating.

The costs of a poorly monitored mining industry

Decentralisation and the global mining boom brought chaos to the industry. In many places multiple permits have been issued for the same land area, permits have been allocated illegally in conservation and protected forests and along water catchment areas, and there has been a huge loss of state revenue – official estimates suggest that up to half of Indonesia’s mining companies pay no royalties and are not registered to pay tax. A recent investigation by Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission identified losses of almost US$1.24 billion in public revenue across Indonesia’s mining sector. Of a total of 10,827 mining permits issued across the country, 4563 were found to not meet ‘clean and clear’ standards, which include having a detailed environmental impact assessment and a post-mining reclamation and rehabilitation plan.



The proliferation of mining permits has had a damaging impact on people and the environment, particularly in Samarinda, where mining consumes 70 per cent of the municipality’s land area. Some mines are located within metres of homes and schools. While the industry brought employment and investment, it has also been the source of much angst –landslides and flooding worsened as a result of mining expansion in Samarinda according to JATAM’s research, with the World Wildlife Fund estimating the cost of the resulting damage at around $9 million.



Acids and sulphates from mining have leeched into rivers, contaminating local water catchment areas, fish ponds and wet rice fields according to local farmers in and around Samarinda who have experienced dramatic reductions in yields as a result.





Samarinda from the air - JATAM East Kalimantan

With the boom in coal exports now over, many small and medium-sized mines have closed or remain inactive. But they continue to pose a serious threat to residents. The blue-green colour of the water-filled mine pits lures young people to them, who then misjudge the depth of the pits and the steep sides that make them difficult to escape. Furthermore, Greenpeace researcher Cut Hilda Meutia found that the pits contained high levels of chemicals, including magnesium, iron, aluminium, cadmium and arsenic. As the impact of ingesting or absorbing these chemicals is not immediate, the negative effects accumulate over time.

The community’s right to a clean environment

Civil society organisations (CSOs) have worked hard to push local administrations to clean up abandoned sites. For years, CSOs have advocated for improved management of mining in East Kalimantan, home to 28 per cent of Indonesia’s coal reserves. In 2013, after 11 people had drowned in disused mining pits in East Kalimantan, CSOs decided to pursue legal avenues. A case was submitted to the Samarinda High Court on 25 June 2013, beginning a year-long trial known as the Gerakan Samarinda Menggugat (Samarinda Citizen Lawsuit, GSM). Nineteen plaintiffs impacted by coal mining presented at the trial, including rice farmers and fishermen who claimed that their diminishing water supplies were increasingly acidic due to dust particles released by mining operations.

On 16 July 2014, judges ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, finding that the government had been negligent in fulfilling their obligations under the 2009 Environmental Law, which states, ‘Everyone shall be entitled to a proper and healthy environment as part of their human rights’. By not fulfilling this requirement, the court decided, the local government had denied the people of Samarinda their right to enjoy a clean and safe environment. The court also ordered the government to evaluate all coal mining permits in Samarinda, monitor reclamation and other post-mining efforts, and take action to protect community farming and fishing areas from contamination by coal mining activities. Yet, since then little has improved, and children continue to drown in exposed coal mining pits in Samarinda and in the neighbouring district of Kutai Kartenegara.

Shifting authority and shifting blame

NGOs believe one of the reasons for the sluggish response could be the recent reforms that have shifted authority over mining permits. The Regional Governance Law (Law No. 23/2014) introduced in October 2014 moves authority for coal and mineral mining (as well as forestry and fisheries) from district governments to provincial governments and the central government. Following a transition period, which should be completed by 2 October 2016, provincial governments will be responsible for issuing permits, and also for evaluating the status of problematic mining permits in their jurisdictions. Governors must report the results to the central government, which will decide whether to maintain or cancel the permits.



Muhammad Muhdar, lawyer and researcher at Samarinda-based NGO Prakarsa Borneo, explains that post-mining clean-up and pit closure is the responsibility of companies. District governments – until the introduction of the new law – were tasked with enforcing and overseeing this process. Yet despite the real dangers of leaving mine sites exposed, companies often evade their reclamation responsibilities. Laws require that companies set aside funds for reclamation activities before conducting extraction work, but in practice these obligations are often not met. ‘There are many companies that do not put aside reclamation funds, so the government doesn’t have the resources it needs to close mine sites,’ says Muhdar.



Frustrated with government inaction and excuses, CSOs have tried to find creative responses to the problem. ‘The government always gives the excuse that there is not enough funding for closing mines’, says Merah Johansyah of East Kalimantan JATAM. NGO activists have held actions following children’s deaths in local mining pits, asking fellow Indonesians to donate Rp.1000 to crowd-fund mine closures. ‘When the funds are collected, we’ll give the money to the government. So they won’t have any further excuses for inaction.’





Protestors demand improvements to mining governance in Samarinda - JATAM national

Better late than never

East Kalimantan governor Awang Faroek Ishak has indicated his willingness to reform mining governance. Awang has a chequered past when it comes to the mining industry. During his time as district head of East Kutai, Awang was named by the Attorney General’s Office for embezzling state funds resulting from the sale of a portion of coal company PT Kaltim Prima Coal. But his recent attention to the industry’s problems is welcome, even if it comes late in the day.



In 2013 Awang issued a provincial moratorium on new concessions for mining, plantations and pulp and paper, which was restated in 2014. Awang has issued a statement saying that those companies on whose concessions mining-pit deaths have occurred must submit a mine closure plan and report on reparations paid to victims. Perhaps the most important reform has been the passing of a provincial regulation in 2015 enacting a supervisory commission. The commission will consist of government and civil society representatives tasked with overseeing mining reclamation and clean-up efforts, an important development that will introduce transparency and participation in the mining clean-up process, ensuring that pits are closed safely and in accordance with environmental standards.



An important step for improving mining governance in Indonesia will be ensuring that the shift in authority for mining permits from district to provincial governments does not slow down reforms. In the end it is the central government that should ensure there is no confusion over the division of responsibilities between the districts and the provinces.



President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, was in East Kalimantan on 23 March 2016, when the bodies of teenagers Noval and Diki were found in mining pits. In response Jokowi has issued an audit of all mining permits issued in East Kalimantan. ‘I order the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to control and check mining [operations], especially small mining sites that don’t prioritise work safety,’ Jokowi told media in Balikpapan.



It seems momentum is finally gathering, and there is now an opportunity to tighten controls and mitigate further losses to human life, and to the ecosystems on which life is sustained. For this to happen, Jokowi needs to ensure that his demand for an audit of the mining sector results in real improvements in mining governance in East Kalimantan.

Is the state ready for the heavy downpour?

Business & Politics News - India & You

Criss-crossed by several rivers, including the mighty Ganges, West Bengal has traditionally been vulnerable to heavy floods each year. With the Monsoon knocking its door, is the state better prepared this year?

After two years of deficient rains, the India Meteorological Department (Met) has forecast that this year the monsoons would be higher than usual, about 106 of the average. The news was bound to bring cheer to hundreds of millions of farmers around the country whose crops have been ruined for two years running due to scanty or untimely rains. Yet, there would be some trepidation as well, especially in states that are particularly vulnerable to heavy floods even during a year with average rains.

West Bengal is one such state, which has floods even when rest of the country cries out for rains as it happened in 2015 when despite a 14 pc deficit in rains, severe floods in 12 districts of West Bengal affected around 3.7 million people.

West Bengal has 37,660 sq. km flood prone area while the total geographical area of the state is 88,752 sq. km. The flood problems of the state are different in different regions. Along with the Ganges, the rivers Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka and Raidak flow through the districts of Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. They originate either in the neighbouring country of Bhutan or the state of Sikkim and flows down to West Bengal before reaching Bangladesh. While in some places excessive monsoons bring serious flash floods, dam breaks have also caused catastrophic flooding in Bengal. Neutralising flood risks have always been a daunting task for the government in the history, will it deliver this year?

Barely a month after Mamata Banerjee took oath as the Chief Minister for the second time, after having scored a thumping win in the elections; the Met forecasts spread panic in the closed door meetings of the new government. The West Bengal state government alarmed by the onset of monsoon is planning measures to limit floods and its consequent annihilation.

DVC aids flood management

The government formed two dedicated flood control rooms — one in North Bengal and another in the south and two senior officials have been posted at the DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) headquarters to monitor the situation. The control rooms would ensure that the government is forewarned on the release of water from the dams. Moreover, the top state bureaucrats will be meeting every day at Nabanna (the state secretariat of West Bengal) and monitor the government’s response to heavy monsoons this year.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee blamed DVC for floods in some parts of the state last year. The government had alleged that sudden release of water from DVC dams without proper intimation had caused loss of lives and livestock. However, the Damodar Valley Corporation, this year has assured West Bengal government of support and better co-ordination with regard to release of water from its dams as in heavy monsoon situations which are likely to trigger floods.

Other measures

Apart from these measures, the irrigation department has identified 145 kilometres of vulnerable river embankments and dams. While the restoration work has already begun, the government is also keeping a close watch on the other river banks especially in the rural areas.

According to sources, the state government is also discussing disaster measures with national and international NGOs such as the Red Cross Society, Bharat Sevashram and St John Ambulance services. The disaster management department has reportedly dispatched teams and relief materials to the flood-prone districts of the state. However, speculations are still lingering about political prejudice and foul play with regard to distribution of flood relief in remote areas.","Fri, 17 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Floods-Bengal.jpg,"['group', 'rains', 'bengal', 'flood', 'dams', 'vulnerable', 'west', 'floods', 'state', 'india', 'water', 'heavy', 'media']", ,flood

21,21,FF-2016-000062-IDN,How a volcanic eruption in Indonesia inspired Frankenstein. - Slate Magazine,https://slate.com/technology/2016/06/how-a-volcanic-eruption-in-indonesia-inspired-frankenstein.html,"Two hundred years ago this June, during a dreadfully cold and wet summer, Mary Shelley began writing Frankenstein. Since then Frankenstein has become iconic, spawning a legion of adaptations and reinterpretations. The Oxford English Dictionary even includes entries for the verb “to frankenstein,” which means to stitch something together in a grotesque fashion, and the prefix “franken-” to make anything monstrous. The novel is shorthand for the dangers of unfettered scientific progress. But the unforgettable creation scene, depicted in movies with frenzied screams of “It’s alive!” and arcing electricity, doesn’t happen until one-third of the way through the novel. If you’ve never read the book, you might expect the story to begin with Dr. Frankenstein recounting his mistakes or heading off to school to study anatomy. Instead, we start with Robert Walton, an Arctic explorer. The Arctic exploration might seem random, but it makes more sense in the light of the environmental crisis unfolding in the Northern Hemisphere when Shelley was drafting the novel.

Mary Shelley was an astute observer of the world; her journals reveal a young woman with a powerful drive to learn, reading a range of political, literary, philosophical, and scientific works. For Frankenstein, she seems to have been inspired by a series of electrical experiments and new microscopic discoveries to imagine whether it would be possible to infuse the spark of life into dead flesh. But her observations were not limited to the world of books—they extended to the environment around her to include the dark forests of eastern France, the sublime peaks of the Alps, and the miserable weather of 1816. In her preface to the 1831 edition of Frankenstein, Shelley comments that the summer of 1816 in Geneva, where she was staying, was memorably unpleasant: “it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house.” This dreary weather wasn’t a chance occurrence—it was just one small manifestation of larger environmental changes.

Between April 5 and 11 of 1815, the volcano Tambora erupted in Indonesia, more than 7,500 miles away from Geneva. Tambora’s eruption is one of the largest in recorded human history, 100 times more powerful than Mount St. Helens’ 1980 explosion. The eruption pumped a massive quantity of sulfur into the atmosphere, radically cooling the Northern Hemisphere by 0.7 degrees Fahrenheit to 1.26 degrees Fahrenheit.* In essence, people living between 1815 and 1816 experienced an extreme, miniature global climate change event.

The constant rain that Mary complains about in her preface caused flooding in Geneva, forcing people out of their houses and onto higher ground. Thanks to Tambora, violent storms rolled over Switzerland and much of the rest of Europe. In June 1816 temperatures in New England began to fluctuate wildly, going from 82 degrees Fahrenheit on June 5, to -30 degrees the next day as reported by the Connecticut Courant (now the Hartford Courant). In Quebec there are reports of frost the week of June 12–19, followed by a brief return to temperatures as high as 75 degrees (more normal for June), followed again by snow and ice. (These numbers may not be totally accurate, since they were anecdotal reports in 19th century newspapers.)* Accordingly, 1816 has been called “Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death” and “The Year Without a Summer.”

In parts of London the weather had a rather mundane impact. La Belle Assemblée in July reports, “The precarious state of the weather, with the departure from town of several fashionists belonging to the higher classes, and the more serious causes of emigration, have rendered the modern toilette less subject to fluctuation than might otherwise been expected.” Thanks to the unseasonable weather, the trendsetters (the fashionists) left London earlier than usual so the mode of dress (the toilette) was more subdued.

But the radical shift in climate had far more serious effects, too. The Connecticut Courant reports the weather had a macabre fallout on the bird population: “A variety of birds, among which are the hummingbird, the yellow bird, the marten and the beautiful scarlet sparrow have been so benumbed, as to be taken by the hand and great numbers have actually perished by the cold.” The birds that were “taken by the hand” were likely eaten, not nursed by the fire until they regained their strength. Other stories include birds flocking to towns seeking warmth and respite from the frozen woods, only to be trapped by hungry humans.

One feature occurs again and again in the news reports: a focus on food. Even brief discussions of the weather are reliably accompanied by concerns about the availability of food. The weather was destroying crops, setting people on edge. Reports out of Montreal, again printed in the Connecticut Courant, suggest that the city was on the verge of rioting because “the high price of bread excites general alarm, but it is owing to artificial causes. Wealthy individuals have engrossed the flour that came to Montreal, and now extort the enormous profit of center per cent. … The situation of the poor in general throughout the Province is dreadful.” There were riots in the United Kingdom; in the city of Frome, citizens raging against skyrocketing potato prices were subdued by the cavalry. La Belle Assemblée might seem to suggest that London was insulated from the unrest, but even it hints that were “more serious causes of emigration” from the city as it became home to masses of displaced vagrants and beggars.

One report out of Maine, in the Connecticut Courant, notes, “A famine for man and beast seems to stare us in the face.” The author goes on to ask, “What is to become of us? We hope, notwithstanding, that the God of harvest will not utterly forsake us.” Famine was widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, stretching as far as China where there are accounts of people eating clay to survive. Conservative estimates put the death toll from Tambora’s disruption of agriculture at 71,000—all because the weather was 0.7 to 1.26 degrees cooler than normal. Distressingly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s projections for global warming suggest that the earth’s climate will be roughly 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer on average by about 2025.

The Year Without a Summer is why Robert Walton is important to Frankenstein: Like the newspapers, he’s concerned about surviving climate chaos. Walton journeys to the Arctic in search of a northern paradise. He says that in the Arctic “the sun is for ever visible; its broad disk just skirting the horizon, and diffusing a perpetual splendour. … There snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe.” Frankenstein begins with the search for new, more habitable lands because of environmental anxieties. People did not know that the cooling trend was a temporary result of volcanic activity. Rather, they thought the summer of 1816, with its famine, social unrest, and winter eternal, was the new normal. To survive in this afflicted world, new sources of food and land would be necessary, so Walton heads north hoping to find a balmy Eden. Amusingly, Walton would have found the Arctic much balmier now: The Arctic was already about 5.22 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than average in 2015. That might open up the Arctic to farming but at the same time the Middle East might become an uninhabitable wasteland not to mention other unforeseen changes.

At the end of the novel, Walton, at the urging of his crew, turns his ship around, ending his quest to find the Arctic Eden. Walton and Frankenstein (who is telling Walton his story, after the captain saved him) are both frustrated by the sailors’ cowardice. The crew doesn’t want to die for glory, honor, and science. Later Frankenstein reconsiders his anger and reflects that he remembered too late: “My duties towards my fellow-creatures had greater claims to my attention, because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery” than his need for self-aggrandizement. The novel emphasizes social responsibility in the face of a climate crisis.

Today, archival technologies allow us to understand the human dimension of climate changes throughout history: How have people in different times and places reacted to a dynamic, deadly world? Reading arcane and previously lost documents, like stories chronicling the summer of 1816, gives us the opportunity to understand the complex nature of our world, to remember what we might have forgotten, and to consider how our communities and societies can be more resilient in the face of a changing climate. The future will always be unpredictable, but every day is an opportunity to learn more from the past and put that knowledge to work. A volcano, a novel, and a smattering of newspaper reports can reveal a possible gap in our thinking about climate change today—the bedrock importance of food security and the turmoil shortages will cause, because the difference between sustenance and starvation can be a matter of degrees.

Footage depicts a bull being sledgehammered to death in Vietnam. Credit:Animals Australia Instead of suspending the trade, the Australian government expedited the approval of dozens of facilities in Vietnam, and approved exports that effectively flooded the market with Australian animals. Even though the department was aware of endemic regulatory breaches, Vietnam was permitted to become Australia's second largest export market for live cows for slaughter, with more than half a million Australian animals exported over the past two years alone. The country now has almost 200 approved facilities, with more abattoirs than exist in Australia. A bull appearing to be wearing an Australian tag in footage filmed undercover in Vietnam. Credit:Animals Australia

The rate of market expansion into Vietnam has made it virtually impossible for industry and government to monitor compliance with Australian standards, opposition agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon says. Blindly pursuing new export opportunities in countries without animal-welfare laws or slaughter standards is undoubtedly a contributing factor, but the problem is far more systemic, far more ingrained, in the live export regulatory system as a whole. After footage of the shocking abuse of cattle in Indonesia was broadcast on the ABC's Four Corners in 2011, the live export trade to that country was suspended and the Gillard government introduced the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System (ESCAS) as a means of protecting animals along the supply chain. The system continues to be touted as ""the world's best animal welfare system"" by both major parties. ESCAS purports to hold exporters accountable and to trace Australian animals, from Australian paddock to overseas slaughterhouses, to ensure minimum standards are met. Importantly, the system also aims to resolve jurisdictional barriers that prevent the Australian government from imposing and enforcing Australian animal welfare standards on importing sovereign states.

As indicated by repeated investigations, ESCAS has proved a monumental failure. Since its inception, there have been more than 100 regulatory breaches of ESCAS by Australian exporters, many of which resulting in abhorrent cruelty to Australian animals in importing countries. From a legal perspective, it's not difficult to see why the system has failed. ESCAS imposes obligations on exporters, even though the exporters have little direct control over animals once they leave Australian shores. It imposes minimum standards on importing countries, even though these standards are unenforceable and set a low threshold for welfare, such as permitting animals to be slaughtered without pre-stunning. And importantly, it's impossible to regulate away significant welfare issues inherent in the trade, such as the stress of prolonged transportation. Critically, laws are only effective if there is a willingness and ability to enforce them. Responsibility for enforcing live export regulations rests with the Department of Agriculture. In a clear conflict of interest, the department is also responsible for promoting and facilitating the industry. It is little wonder that the department has failed to sanction a single exporter for breaching the system - whether by means of a fine and/or revocation or suspension of an export licence. The system doesn't work.

Sadly, after years of shocking live export investigations - of animals having their tendons slashed in Egypt, subject to traditional rope slaughter in Indonesia, or mutilated in the streets of Jordan - this is no longer news to the Australian public. We're now accustomed to activist footage of live export cruelty. And with every new investigation, the same industry and government lines are repeated as if for the first time: that these are isolated incidents; that Australia is better able to lift global welfare standards by continuing with the trade; that we must have faith in the system. But we know that these are not isolated incidents. We know that welfare standards cannot possibly be improved when exporters are flagrantly breaching regulations with impunity. And we know better than to have faith in a system that serves only to legitimise a trade that is indefensible. Politicians from both major parties must take action. It's time to bring an end to this trade, or at the very least, suspend exports to Vietnam pending a thorough and independent investigation of these systemic failings. Until such time as the trade is brought to an end, responsibility for enforcing the industry must be taken away from the Department of Agriculture, and reinvested in a truly independent office of animal welfare.","Wed, 22 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1.0088%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_793%2C$x_243%2C$y_277/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_social_wm/l_text:PT%20Sans_41_bold_italic:%20from%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_84%2Cx_288%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/l_text:PT%20Sans_41_bold:%20%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_90%2Cx_375%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/l_text:AbrilTitling-Bold.ttf_83:%202016%20%2Cg_south_west%2Cy_15%2Cx_274%2Cco_rgb:0a1633/f957e814d26a2a9ceaddb7e8b4a723afe2f5dc4d,"['department', 'agriculture', 'conflict', 'export', 'vietnam', 'welfare', 'australian', 'cattle', 'interest', 'animals', 'shows', 'system', 'live', 'departments', 'trade', 'standards', 'horror']", ,none

24,24,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Time to End Impunity for Suharto’s Crimes in Indonesia and Timor-Leste - Common Dreams,https://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/06/27/time-end-impunity-suhartos-crimes-indonesia-and-timor-leste,"Indonesia recently held a symposium on the violent events of 50 years ago which brought the Indonesian General Suharto to power. The results were inconclusive as the dictator’s defenders denied the massacres and attacked those who want Indonesia to finally deal with its blood past.



The tragedy of 1965-1966 is part of a long history of massacres by the Indonesian military. As East Timorese, we know very well the brutality of the Indonesian dictator’s regime. I was born after the initial Indonesian invasion in 1975, but grew up under the occupation. As a young student, I saw the Indonesian military intimidate and abuse youth suspected of supporting East Timorese independence. We were not safe anywhere: Suharto’s troops would seize us at home, school or on the streets; many were never seen again. I watched helplessly as soldiers murdered my cousin, Luis Gusmaõ Pereira, in a public market in Triloedae-Laga.



During 1965-1966, the Indonesian military and its militias carried out mass executions of those suspected of involvement or support for the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Amnesty International estimates that between 500,000 to one million people lost their lives. Others were tortured and imprisoned, some for decades. Members of their families were denied employment and schooling. Many had no option but to live among their persecutors, as shown in the Oscar-nominated documentaries The Act of Killing and The Look of Silence.



Cold War fears often justified U.S.-backed military interventions against democratically-elected governments. Sukarno, the founding president of Indonesia and Suharto’s predecessor, carried out a populist political program linked to social and economic justice, supported by the PKI and many other groups. Sukarno also helped found the Non-Aligned Movement that stood apart from the Cold War blocs. The U.S., believing Indonesia was acting too independently, supported Suharto’s seizure of power and cheered the mass killings.



A decade later, Suharto sought and received U.S. backing for its plan to launch the brutal invasion and illegal occupation of Timor-Leste. Up to 200,000 East Timorese were killed, as the U.S. showered military and other support on Indonesia. Timor-Leste’s Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation final report, Chega!, documented numerous crimes against humanity during Indonesia’s 24-year occupation, including massacres, rape, torture, and forced disappearances. Many died of starvation when the Indonesians forced communities from their farms and gardens and then blockaded food supplies. Declassified documents show that the US government understood that both the invasion and occupation were illegal, yet it still provided military assistance, knowing that it would be used against the people of Timor-Leste.



Survivors, the families of victims, and human rights activists have worked to win justice and accountability for the crimes against humanity during the 1965-1966 period. While we’ve seen some light in democratic progress under Indonesia’s current President Joko Widodo, justice and accountability continue to elude us. President Widodo has made some efforts at accountability for the human rights violations during the Suharto years, these efforts have been challenged by members of his own government.



Since we voted for our independence in 1999, there have been several efforts at accountability for the crimes committed in Timor-Leste. However, only East Timorese members of militia that were created and controlled by Indonesia have been convicted and received minimal punishments. Meanwhile, the principal architects of the crimes remain free in Indonesia, some of them still in positions of power. Several have run for President of Indonesia. While the political establishments in both countries are currently determined to ignore them, the people of Timor-Leste and human rights activists continue to push for and demand accountability and justice.



The chains of impunity remain strong in Indonesia; U.S. leaders who supported crimes against humanity in Indonesia and elsewhere continue to avoid accountability and punishment. The U.S. and Indonesia claim they are democratic and law-abiding nations, but they openly resist holding their own officials accountable.



This is not just a matter of dealing with the past. Indonesia’s security forces continue to commit serious crimes in West Papua and elsewhere in Indonesia. In recent months, thousands of West Papuans have been detained while demonstrating for their right to self-determination. Indonesian activists faced intimidation from the state and the military when they dare to speak about massacres or serious crimes of the past. Last October, security officials forced the cancellation of sessions addressing the 1965 massacres at an international writers’ festival in Bali. Recent showings of films about the massacres, including The Look of Silence, have been attacked.



Together, we can end impunity. First, the U.S. and Indonesia must release all their records concerning the crimes committed in 1965-66 and 1975-1999. Revealing the truth is necessary for a genuine justice and accountability for these serious crimes.



Chega! recommends that countries like the U.S. that armed and trained Indonesia’s military provide reparations to the people of Timor-Leste. The U.S. knew very well that its weapons– from military aircraft to M-16 rifles – would rain death and destruction on many thousands of innocent people.



Since Indonesia has proved unable to credibly prosecute its own, international tribunals are needed if those responsible for the crimes of 1965-66 and the crimes in Timor-Leste from 1975-1999 are to be brought to justice.



50 years of silence and repression must end. The cycle of impunity must be broken.","Mon, 27 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.commondreams.org/sites/default/files/views-article/thumbs/die-in.jpg,"['crimes', 'timorese', 'accountability', 'indonesia', 'impunity', 'indonesian', 'occupation', 'suhartos', 'end', 'president', 'massacres', 'military', 'timorleste']", ,none

""The stormy weather in northwest Russia was caused by a very strong area of low pressure moving towards that area from Scandinavia,"" said weather.com meteorologist Chris Dolce.

Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the nation's main state investigative agency, said the incident took place in Syamozero. In total, the group consisted of 47 children and four adult instructors, two of whom were detained along with the director and deputy director of a hotel which reportedly organized the outing.

Natalya Stolyarova, who runs a nearby dog breeding kennel, told Sputnik News that one of her employees came across 11 children that managed to get out of the water on their own.

""The children were close to freezing, and the employee was lucky to wake them up,"" said Stolyarova. The survivors are reportedly in satisfactory condition, with two being given urgent medical care.

Vladimir Kucherenko, the director of a local tourist company, told the Associated Press that most children had apparently died from long exposure to cold water, as water temperatures in the lake were 8-10 degrees Celsius (46-50 Fahrenheit). He said strong winds might have driven boats across the lake, making it hard for the children to get to the shore.

26,26,FF-2016-000062-IDN,In search of Madagascar's “marine primates” - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/in-search-of-madagascars-marine-primates/,"At least 23 species of lemur in five families have been spotted in mangroves, about 20 percent of all lemur species and about half of the species whose range is known to include mangrove areas.

In Madagascar, mangrove extent declined by 21 percent between 1990 and 2010, according to a study released in January 2016.

It’s difficult to say how important mangroves are for lemurs without further research, however.

In March 2015, Charlie Gardner and his wife were performing a bird survey for the marine conservation organisation Blue Ventures deep in the mangroves of northwest Madagascar.

They went for a walk one night and had just turned back toward their camp as it started to rain when they noticed the glimmer of a mammal’s eyes high in a tree. Being that there was about three kilometers (nearly two miles) of mangrove swamp between them and the nearest dry land, Gardner and his wife assumed it must be a fruit bat. But as they got closer, they realized it was in fact a Northern Giant Mouse Lemur (Mirza zaza), an endangered species found only in that particular part of Madagascar.

Gardner, an honorary research fellow in biodiversity management at the University of Kent, had seen ring-tailed lemurs in mangroves near where he lived in southern Madagascar many years prior to this sighting, and had been interested in this behavior ever since. But after searching all the literature he could find, he realized that only four species of lemur had ever been recorded in mangrove habitat.

But then, last year, Zo Andriamahenina, a geospatial scientist for Blue Ventures, found two Claire’s mouse lemurs in a mangrove up north, in Antsahampano — the same mangrove forest where Gardner and his wife encountered the Northern Giant Mouse Lemur.

These discoveries were surprising, to say the least, Gardner told Mongabay: “On the one hand it was surprising because mangroves are a difficult environment to live in. They are regularly flooded by seawater, they tend not to harbor great invertebrate diversity above the water, and they are floristically very poor — in fact in all of Madagascar there are just eight mangrove species, and many stands are composed of just two or three species. So all in all we would not expect there to be much for lemurs to eat year-round.”

Gardner continued: “On the other hand the lack of records might just be because no one has ever really looked.”

Mangroves are difficult places to conduct research, he explained. “The trees grow incredibly densely and many have horizontal stilt roots that make passing impossible, and of course you always have to travel either through water or deep, cloying mud.” Plus, given that Madagascar’s terrestrial forests are so rich in lemurs, “Why would a primatologist ever look in the mangrove?”

Gardner himself doesn’t typically spend much time in mangroves, but had still come across lemurs in mangroves twice now, leading him to hypothesize that many others might have had similar encounters. So he set out to collect as much anecdotal evidence as he could to supplement his review of the existing literature on the topic. He surveyed hundreds of scientists and conservationists as well as a variety of other people who might have spotted a lemur in a mangrove at some point in the past.

“I knew that I had to contact more than just scientists — after all, I already knew that primatologists rarely went near mangroves — so I also focused on ecotourism guides, hotel staff in coastal areas and so on,” he said. “In all I wrote to over 1200 people.”

The results of Gardner’s study were published in the International Journal of Primatology in April. He found that at least 23 species of lemur in five families have been spotted in mangroves, about 20 percent of all lemur species and about half of the species whose range is known to include mangrove areas.

“Lemurs used mangroves for foraging, sleeping, and traveling between terrestrial forest patches, and some were observed as much as 3 km from the nearest permanently dry land,” Gardner wrote in the study. “However, most records were anecdotal and thus tell us little about lemur ecology in this habitat.”

Still, this is pretty conclusive evidence that mangroves are more widely used by lemurs than has previously been thought. And since 94 percent of lemur species are threatened with extinction, mangroves “merit greater attention from primate researchers and conservationists in Madagascar,” Gardner wrote.

“Given that mangroves are among the most threatened of all tropical ecosystems (Duke et al. 2007; Valiela et al. 2001) and have lost 20%–35% of their global extent since 1980 (FAO 2007; Polidoro et al. 2010; Valiela et al. 2001), an understanding of their role in maintaining primate populations is essential to inform conservation planning, as well as contributing to our knowledge and understanding of primate–habitat interactions,” per the study.

In Madagascar, mangrove extent declined by 21 percent between 1990 and 2010, according to a study released in January 2016.

It’s difficult to say how important mangroves are for lemurs without further research, however. For several of the widespread species Gardner found reports of in mangroves, like the ring tailed lemur, aye-aye, and Coquerel’s sifaka, mangroves make up a tiny portion of their range, meaning mangroves are probably not hugely important for the conservation of those species.

But in northwest Madagascar, where the largest mangrove forests are, there are a number of threatened species — such as the critically endangered Claire’s mouse lemur, the endangered Danfoss’ mouse lemur, and the endangered Northern Giant Mouse Lemur — that only occur in small areas. “If these species are also at home in the mangroves, then that could be very significant,” Gardner said.

27,27,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Gravel-bed river floodplains are the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes - Science Advances,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600026,"Gravel-bed river floodplains in mountain landscapes disproportionately concentrate diverse habitats, nutrient cycling, productivity of biota, and species interactions. Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.

Keywords

Here, we synthesize decades of disciplinary research into an interdisciplinary review of the evidence for gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as essential focal points of biodiversity and productivity and as corridors for connectivity across the glaciated mountain landscapes of the northern Rocky Mountains. We examine the role of natural processes in maintaining diverse, viable, and interconnected populations of native species that are challenged to adapt to climate change and other human stressors. We review the underlying research in hydrology and geomorphology that sets the stage for ecological interactions on gravel-bed floodplains, where aquatic and terrestrial habitats are intimately intertwined. We explain why we believe that gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains are the ecological focal point of habitat complexity and biodiversity in glaciated mountain landscapes and the “arena” for ecological interactions between and among species. We conclude with the argument that research and management of river ecosystems have too often been approached from a narrow perspective of the river as just a channel plus a narrow riparian ecotone adjacent to it. We argue that river conservation and restoration efforts that consider only the river channel while largely ignoring an expansive floodplain will not be effective at achieving local- or regional-scale benefits. Similarly, efforts to protect upland systems and wildlife that do not address fracturing and connectivity of the river system to uplands will also be compromised. In glaciated mountain systems, conservation efforts intended to benefit a wide spectrum of plants and animals across the landscape must prioritize intact structures and processes throughout the length of gravel-bed rivers and the width of their floodplains.

This review provides insights into the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains in glaciated mountain landscapes and is unique in the breadth of its focus. This effort considers the full continuum of species and processes that gravel-bed rivers support, from microbes and meiofauna within the subsurface of the gravel-bed river floodplain up to vertebrate taxa, including amphibians, fishes, birds, mammals, ungulates, and large carnivores. We make the case that the ecological importance of gravel-bed river floodplains as regulators of mountain landscapes has been overlooked because of the strong disciplinary approaches taken with classic fields in hydrology, geomorphology, ecology, and conservation biology. Simply put, syntheses between hydrologists, avian ecologists, freshwater biologists, and large-mammal ecologists have been rare on this subject.

Rivers and their riparian corridors are known to play an important role in regional biodiversity ( 1 ), but the mechanisms sustaining ecological integrity are less well understood across disciplines. Gravel-bed rivers, which commonly occur in the valley bottoms of heavily glaciated mountain systems ( Fig. 1 ), such as those found in the Rocky Mountains of North America, the Alps of Europe, the Andes of Patagonia, the Southern Alps of New Zealand, and the high Himalayas of Asia, are particularly characterized by dynamic fluvial processes that constantly change and renew the surface and subsurface of the river’s valley floor ( 2 , 3 ). In the glaciated regions of the Rocky Mountains, essentially from the Yellowstone area in northwestern Wyoming, United States, to Yukon, Canada, gravel-bed rivers are disproportionately important to regional biodiversity and to landscape-scale ecological integrity. Research conducted in this mountain region, across a wide variety of fields in ecology and diverse taxa, has highlighted the importance of these gravel-bed rivers to an unexpectedly high proportion of the region’s aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species. Although gravel-bed river floodplains play a disproportionately important role in sustaining native plant and animal biodiversity, they have also been disproportionately affected by human infrastructure and activities ( 4 ). In northern Rocky Mountain landscapes, dams, diversions, agriculture, flood control, exurban development, and transportation corridors are but a few of the vast array of human-mediated direct and indirect factors that affect river processes. First principles of ecosystem management ( 5 ) focus on the protection and conservation of the most diverse and the most productive places to maintain viable populations of native species and ecosystem types. Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes ( 6 ), including disturbance regimes ( 7 ), hydrologic processes ( 2 ), nutrient cycles ( 8 ), and connectivity across spatial and temporal scales ( 9 ), is central to sound conservation. Because gravel-bed rivers and especially floodplains are focal points for biodiversity in maintaining viable aquatic, avian, and terrestrial populations, we need to focus on their conservation, with particular attention to the processes that maintain them in space (across the valley floor) and time (over decades and centuries).

THE GRAVEL-BED RIVER AND FLOODPLAIN ECOSYSTEM

Hydrogeomorphic complexity and connectivity Broad U-shaped river valleys are characteristic of glaciated mountain landscapes where large alpine valleys have been deepened and enlarged in response to Pleistocene glaciation (10). Three linked hydrogeomorphic domains are found in these U-shaped valleys: canyons, lakes, and gravel-bed floodplains. The distribution of these domains depends on the underlying bedrock, the width of the valley, and the history of glacial advances and gravel deposition. Where a valley is narrow and bedrock is near or at the surface, the river will cut a canyon and flow as a single channel down a steep gradient. Where the valley is broad, the valley floor may be either filled with water, creating a lake, or filled with glacial and alluvial sediments, creating a gravel-bed floodplain. Often, these hydrogeomorphic domains will alternate and reappear several times as a river makes its way down the valley (11). Rivers in canyons support comparatively less biodiversity than floodplain segments because the narrow, linear river corridor of confined river segments has much less physical complexity and habitat diversity. By contrast, the gravel-bed floodplains on the same river system are extremely complex, creating an extraordinary diversity of habitats that support diverse communities of aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species (12, 13). In the Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) region glaciers, snowfields and rainfall feed into the valley’s surface water and groundwater. Flow volume in the river channel varies markedly by season, with the spring flood period providing most of the annual stream flow and with lower volumes in late summer, fall, and winter, barring unusual weather events. During the annual spring snowmelt, high volumes of water have enough energy to mobilize gravel and cobble bed sediments, scour river channels, and cut banks on the outer edge of river bends while depositing sediments to create gravel bars on the inside edge. This process, called cut-and-fill alluviation, is dynamic and, over many years, produces a legacy of sorted and unsorted cobbles and gravels distributed across the surface and subsurface of the entire floodplain. Thus, the channel changes both its shape and location repeatedly over time (14). Occasionally, during flood disturbance events, the river will completely change its channel as waters flow across the floodplain surface, cut a new channel, and leave behind an abandoned channel. These multiscale disturbance processes create a mosaic of cobble, gravel, and finer deposits across both the surface and the subsurface of the floodplain (3). For example, large cobbles with few interstitial fines are created by sediment mobilization during flood events and then get buried as the channel migrates, creating subsurface, heterogeneous flow networks (15). Across the surface of the floodplain, the mosaic of habitats is expressed in different successional stages, including new channels, very old channels, ponds, barren gravel bars, young vegetation stands, and gallery old-growth forests that are hundreds of years old (Fig. 2). The complex mosaic of surface and subsurface habitats is interconnected longitudinally with the river slope, laterally from the river channel across the floodplain, and vertically from the river channel into the subsurface gravels (16). Fig. 2 The three-dimensional structure of the gravel-bed river. Illustration shows the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical dynamics of the floodplain system. The floodplain landscape is created and maintained by biophysical processes that lead to a complex and dynamic habitat mosaic at the surface and in the subsurface. In this cutaway view, the hyporheic alluvial aquifer, characterized by river-origin water flowing through the gravel subsurface, is shown from valley wall to valley wall. The larger blue arrows signify the hyporheic waters that develop at the upper end of the floodplain and flow through the gravel substratum to discharge into the surface at the lower end of the floodplain following long flow pathways. The smaller arrows near the surface illustrate the water exchange between the surface waters and the upper hyporheic waters in the shallow bed sediments that occurs repeatedly along the length of the floodplain. The smaller U-shaped arrows at the interface between the hyporheic zone and phreatic groundwaters illustrate the small exchange that occurs between the hyporheic zone and deeper, phreatic groundwaters that are stored for longer periods of time. The black crescents represent the legacy of cut-and-fill alluviation, characterized by highly sorted open-network cobble substrata with interstitial flow pathways left behind as the river channel moves laterally on the floodplain surface (E. Harrington, eh illustration, Missoula, MT). Throughout the year, water is constantly flowing out of the river channel and into the gravels below and laterally beyond the channel (that is, “hyporheic zone,” from the Greek hypo, meaning “under,” and rheic, meaning “river”). This river-origin water extends across the U-shaped valley bottom, often from valley wall to valley wall and often hundreds of meters to more than a kilometer laterally from the river channel (17). The water that flows in and out of the channel, both vertically and laterally, reappears as upwelling springs directly in the river or in other lateral features such as side channels, springbrooks, and pond habitats on the surface of the floodplain. Water can travel hundreds of meters per day through the floodplain gravels. River water that flows in and out of the channel and the subsurface alluvium creates an extraordinary diversity of ecological niches within the gravel-bed river floodplain. During summer, surface waters heated by solar radiation are cooled by hyporheic groundwater discharge to the surface, creating spatial heterogeneity of water temperatures across the floodplain. The wide variety of temperature regimes is a function of solar warming in the main channel and shallow shorelines and the cool groundwater upwelling into those same habitats (Fig. 3A) (18). During winter, those locations that are summer-cooled become winter-warmed, which prevents the river water in that reach from becoming frozen as anchor or surface ice (19).

Nutrients, microbes, and aquatic insects in the gravel It is broadly understood that river channels support aquatic life and the cycling of nutrients. However, outside of the discipline of stream ecology, it is not as widely appreciated that nutrient-rich waters below and lateral to the channel support a complex food web composed of microbes, mesofaunal crustaceans, and aquatic insects that are hydrologically connected to the river and dependent on the surface water and groundwater exchange. Simply put, most terrestrial ecologists assume that the river and aquatic interface is confined to the river channel. However, the expansive nature of the river corridor in floodplain reaches leads to the aquatic habitat diversity of these unconfined reaches being much higher than that of confined river reaches, subsequently leading to a significantly higher diversity in the aquatic food web (17, 20). Downwelling water from the river channel into the gravel-bed subsurface carries both particulate and dissolved organic matter (20). Oxygen concentrations in the river water are near saturation as the water enters the gravel. At the point of entering the subsurface, particulate organic matter is trapped and filtered from the water. This concentration of particulate organic matter at the oxygen-rich points of downwelling supports abundant and productive communities of microbes and particulate-feeding aquatic insects (20). The dissolved organic matter continues to travel into the gravel with the subsurface water. As this water moves through the subsurface gravels, the oxygen becomes depleted by microbial decomposers, which release both CO 2 and biologically available forms of nitrogen and phosphorus (21). These bioavailable nutrients flow through the subsurface gravels to reemerge at the surface in springbrooks, ponds, and backwaters, or they may upwell directly into the river channel. Bursts of algal growth occur where these nutrients, which are carried by upwelling of the hyporheic groundwater, come to the surface (Fig. 3B) (22). Grazing aquatic insects achieve high densities and growth rates at these sites of high algal growth (19). Many small crustaceans and large aquatic insects spend early stages of their life histories in these nutrient-rich subsurface gravels throughout the gravel-bed river floodplain, again hundreds of meters lateral to the river channel (17), reflecting the expansive nature of the alluvial, hyporheic aquifer. They are nourished not only by the dissolved organic matter carried into the gravels by downwelling river water but also by the decomposition of organic matter (such as coarse woody material) that has been buried in the gravels by cut-and-fill alluviation. This buried organic matter forms concentrated sites of decomposition and microbial activity, including anaerobic methanogenic bacteria that account for as much as 99% of energy flow in some species of the hyporheic food web (Fig. 3C) (23). The aquatic insects that live in the gravel can be found from valley wall to valley wall and from the top to the bottom of the floodplain in the spaces between the cobbles created by periodic rolling of the rocks through hydrogeomorphic processes. These aquatic insects return to the river channel through the interstices in the gravels and then emerge and reproduce. Hyporheic invertebrates can form a significant portion of the total production of invertebrates of the river (17) and, thus, directly affect higher levels of the river food web, including fishes, amphibians, birds, and bats and other mammals (9).

Native fishes and floodplain fluvial processes Many of the habitats that are essential for growth, survival, and persistence of native fishes in the Y2Y region are found exclusively on gravel-bed river floodplains. This is particularly true for native and threatened or endangered salmonids, such as the bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and the westslope cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi) that occupy gravel-bed river floodplains for their entire lives or travel hundreds of kilometers to seek out these areas to complete their life cycle (24). Trout and other native fishes are dependent on cool water in the summer and unfrozen conditions in the winter, keying into a fundamental character of the groundwater and surface water interaction with the hyporheic zone, as discussed above. Moreover, salmonid reproduction is heavily concentrated in habitats directly associated with groundwater upwelling from the subsurface into the gravels of the river channel (19, 25). In such upwelling sites, incubation temperature is ideal, and there is well-oxygenated water and a sufficient flow to carry away nitrogen waste products from the incubating embryos. Adult female trout construct their redds (that is, nests for incubating eggs) in gravels that have been rolled and swept clean of fine sediments, first by fluvial processes during the spring snowmelt flood and then, again, by the spawning fish. Thus, a suitable spawning habitat is dependent not only on cool water per se but also on the hydrologic process of flooding and the groundwater–to–surface water exchange that is maintained by the shifting habitat dynamics of the gravel-bed river floodplains on the alluvial valley floor (Fig. 3D) (25). The habitats created by fluvial processes on and in the gravel-bed river floodplains are essential not only for spawning but also to the rest of the life cycle of native salmonids. Juvenile salmonids typically use side channels, springbrooks, and low-velocity shoreline habitats for early rearing and feeding (26), whereas subadult and adult fishes require deep, complex areas of the channel with channel-edge vegetative cover for feeding and protection from predation (27). Trees that fall in the river channel through the process of cut-and-fill alluviation create pools and structures and provide shade that is important during the summer months (28). Groundwater upwelling from the floodplain gravels creates an ideal overwintering habitat because of the relatively warm, ice-free conditions provided by hyporheic return flows to the river (19). Alluvial valley segments support relatively higher levels of genetic diversity and abundances of native salmonids (29), underscoring the importance of these habitats as “biological hot spots” for evolutionary potential (that is, adaptive capacity), resiliency to environmental change, and overall persistence.

Amphibians in ephemeral floodplain habitats Amphibian reproduction requires pond and nearshore channel environments with specific thermal and hydroperiod conditions (that is, the length of time that surface water is present). Often overlooked is the fact that, in glaciated mountain environments, the greatest diversity of thermal and hydroperiod conditions is found among the ponds and disconnected backwaters of gravel-bed river floodplains. Many amphibians select ephemeral ponds for breeding to avoid predation. The short hydroperiod of such ephemeral ponds prevents predatory fish from accessing the same habitat that amphibians select for eggs and immature aquatic stages. However, to exploit these ephemeral habitats, larval amphibians must grow and develop rapidly before the water disappears. Pond habitats on the open floodplain that are created by the spring flood receive direct sunlight and can be warmed to >25°C, yet have bottom temperatures of <7°C because of subsurface groundwater entering the bottom of the pond through the gravels. Ponds in paleochannels that thread through an adjacent forest tend to be much cooler from top to bottom because of shading by the surrounding mature vegetation and the upwelling of groundwater. This array of thermal and hydroperiod conditions supports not only a diverse amphibian assemblage (30) but also high levels of intraspecific genetic diversity and plasticity in phenotypic expression (31).

Disturbance and vegetation diversity across the floodplain The ecological importance of vegetation to aquatic ecosystems has been widely studied (32, 33). However, riparian vegetation is often considered as a relatively narrow band (that is, 25 to 50 m in width) next to the channel, whereas the relevance of plant communities that extend across the floodplain is ignored in the context of “vegetation in the riparian zone.” This understanding is inaccurate and is now realized to be too limited. On the gravel-bed river floodplains of the Y2Y region, riparian plant communities extend hundreds of meters to kilometers from the active channel to the lateral edges of the floodplain (see Fig. 1). Water from the river channel downwelling into the hyporheic zone of the floodplain and then flowing subsurface from lateral edge to lateral edge of the floodplain nourishes the trees and other plants (34). The combination of these nutrient pulses with multiscale disturbance of cut-and-fill alluviation, larger-scale flood disturbance history, and fire disturbance creates a highly productive and biodiverse vegetation community. Native cottonwoods (Populus spp.) and willows (Salix spp.) dominate early succession of gravel-bed river floodplains in the Y2Y region, and their life history traits are tightly linked with the natural flow regime (35). Cottonwoods and willows are intolerant of established vegetation, and seedling recruitment requires barren sites newly formed by flood disturbance events and scour, as described above. Although these species are prolific seed producers, the tiny seeds are annually released in a short interval after the spring snowmelt peak and are only viable for a few weeks. The seeds are blown or floated onto moist and barren sites left behind on the exposed cobble bars by the receding river water. After germination, the small seedlings will only survive through the first summer of highly xeric conditions on the bare cobble and gravel bars if the river stage recedes slowly enough for the root elongation to track the falling groundwater zone, which is tightly linked to the river level. If the rate of decline following the peak in the flood hydrograph is too rapid, then seedlings desiccate and die with resulting poor recruitment (36). Conifer-dominated stands often eventually replace cottonwood stands in areas of the floodplain that are undisturbed for a long period of time (14), and with their lower productivity, conifers also tend to harbor lower biodiversity (37). Thus, highly stable floodplains (that is, lacking disturbance flooding) in the Y2Y region become dominated by less diverse and less productive conifers. Gravel-bed river floodplains contain a complex set of habitats that includes soil moisture ranging from extremely xeric to mesic and hosts an extraordinarily high diversity of plant species. More than 60% of plant species from the floodplain valley floor to the alpine occur on the heterogeneous habitats of the gravel-bed floodplains (38). This is because moisture gradients that occur across hundreds of meters of elevation on mountainsides are highly compressed over short elevation differences on floodplains but support similarly diverse species assemblages. These rich and diverse floodplain plant communities are shaped by, and in many cases are dependent on, the natural dynamic processes of the river. Many of the plants of gravel-bed river floodplains are pioneering species that not only are tolerant of flooding but also are actually dependent on the physical disturbance of the cut-and-fill alluviation process that creates open cobble bars for their reproduction (39). These plant communities also influence the river’s hydrological and geomorphic processes as large trees of old-growth forest patches are eroded, and large wood debris is captured by the river during flood events. The largest wood creates hydraulic complexity with deep scour in one location and high deposition in another (3, 28). Likewise, paleochannels with scour holes become pond habitats with hydric soils and wetland plants. These often occur directly next to floodplain surfaces 2 to 3 m in elevation above the groundwater table, which is directly controlled by the river stage. Thus, old-growth cottonwoods and spruce forests are often seen growing directly adjacent to both the contemporary channel and old paleochannels (14).

Avian direct and indirect use of floodplains Many bird species are known to rely on river corridor habitats. In the Y2Y region, more than 70% of the species diversity is associated with gravel-bed rivers and floodplains to complete part of their life cycle (if not the entire cycle) (40). The continuum of floodplain use among bird species in the region ranges from those entirely reliant on near-channel habitats (for example, water and shore birds), to birds that seasonally occupy adjacent riparian forest habitats for breeding activity (for example, flycatchers, wet woodland passerines, and raptors), to short-term inhabitants of the river floodplain during migrations or seasonal temporary users before local connectivity to uplands (for example, neotropical migrants). The highest bird densities (41) and greatest bird diversity (42) are associated with expansive floodplains containing a variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats with large and complex patches of deciduous gallery forests intersected by side channels and a range of successional plant communities. The dependence of passerines on riparian vegetation, especially in the semi-arid west, has led ornithologists to refer to gravel-bed river systems as the “aorta” of mountain landscapes (43). The diverse structure and composition of floodplain vegetation that result from fluvial processes lead directly to high bird diversity (42). The cottonwood gallery forests, which are highly dependent on fluvial processes, provide nesting and perching sites. Freshly exposed gravels are a critical habitat to spotted sandpipers (Actitis macularius) and other shorebirds. Gravel-bed floodplains are also important to birds typically thought of as upland breeding species. Following their spring migration to the Y2Y region, many upland species rely on the gravel-bed river floodplain habitats along the valley floor early in the season before breeding or as they prepare to migrate south in the fall. For instance, ruby-crowned kinglets (Regulus calendula), categorized as “coniferous forest specialists,” inhabit gravel-bed floodplains during the winter and early spring. Some stay in the coniferous forest adjacent to the floodplain, whereas others move to an upland forest habitat as resources become available for breeding activity later in the spring (44). Migrating insectivorous birds prefer floodplains because of the predictable and abundant food resources and a lower predation risk than other environments (45). Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) that breed in coniferous forests often forage over floodplains (46), and although falcons do not rely solely on gravel-bed floodplains, these areas provide critical prey resources (for example, waterfowl, passerines, and shorebirds) that attract and support peregrine populations and those of other raptors.

The arena for ungulate and wolf interactions Many large mammals, such as moose (Alces alces), beaver (Castor canadensis), and river otter (Lutra canadensis), are obligate users of wetlands, rivers, and floodplain habitats. However, the wide variety of large mammals generally considered as upland species but which rely heavily on gravel-bed river floodplains for many portions of their life histories is often overlooked. Throughout the Y2Y region, large-mammal communities are shaped by elevation, climate, precipitation, and primary productivity gradients created by the mountain ecosystem (47). Gravel-bed river floodplains in the region provide the overall highest annual primary productivity (48), the earliest appearance of spring-emergent vegetation, and the latest continuance of fresh vegetation in the fall (49). Critical grasslands and shrub and aspen stands required for winter maintenance of large ungulates, such as bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), and deer (Odocoileus spp.), dominate the vegetation of alluvial fans, which extend onto broader gravel-bed river floodplains at the lower elevation valley bottoms. Gravel-bed river floodplains provide boreal lichens for woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and a key habitat for large carnivores such as wolves (Canis lupus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), and mountain lions (Felis concolor) (50, 51). Gravel-bed floodplains provide not only critical habitats but also the arena for key ecological interactions among several large mammals (Fig. 4A). Carnivory and herbivory are important ecological processes that affect both gravel-bed river floodplains and upland habitats in mountainous ecosystems (52). In the Y2Y region, wolves commonly den along the edge or directly on large gravel-bed river floodplains (53). Wolves find preferred materials for denning in gravel and sand deposits along banks exposed by the processes of cut-and-fill alluviation. Gravel-bed floodplains also provide a significant predation advantage to wolves. Spring migratory corridors of their prey, from winter ranges to alpine summer ranges, follow valley bottoms, passing close to active wolf dens (54) and increasing the likelihood of successful predation during spring and fall (55). In summer, risk of mortality is greatest when ungulates cross lower-elevation valleys between alpine ranges (55), whereas during winter, an estimated 40% of all wolf kills within Banff National Park occurred on gravel-bed river floodplains. Moreover, the attraction of ungulates to spring green-up near warmer groundwater upwelling zones may create an ungulate “hot spot” during the time of year when large ungulates are in poor body condition (56). These hot spots are then exploited by large carnivores, resulting in the important late winter–early spring spike in mortality of all ungulate species on the gravel-bed floodplains (57). Many studies show that ungulates pursued by predators on uplands will descend onto the floodplain of the valley bottom, attempting to use the river as an escape strategy. When this strategy proves unsuccessful, the kill invariably occurs on the floodplain. Thus, in the case of wolves and coyotes, it is particularly disadvantageous for prey to escape by running downhill (58).

(B) A map of grizzly bear subpopulations in the United States–Canada transboundary area of the Y2Y region derived from fragmentation synthesis. Numerical values represent subpopulation estimates. The yellow dotted lines delineate fragmentation between subpopulations and follow fragmented gravel-bed river floodplains [modified with permission from the study by Proctor et al. (65)]. The predation that occurs on gravel-bed floodplains also affects the health and reproduction of cottonwoods on the floodplain and upland aspen forests. Wolf predation on elk, which occurs primarily on gravel bars, is capable of providing top-down controls on elk density in some systems (52). Eradication of wolves and other carnivores across the southern half of the region in the 1930s to 1960s led to the extreme overpopulation of large ungulates, in particular elk, throughout many river valleys (59). The increased elk numbers, in turn, led to a marked increase in herbivory by elk on woody browse species such as aspen, cottonwoods, and willow, which then cascaded to declines in beaver and other obligates of early willow and mature forest species, such as riparian passerine birds (52). The loss of the deciduous cottonwood and aspen forests not only had a direct effect on beaver populations but also had a significant effect on the role large wood has in hydrogeomorphic processes of the gravel-bed river floodplains. In the last several decades, the restoration of wolves in Banff and Yellowstone has reversed the loss of woody browse species on gravel-bed river floodplains (60). Results from spatial risk models for Yellowstone National Park and the Ya Ha Tinda and Bow Valley in Banff National Park show that since the 1990s, wolf predation on elk has also resulted in a marked rejuvenation of upland aspen (52, 61). Predation on ungulates on gravel-bed floodplains also likely results in an overlooked but important source of nutrient flow. The role of salmon as a nutrient subsidy from the marine environment to gravel-bed floodplains around the north Pacific Rim has been well documented (62). Similarly, a study on Isle Royale (63) showed that the distribution of wolf-killed moose carcasses had strong and persistent effects on terrestrial nutrient cycling by concentrating nutrients at the site of the kill. Work in Yellowstone National Park has shown high pulses of nutrients from carcasses to terrestrial systems. Because predation risk is highest on gravel-bed floodplains, high nutrient concentrations around large ungulate carcasses are likely to reach the aquatic system (63).

Floodplains as “connectors and fragmentors” of grizzly bear populations There was once a large contiguous population of grizzly bears (U. arctos) across western North America from Mexico to Alaska. Today, south of Alaska and central and northwestern Canada, the southern part of the Y2Y region holds the remnant distribution in what was the southern half of their North American distribution (64). In this area, there is a contracted suite of subpopulations, some of which are small with high conservation risk, whereas others are healthier and act as core anchors to the whole system (65). Direct mortality and habitat loss were the initial causes of severe range contraction, but such mortality and habitat loss have been significantly reduced in many areas. Now, population fragmentation is a major threat to the remaining grizzly bears (65). Grizzly bears have ecological characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human activities. They occur in sparse densities and have low reproductive rates and male-biased dispersal. In the southern Y2Y region, population fragmentation for grizzly bears is concentrated on gravel-bed river floodplains. Floodplains are critical to grizzly bears for two reasons. The well-known reason is that floodplains are the first areas to green up in the spring and, thus, are disproportionately used when bears emerge from hibernation. The insight that they are critical for reasons of fragmentation is novel. Previously, fragmentation has been a more generalized concern about human transportation and settlement corridors (65), but now, we observe that the gravel-bed floodplain portions of these areas are a seasonally critical habitat and paradoxically serve as a source of fragmentation. For grizzly bear populations in southern Canada and the northern United States, the human settlement and transportation corridors within gravel-bed river floodplains and river valleys in general actually define the boundaries of grizzly bear subpopulations (Fig. 4B) (65). The opposite of fragmentation is movement enabled by connectivity. It is important for all wide-ranging species but is especially important for grizzly bears. For grizzly bear populations, female movement is critical. Females provide population viability, and in-migration of females is required to rescue small, fragmented populations from extirpation (65). In the Y2Y region, movement of females between mountain ranges is both concentrated (66) and most at risk across gravel-bed river floodplains. Female connectivity is not a dash across a human settled valley but a process where female offspring disperse away from their mother into their adult home range that usually overlaps a portion of their maternal range (67). Because female grizzly bear dispersal is gradual (67) and over relatively short distances (68), linkage areas are not narrow movement corridors but need to be large secure areas (that is, kilometers long and across whole gravel-bed river floodplains) where female bears can live portions of their lives with minimal mortality risk. Where gravel-bed river floodplains are intact in remote places such as the Flathead Valley in southern Canada and the western boundary of Glacier National Park (United States), there is no population fragmentation (68). By contrast, in the adjacent but more heavily used Elk River Valley along Highway 3, north of the Flathead watershed, human developments on gravel-bed floodplains have inhibited female movements, although males still cross the valley (68). Farther west, human developments in the Nelson, British Columbia, area have completely blocked valley bottom movements of both males and females, leading to genetic differentiation and isolation of the southern Selkirk Mountain population (Fig. 4B) (65). These patterns hold across the southern Y2Y region. Both males and females demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. Female movement rates reduced markedly when settlement increased to >20% of a fracture zone. Male movement continues past the 20% level but declines gradually. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. The result is that several small bear populations that have male-only immigration are not viable over the long term (65). In the Y2Y region, floodplains are often in private hands. The paradigm where human settlement patterns usurp entire river valleys could be improved to better serve biodiversity objectives that include large carnivores if portions of these valley systems contain low human densities and are managed for or restored to a condition closer to their natural state (65, 68). Thus, conservation efforts that focus on securing gravel-bed river valley bottom habitat on private land are essential in maintaining healthy connected grizzly bear populations across the Y2Y region (65, 68). Further, for public lands such as the Canadian Flathead where valley bottoms have both an intact gravel-bed river floodplain structure and hydrological processes, conservation management that minimizes human densities, and thus mortality risk and habitat disturbance, is critical for the regional grizzly bear metapopulation to persist.","Fri, 24 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600026/F1.large.jpg,"['river', 'channel', 'ecological', 'floodplains', 'valley', 'glaciated', 'habitats', 'mountain', 'landscapes', 'processes', 'floodplain', 'nexus', 'species', 'gravelbed', 'water']", ,none

SYDNEY (AFP) - An Australian wombat who became depressed after a massive cyclone tore through his wildlife park home, depriving him of cuddles with tourists, has died, prompting an outpouring on social media.

Tonka, a bare-nosed wombat, was raised by rangers at Queensland’s Billabong Sanctuary after his mother was hit and killed on the road and he was rescued from her pouch.

The furry marsupial watched television with rangers, slept with a toy teddy bear, and delighted in having his tummy rubbed, the Sanctuary near Townsville said in a Facebook post.

But after the monster storm Cyclone Yasi tore through Queensland in 2011, prompting the closure of the park for 10 weeks, Tonka went into a mysterious decline, refusing food and losing weight.

It wasn’t until the park reopened that Tonka became his normal self, cleaning out his food bowl for the first time in weeks.

""The conclusion? Tonka had missed his pats and cuddles and become depressed! Since then he never looked back,"" the sanctuary said.

Tonka, who was seven, was put down on Saturday after extensive tests showed he had irreversible kidney damage.

Bob Flemming, who owns the park, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the response to Tonka’s death had been overwhelming.

""People have been sending in their photos of their experiences with Tonka, their children holding Tonka over the years,"" he said.

""He just loved people so much, he fretted if he wasn’t being handled.""

In hundreds of comments online, several people wrote that Tonka had been the highlight of their Australian trip.

31,31,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Brexit Implications for ASEAN Based Investors - ASEAN Business News - ASEAN Briefing,https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/asean-brexit/,"By: Maxfield Brown

In a victory that stunned analysts around the world, the UK has voted to exit the European Union (EU) by a margin of 52 to 48 percent. In addition to producing significant implications for investors across Europe, the interconnected nature of the global economy leaves businesses across the world exposed. ASEAN is no exception. Currency markets within the South East Asian bloc have already seen swift valuation changes, and the pending exclusion of the UK from the EU’s network of trade negotiations in ASEAN is likely to have a long term impact on trade within the region.

For European investors maintaining operations throughout ASEAN or British parties considering investment, it will be of utmost importance to monitor developments within the region closely in order to ascertain their likely exposure to Brexit fallout.

Short-Term Considerations: Foreign Exchange Volatility

As markets within ASEAN know all too well, currency volatility is one of the most immediate externalities associated with economic crisis. Despite the Pound Sterling being separated from the Euro, the mere threat of a Brexit was enough to depreciate the Pound by 7 percent against the US dollar during voting. As polls closed, ASEAN currencies have also seen substantial rises in their value against the United Kingdom.

For those purchasing goods or servicing debts within the UK or using British Pounds as a medium of denomination or exchange, the prevailing headwinds within currency markets strongly favor currencies from within ASEAN. In the near term, this will allow consumers to purchase goods from UK based suppliers at a significant discount, however, it will also curtail the ability of British based consumers to purchase goods from a variety of markets including those within ASEAN. This is likely to constrain liquidity of British buyers and runs the risk of disrupting existing purchase agreements that these parities may have signed with ASEAN based suppliers.

While the British Pound has been hit hardest by its exit from mainland Europe, Brexit has created significant tensions within the Eurozone as a whole and decreased confidence that the Euro will continue to be used within the region. Reflecting these concerns, all currencies within ASEAN have appreciated significantly against the Euro with the exception of Malaysia. Investors flooding out of the Eurozone have instead taken refuge in Dollar denominated assets resulting in an appreciation of the US dollar against ASEAN markets.

Although muted when compared to the Pound, the movement of the Dollar and Euro will have tangible impacts on the cost of goods being purchased and sold to these markets. Exports to the European Union will likely see reduced demand as cost adverse Eurozone buyers are priced out of ASEAN markets. Buyers from within ASEAN on the other hand will benefit from discounted Eurozone goods brought on by the relative rise in their home currencies. Those exporting to US markets will likely see demand increase, with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia particularly well positioned to benefit.

A final area of consideration for investors should be those nations within ASEAN that have chosen to control their currencies. Given the large volatility and volume of trading in international markets, countries such as Laos, Myanmar, and even Vietnam may struggle to maintain steady parity with the Pound and other currencies such as the US Dollar.

Long Term Challenges: Trade Liberalization

While currency markets will price in Brexit over the coming weeks, the long term impact of the UK’s departure will likely be reflected in ASEAN’s trading relationship with the European Continent. Not only does the United Kingdom lack a network of independent trading arrangements with ASEAN states, but many of the EU projects with ASEAN remain unresolved.

Currently, the EU is in open negotiations with several of the largest economies within the ASEAN region including Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Moving forward, the United Kingdom will not be included within these negotiations and will be excluded from the benefits of any finalized agreements. This is likely to present challenges for those wishing to export to the UK or for UK based investors currently seeking to invest within the region. Although it is likely that the UK will initiate similar agreements independently, these agreements are yet to be announced and will likely take years to negotiate and implement.

For mainland European investors who stand to benefit from agreements with ASEAN states, the fallout of Brexit is likely to cause considerable turmoil. As a serious blow to Brussels and confidence in centralized European governance, Brexit is sure to detract focus from negotiations in the near to medium term. Depending on the speed with which mainland Brexit fallout can be managed, negotiations may be subject to varying delays.

Investment Opportunities: The TPP & Vietnam

As explored above, currency volatility in Europe presents salient import opportunities for a variety of ASEAN’s producers and consumers. In the long term, however, a select group of ASEAN markets and investors stand to reap major advantages from the diminishing position of Europe within ASEAN.

Having already concluded negotiations with the European Union, Vietnam is likely to be the big winner in the face of Brexit. Lagging EU trade negotiations with other member states will make the communist nation one of the most exciting opportunities for low cost investment from a European perspective. In the face of lowered purchasing power within the Eurozone, consumers will be on the lookout for low cost goods. Given its unique position in low cost manufacturing, Vietnam will likely be more competitive than ever among European consumers. The longer that negotiations are drawn out in other ASEAN states, the more solidified Vietnam’s advantage will become.

From the perspective of investment, TPP is likely to solidify advantages for its 11 members within ASEAN. The reduction of tariffs and convergence of regulations with Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Vietnam provide significant opportunities for TPP members that will now be out of reach for European competitors. The dollar’s strong appreciation against ASEAN currencies is also likely to compound benefits for US based investors, making them among best positioned to invest within ASEAN.

Navigating a Post Brexit Pacific

Despite the British decision to walk away from Europe, ASEAN is set to remain a lucrative and resilient location for investment and production. Many economies within the region are undergoing trade negotiations with the EU and have seen favorable treatment in the face of currency volatility. Nonetheless, it is important for companies operating in the region to understand the nature of their exposure to this development and to take actions to mitigate externalities as they arise. In the short term, it is advised that companies with a large European (UK or mainland) customer base pay close attention to foreign exchange volatility and consider mitigation options within ASEAN. Even if headwinds favor them in the status quo, these could change quickly as the situation in European and Asian markets develops.

In the medium term, it will become important for companies to begin to monitor the progress of trade negotiations between the EU and ASEAN member states. It is likely that these could see delays and understanding when and where these delays will occur will allow for effective investment and operational planning.

Annual Audit and Compliance in ASEAN

For the first issue of our ASEAN Briefing Magazine, we look at the different audit and compliance regulations of five of the main economies in ASEAN. We firstly focus on the accounting standards, filing processes, and requirements for Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. We then provide similar information on Singapore, and offer a closer examination of the city-state’s generous audit exemptions for small-and-medium sized enterprises.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership and its Impact on Asian Markets

The United States backed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) includes six Asian economies – Australia, Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam, while Indonesia has expressed a keen willingness to join. However, the agreement’s potential impact will affect many others, not least of all China. In this issue of Asia Briefing magazine, we examine where the TPP agreement stands right now, look at the potential impact of the participating nations, as well as examine how it will affect Asian economies that have not been included.

33,33,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Commercial Diver Lives to Tell the Tale - The Maritime Executive,https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/commercial-diver-lives-to-tell-the-tale,"Commercial Diver Lives to Tell the Tale

A commercial diver living in Australia has revealed the horrific crushing accident he suffered 330 feet (100 meters) below the surface whilst working in the Gulf of Thailand.



The diver, who wishes to remain anonymous, has recounted events to MarEx:

He was relocating buoyancy tanks on a pipeline when an error in communication resulted in a 7.5 ton metal depressor frame being lowered on to him.

The diver was on his knees facing the seabed when the load was lowered by crane, and it made contact across his back where his emergency air supply was located.

He was forced down into the mud of the seafloor. His head was forced back, and his helmet was danger of being pulled off his head. He tried to “headbutt” the helmet on while constantly being forced deeper in the mud.

The action caused trauma to the muscles and discs in his spine. His right leg was forced sideways, causing a torn knee ligament, and his arms were forced apart. Although he attempted to close his arms back to his chest, the mud was too firm, and both shoulders were dislocated.

With his arms dislocated and behind him, his chest bore the full surface area of the seabed. He held his breath and flexed as hard as possible, but his lower cartilage ribs were fractured and the cartilage between his ribs and sternum broken.

He felt the need to speak to the supervisor to “politely” ask him to remove the load. However, whenever he attempted to speak, gas was forced from his lungs, causing further compression to his chest cavity.

He was compressed beneath the load for approximately 10 seconds before the crane was able to lift it.

The diver working with him pulled him from the mud via the umbilical line that connected him to the dive bell, his only means of returning to the surface.

At this point the diver was still conscious (“only just holding on”) with visual problems, mobility problems and breathing difficulties.

The diving bell clump weight was lowered to the seabed, and his companion carried him 30 meters from the accident site so that he could be positioned on to it. The clump was then raised to the diving bell.

However, the diver could not fit back into the bell’s small opening as his dislocated arms stuck out sideways. He managed to clamp his left arm between his legs and pull it back into its socket. This maneuver, his own idea, was performed in his current adrenaline-fuelled and panicked state. He didn’t think he could perform the same action on the other arm and remain conscious. Breathing was now extremely labored.

The supporting diver assisted him on to his side so he could be floated up into the bell, right arm first with his elbow retracted. The diver used his left (uninjured) leg to hold himself in the bell by standing on the valve guard on the outer bottom door.

His head was still underwater in the partially-flooded bell. As the bellman pressurized the bell, forcing the water out, the diver had to bear the weight of his helmet in air. He was unable to do so without extreme pain, so the bell was re-flooded.

As he was still wearing his helmet, a cervical collar could not be fitted. Instead, the bellman’s towel was rolled up and used to support his head. The bell was then pressurized until the water level was at just above shoulder height. His helmet was then carefully removed.

Again, the bellman attempted to fill the bell with air. Again, it had to be reflooded because the diver experienced severe pain until his right, still dislocated, arm was supported using a rope.

The bell was finally raised to the ship, and towels were used to make a stretcher. Due to the extent of the diver’s spinal injuries, and right arm still sticking out unable to be splinted, he could not be maneuvered through the cramped conditions of the dive bell’s doors without causing extreme pain.

Morphine was administered, and his memory is clouded as the vessel’s medics attempted to relocate his right shoulder. After about an hour of unsuccessful attempts, he was transferred to another chamber so he could be decompressed, a process that takes several days, ready to be taken to the ship’s hospital.

“Six doors and two tight corners - ‘very’ difficult and painful”

He was made as comfortable as possible in a bunk with pillows, blankets and more morphine. Pain relief was constantly administered throughout decompression, firstly through intramuscular injection in the arm, until it was too bruised, then through the buttocks.



Upon completion of decompression, the casualty was assisted from his bunk and out of the diving system, where he was able to stand on his uninjured leg if holding onto something for support. He was assisted to the vessel’s hospital, where his arm was finally relocated.

After a 24-hour bend watch, in case he should suffer decompression sickness, he was evacuated by helicopter and transported via ambulance to hospital.

Both shoulders have since been reconstructed, and he has undertaken a full year of physio and occupational therapy before returning to full duties as a diver. He still experiences psychological trauma involving nightmares and flashbacks.

34,34,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Take the Most Hazardous Science Quiz Ever - Scientific American,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/take-the-most-hazardous-science-quiz-ever/,"Earthquakes are notorious perils in California, but do you know how much damage they can do in the eastern U.S.? Our country turns out to vulnerable to many risky natural events: quakes and hurricanes, but also huge sinkholes and dust storms as well as rising seas, flooding rivers and wildfires. They cost lives and money. Identifying hazards like these and telling people how much risk the events pose at any given time is a focus of the U.S. Geological Survey, which partnered with Scientific American to create this 10-item quiz about our potential for different disasters. See how much you really know about our country’s dangers.

1. How many Americans live and work in areas exposed to potentially damaging earthquakes?

About 10 percent of the population About 25 percent About 50 percent Almost all

Damage from the January 1994 earthquake in Northridge, Calif. Credit: USGS

ANSWER: C—Nearly 50 percent of the U.S. population live and work in areas of the 48 contiguous states, as well as earthquake-prone areas of Alaska, Hawaii and the U.S. territories, that are exposed to potentially damaging ground shaking from earthquakes. Looking only at the most severe ground-shaking levels, the 10 states with the most people at risk are, in descending order: California, Washington, Utah, Tennessee, Oregon, South Carolina, Nevada, Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois. Although this level of shaking is estimated to occur relatively infrequently, it could cause significant damage and causalities.

A Scientific American report explains the causes of tremors and what makes them stop, whether they can be predicted and whether our buildings can be made more quake-proof. In the middle of the country scientists are increasingly sure that wastewater injection tied to fracking for oil and gas is causing more tremors.

2. On average, how much are landslides estimated to cost the nation each year?

$38 million $3.5 billion $1 billion

Answer: B—In the U.S. landslides cost the nation an estimated $3.5 billion per year. This is an estimate because there is no uniform method to track landslide losses or a central government agency that does so. Local losses can be very high. For example, the winter season rains associated with the 1997–98 El Niño caused landslide damage estimated at $210.2 million in the San Francisco Bay Area. Right now the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are working on a Debris-Flow Warning System to help provide forecasts and alerts.

Other countries also worry about slides: In Nepal researchers are putting sensors on mountains to forecast rockfall hazards. Learn more about the dangers in the U.S. at http://landslides.usgs.gov/

3. How many potentially active volcanoes are there in the U.S.?

5 23 169

Answer: C—The U.S. is home to 169 active volcanoes, many of which could erupt at any time. The Volcano Hazards Program, run by the geological survey, monitors activity around these volcanoes—earthquakes, ground movement, volcanic gas, rock chemistry, water chemistry, remote satellite analysis—on a continuous or near–real-time basis. Monitoring lets the agency issues warnings and alerts, including imminent or ongoing eruptions, ash fall forecasts and notifications when eruptions have ended.

Scientists are also examining dormant volcanoes such as the behemoth below Yellowstone National Park. Worldwide, Indonesia is most at risk from eruptions, according to researchers. Learn more about volcano prediction at http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/

4. How much of the U.S. is vulnerable to sinkholes, which are rock areas that dissolve easily?

100 percent 55 percent 5 percent 20 percent

Sinkholes damaged homes in western Florida in 2010. Credit: USGS

Answer: D—About 20 percent of the nation sits atop of terrain known as karst. In these areas the underlying rock can be dissolved by groundwater, and then the ground is vulnerable to collapse. Sinkholes are common in these places and can be as sudden as they are devastating. The most damage from sinkholes tends to occur in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Many sinkholes also form after human activity. Collapses can occur above old mines, from leaky faucets, when sewers give way or due to groundwater pumping and construction.

5. How many people in U.S. have floods killed each year, on average, over the past 30 years?

8 82 332

In June 2011 downtown Minot, N.D., was inundated by the Souris River. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Floods have killed an average of 82 people each year during the last 30 years, and caused $8 billion in damages annually. Floodwatch, a Web site operated by the USGS, offers a map with hourly updates of flood conditions at over 3,000 locations throughout the U.S.

There are also giant flows of vapor, dubbed “atmospheric rivers,” that unleash floods periodically, and climate change could increase their frequency. To understand more about traditional floods, look at http://water.usgs.gov/floods/

6. In what year did wildfires burn the most acreage in the U.S.?

1984 1991 2015

A wildfire burning in Alaska in April 2016. Credit: USGS

Answer: C—The 10 million acres that burned in the U.S. in 2015 were the most on record, primarily due to drought conditions. The national average has been 6.7 million acres for the past 10 years, and 3.6 million acres burned in 2014. Wildfire risks to firefighters, homes and property, along with threats to communities, landscapes and species are increasing, as are response and recovery costs. Alaska was of particular concern last year; over five million acres were blackened by intense wildfires.

Worldwide, forests from the Arctic to Indonesia are flaring up more often as climate changes. In the U.S. the geological survey plays a major role in mapping areas of wildfire hazards, and you can find out about it at http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3015/

7. What months typically make up hurricane season along the Atlantic Coast?

June–November March–August May–October

Hurricane Irene destroyed a long stretch of road in Rodanthe, N.C., in late August 2011. Credit: USGS

Answer: A—From June through November major tropical cyclones generate the most concern. On average during this period, 12 tropical storms, six of which become hurricanes (categorized as having winds exceeding 74 miles per hour), form over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea or Gulf of Mexico, according to the National Weather Service. In addition to high winds, heavy rainfall and storm surges cause tremendous damage.

Researchers have explored hurricane origins to find out what makes the storms so big. Learn more about storm seasons at http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/hurricane-season-is-here/

8. Are sea level rise rates increasing faster along the U.S. west or east coast?

West East It's the same for both

The marshes of the Plum Island Estuary in Massachusetts are disappearing beneath the Atlantic. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Along portions of the Atlantic coast, rates of sea level rise are increasing three to four times faster than globally. Since about 1990 sea level rise in the 600-mile stretch of coastal zone from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to north of Boston has increased from two to 3.7 millimeters per year. Globally, annual sea level rose less, going up from 0.6 to 1.0 millimeter.

Earlier this year scientists reported that sea levels were going up faster now that at any time during the past 2,000 years. Learn about the rising tides at https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp-ID=3256.html

9. True or false? The same size earthquake will cause damage over a larger area in the western U.S. than the east.

True False

A magnitude 5.8 quake hit this house in Virginia on August 23, 2011. Credit: USGS

Answer: B—Earthquake shaking in the eastern U.S. can travel much farther and cause damage over larger areas. The difference is due in part to the geologic structure and rock properties that allow seismic waves to travel farther without weakening. Whereas earthquakes occur more frequently in the west, people in the east should still be prepared. A geologist explained in Scientific American why eastern quakes travel so well, and the geological survey also has information at https://archive.usgs.gov/archive/sites/www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp-ID=3447.html

10. In the near future, which part of the U.S. is likely to see large increases in dust storms?

Southwest Midwest Southeast

Answer: A—Dust storm frequency has increased and is projected to continue in the Southwest, affecting human and ecosystem health. Several lines of evidence link these storms to more intensive land-use practices and a decadelong drought. Climate model projections of sustained drier conditions in the Southwest will likely reduce the amount of perennial vegetation covering the land, and a growing human population can disturb naturally protected soil surfaces. Both of these factors make it more likely that soils will be eroded in high winds and increase the amount of particulate matter in the air we breathe.

36,36,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Amazonian catfish's 5000-mile migration endangered by dams - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/amazonian-catfishs-5000-mile-migration-endangered-by-dams/,"Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii, a commercially valuable catfish species and an apex predator, grows to 3 meters long. Scientists have long suspected that it makes an extraordinary migration from the Amazon headwaters to the Amazon Basin and back.

Now researchers — using an innovative technique that examines the chemical composition of adult catfish ear bones — have found proof of the 8,000-kilometer journey. The fish can drift as far downstream as the Amazon estuary, then swim back to the headwaters stream where they began, or to other Amazon tributaries.

Unfortunately for the catfish, more than 400 dams have been built, are under construction, or are planned for the Amazon Basin and Andes feeder streams. Global research has shown that long homing migrations by fish are incompatible with dams.

The researchers are urging governments in six Amazon Basin countries to reconsider and redesign their Amazon dam plans, or risk losing this natural wonder — along with seeing negative impacts to the entire freshwater food chain.

A singular Amazonian catfish is capable of an amazing feat: hidden from human eyes, the species travels vast distances over its lifetime, making a round trip covering more than 8,000 kilometers (nearly 5,000 miles), to return to its natal breeding grounds, a new study confirms.

But even as this record-setting feat — the longest freshwater migration in the world — is scientifically confirmed, the species is threatened by hundreds of planned Amazonian dams.

Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii is a commercially valuable catfish species and an apex predator, growing to 3 meters (more than 9 feet) long. Understanding the migratory patterns of the fish, whose range spans six Amazonian countries, “is paramount for designing adequate conservation and management strategies, especially in view of the current and proposed hydroelectric development throughout the Amazon basin,” the researchers write in the Journal of Applied Ecology.

Observations in the 1990s concerning the size distribution of catfish caught along the length of the Amazon River first led researchers to suggest that long-distance homing migration might be taking place, explained study lead author Fabrice Duponchelle of France’s Institute of Research for Development. Subsequent genetic analyses were consistent with that hypothesis, but still didn’t offer definitive proof.

Intrigued by the possibility that catfish might be homing over such vast distances, Duponchelle employed an innovative technique in the new study to get conclusive evidence: chemical analysis of the otolith, a type of ear bone.

As otoliths grow, their chemical composition changes to reflect the background levels of particular chemical elements found in the environment. Like tree rings, the layers of bone relate to their age: the center, innermost layer of otolith is the oldest, and reflects life as a hatchling; the outer edge is the most recent, and reflects the last stage of the fish’s life.

The scientists examined how chemical composition — specifically the ratios of two strontium isotopes — changed from the otolith’s center to its edge. Because strontium levels vary geographically across the Amazon region, it was possible for the research team to match the isotope ratios seen within the bones to their geographic origin in one of three areas: the Amazon River and its Andean and lowland tributaries; the Madeira sub-basin; and tributaries originating on the old, granite Brazilian and Guiana shields. In this way, the lifetime migration patterns of 37 catfish were carefully pieced together.

Adult catfish were sampled from their breeding grounds in the upper Madeira and Amazon rivers. The life histories stored in their bones revealed that — as larvae and juveniles just a few centimeters long — they had drifted downstream, eventually reaching the lower Amazon, with some going as far as the Amazon estuary.

Most returned to their original breeding grounds thousands of miles upstream as adults, particularly within the Madeira sub-basin.

Several of the catfish studied showed alternative movement patterns, however, corresponding to migrations that began in one sub-basin and ended in another. “There are always both homers and strayers” in migratory fish species, Duponchelle told Mongabay — a pattern that helps safeguard the species against extinctions. None of the catfish examined showed evidence of being resident in their natal sub-basin throughout their life, suggesting that the initial downstream migration is a compulsory part of their lifecycle.

The team’s ground-breaking work provides conclusive evidence of the homing behavior shown by B. rousseauxii on its 8,000-kilometer journey. “Such long-distance natal homing is exceptional in purely freshwater fishes,” the researchers state.

The distance covered is “rather exceptional from a global perspective too,” said Herman Wanningen, director of the World Fish Migration Foundation. The catfish can hold its own against long-distance freshwater-saltwater migrants such as sturgeon, salmon and the European eel; the latter covers 10,000 to 12,000 kilometers (6,214 to 7,456 miles) on its journey between the Sargasso Sea and European lakes and rivers.

Unfortunately for the Amazon catfish, the length of its journey makes it especially vulnerable to disruption by the hundreds of hydropower dams slated for construction across the Amazon basin and in the river’s headwaters.

Two major completed hydropower projects on the Madeira River already pose a significant barrier to their migration route, despite mitigation efforts. Although fish passages to aid upstream migration were incorporated into both the Jirau and Santo Antônio dams, these measures have proven ineffective, the researchers write, concluding that “a substantial part of [the catfish’s] possible spawning grounds in the Amazon Basin is already strongly compromised.”

The scientists warn that negative impacts to this top Amazon predator will have knock-on effects along the whole food chain. Researchers call for urgent modifications to proposed, under construction and existing dams to restore connectivity across the migration route.

But even if upstream migration could be restored, a trickier problem is maintaining the downstream movement of the catfish during their very small juvenile stages, Duponchelle said. “These young stages — adapted to migrate downstream in running, highly oxygenated waters — now have to face huge lakes [created by dams], with often poorly oxygenated waters, roamed by predators they did not normally encounter [in the past], such as piranhas, for instance.”

Lessons learned from around the world indicate that dams and migratory species cannot coexist, Wanningen cautioned: “The only way to protect these long distance migrants is to keep certain river systems open for free migration to fulfil their lifecycle.”

“The solution would be to implement river basin planning, where choices are made about which rivers will be kept free flowing and protected, which rivers are restored by removing barriers or where fishways are installed, and which rivers are utilized for energy production/hydropower,” he said.

“This is what should be done first and then new hydropower plants can be built.”

Duponchelle hopes that the new study, when combined with the work of other scientists who have provided evidence of the ecological and social impacts of dams, along with research that identifies better, cheaper and greener energy alternatives to Amazon hydropower will be taken into account before it’s too late.

“Unfortunately,” he concluded, “what happens in the world everywhere suggests than the power of money far exceeds the power of reason.”

42,42,FF-2016-000062-IDN,We can have fish and dams: here's how - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/we-can-have-fish-and-dams-heres-how-61424,"Fish are the most threatened group among Earth’s freshwater vertebrates. On average, freshwater fish populations have declined by 76% over the past 40 years. Damaged fish communities and declining fisheries characterise global freshwater environments, including those in Australia.

Fish migrate to complete their life cycles, but water-resource developments disrupt river connectivity and migrations, threatening biological diversity and fisheries.

Millions of dams, weirs and smaller barriers – for storage and irrigation, road and rail transport and hydropower schemes – block the migration of fish in rivers worldwide.

These barriers serve our needs for water supply, transport and energy. But, by obstructing fish migrations, they also degrade ecological integrity and reduce food security.

This is bad news for those who depend on fish for food. For example, in the Mekong River fish supply over 70% of the people’s animal protein, but catches are falling drastically following dam building.

In our paper published today in CSIRO’s Marine and Freshwater Research, we take stock of the impact these barriers have on our freshwater fish, most (perhaps all) of which migrate, and how we can help them.

Dam it all

There are countless barriers across Australia’s rivers. Roughly 10,000 barriers of all kinds obstruct flows in the Murray-Darling Basin. Flow is unobstructed in less than half of the basin’s watercourse length.

Native fish numbers in the basin’s rivers have declined by an estimated 90% through habitat fragmentation by barriers together with altered flows, overfishing, coldwater pollution and invasive species.

Similar problems also affect coastal river systems. One or more barriers obstruct 49% of rivers in southeast Australia.

Local species extinctions and loss of biodiversity have occurred nationwide in developed regions, especially upstream of large dams.

Overcoming barriers

One way to help fish overcome barriers is to build fishways (or “fish ladders”).

Fishways are designed to aid fish travelling upstream or downstream at high (dams, weirs) or low (road crossings, barrages) barriers. These are classed as “technical”, with hard-engineering designs, or “nature-like”, mimicking natural stream channels.

Author provided

Recognition that dams threaten freshwater fish communities lagged well behind their construction. Nonetheless, European and American observations of declining fisheries for species moving from the sea to breed in rivers prompted early attempts in Australia to provide for fish passage.

The first Australian fishway was built near Sydney in 1913. By 1985, 52 had been built, but they adopted Northern Hemisphere designs for salmon and trout. These were unsuitable for Australian species, which rarely leap at barriers, and their flow velocities, turbulence and other aspects were excessive.

Seeing the failure of these fishways, New South Wales Fisheries sought advice in 1982 from George Eicher, an American expert, who advised on research to create designs for local species.

This led to expanding fishways research and construction in eastern states. The result was markedly improved performance, for example in the Murray-Darling’s Sea to Hume program.

Fishway performance

Our research shows that regrettably few Australian fishways have yet been shown to meet ideal ecological criteria for mitigating the impact of barriers. Furthermore, fishways are in place at relatively few sites.

In NSW, for example, only about 172 in total serve several thousand weirs and 123 dams. They can be expensive to build and operate, so costs retard mitigation at numerous important sites.

Fishways have seldom been built on dams (fewer than 3% of Australia’s 500 high dams have one); they have generally cost tens of millions of dollars; and most operate, with limited effectiveness, for less than 50% of the time. The need for much greater investment in innovation, research and development is pressing.

How to store water and also rehabilitate fish

To reduce the impact of dams on fish we need to look at resolving problems at river-basin scale; improving our management of barriers, environmental flows and water quality; removing barriers; and developing improved fishway designs.

Author provided

One way to accelerate improvements nationally would be to pass legislation for routinely re-licensing waterway barriers at regular intervals. This would mean that older barriers are re-evaluated and upgraded or removed where necessary. Under the NSW Weir Removal Program, 14 redundant weirs have already been removed, with others under assessment.

We are developing an innovative pump fishway concept at UNSW Australia. It combines aquaculture fish-pumping methods for safe fish transfer with existing fishway technology.

We hope the project may help transform past practices through less-costly modular construction, adaptability to a wide range of barriers and improved effectiveness.

Better fishway developments will mean that we can store and supply much-needed water while also restoring fish migrations. This will be increasingly important as climate change reduces streamflows in many regions, and will help rehabilitate fish populations.","Mon, 27 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/128221/original/image-20160627-28362-1f6yh2x.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C109%2C1280%2C620&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['research', 'weirs', 'fishway', 'dams', 'rivers', 'fishways', 'fish', 'freshwater', 'heres', 'barriers', 'water']", ,none

The barangay was visited Tuesday by a disaster preparedness caravan of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to help prepare the community to handle any disaster.

The barangay is frequently inundated by floods from the runoff of the Laguna de Bay which overflow during heavy rains from the nearby East Kabulusan Creek as the water heads to Manila Bay.

Cupang is also vulnerable to dangerous ground shaking during an earthquake caused by the movement of the West Valley Fault close to the barangay.

Members of about 200 families gathered at the barangay gymnasium for lectures from DILG officials on how they can become self-reliant and avoid dependence on the government during emergencies.

Officials showed residents ways to turn ordinary buckets into emergency containers for ready-to-eat food, medicine, clothes, three gallons of water, a radio, a flashlight, and hygiene kits. They said these could be easily carried during an emergency evacuation.

44,44,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Woman killed by cyanide coffee was 'planning to start a family' - Stuff.co.nz,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/asia/81319767/woman-killed-by-cyanide-coffee-was-planning-to-start-a-family,"An Indonesian woman appears before a court in Jakarta accused of poisoning a friend with cyanide. Paul Chapman reports.

The bereaved widower of an Indonesian woman who was allegedly poisoned with cyanide-laced coffee by a friend from her student days in Australia has called for justice to be served, revealing the couple had planned to start a family by the end of the year.

Jessica Kumala Wongso has been accused of the premeditated murder of Wayan Mirna Salihin, with whom she studied at the Billy Blue College of Design in Sydney.

""I want justice to be served in accordance with the law,"" Salihin's husband, Arief Soemarko, said at Wongso's trial at the Central Jakarta District Court.

FACEBOOK The victim, Wayan Mirna Salihin.

Soemarko, who married Salihin in Bali in November last year, said the couple had planned to honeymoon in Korea in April and start a family by the end of this year.

The furore surrounding the death of Salihin on January 6 has played out like a soap opera in Indonesia with febrile speculation over a possible motive for the alleged murder.

TATAN SYUFLANA/FAIRFAX The accused: Jessica Wongso leaves Central Jakarta Court after the first day of her trial.

The scene of her poisoning - Olivier, a restaurant in the glitzy Grand Indonesia shopping mall in central Jakarta - has become an improbable tourist attraction, with a non-toxic version of the Vietnamese iced coffee that killed Salihin a macabrely popular choice.

According to the indictment read in court, Salihin had criticised Wongso's boyfriend in Australia, whom she claimed was rude and a drug user.

""The words of Mirna made the defendant angry and hurt and the defendant decided to cut communication with Mirna,"" the indictment said.

TWITTER The scene of the crime: Jessica Wongso takes part in a police-organised re-enactment at the Olivier Cafe.

It said Wongso subsequently broke up with her boyfriend and had some legal problems in Australia.

A Fairfax Media investigation revealed Wongso was listed to appear before a Sydney magistrate on a high range drink driving charge on February 26 but was already in custody in Indonesia.

""To avenge her anger, the defendant planned to take away Mirna's life,"" the indictment read before the court said.

JEWEL TOPSFIELD/FAIRFAX The husband: ""I want justice,"" says Wyan Mirna Salihin's widower, Arief Soemarko.

It said Wongso, who worked for Ambulance NSW until late last year, re-established contact with Salihin and it was arranged they would meet at Olivier Cafe on January 6 with another friend, Hani.

According to the indictment Wongso arrived early, ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and two cocktails and added cyanide to the coffee.

""Jessica said: 'This is for you Mir, you said you want Vietnamese Iced Coffee',"" the court heard. ""Then Mirna drank it and said: 'It's not tasty, it's awful', waving her hands in front of her mouth due to the hot flavour it made. Two minutes later Mirna fell unconscious.""

TATAN SYUFLANA/FAIRFAX NZ Jessica Wongso fronts Central Jakarta Court accused of the murder of her friend.

Salihin died on the way to hospital.

Wongso's lawyer, Otto Hasibuan, questioned why Wongso would travel all the way from Australia to Indonesia to kill Salihin just because she was hurt about what her friend had said about her ex-boyfriend.

He also said the indictment did not elaborate on when or how the cyanide was purchased.

But the prosecution insisted in court on Tuesday that it had strong evidence of Wongso's guilt.

Asked what the prosecution had told the court to counter the defence argument that the indictment was absurd, Chief Prosecutor Ardito Muwadi said the important element of premeditated murder was the intention in the defendant's heart and how calm they were in carrying out their plan.

The trial has implications for Australia because the Australian Federal Police (AFP) agreed to assist with investigating the case after the Indonesian government provided written assurance that Wongso would not face the death penalty if found guilty.

Although Law and Human Rights Minister Yasonna Laoly has confirmed this, Indonesia' chief security minister, Luhut Panjaitan, appeared to equivocate during a trip to Sydney earlier this month, saying: ""Well, I think we leave it to the judge, the court, but I believe we work it out (the) Indonesian way.""

Salihin's father, Dermawan Salihin, said he did not believe the agreement with the AFP should be upheld if Wongso is convicted on the basis of evidence from Indonesia.

""Secondly, Jessica is not Australian, she is just a permanent resident,"" he said.

Salihin said cyanide was readily and cheaply available in Indonesia as pest control for farmers.","Wed, 22 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/c/e/y/t/c/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1ceyqf.png/1466535667993.jpg,"['coffee', 'mirna', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'planning', 'woman', 'killed', 'jakarta', 'cyanide', 'court', 'indictment', 'wongso', 'start', 'australia', 'jessica', 'family', 'salihin']", ,none

50,50,FF-2016-000062-IDN,On The Road: Rhino Translocation in Nepal - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2016/06/on-the-road-rhino-translocation-in-nepal/,"Up until the mid-20th century, a similar, if larger, undertaking would mean hunting parties for maharajas and their guests looking for exotic trophies. Today, such parties are reserved for wildlife census and other research and conservation efforts.

In the 1960s there were less than 100 one-horned rhinos in Nepal and by 1975 only about 600 survived in the wild globally.

By 2015, Nepal’s Chitwan National Park alone was home to 605 rhinos.

With one palm above the rhino’s nostril to check its breathing and another under its head to make sure it wasn’t slumping, an anxious official yelled over the sound of metal wheels grinding against stones on a dirt road inside Chitwan National Park, Nepal.

“Hurry up!”

The sun was ready to set, and it had already been an hour since the 12-year old male was sedated. Despite the efforts, the rhino’s placement on the wooden flatbed trolley after being subdued was not ideal, and at one point an empty jute sack — the only thing they could find — was folded and placed under its head in a desperate effort to try and not strain the animal’s neck too much during the very bumpy ride.

“Do they realize how heavy that thing is?” grumbled the nervous driver inside his excavator, trying his best to quickly but carefully pull the trolley with nine men holding the animal in place along a trail that included trudging across a creek and several dips and rises.

It had been a long and trying day, and against the backdrop of local protests denouncing the translocation, this rhino and everyone involved in the process were under pressure to ensure its safe release in Bardiya National Park, about 150 miles west, the following morning. This meant a near-nine-hour drive through the night soon after the cage was loaded onto the truck.

In the next two years, this translocation effort, led by the Nepali government’s Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation in partnership with WWF and National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), with partial funding by the USAID Hariyo Ban Program, plans to populate Bardia National Park with at least 20 to 30 rhinos from Chitwan. By the end of this particular weekend, they hoped to translocate the first five.

Since then, news of a rhino dying of tuberculosis in Chitwan has come to light. And on May 22, one of the translocated animals gave birth to a healthy male calf. Just in time, Nepal’s new 100-rupee-bill, which came into circulation this month, replaces the image of a single rhino with that of an adult rhino with a calf.

A New Dawn

The last time rhinos were translocated from Chitwan National Park to Bardia National Park was in 2003.

On Tuesday, March 1, 2016, the hiatus ended. The day began at dawn, fog still lifting off the southern forest plains, the sky still a deep blue. By 6:45AM, the sun had begun to rise and mahuts were busy readying elephants for the long day ahead in the park’s Sukebar area. Minutes later a distant yell echoed into the camp.

“There’s a tiger in the area,” someone explained. “That’s common.”

By 7AM, Shanta Raj Gyawali, Coordinator of Biodiversity Conservation for Hariyo Ban Program, had his hands full — literally. As the lead for the technical team comprised of representatives from NTNC, Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC), WWF, and Chitwan national park, Gyawali had begun preparing a mixture of M99 (3-4mg Etorphine Hydrochloride and 12-15mg of Acepromazine) that would be used to sedate the rhinos. Once the darts were ready, three shooters from NTNC loaded it on their respective rifles.

The plan was to dart at least two to three rhinos by that afternoon, for the next day’s release, and a total of five by the weekend. Nearby, Kanchan Thapa, a conservation biologist with WWF Nepal, had finished checking five radio collars for rhinos and carefully placed them in a nylon duffle bag. The equipment made by the German company Vectronic Aerospace cost $7,000 plus 40 percent tax each.

By 8:30AM, an army of 33 elephants had marched into the forest to track and find rhinos, then corral them as close as possible towards the area where large wooden cages and a couple of trucks awaited.

Up until the mid-20th century, a similar, if larger, undertaking would mean hunting parties for maharajas and their guests looking for exotic trophies. Today, such parties are reserved for wildlife census and other research and conservation efforts.

In the 1960s there were less than 100 one-horned rhinos in Nepal and by 1975 only about 600 survived in the wild globally. By 2015, Chitwan alone was home to 605 rhinos. “We are a leader in rhino conservation,” Phanindra Raj Sharma, Director General of DNPWC, explained.

Still, the animals were bent on making the conservationists put in a hard day’s work. A rhino was finally darted at 4:46PM.

“Can you guys please hurry up! Its ears are already beginning to twitch!” Mr. Gyawali, the biologist, yelled as men and machine tried to pull the trolley with the rhino inside a large wooden cage under a quickly darkening sky.

Once inside, the technical team administered an antidote to the sedative, M50-50 (Diprenorphine), with the help of a handheld torchlight. Immediately, a handful of young men started lowering the cage door only to hit a snag: the rhino’s snout was too far out, and now the door was resting on it. The rhino started to grunt and move, trying to push the cage door upward. “Hold it down!” Mr. Gyawali urgently instructed the young men above the cage, who were trying to do just that. “And get those guys with the levers to push the trolley in!”

As the rhino pushed the cage door upward and tried to get its head out, the men above tried to push the door down without hurting the animal. Finally, the trolley was pushed in a few inches and the cage immediately shut and locked. Inside, the magnificent animal stood up. The cage shook.

‘A Historical Undertaking’

The following morning, at 10:40AM, I climbed on to the roof of the truck carrying the rhino as it crossed a river in Bardiya National Park to reach the release site. I could see the animal below as sunlight poured into the cage from in between its wooden planks. The rhino grunted, and every time the animal moved the cage shook. A convoy of vehicles followed, bringing the Forest Minister, Hon. Agni Prasad Sapkota, and other high-level officials, experts, and invitees to the release site.

Of the three machans set up to view the release, the closest to the truck was reserved for the Minister and other VIPs. “What to do if it charges our machan?” someone asked as the technical team below inquired whether the Minister was ready to declare the release. “The drone’s battery is going to die, can we release it fast?” someone below asked aloud. “Why aren’t the elephants near our machan to make sure the rhino doesn’t come this way?” a member of the Minister’s delegation asked for the second time. Then, “Is it okay to release it now?” the Minister asked to no one in particular. “Yes, yes sir,” a couple of people reassured him. “So I just say it?” he verified. Then he did.

At 10:46AM the cage door opened to reveal the backside of the rhino, who appeared not to know what to do.

“Maybe when they loaded the cage into the truck, they should have turned it around so that it would face the right way when the door opened,” the Minister mused aloud. On two other machans, others waited anxiously.

Finally, at 11:07AM, the rhino walked backward out of the cage. Very quickly, making a sharp 180-degree right turn, it saw a forest ahead, as intended. Without much hesitation, the freed animal hopped and sprinted into the trees, leaving behind a trail of dust and a marveled crowd. Mahouts who had been waiting on their elephants gently followed the rhino to make sure it did not make another sharp turn and charge back towards the release site (apparently, on at least one prior occasion, the rhino made sure to exact its vengeance on the truck it had been transported in).

At around 11:10AM, someone announced it was safe to get back down.

Back across the river, on its sandy banks, Minister Sapkota made a formal address. “This is a historical undertaking and a happy moment for conservationists,” he told the crowd. “This brings both challenges and opportunities, but most of all it brings opportunity for the community here. If people want, they can conserve and develop. This is just the start, but a good start. We leave resting this responsibility to you, with faith in you.”

Protests and Public Perception

In the preceding days, the media had been regularly reporting on the protests in Chitwan against the translocation. Indeed, on the morning of the release itself, there was unfavorable coverage of the undertaking. The broadsheets appeared to have taken an antagonistic position to the translocation without explaining its role as a conservation exercise.

To get a better sense of why translocation was a preferred conservation strategy, I spoke to my colleague, Prof. Elizabeth Hadly, who heads the Hadly Lab in Stanford University’s Biology Department and guides her students’ doctoral research on wildlife and ecology in Nepal.

“The goals of translocation are not always clearly articulated and their success may be contingent on factors that are unanticipated such as disease resistance or behavioral differences that prohibit translocated individuals from successfully integrating into a new environment,” said Prof. Hadly, whose recent book End Game (co-authored with Prof. Anthony Barnosky) begins with a chapter on Nepal.

“Translocation has been used in many ways for conservation; to repopulate an area that has seen demise or extinction of a population; to increase genetic diversity; to relocate a problem individual or individuals; or to anticipate future environments that might be better suited for the survival of species,” Hadly added. In Nepal, it was more or less all of the above.

Back on the riverbank, I spoke to Santosh Mani Nepal, Senior Director of Policy and Outreach for WWF Nepal and a respected voice on conservation policies in the country. “WWF is a historical partner in this kind of innovative initiatives and will continue to be,” he said. “Some are successes, some are not, depending upon the sociopolitical situation of the country. But eventually our goal is to make sure that conservation wins, which is why we support this endeavor.”

The point that protestors and the media have latched on to is this: 70 rhinos were translocated from Chitwan to Bardia’s Babai Valley between 1985 and 2003, bringing its population to 85. However, by 2015, only 29 remained. Using this historical premise to highlight the insecurity for rhinos in Bardia today and in the near future, protestors are seeking to block the translocation.

The problem with this position is the incomplete picture it paints about the shared safety issues and success of rhino conservation in Nepal’s national parks, and the many poached and natural deaths of rhinos in Chitwan itself.

Between 2000 and 2006, Chitwan National Park saw a decline of 31 percent in its rhino population, dropping from 544 to 372, almost all of it due to poaching. Between 2011 and 2015, the population increased by 21 percent. Over a dozen rhinos there have died of natural causes since 2014.

The massive rise in poaching of rhinos and tigers between the late 1990s and 2006 was largely due to the Maoist conflict, which forced the Nepal Army, previously enlisted to guard national parks, to mobilize and address the conflict instead. Post-conflict, the Government of Nepal beefed up its national parks security. In Bardia, the number of guard posts inside the park was nearly doubled to 33. There has been no rhino poaching in Bardia since 2010, and Nepal has maintained a remarkable “Zero Poaching” rate for three years of the last five years.

“I personally visited the sites where the rhinos will be released,” Mr. Kahrel, DNPWC’s Director General, said. “And I have made sure we have done everything we need to keep the rhinos safe in their new home. The main challenge is security, and on this we have a proven track record and experience, and we are confident we are up to the task.”

In Bardia, it is also not just about adding the number of guard posts for the army. Previously, because of flood risks, soldiers would retreat to safer areas during the monsoon and poachers would take brutal advantage of the temporary security vacuum. Learning from this, the army is working towards maintaining its standard positions throughout the year and identifying strategic locations that are also less prone to flooding.

At the same time, the USAID-funded Hariyo Ban program has engaged local communities in various capacities in recent years, including helping them to transition from traditional hunting to newer sources of livelihood, as well as establishing youth anti-poaching groups and community forest monitors.

“The one-horned rhino is a source of national pride and identity for the Nepali people,” Amy Tohill-Stull, the Acting Mission Director of USAID/Nepal, explained over email, speaking about the translocation and USAID’s broader effort in wildlife conservation in Nepal. “USAID, in partnership with local communities, the Nepali Army and the Government of Nepal are working together to prevent poaching and re-establish forest land between Chitwan and Bardia. Together, Nepal has created several safe national parks where both wildlife and ecotourism can thrive.”

Indeed, the translocation is positioned to benefit communities in both Chitwan and Bardia. In Chitwan, it could help mitigate the frequent human-wildlife conflicts sparked when rhinos are pushed out of their core area due to population pressure. In Bardia, they would have multiple effects.

“Rhinos are mega grazers, so they tend to save ecosystems. So we actually think they might be able to help with that here as they have in Chitwan,” Sabita Malla, a wildlife biologist with WWF Nepal who is part of the translocation team, explained. “Based on available habitat here now and quantitative data of grass patches in Nepal’s floodplains, we think about 50 rhinos can be sustained here in Bardia’s Babai valley.” Tourism prospects would also increase for the region.

New Revelations, More Translocations

A new risk, however, has emerged. On March 3, two days after the first translocation, a paper titled “Mycobacterium orygis – Associated Tuberculosis in Free-Ranging Rhinoceros, Nepal, 2015″ was published in the journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases. The news of the paper and its important findings only made it to Kathmandu media towards the end of the month.

In the paper, the authors write: “On February 16, 2015, CNP officials observed a sick female rhinoceros in the buffer zone of the western sector of the park near Amaltari. The rhinoceros was dull, depressed, and not feeding. The following day, the animal was found dead in the same area.”

The study concluded that the animal had died of tuberculosis (TB). Of their findings, the authors added:

In our earlier study, we isolated M. orygis from chital deer (Axis axis) and blue bull (Boselaphus tragocamelus) from a captive wild-animal facility and postulated that the origin of the infection might be from infected animals in CNP [Chitwan National Park], where the deer and blue bull originated. This new finding of a different strain type of M. orygis in a free-ranging rhinoceros in CNP provides evidence for our hypothesis. Other reports of M. orygis in captive wild animals in Nepal, cattle and a rhesus monkey in Bangladesh, humans in South Asia, and an immigrant from India in New Zealand further support this bacterium’s potential widespread distribution in South Asia and attests to the One Health significance of this organism.

How the rhino translocation plans will be affected in light of this new study remains to be seen. Should the translocated rhinos, who have satellite tracking collars, be pursued again to be tested for TB? How does this affect the remainder of the translocation plans? Officials contacted at WWF Nepal did not respond regarding this query.

There has been no public discussion on the topic of TB in rhinos, although TB-infected elephants of Chitwan National Park have made the news several times over the years. In the meantime, the Nepali government has now started preparing to translocate the rare arna (water buffalo) from Koshi Tapu Wildlife Reserve in eastern Nepal and Swamp Deer from Bardiya National Park in western Nepal to Chitwan National Park.

A Trade

In late January, the Chinese government asked Forest Minister Sapkota for two rhinos in exchange for financial and technical assistant for a Forensic Science Laboratory that Nepal had proposed.

China made the demand at a time when Nepal was trying to curry favor during the months-long, India-imposed goods blockade on Nepal, and Nepal was trying to play its relations with China against its deteriorating relationship with India. The current Prime Minister has made a habit of appeasing the Chinese. The rhinos that will be traded to China will also be from Chitwan. The exchange of rhinos for funds has thus far not inspired any public discourse or media scrutiny.

In Bardia, as the rhino stepped out of its cage, Minister Sapkota was clearly pleased. Noticing the wound on its back, he asked about it with clear concern. I informed him it was injured in a fight with another rhino in Chitwan before being darted. “I hope it did not bleed more after being darted,” he said.

As the rhino dashed off into the forest, the Minister stood on the machan motionless for a few seconds, staring at the dust the animal had kicked up. Perhaps he was reflecting on the China deal, and having to be in the position of mediating it.

More than 50 million cubic feet of earth needed to be moved as part of the Panama Canal expansion project which consisted of four main sub-projects:

1. Third Set of Locks

The project entails the construction of Neopanamax-dimension lock complexes on the Pacific and Atlantic sides. Each complex features three chambers, nine water-saving basins, a lateral filling and emptying system and rolling gates.

2. Pacific Access Channel

Executed in four phases, the project entailed the dry excavation of some 50 million cubic meters of material along a 6.1-kilometer (3.8-mile) span. The main concept was the creation of a new access channel north of the Third Set of Locks on the Pacific side.

3. Navigation Channel improvements

This component involved dredging of the Canal entrances in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the existing navigation channels in Culebra Cut and Gatun Lake.

4. Improvements to Water Supply

The work enabled raising Gatun Lake’s maximum operating level by 45 centimeters (18 inches) to improve Canal water supply and draft dependability. Water has always been a critical resource to the Panama Canal, and the addition of the third set of locks created a greater need for even more water to make the expansion program possible.

In order to properly maintain and sustain this valuable resource for centuries to come, the Panama Canal designed and installed a total of 18 water-saving basins at the Expanded locks. Each of the massive basins has a surface area of 25 Olympic-size pools that utilizes state-of-the-art technology to allow the Canal to reuse 60 percent of the water per transit.

The Borinquen Dam

Work to expand the Panama Canal officially began on September 3, 2007, with dry excavations to create the channel that would link the Third Set of Locks on the Pacific side to Culebra Cut.

A crucial part of this project involves the construction of a dam known as Borinquen 1E. The dam is located west of Pedro Miguel Locks. It measures 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) long and allows the operation of the new channel nine meters above the existing level.

Dry-excavation activities in this area called for the clearing of 461 hectares contaminated with unexploded ordnance. The Panama Canal Authority found a way to use much of the extra material that was excavated for the expansion to safely bury a number of unexploded munitions left behind by U.S. soldiers more than 60 years ago, effectively using one problem to solve another.

Construction of Borinquen 1E dam clay core was completed in June 2015. In July 2015 an excavation record of 1.5 million cubic meters of material was reached, and flooding of the channel began in September 2015. The channel reached the level of Gatun Lake in November 2015, and due to requirements it was filled to its maximum level of 27.19 meters (89.2 feet).

Gatun Spillway

The Atlantic Entrance

The contract for dredging works for the Atlantic entrance was awarded to Belgian contractor Jan De Nul on September 25, 2009. Dredging was conducted in a 13.8-kilometer (8.6-mile) extension to widen the existing Atlantic entrance to a minimum of 225 meters (738 feet), as well as the north access channel to the new Agua Clara Locks to a minimum of 218 meters (715 feet). An option for further dredging up to 16.1 meters (53 feet) was executed, which represented an additional 2.3 million cubic meters of material.

The contractor deployed several dredges simultaneously along the area, including hopper dredge Filippo Brunelleschi and cutter suction dredge Marco Polo. Dredging operations concluded on January 30, 2013, with Neopanamax size dredge Charles Darwin removing the remaining shoals in the new expanded channel.

The Pacific Entrance

The contract for dredging the Pacific entrance was awarded on April 7, 2008, to Belgian company Dredging International Panama. The work consisted of widening the navigation channel on the Pacific entrance to a minimum of 225 meters (738 feet) and deepening it to 15.5 meters (50.9 feet) below mean low water springs, as well as partial construction of the south access to the Cocoli Locks. World-renown high-tech, powerful equipment including dredges D’Artagnan, Vlaanderen XIX and Lange Wapper were used in the project.

Culebra Cut

The Culebra Cut and Gatun Lake project entailed the removal of underwater material to deepen and widen the navigation channels in Gatun Lake and to deepen the navigation channel in Culebra Cut. Work in the Cut was completed at the end of 2012, and dredging works at Gatun Lake were completed on January 31, 2015.

The work included installation of 34 new navigational towers along the 38 kilometers (24 miles) of Gatun Lake, from Gamboa to the locks on the Atlantic side. These towers, which use LED- and PEL-type lights, replace light houses, are part of the Panama Canal Authority’s plans for enhancing safe navigation at the waterway in conjunction with the six towers that were built in the area of the new Pacific Access Channel.

The third set of lochs

At a cost of $3.2 billion, the contract was executed by consortium Grupo Unidos por el Canal (GUPCSA). The consortium is formed by Sacyr Vallehermoso from Spain; Impregilo from Italy; Jan de Nul from Belgium and Constructora Urbana from Panama. The project entailed the design and construction of two similar lock complexes, one on the Pacific and the other on the Atlantic side. Each has three chambers, nine water-saving basins, a lateral filling and emptying system and a redundant system of rolling gates.

To build the new locks, the contractor installed industrial parks at each site for concrete and aggregate production. The basalt rock extracted from the Pacific site excavations was used as aggregate and sand for concrete mixes at both sites.

The design and fabrication of the different components was a worldwide project. In Italy, Cimolai fabricated the 16 gates. South Korean-based Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries fabricated 158 valves, 84 bulkheads and 328 trash racks.

The Gates

The rolling gates system was one of the most significant elements of the locks design and construction, at a cost of $547.7 million, which included fabrication, shipment and installation. Each gate will open and close in four and not more than five minutes.

The six different types of gates were fabricated with features that vary according to where they are installed. For instance, the tallest ones – 33.04 meters (108.4 feet) – are installed at the Pacific entrance to the Canal, to withstand significant tidal variation. Even though the heaviest gates are 4,242 tons, their design incorporates buoyancy chambers to enable them to move on rails at 15 percent of their actual weight.

53,53,FF-2016-000062-IDN,The dredge report: being an account of an expedition into the hyperreality of the California Delta - TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/25/wow-thats-a-lot-of-dredge/,"It has occurred to me that perhaps TechCrunch pays insufficient attention to slurry, sediment, silt, sludge, mud, and muck; to canals, earthworks, levees, dikes, dredges, and the Army Corps of Engineers; to the vast engineering works, with lifespans measured in decades, that literally reshape our world. So last weekend I boarded a bus hired by the Dredge Research Collaborative.

This wonderfully obsessive and obscure group of infrastructure aficionados, guided by Wired writer and Rhode Island School of Design professor Tim Maly, has held an annual “DredgeFest” event every year since 2013. This year it was a tour of that vast artificial hyperreality just upstream of San Francisco and the Valley — the California Delta.

“We own the only high-rate offloader west of the Mississippi,” Jim Levine says at our first stop, the massive megaproject called the Montezuma Wetlands, with some justified smugness in his voice. “Slurry it up to 15% … pump the sediment 4 miles at 20,000 gallons a minute … last year we took in about a million [cubic] yards … probably half of all the dredging in the bay.”

“Wow,” an awed student breathes in reply, “that’s a lot of dredge.”

The entire Delta is, basically, a lot of dredge. Once it was a huge wetland carved by a network of intertwined, constantly shifting waterways. Then came the 19th-century gold rush. Miners upstream in the Sierra washed away entire rock faces with high-pressure water, creating a gargantuan “pulse” of sediment that filtered downstream, its traces still visible in the San Francisco Bay today. Meanwhile, settlers began to cultivate the Delta. Chinese laborers built the first delta megaproject; a colossal array of levees to (aspirationally) hold back floods.

The descendants of those levees wall the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers today — and the peaty land of the islands behind them has subsided to a depth which in places hits 26ft/8m below sea level. On Sherman Island, where the Sacramento and San Joaquin meet, we stood in those depths, looking what felt like way up to the riverbanks, jokingly advised to look for cracks in the levees.

Of course what really worries Californians is earthquakes. Sherman Island, and its levees, keep the brackish Bay water out of what’s sent south by the California State Water Project. If it were to be inundated by a levee breach, salinity would increase so much that “we’d have to shut down the pumps” carrying water south, said an engineer from Ducks Unlimited (no, really) as he showed us around the site.

If this doesn’t seem like a tenable long-term solution to you, you’re not alone. Governor Brown and co. are currently promoting a $15 billion plan to carry water under the Delta to Southern California, courtesy of two giant tunnels. This is, to put it mildly, controversial. Others have proposed converting farmland back to natural wetlands. Which is of course even more controversial.

There is no such thing as a megaproject without fierce opposition. Even the Montezuma Wetlands project — which, elegantly, tops up subsided lowlands with dredged sediment, to regenerate the kind of wetlands which originally existed — attracted enormous hostility and resistance. The project was birthed in 1991: it did not launch until 2003, after 12 years of legal battles.

Now, in the shadow of a massive wind farm (its existence perhaps prompted by the project’s $150,000/month PG&E bill) a slow restoration of two thousands acres of wetlands is underway, and should continue for at least another decade. In an era when “tech” usually means something obsoleted within a few years, there is a certain grandeur to projects with this kind of scale and lifespan.

Even outside of cities, most of the population of California lives in a fundamentally artificial environment, courtesy of what can be considered an ongoing engineering project that dates back more than a century: the transformation of the Delta and the Central Valley into some of the world’s most productive farmland, while keeping the South alive with water from the North, the Owens Valley, and the Colorado River.

Some of this history has been captured at the Dutra Museum of Dredging (no, really) in Rio Vista in the Delta. (Sorry, hacker tourists; they’re open by appointment only, and prefer groups of 10 or more.) There I learned that the clamshell dredge was one of the cutting-edge world-changing technologies of its day. It’s still in wide use, but of course it’s not “tech” any more. As technology ages, it becomes infrastructure, and grows deeply boring to most.

The friend who invited me out to DredgeFest is a professional infrastructurist himself — except that his is in orbit. One day the descendants of his satellites will be both as unsexy, and as crucial, as the dredges you might glimpse from BART or the bayside from time to time, without really noticing. And why should you? Like most infrastructure, they are much too important to be allowed to be interesting.","Sat, 25 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/purple-dredge.jpg?w=578,"['sediment', 'valley', 'san', 'delta', 'techcrunch', 'project', 'wetlands', 'california', 'account', 'levees', 'report', 'water', 'expedition', 'hyperreality', 'dredge', 'really']", ,none
54,54,FF-2016-000062-IDN,What China's successful reforestation program means for the rest of the world - PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-06-27/what-chinas-successful-reforestation-program-means-rest-world,"Forest recovery was seen particularly in mountain regions, including the Min Mountains pictured here, and in areas that had previously been cut down by logging companies. (Photo: Andrés Viña)

After major flooding in 1998, China introduced the Natural Forest Conservation Program, a logging ban to help protect against erosion and rapid runoff. A recent study in Science Advances of 10 years of satellite data found significant recovery in some Chinese forests.

But it's not all good news. Andrés Viña, an author of the paper, says this reforestation is probably shifting deforestation elsewhere.

""They implemented two national programs. One was the Grain to Green program, which is basically to reconvert agricultural fields in steep slopes into forests. And the other is the natural forest conservation program which is, in a sense, a logging ban to prevent deforestation and also to increase the aerial forests,” Viña says. “At regional scales, in the Sichuan province, the program seems to be working in the sense that there is forest regeneration, forest recovery. And so we wanted to see if that was the case on a national scale. And we also wanted to see if the program was, in fact, related with this regeneration.”

China’s conservation policies banned logging and employed locals as park rangers, protecting forests so that they could regrow. The recovery of a forest in the Min Mountains, Sichuan Province, is pictured here. (Photo: Andrés Viña)

China's reforestation initiatives, in other words, have been a huge success. But Viña says this isn't necessarily a good thing. China, as it turns out, is just looking elsewhere to get the lumber products it needs.

“China has become one of the leading timber importers in the world,” Viña says. “It's Southeast Asia, Vietnam, Indonesia, as well as Africa, northern Eurasia, Russia are the ones that are now supplying all the gap that has been left by this program enacted. In a sense, the program exported the deforestation, and we basically also speculate that it's not just a climate issue, but also a biodiversity issue, because many of the places that are being deforested right now are also places of high biodiversity. We are replacing high biodiversity places in other places for relatively poor biodiversity forests in China.”

Satellites tracked forest cover and regrowth from 2000-2010 in the study, “Effects of conservation policy on China’s forest recovery,” published in Science Advances. (Photo: Viña et al. Sci. Adv. 2016)

“We as consumers with user consumption habits and user consumption rates basically encourage China to participate in things like sustainable timber production certification. A lot of that timber that is imported is used to produce furniture, for example. But then is exported again to countries like the US and countries in Europe, etc. So, indirectly, we are contributing to this export of deforestation. ... What we do in one place will have repercussions beyond that particular place,” Viña says. “Thinking of China as a vacuum, it's a win for China, but how much a reality in terms of climate change mitigation this program is accruing is still a question mark.”

55,55,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Change The System - Not The Climate - The Ecologist,https://theecologist.org/2016/jun/16/change-system-not-climate,"We are seeing the realities of climate change: rising temperatures, declining Arctic sea ice, extreme weather events, heatwaves, wildfires, floods, droughts, stronger storms and hurricanes and so on. According to UN estimates, there will be 1 billion ‘climate refugees', i.e. victims of disasters induced by climate change in the world by 2050.

India is now experiencing the highest temperatures ever with a heatwave and drought, which has left many people with little access to water. Bangladesh got pummeled yet again by heavy rains leaving two million people homeless. Sri Lanka - which has experienced significant rise in sea levels in recent years - has just faced unprecedented floods and landslides which have left some 500,000 people homeless and over 200 families buried in the landslides.

Those most affected by climate change are those least responsible: the poor nations and communities of colour that have historically provided the natural and human resources for the enrichment of the privileged classes in the industrialized nations. The international policy frameworks in place are far from adequate to address the urgency of the climate crisis.

International Frameworks

The Kyoto Protocol, linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted in 1997, though flawed and never fully implemented, committed parties to internationally-binding emission reduction targets. Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, it placed a heavier burden on developed nations based on the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities.""

However, even minimal efforts to address climate change became derailed by international economic competition. Industrializing countries such as China, India, and Brazil wanted the ""rich, powerful and deeply fossil-fuel addicted"" countries in the Global North to take the lead in drastic emissions reductions allowing them room to industrialize and advance economically. Fearing loss of their economic edge, the Global North wanted to move away from the targets and obligations to which they had previously agreed. Lobbied heavily by the fossil fuel industry, The United States government never even ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

Pointing out that the ability of populations to adapt and mitigate against climate change is shaped by political and economic realities, civil society organizations mostly from the global South declared the Bali Principles of Climate Justice in 2002. It framed the climate crisis as a political and ethical issue, not simply an environmental and physical phenomenon. The countries of the global South demanded the rich Northern nations to pay their ‘climate debt', that is, compensation for their historically disproportionate emission of greenhouse gases which has contributed to extensive environmental and societal damage in poor countries.

Given these on-going contentions, the U.S. China bilateral Climate Deal of November 2014 was welcomed as an important achievement by the two most polluting nation states. Unfortunately, however, this Deal is merely a statement of aspirational goals: it has no binding targets, no specific plans to cut emissions and no penalties for non-compliance.

According to this Deal, China will not begin reducing emissions until as late as 2030. While the US agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26%-28% below 2005 levels by 2025 is significant, it is not considered sufficient to reach the target of below 2 C increase in temperature by the end of the century. There is no guarantee that President Obama's successor who will have to implement the deal will do so.

Paris Climate Agreement

The Climate Treaty signed in Paris in December 2015 is hailed as an historic achievement in international consensus and a turning point in climate policy. Practically all countries in the world opted to sign agreeing to hold the increase in the global average temperature increase to 1.5 °C.175 countries have already signed the Agreement which will go into effect in 2020. US Secretary of State John Kerry signed on behalf of the United States holding his little granddaughter in his arms.

Symbolism and rhetoric aside, the Paris Agreement, unlike the previous Kyoto Protocol, provides no detailed timetables or country-specific goals for emissions reduction. It leaves every country to decide its own cuts in pollution (so-called ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"") according to its own criteria. It provides no clear, measurable targets, no accountability no legal obligations. Each country that ratifies the agreement will be required to set a target for emission reduction, but the amount will be voluntary. There will be neither a mechanism to force, a country to set a target by a specific date nor enforcement measures if a set target is not met.

The Agreement was a victory for the United States given its opposition to mandatory emissions reduction targets and the Kyoto Protocol. It was, however, a failure for the smaller nations most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which wanted to include stricter emissions targets and enforcement mechanisms. Apparently, the U.S. gained their compliance through backdoor diplomacy and offers of international funding for climate adaptation. The United States also succeeded in ensuring that the Agreement was not legally binding and countries were not open to litigation for non-compliance of the Agreement.

The Paris Agreement will not be binding on its member states until 55 parties who produce over 55% of the world's greenhouse gases ratify it. Thus far, only 17 countries - overwhelmingly vulnerable small island nations - have ratified the Agreement. There is doubt that given global economic competitiveness whether some countries, especially high polluters, such as, China, the US, India, Brazil, Canada, Russia, Indonesia and Australia will do so. There is also no guarantee that the developed countries will honor the pledge to mobilize $100 billion per year for climate financing for the poor countries starting in 2020.

The Paris Climate Agreement does not even mention fossil fuels let alone the need to leave 80% of it in the ground, which many experts consider a requirement to mitigate climate change. It does not address the need to cut government fossil fuel subsidies, military expenditures, air travel, shipping, etc. as keys to global de-carbonization.

Hardly anyone expects countries to do much for climate protection under this arrangement. No wonder fossil fuel companies were the financial backers of the Paris Climate Conference, which was dominated by market based solutions to climate change, notably emissions trading.

Carbon Trading

Carbon trading, which constitutes the bulk of emissions trading was introduced as the main mechanism for meeting emissions reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. Within this system, a country having more carbon emissions can purchase the ‘right' to pollute more if it exceeds its cap by purchasing the permits of less polluting countries. As Carbon Trade Watch explains: ""emissions trading partitions and privatizes the atmosphere and institutes the buying and selling of ‘permits to pollute' just as any other international commodity"". This strategy for commodification of emissions was pushed by the US in response to heavy corporate lobbying.

Critics argue that there have not been measurable reductions in carbon emissions attributable to the mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol. They point out that the two most important carbon markets, the EU Emissions Trading System and the UN's Clean Development Mechanism have essentially failed. They argue that the market-based cap and trade system, designed to reduce carbon emissions has actually aggravated the problem by giving unfair financial advantages to major polluters to continue polluting while putting the onus of climate protection and maintenance of carbon sinks on the poorer countries and inhibiting their economic development. Moreover, ‘emissions trading' takes attention away from the search for less complicated strategies, such as a straightforward carbon tax on polluters and changes in patterns of economic production and energy use.

Despite these problems, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change still strongly supports carbon trading. International financial interests are now gearing up to expand carbon trading under the new Paris Agreement. They see a huge new market and business opportunity in carbon trading. The World Bank has established a Carbon Finance Unit to create an international system to price carbon. The World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim recently stated that there is an ‘obvious consensus' among World Bank economists studying the problem, and that ‘putting a price on carbon pollution is by far the most powerful and efficient way to reduce emissions' Christine Legarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund has called carbon pricing the ‘crown jewel' of efforts to mitigate climate change.

Many environmental justice activists, however, are deeply concerned about the possible effects of this approach motivated by profit. They argue that carbon trading will lead to increasing ‘financialization of nature', the commodification of everything that can be seen as a carbon sink, especially forests but also agricultural land and even the ocean's capacity to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis via algae'. The Pope's June 2015 Encyclical also voices the grave concerns that many people have over the status quo's push for carbon trading:

Rather than upholding and extending the extremist growth oriented system through new strategies, such as, carbon trading, the world's economic structures must be transformed so that the exploitation of people and plunder of the Earth and the relentless pumping of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are replaced by systems that honor environmental sustainability and social justice.

We have to be careful too that eco-fascist views and movements do not gain ground as economic conditions deteriorate and social and environmental dislocations worsen around the world. Change towards renewable energy has to be accompanied with changes in the control over resources and production and access of wider groups of people to economic opportunities.

In the face of dramatic recent acceleration in the warming of the planet, the failure of the Paris Agreement to address divesting from fossil fuel and the support of governments for new fossil fuel projects, climate action is intensifying around the world. There are thousands of organizations and people all around the world engaged in positive nonviolent and collective action. Indigenous people have been at the forefront of struggles to protect Mother Earth from the very beginning of their encounter with European colonization. We must believe that the larger goals of environmental sustainability and social justice can be achieved and that ‘Another World is Possible' if we work together to ‘Change the System, not the Climate'.

60,60,FF-2016-000062-IDN,How can hospitals possibly prepare for disasters? With practice and planning - The Conversation US,https://theconversation.com/how-can-hospitals-possibly-prepare-for-disasters-with-practice-and-planning-61061,"The tragic shooting in Orlando brought dozens of victims to emergency rooms. Now, several of those people have been admitted and are clinging to life. Many across the nation are praying for them and other victims. Without quick response and high-quality emergency medical care, many more than the 49 already reported may have died.

Emergency room physicians described a scene of horror as wounded patients flooded the nearest hospitals and gurneys lined up in hallways. How do emergency departments deal with such an unpredictable and horrific occurrence?

The truth is that while we may not know the exact nature of a disaster, we do know that catastrophes will happen. There are many examples of the need for metropolitan areas to be prepared to manage large numbers of casualties related to a major incident. In addition to natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes, examples include the marathon bombing in Boston; the recent terror attacks in Paris, San Bernardino and Brussels; and, most recently, the shooting that occurred in Orlando.

The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response was started in response to Hurricane Katrina. The agency assists health care coalitions, which include health care facilities such as hospitals, emergency medical service agencies and local public safety departments to prepare in the management of large-scale events. It specifically aids hospitals to prepare for events that create a surge of patients through the Hospital Preparedness Program. That agency establishes performance goals, and hospitals regularly conduct disaster exercises to enhance their preparedness for managing these types of events.

Emergency departments are expected to respond rapidly. They must effectively and quickly assess who among the wounded needs treatment first, or triage. Hospitals must create surgical capacity in the operating rooms, and bed capacity on the floors to treat patients that require admission.

Emergency departments and hospitals participate in a disaster exercise at least once a year. These exercises help to prepare them for managing the large influx of patients associated with a mass casualty event. These exercises also hone triage skills. Additional staff are called in to treat the wounded. There is a science, called surge modeling, that has developed to guide emergency departments and trauma centers. Surge science takes data from events and analyzes response times and personnel needs so that emergency departments can be optimally staffed.

The key objectives of these plans include efficient distribution of critically injured patients to trauma centers and damage-control surgical principles when applied to mass casualty responses. These principles optimize surge capacity and have the potential to reduce mortality associated with the event. Hospital personnel are trained to create immediate capacity by moving patients and calling in additional assets in order to accommodate and manage a surge of patients. These systematic approaches to surge planning for mass casualty responses take an “all hazards” approach to ensure that the plan is adaptable and scaleable regardless of the type or cause of the event.

Obviously, caring for patients during a major event comes with its own emotional impact on those who provide care. Medical professionals, trained in emergency medical procedures, also train to focus solely on the critical tasks at hand. Make no mistake, however: These events impact the providers. We typically debrief among ourselves to help us process what we have seen, and as a team, we provide each other with emotional support. From a leadership perspective, we also have trained personnel available to help debrief through critical incident debriefing meetings.

Preparation works

REUTERS/Jim Young

Fire, EMS, law enforcement personnel and staff at Orlando Regional Medical Center did an excellent job of caring for the victims injured in the tragic event that occurred on Sunday. The hospital received about four dozen people over a very short period. This surge of patients was triaged, treated, and critically ill patients were sent to the OR rapidly. One doctor described it as a war zone. Their planning and preparedness efforts helped to position those personnel for managing this kind of response. Those efforts highlight the importance of diligent planning and exercise programs. These preparedness activities make communities more resilient and ensure that key personnel are poised to respond appropriately to mass casualty events.

This tragic event will contribute to increased knowledge on preparedness. As time progresses, we will obtain hard data, and we will review this event academically to determine lessons to be learned.

Another important point to remember in catastrophic events is that survivors and even bystanders on a scene are often first responders. In the Orlando shootings, several police officers were pressed into duty to transport shooting victims to hospitals. One reportedly dragged a wounded person out of the Pulse bar and to safety.

It is important for people to know safety strategies that may help them stay out of harm’s way in the event of an active shooting.

Active shooter events are unpredictable, motives are different and warning signs may vary, but there are three things you can do to increase chances of safety and survival: Run, hide, fight.

Run: If a safe path is available, always try to escape or evacuate even if others insist on staying. Don’t linger to gather belongings. Encourage others to leave with you, but don’t let their indecision slow down your own escape. Once out of the line of fire, try to prevent others from unknowingly walking into the danger zone and call 911.

Hide: If you can’t escape, try to hide outside the shooter’s view. If you can’t find a safe room or closet, hide behind large objects that offer protection. Seek a hiding place that doesn’t restrict your options to move. Try to remain quiet and calm. When hiding, turn out lights, lock doors and silence the ringer and vibration mode on cellphones. If a door doesn’t lock, attempt to block it with furniture or other large objects.

Fight: As a last resort, if your life is at risk, working together or alone, act with aggression. Use improvised weapons – for example, a fire extinguisher or chair.

Unfortunately, we live in world where bad things happen. It is important for emergency departments and hospitals to prepare for mass casualty incidents.

63,63,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Germany's first female Euro commentator faces sexist outrage online - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-first-female-euro-commentator-faces-sexist-outrage-online/a-19340658,"Social media users flooded German public broadcaster ZDF's sites after Friday's Italy-Sweden match, not to voice complaints about the game, but to bemoan the broadcaster's female commentator.

Claudia Neumann, a reporter for German public broadcaster ZDF, became the first female play-by-play announcer for this year's men's European Championships in France.

But her role as the match's main commentator enraged numerous soccer fans. Many of whom posted complaints about her ""annoying voice"" while others said women have no place doing sports commentary for men's soccer. One Twitter user wrote: ""Women shouldn't commentate men's soccer. It doesn't fit. Annoying. Period.""

Her Euro 2016 debut was the June 11 match between Wales and Slovakia. Following that first game, users insulted and attacked her with misogynistic slogans about ""the place of women"" and even rape threats.

ZDF 'shocked' by sexist comments

Despite expecting some criticism following the games, the head of ZDF's sports department said he couldn't believe the ""harsh formulation"" of comments that appeared on ZDF social media sites.

""I'm shocked,"" said Dieter Gruschwitz on Saturday to sports news agency SID, calling some of the social media comments ""asocial critique.""

In a post on the broadcaster's Facebook site, ZDF editors said numerous ""offensive"" comments had been deleted.

""If you cannot objectively take part in the discussion, we will block you,"" warned ZDF on Facebook, adding that ""insults are not opinions and will not be tolerated according to our netiquette.""

Stefan Leifert, a ZDF correspondent in Brussels tweeted a screenshot of some of the Facebook comments which included homophobic and sexually explicit remarks.

Neumann: 'I've got thick skin'

The strength of some of the comments prompted an angry reaction from ZDF on Saturday, but a cool reaction from Neumann, herself.

""Hey, people, it's only about football!"" Neumann told SID in an interview, adding that the social media backlash against her ""is all absolutely ridiculous.""

""Most of those people weren't even born when I was already sinking bicycle kicks.""

In 2011, she became the first female sports announcer on German TV for the women's World Cup - women's soccer, as well as men's, had until that point been dominated by male commentators.

When asked how she is coping with the deluge of online criticism following her first two Euro 2016 games, she said she hopes her work will make it easier for more women to break into the ranks of sports commentary.

""If it helps to eventually make it easier for a few younger female colleagues - okay. I can take it,"" Neumann said. ""I've got thick skin.

""I won't let them break my passion and my profession,"" she added.

Fans stand up for Neumann

Many on Twitter and Facebook also praised Neumann's performance during the two Euro matches, including several members of the German media.

One user tweeted that the Italy-Sweden game had ""two good things. 1. The refreshing commentary from Claudia Neumann. 2. The goal from Italy's team.""

Kathrin Steinbichler, an editor for the German newspaper ""Süddeutsche Zeitung"" tweeted: ""By the way, Claudia Neumann is one of the best and most knowledgeable colleagues. (She's) doing a super job at the Euro 2016.""

Another twitter user praised Neumann's voice and called her a ""hero.""

Although Neumann was only slated to make the commentary for the tournament's group rounds, some on social media are campaigning for her to take over the Euro 2016 match final.

The ability to provide commentary during an important soccer game ""is not a question of sex, but a question of competence,"" read an online petition calling for her to commentate on more matches.","Sat, 18 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19340467_6.jpg,"['faces', 'neumann', 'comments', 'social', 'online', 'female', 'german', 'commentator', 'mens', 'germanys', 'outrage', 'sexist', 'zdf', 'women', 'soccer', 'euro', 'media']", ,none

Bill Kayong, 43, was gunned down in his pickup truck while stopped at a traffic light in the small city of Miri in Sarawak state, police said.

Kayong was a member of the opposition PartiKeadilan Rakyat (People's Justice Party) and had run for a Sarawak state assembly seat in elections held on May 7.

Dev Kumar, the head of criminal investigations for Sarawak, which lies along the northern portion of huge Borneo Island, said in a statement that Kayong was ""shot dead by an unknown person using a shotgun.""

He urged the public not to speculate on possible motives for the killing, promising a thorough investigation.

Kayong is a member of one of Sarawak's many indigenous tribes and was active in fighting on behalf of indigenous peoples, especially on land-rights issues, Steve Teo, Keadilan's local youth-wing chief, told AFP.

Teo said he knew of no specific possible motive for the killing.

Sarawak is known for its once-towering rainforests and its powerful rivers.

Tribal groups have for years resisted logging, the expansion of palm-oil estates, and the building of hydroelectric dams that have flooded large areas inhabited for generations by tribespeople.

Tribal activists say their land rights have in many cases been stolen, with the collusion of the state government and well-connected companies.

Malaysia's ruling coalition won a landslide victory in last month's state polls, which the opposition and independent analysts said was marred by blatant government handouts to voters and other ""money politics"", as well as gerrymandering that favoured the coalition.

70,70,FF-2016-000062-IDN,How time-poor scientists inadvertently made it seem like the world was overrun with jellyfish - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/how-time-poor-scientists-inadvertently-made-it-seem-like-the-world-was-overrun-with-jellyfish-61564,"When is a jellyfish plague not (necessarily) a jellyfish plague? When time-poor scientists selectively cite the literature to make it look like the oceans are flooded with jellies – even when it’s far from clear that they really are.

What does scientists being in a rush have to do with jellyfish populations? Let’s start from the beginning.

The identification of patterns and trends in nature happens through the accumulation of consistent observations, published in scientific reports. Once observed, the emerging patterns are usually reported in narrative reviews, which often stimulates a flurry of research activity in that field.

Eventually, the purported patterns are formally tested using “meta-analyses” of the published literature, to either confirm the pattern and establish it as theory, or refute it.

This path from the primary observations to theory can be traced through a network of citations.

Science, however, is done by humans and citation practices are subject to errors of bias and accuracy. Citation practices that are biased in a particular direction have the potential to lead to the identification of false patterns and flawed theory.

Enter the jellies

In the 1990s and 2000s, reports began to appear in the scientific literature of increased jellyfish populations in some parts of the world’s oceans. Various reviews reported the possibility that jellyfish blooms might be increasing globally. Over time, these became increasingly assertive about the existence and extent of the trend, until researchers were asking what to do about the increasingly “gelatinous state” of the oceans worldwide.

The question of whether the global jellyfish boom was real or not was tested by two meta-analyses – which came to opposite conclusions. A 2012 study concluded that populations were increasing globally because they found evidence for increasing populations in 62% of large marine ecosystems tested (although low certainty was assigned to two-thirds of these). The following year, another study found that only 30% of populations were increasing. It concluded that jellyfish populations wax and wane over several decades.

So, in reality, the scientific community is still divided over whether there really has been a sustained global increase in jellyfish numbers.

What about perception?

We wanted to know whether the perception of a global increase in jellyfish blooms was at least partly due to poor citation practices in the scientific literature. Our research, published in Global Ecology and Biogeography, suggests that it was.

Citation practices can be flawed in several ways:

Unsupported citations are when authors cite sources that contain no evidence that could possibly support the author’s claim.

Selective citations happen when a paper is cited to support a claim but contrasting evidence provided in the same paper is ignored, or when authors choose to cite earlier papers that have since been refuted.

Ambiguous citations happen when an author’s sentence contains multiple phrases, but the citations used to support each phrase are clustered at the end of the sentence, preventing readers from telling which is which.

Empty citations are when authors cite a paper that cites another paper as evidence for the claim, rather than the original source (also called “lazy author syndrome”).

We comprehensively searched the literature for papers, published before the two meta-analyses, that issued statements regarding trends in jellyfish populations. We classified each statement according to its affirmation and direction (that is, whether it said jellyfish are “increasing”, “may be increasing”, “decreasing”, or “not sure”), as well as their geographic extent (global, multiple regions, or one region).

We then assessed the papers cited as evidence of the statement, to see whether the citations were accurate or whether they fell into one of the categories of flawed citations outlined above.

A (jelly)fishy tale?

Of 159 papers that had issued statements about trends in jellyfish, 61% claimed that populations were increasing (27% at the global scale and 34% in multiple regions) and 25% asserted that populations may be increasing. Only 10% of papers said the data were equivocal. Just one reported that populations were decreasing (but at a local scale).

Most concerning was that only 51% of papers cited were considered to provide unambiguous support for the statements made by the authors. Almost all statements based on unsupportive citations were those claiming that jellyfish were increasing globally (despite the fact that it would have been impossible to make any claims about global trends before the first global meta-analysis was published in 2012). And in all cases, selective citations were biased towards claims that jellyfish populations were increasing.

Pressure to publish in prestigious journals and win research funds may lead some scientists to make claims that reach beyond the evidence available. In most cases, however, citation errors are not overt attempts to distort the evidence. Rather, they probably arise because increasing academic workloads reduce the time available to evaluate papers accurately and to keep abreast of the almost exponential increase in the volume of literature being published.

As scientists, we need to ensure that our claims are always supported by robust evidence because it is apparent that poor citation practices – and, in particular, selective citation of the literature – can distort perceptions within a research field.","Mon, 27 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/127994/original/image-20160624-30263-1jknmgz.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C35%2C640%2C310&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['papers', 'evidence', 'scientists', 'global', 'timepoor', 'inadvertently', 'jellyfish', 'populations', 'overrun', 'increasing', 'literature', 'citations', 'citation', 'authors', 'world']", ,none

In Thailand, much imported electricity is used for air conditioning in shopping malls. (See Ian Baird, “Rescaling and Reordering Nature–Society Relations: The Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Dam and Laos–Thailand Electricity Networks,” for an analysis of the relationship between hydropower in Laos and air conditioning in Thai shopping malls.)

The Nam Tha, or Tha River, begins in northern Laos near the Lao-China border and runs southwest to join the Mekong just south of Huay Xay on the Lao-Thai border. In October 2014, I traveled by motorcycle and longtail boat up the Nam Tha, starting from its mouth at Pak Tha, to investigate a dam project on the river. Work on the dam’s access roads and other infrastructure had been underway for months, but no signs of construction were visible as I traveled—the banks were thickly forested, interspersed with patches of swidden agriculture, with occasional thatch villages where I stayed along the way.

The Nam Tha dam is being built by a subsidiary of the China Southern Power Grid, and 95 percent of the electricity it generates will be sold to Thailand. Scheduled to be completed in 2017, the dam will displace over 10,000 ethnic Lao and minority peoples, and during my visit the village Ban Hadmuark was being enlarged into a resettlement town for displaced villagers. (For details on the demographic impacts of the dam, see Olivier Evrard’s article “The Silenced River.”)

In February 2016 I returned to the Nam Tha to document the progress of the dam. This time I hitchhiked with a work truck driving in on the 37 kilometer access road from National Highway 3. I was stunned to discover that this stretch of the river had been transformed into a vast industrial plain, razed flat and crowded with cement trucks, lorries, earth movers, turbine parts, and scrap metal.

This photo essay starts with the Nam Tha as I experienced it in 2014, then switches to the way I encountered it in 2016. However, these images don’t convey the sense of violence that struck me when I entered the dam site a year and a half after seeing it in a nearly pristine state—the machinery, noise, ravaged hillsides, and clouds of dust raised up by gravel crushers, seemed limitless, on a scale to dwarf human individuals, communities, and aspiration.

Still, I hope these images serve in a small way to express the experience of peoples who have no voice or agency in the face of changes imposed upon them by international corporate interests and by their own governmental elite. Any form of protest can lead to police abduction and disappearance for Lao nationals in Laos—therefore, along with the advocacy of NGOs like International Rivers, this type of documentation may currently be one of the only means of dissent against hegemonic “development” which uproots and disenfranchises many for the benefit of a privileged, autocratic few.

Junagadh: A team of researchers at Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) in Gujarat have struck gold, quite literally. As per their claims, tests have unveiled the presence of gold in the urine of Gir cows – a phenomenon that the researchers said was only heard of in religious scriptures.

According to a report in Times of India, the urine samples of 400 Gir cows was analysed at the Food Testing Laboratory of JAU and it showed traces of gold. The precious metal was found in ionic form, which is gold salts soluble in water. The gold in the urine can be extracted and solidified using chemical processes, the researchers said.

The team of researchers, working under the head of JAU's biotechnology department Dr B A Golakia, used the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to examine the urine samples.

""Till now, we have heard about presence of gold in cow urine from our ancient scriptures and its medicinal properties. Since there was no detailed scientific analysis to prove this, we decided to undertake a research on cow urine. We analyzed 400 samples of Gir cow urine and found traces of gold,"" said Golakia.

Besides gold, the team also found 5,100 compounds in Gir cow urine that actually have immense medicinal value and can cure several ailments.

Golakia was assisted by other researchers namely Jaimin, Rajesh Vijay and Shraddha. The team will now analyze urine samples of all 39 indigenous cow breeds of India for the same purpose.

Golakia told the newspaper that the research is now being conducted on the use of Gir cow urine on human and plant pathogen. The experiments are being carried out to use it in treatment of human diseases and plant protections.

As part of a resurgence of interest in the Edo era (the name for Tokyo between 1603-1868), we want to suggest that “Edo Japan is Cool!”

Today, the Japanese have an insatiable appetite for all things Edo. This goes deeper than the daily long lines outside the Edo-Tokyo Museum or the very popular historical dramas on TV every Sunday evening.

Azby Brown, author of Just Enough: Lessons in Living Green from Traditional Japan, believes current anxieties about the state of the world are driving interest in the Edo experience.

At the beginning of the Edo period, Brown argues, Japan faced ecological collapse from deforestation, erosion and watershed damage. New conservation practices were introduced in response to this crisis and to promote Satoyama landscapes. This brought about a sustainable interaction between nature and humans.

This is supported by Conrad Totman, author of The Green Archipelago. Totman argues that the Edo government (Bakufu) responded to these ecological threats by introducing new technologies. Complemented by a combination of social and cultural value changes, this led to Edo becoming a sustainable city.

What lessons can growing, developing-country cities learn from Edo?

Edo’s global relevance

With a population of 38 million, modern Tokyo is 13 million people larger than the world’s second-largest city, Delhi. While Tokyo’s population is predicted to decline slightly, Delhi’s is still growing and the two cities will be the same size in the next 15 years.

In 1721, Edo was also the world’s largest metropolis with a population of around one million. The next-largest city was London with 630,000 people.

London’s growth was limited, in part, because it couldn’t efficiently dispose of sewage. This problem wasn’t solved until the invention of Victorian sewerage pipes. Edo dealt with this problem by collecting and disposing of night soil.

The intensity of Edo’s agriculture gave the city a crucial advantage. Rice farming required smaller plots of land than grain or animal husbandry, so it could be closely woven into the fabric of the city. This, in turn, reduced the effort and cost of transporting night soil.

Agriculture also buffered flooding from typhoons, giving the city a clean and stable water supply. As for food, such was the primacy of urban agriculture, fruit and vegetables were named after the Edo suburbs known for producing them.

The first lesson from Edo was therefore to develop and maintain a unique home-grown technological solution to urban life.

In addition, efficiency was central to the Edo economy and daily life. Rather than have a bath in each house, co-operative bathing in a sento became an essential place for socialising, while saving on water and firewood for heating. Clothes were maintained and mended, ceramics repaired. Whole industries were built around recycling and resource recovery.

The people of Edo understood the meaning of a zero-waste society well before the term was invented. Edo teaches us the value of looking carefully at planning solutions that are developed in a particular context. It also shows us that, for cities such as Delhi, West is not necessarily best.

Ethical but not utopian

The second lesson relates to the ethical framework of the citizens of Edo. Their worldview was informed by an ethic of life and interaction.

Brown suggests that the people of Edo understood the “big picture”. They recognised that they needed to run their city, economy and lives within the limits of the natural world. This is something most people struggle with today.

We live as if we are free to ignore ecological limits and planetary boundaries. For most people today, a life lived within limits easily equates to impoverishment and austerity. This constrains our imagination of what it may be like to live in a constrained economy, as in Edo Japan.

Edo was by no means a utopia. It had a rigid class structure of samurai, peasant farmer, artisan, merchant and untouchables. You were born into your position and could not move between classes. The samurai lived in gated communities and the average merchant or artisanal family lived in cramped conditions with few possessions.

Yet, knowing your place in the community extended out to knowing your place in the city and the natural world. This was a key mechanism to help citizens understand the right thing to do and live an ethical life through codes of honour, loyalty and a sense of duty.

While this might jar with our modern values, it raises the question of what rights, if any, we would be willing to give up. And what responsibilities would we be willing to accept for a truly sustainable future?

Brendan Barrett/Edo-Tokyo Museum , Author provided

Edo and the future of Japan

The third and final lesson derives from a dystopian prediction of our ecological predicament.

One of the most forceful advocates for reassessing Edo is the Japanese author Eisuke Ishikawa. In his 1998 book, 2050 is the Edo Period, he argues that Japan is undergoing a “slow crash”.

The book traces the decline of Japan through the memories of an old man in 2050. Society has declined and aged. The economy has stagnated for decades. In 2050, according to Ishikawa, 99% of the population will be living rural lifestyles and the big cities of Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka are derelict.

In the West, this dystopian Japanese vision of the future is paralleled by James Howard Kunstler’s “long emergency” and his engaging novel, World Made by Hand. Kunstler depicts small-town US after the collapse of the global economy and modern society. It is a world where we have to live with less – no electricity, no running water, no health services, no government and so on.

Interestingly, Kunstler writes about Japan in his blog and comments on the nation’s two-decade economic malaise, as the population shrank and its debt climbed. He suggests that all this is “getting to them [the Japanese] in a deep, major way” and “they perhaps secretly long to get back to something like an older traditional Japanese society” – the Edo era.

It would be impossible for Japan to revert to that time, but we can profit vastly from Edo’s experience. In the words of Azby Brown:

The challenge that faces us now is to redesign our production and our consumption so that they share the virtues of their Edo-period counterparts, to link our sophisticated technical systems to the kind of mentality that those prescient forebears displayed.

As the Japanese government promotes a “soft power” campaign of “Cool Japan”, it should embrace a larger and more nuanced view of Edo’s contribution to human progress.","Fri, 17 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/126465/original/image-20160614-18068-tl8i89.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=72%2C0%2C2399%2C1165&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['life', 'japan', 'lessons', 'biggest', 'surviving', 'economy', 'japanese', 'edo', 'past', 'worlds', 'society', 'future', 'offers', 'live', 'city', 'population', 'world']", ,none
77,77,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Nineteen migrants found suffocated in truck at DRC-Zambia border - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/nineteen-migrants-found-suffocated-in-truck-at-drc-zambia-border/a-19340406,"Congolese authorities confirmed on Saturday that they had discovered the bodies of 19 migrants who had asphyxiated in a Zambian-registered truck earlier in the week.

Border guards in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) said they had been alerted by the sickening smell coming from a truck which was revealed to have been carrying some 100 refugees.

The seventy-six living migrants were rescued when the vehicle was stopped on the Zambian border in southeastern Congo on Thursday.

""We stopped this vehicle ... because of the nauseous smell which was coming from the trailer,"" said Jean-Pierre Lubosha, head of the DRC border control. He told the press that the crew had at first claimed to be transporting fish.

""The bodies were handed over to the Zambian authorities on Thursday. We interviewed the survivors who all claimed to be Ethiopian nationals,"" said Lubosha.

There had been some discrepancy about the nationality of the migrants, as Zambia initially claimed they were Somalis.

Ethiopia is currently experiencing its worst drought in 50 years, leaving milions in need of food and water.

Zambia promises to put pressure on trafficking

""We congratulate the Congolese authorities for their vigilance, allowing them to discover this scandalous human trafficking, implicating three Zambian members of the [truck] crew,"" said Zambian vice consul David Nyangulu, who added that an international investigation was underway.

Following the deaths, Zambia promised to step up the fight against human trafficking.

""Our country has very porous borders, but we will put in place measures to ensure cases of human trafficking are curbed,"" Home Affairs Minister Davies Mwila told a local radio station.

Lucknow: A disgusting incident from Lucknow came into light on Sunday when a video of four policemen fighting with each other, allegedly over share of bribe, went viral on social media.

Eyewitnesses said the fight was over division of bribe money that was collected by the policemen from trucks and local vendors of the area.

In the viral video, two policemen are seen throwing blows and jostling with each other in public, while the other two are trying to separate them but failed to do so. The four were later joined by a fifth policeman who also made an attempt to break the fight.

The local police, however, denied the reports of bribe being the reason for the fight.

Senior Superintendent of Lucknow Police Manjil Saini said that the brawl between policeman Vijendra Yadav and the Home Guard was over clearing the traffic jam in Itauja area in the outskirts of Lucknow.

""This is not true at all. Moreover the video is nearly two-three days old,"" Saini commented on the allegations of fighting over share of bribe.

While Virendra Yadav has been suspended, a letter has been written to Homeguard directorate seeking action against the Home Guard, SSP Manjil Saini said.

79,79,FF-2016-000062-IDN,The Fête de la Musique survival guide - CNN Philippines,http://cnnphilippines.com/life/entertainment/music/2016/06/16/fete-de-la-musique-2016.html,"Manila (CNN Philippines Life) — Sudden downpours, long MRT lines, and flash floods are all signals that summer is officially winding down — and subsequently, this also means that music festival season is almost over.

As a last hurrah for the summer, the Alliance Française de Manila is celebrating its annual Fête de la Musique in Manila on June 18 and 23. As in the past years, the lineup is almost as act-heavy as big music festivals like Coachella or Lollapalooza. Festivities start at 4 p.m. at the A-Venue open-parking main stage with the electronic musician BP Valenzuela and the experimental hip-hop/soul musician RH Xanders. Reese Lansangan will open the main stage in the Greenbelt 3 park at 4:30 p.m., and over a hundred acts will be performing at various pocket stages scattered around the Makati area. Admission is free to the festival, featuring performances from local and international musicians under genres that range from bedroom beats and Xperimental to grunge and electronica.

Fête has always been the perfect opportunity to discover new music, which can make it tempting to go to all the stages. Though the venues do seem theoretically close to each other, having to go back and forth to catch your favorite bands could be tiring and pricey. With that in mind, CNN Philippines Life has come up with a solution to help you make the most of this year’s Fête: a nifty little guide featuring festival essentials, a list of the stages that are close to each other, and quick tips.

Prep the essentials

Sure, Makati is dotted with 7-Elevens around every corner, but it doesn’t hurt to over-prepare maybe just a little. For Fête, it would be best to pack a light bag, dress comfortably, and do away with whatever you don’t think you’ll actually end up using for the day. Keep it practical: Bring your phone, a power bank (or even just your charger, because you never know where there could be plugs), tissues or wipes, hand sanitizer, an umbrella, and maybe a change of clothes. You can also opt to bring water and snacks, and even a book or something else to pass the time with in case you find yourself in the middle of a long wait. Bring emergency cash and spare change for commuting.

Make a checklist for artists and stages you want to see, and pay attention to schedules and venues, and how far apart they are. (More on that below.) Research routes for commutes to save cash on cab rides. If you’re bringing friends — definitely advisable for the festival! — write down their numbers just in case. A legal ID might also be wise to keep with you, as some places may want to check for them.

Game plan

There are 21 pocket stages situated around the Makati area. The diverse lineup features everyone from Pupil to up-and-coming indie bands like Oh, Flamingo! In the list below, grouped are the stages that are close to each other.

Jazz Stage at Sage Bar, Shangri-La Makati*

Bedroom Beats Stage at The Belle & Dragon*, starts at 4 p.m.

Acoustic Stage at A Space

Hiphop Stage at M Cafe*

Blues-Soul-Funk Stage at H&J Sports Bar and Restaurant*

Blues Rock Stage at Le Cafe Curieux*

Eclectic and Art Stage at Lokal Hostel

Evolution of RnB Stage at Z Hostel

Mod Stage at Alchemy Bistro Bar*

Xperimental/Folk Stage at Pineapple Lab

Reggae Stage at B-Side, The Collective

Punk Stage at Mang Rudy’s Tuna Grill and Papaitan*

Grunge Stage at Aloha Bar & Grill, The Collective*

World Stage at The Cabin Bar & Bistro*

Electronica Stage at Time

Fusion Stage at Century City Mall (4th Floor)

Rock Stage at Green Sun (The Eye)

Indie stage at Green Sun (Axon)

Food will be sold at the SOMA Bistro

Stages that are outliers are: F*K Stage at Finders Keepers*; House Party Stage at Black Market, which starts at 10 p.m.; and Open Mic & Spoken Word Stage at Acceler8.

*Marked places serve food.

Here’s a map to illustrate which places are closest to one another.

Make the most of it

Fête de la Musique is a free event, but that doesn’t mean you can take it for granted. It brings together hundreds of artists from all over the world to celebrate music, even if they’re not well-known or they seem out of the ordinary, playing music that doesn’t cater to certain tastes.

There are three rules of thumb, then, to make sure you get the best that the festival has to offer: Go out of your comfort zone, check out at least one new band or type of music that you’ve never heard before, and don’t just stay in one place. Going back and forth to catch certain acts and sets may be tiring, but you just never know what you’ll miss. Plus, it’s the weekend — for just a few hours, it wouldn’t hurt to pretend that you’ve got all the time in the world.

80,80,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Dutch prototype clean-up boom brings Pacific plastics solution a step closer - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/22/dutch-prototype-clean-up-boom-brings-pacific-plastics-solution-a-step-closer,"A bid to clear the Pacific of its plastic debris has moved a step closer with the launch of the biggest prototype clean-up boom yet by the Dutch environment minister at a port in The Hague.

On Thursday the 100 metre-long barrier will be towed 12 miles (20km) out to sea for a year of sensor-monitored tests, before being scaled up for real-life trials off the Japanese coast at the end of next year.

If all goes well, full-scale deployment of a 100km-long version will take place in the “great Pacific garbage patch” between California and Hawaii in 2020.

The Dutch environment minister, Sharon Dijksma, told the Guardian that her government, which part-funded the test, was fully backing the project, which will eventually cost about £230m (€300m).

“We can use our political pressure with other governments, businesses and the international institutions to fund this on an even bigger scale,” she said. “We are used to fronting public-private [partnerships] like this. It is not new for us. When it is a success, philanthropists will be standing in line asking to join us.”

The snake-like ocean barrier is made out of vulcanised rubber and works by harnessing sea currents to passively funnel floating rubbish – often just millimetres wide – into a cone.

A cable sub-system will anchor the structure at depths of up to 4,500 metres – almost twice as far down as has even been done before – keeping it in place so it can trap the rubbish for periodic collection by boats.

A fully scaled-up barrier would be the most ambitious ocean-cleansing project yet, capturing about half of the plastic soup that circles the north Pacific gyre – one of several large systems of rotating ocean currents – within a decade. That at least is the plan.

The largely crowd-funded project has caught the imagination of a new generation in the Netherlands. In no small part this is down to the unaffected charisma of its 21-year-old founder, Boyan Slat, a student dropout who has become an environmental entrepreneur.

“The key objective of these tests is to see if we can build something that can survive at sea for years if not decades,” he said. “We want to test the efficiency of the system, understand its behaviour, and see what damage it suffers over time from abrasion or fatigue.”

After promising tests at the Marin research institute in Wageningen earlier this year, the prototype was developed with a renowned dredging and marine contractor, Royal Boskalis Westminster. Peter Berdowski, the firm’s CEO, described it as “a wonderful concept” and “very inspiring”.

The Dutch government is so convinced of its feasibility that it is taking Slat to Indonesia in November, as part of a high-level climate and trade mission, led by the prime minister, Mark Rutte.

Discussions are likely to focus on the possibility of attaching the barrier to the mouths of rivers as a way of staunching the 800 tonnes of plastic that flow into the Pacific and Indian oceans every year.

Dijksma said: “We will try to see if there is a possibility to put this project in place with the Indonesian government too. We have not done the deal yet. But the fact that Boyan will be in the delegation is important because we only take people with us when we think they offer solutions that could be interesting for other governments.”

With up to 29.1 items of rubbish per square metre, the Indonesian archipelago has the world’s second-highest concentration of shoreline marine debris after Sicily, which has 231 items per square metre.

In 2014, 311m tonnes of plastic were produced around the world, a 20-fold increase since 1964. It is expected to quadruple again by mid-century.

A report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation earlier this year predicted that there would be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050 unless urgent action was taken.","Wed, 22 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f6e8ea9c1dc044b6680f77dbb97a9d7c53e105d/133_0_3600_2160/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1d2dee4d5d697fe2ee3363bbec60df4f,"['solution', 'plastics', 'closer', 'boom', 'minister', 'prototype', 'cleanup', 'pacific', 'place', 'project', 'barrier', 'sea', 'tests', 'rubbish', 'plastic', 'brings', 'step', 'dutch']", ,none
81,81,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Breaking Asia's data drought - Times of Oman,https://timesofoman.com/article/11547-breaking-asias-data-drought,"By: Times News Service

Many parts of Asia have been gripped by searing temperatures and the worst drought in decades. Millions of people face shortages of food or water, leading to the loss of lives, livelihoods, crops, and livestock. As water shortages depress productivity, reduce energy output at hydro plants, and cut food exports, economies are suffering.

To find relief, we must look to the skies – but not in the way one might expect. While rainfall would obviously be welcome, there is a tool for coping with extreme weather over which we actually have some control: satellites.

The extreme weather confronting Asia is not expected to abate anytime soon. The current drought can be blamed partly on an unusually strong El Niño that has been warming the Pacific Ocean since mid-2015. More and stronger El Niños are expected this century, reflecting the impact of climate change. This will aggravate Asia’s already serious water problem, which is becoming particularly serious in cities, owing to rapid urbanization. The region’s urban population is set to double, to 3.2 billion people, by 2050, by which time nearly three-quarters of its total population could face water stress. Controlling these forces may seem impossible. But preventing further water shortages is not. What is needed now is bold action to improve our understanding of the nature and scale of Asia’s water crisis, thereby strengthening our capacity to respond to it.

A lack of data about, say, riparian flows, including how much water is diverted for agriculture and human consumption, undermines efficient resource management. Likewise, the absence of detailed rainfall records, particularly in remote areas, impedes efforts to assess flood and drought risk. Accurate data are also needed to design the right irrigation systems, dams, and embankments – not to mention building them where they will have the greatest impact in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change.

Missing data frustrate sound policymaking in myriad ways. Though agriculture consumes about 80 per cent of freshwater stocks in Asia, most countries cannot correctly measure how much water is used to grow a crop, and how much of that water is re-used downstream. Greater clarity about how much water enters and leaves catchments, and for what purposes, would enable smarter policies, just as savvy investors rely on good financial accounting. As some water-scarce countries, such as Australia, have already shown, such accounting helps countries to allocate water more efficiently among agriculture and energy producers and urban consumers.

Here is where satellite technology comes in. Regular sweeps over cropped areas using remote sensing – something like a full-body health scan – can quickly gather information on rainfall, land temperature, and even groundwater levels that would otherwise take months to obtain. When combined with physical measurements on the ground, these data can help governments gain a better accounting of water resources, prepare for droughts and floods, and plan future water use.

Already, the Water Accounting Plus software system – developed by UNESCO-IHE, the International Water Management Institute, and the Food and Agriculture Organization – uses open-access remote-sensing data to assess land use, rainfall, and temperature. The data enable the system to determine how much water is available in a river basin, how much is being used for various purposes, and how water use has changed over time.

With such information, countries like Cambodia and Vietnam can confront the surge in water demand they face. To help propel them toward that goal, UNESCO-IHE, with support from the Asian Development Bank, has been working with their governments – as well as the authorities in India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan – to create a pilot programme to answer key questions about land and water use.

More such initiatives are needed – and quickly. One area of focus must be agriculture. In Vietnam’s parched central highlands and coastal provinces, for example, there is an urgent need to harvest “more crop per drop” and improve emergency responses. If satellite technology is fully exploited, farmers could receive real-time information on their mobile phones about how much water to use and when. Moreover, the region’s most productive farmers could be identified and encouraged to share their best practices with other farmers.

Another key step will be to map water stocks and usage across entire countries, and to make this information available online. Rather than allowing vital data to gather dust, as has occurred in the past, we must augment it, update it, and share it widely, so that it can be put to use.

Breaking the data drought will not by itself end Asia’s water crisis. But it is a crucial first step to ensure that the region’s destiny is not dictated by its weather. - Project Syndicate","Sun, 19 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://shabiba.eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/2016/06/19/436067.jpg,"['asias', 'shortages', 'agriculture', 'data', 'rainfall', 'accounting', 'information', 'countries', 'weather', 'drought', 'breaking', 'water']", ,flood_and_drought
82,82,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Persian Rugs: Still Priceless or a Magic Carpet Ride to Nowhere? - ThinkAdvisor,https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/06/20/persian-rugs-still-priceless-or-a-magic-carpet-ride-to-nowhere/,"For centuries the rich beauty of Persian rugs has been desired by collectors, decorators and individuals. The deep colors, natural fibers, ornate and intricate designs and famous loop weave all make the Persian rug that rare collectible: an item that’s at once usable and a piece of art.

Although other countries such as India, Nepal and Turkey, have recently stepped in to fill the gap — some even able to match the Persian beauty — none seem to provide that something which is magical and mysterious in the works from old Persia.

In 2010, Christie’s sold the Comtesse De Behague Kirma Vase Carpet from Southeast Persia, circa mid-17th century, for £6.2 million (approximately $8.8 million). Although there have been many Christie’s sales since, no Persian rug sale has matched that price, even a recent one of an almost identical rug. And as dealers and auction houses know, the market is fickle, narrow and cyclical.

“Lifting the embargo is something we anticipated for a long time,” says Oscar Tatosian, owner of Oscar Isberian Rugs, a store started in 1920 in Evanston, Illinois, by his grandfather (today they also have stores in Chicago and Highland Park, Ill.).

“It’s exciting because it offers a range of both antique and newly woven, highest quality Iranian carpets. “ It’s also a relief for Tatosian who says he was “teased” when attending auctions in Europe in the last several years “because we could look at the Persian carpets and admire them, but we couldn’t bring them into the U.S.”

So has that pent-up demand for Persian rugs led to a flooded market?

Not really, at least not yet. Elisabeth Parker, Christie’s International Head of Rugs and Carpets, says it’s still a bit early to know the impact of the end of the embargo. Christie’s did have an auction of Persian rugs in April 2016 which did better than previous sales, but that may have been because it included three Persian carpets with a Rothschild provenance.

“It’s a great story,” she says. “Three 17th century or earlier Persian carpets, virtually unknown, had been in the attic in one of the Rothschild’s homes. They didn’t know what they had. It was a perfect storm of great condition and beautiful pieces.”

One rug was complete and sold for $1.368 million, another one was a fragment, cut down from its original size and sold for £794,500 (approximately $1.128 million) while the final was a fragment, and sold for £542,500 (approximately $773,350). Some people just collect fragments.","Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.thinkadvisor.com/media/master-template/social-share-logos/social-share-ta-716x372.png,"['carpets', 'know', 'approximately', 'rugs', 'tatosian', 'ride', 'carpet', 'rug', 'sold', 'priceless', 'magic', 'persian', 'million', 'christies']", ,none

By Anote Tong

Climate change poses the most significant moral challenge to the global community and an existential threat to the future of many communities worldwide.

With the projected rise in sea levels by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of up to one metre within the century, the most vulnerable coastal communities and low-lying island states — several of which are in Pacific — face the real possibility of their islands and communities being submerged well within the next hundred years.

Recent events and the experience of the most vulnerable island communities clearly indicate that climate change is already seriously affecting the low-lying island communities in the Pacific.

Cyclone Pam, which hit and seriously damaged the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu in March of 2014, also veered north on a path never previously witnessed to hit the islands of Tuvalu and the southern island of the Gilbert Island Group of Kiribati.

Kiribati is on the Equator and was previously not prone to cyclone events, being in a region regarded as free from cyclones.

This unprecedented event clearly indicates that the weather patterns in this region are being altered and suggests that sea level rise may not be the most immediate threat to the security of these highly vulnerable island countries, but rather more highly energized and more frequent storms.

Cyclone Winston, which hit Fiji early in 2016, was categorized as the most severe storm ever recorded in the southern hemisphere.

These cataclysmic events, together with ongoing and increasing severity of coastal erosion and periodic flooding, have now rendered what were once viable communities uninhabitable.

Sea water has intruded into the underwater aquifers (a source of potable water and a lifeline for these communities), causing contamination to water supplies and damage to food crops.

On the southern island of the Gilbert Island Group, some villagers have now relocated to other parts of the island and several more will have to do the same well within the next decade.

However, these atoll islands are on average no more than two meters above sea level. Therefore, the ability and the options for relocation on the islands are limited.

Against this background and against the projected increasing severity of climate change impacts, the future of these communities and their capacity to continue as viable communities on their home islands is also severely limited.

Unless significant resources are to be made available from the developed world to build capacity to withstand the increasing severity of climate change impacts, a community’s ability to adapt and to remain in its homelands would not be an option.

In an attempt to provide themselves with any measure of an option against the relentless onslaught of climate change, these most vulnerable countries have formed coalitions such as the Climate Vulnerable Forum.

The CVF is composed of countries ranging from the highly populous nation of Bangladesh to the small island nations of Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati in the Pacific, and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.

To highlight their extreme vulnerability as atoll island nations, the latter group formed the Coalition of Atoll Island Nations on Climate Change (CANCC), to focus international attention on the reality that their future as sovereign nations is in serious jeopardy.

But in spite of the strong desire and commitment of these countries to be able to continue to remain in their homelands, their ability to adapt and build the resilience required to withstand ongoing and future climate change impacts is entirely dependent on substantial intervention by the international community.

And even then it would be most unlikely that the scale of resources needed to guarantee the security of their entire populations is likely to be forthcoming.

Relocation, no matter how undesirable, must therefore be the brutal reality of the future of atoll island nations, and part of the solution.

Kiribati has advocated that migration with dignity must be part of a climate change adaptation strategy, rather than relocation of its people as climate refugees.

But the reality of what faces member countries of the CANCC in the future also holds true for countries like Bangladesh, where a significant number of their very large population is highly vulnerable and would also need to relocate from their existing communities.

And the moral challenge for the global community, among others, is then: “Are we able to face up to a catastrophe that is of our own creation?”

85,85,FF-2016-000062-IDN,China: New Bank's Projects Should Respect Rights - Human Rights Watch,https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/24/china-new-banks-projects-should-respect-rights,"(New York) – The China-founded Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) should create a robust, independent accountability body to investigate rights abuses linked to its projects, Human Rights Watch said today. The AIIB, established in June 2015, convenes its first annual general meeting in Beijing on June 25-26, 2016. It is set to approve a new round of projects at the meeting.

The AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and Operating Policies note the need to address the bank’s environmental and social impacts and to establish an oversight mechanism to ensure “transparency, openness, independence, and accountability.” The bank’s environmental and social framework emphasizes its aim, through the projects it finances, to encourage respect for human rights. However, the AIIB’s safeguard policies do not require the bank to identify and address human rights risks in the projects it finances, which is necessary for the bank to realize this vision, Human Rights Watch said. Nor has the bank publicly addressed whether it will consult with nongovernmental groups, particularly in countries hostile to independent monitors.



“The AIIB has a chance to get right what other development banks have repeatedly gotten wrong by ensuring that its operations won’t undermine human rights,” said Jessica Evans, senior international financial institutions advocate at Human Rights Watch. “To achieve that, the bank will need to identify and address human rights risks linked to its projects.”



The AIIB, whose first loans have already been announced, intends to fund infrastructure development across Asia. China is its founder and largest shareholder. Other members include Australia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. About a dozen of the bank’s member countries regularly express concerns about China’s human rights record and about abuses linked to economic development projects.



Human Rights Watch research on development banks globally has documented forced evictions, violations of indigenous peoples’ rights, reprisals against critics, and discrimination in the distribution of aid.

Human Rights Watch expressed its concerns about transparency, accountability, and engaging civil society in two letters to the bank’s leadership in August 2015, noting China’s weak track record on transparency and rights-respecting development processes. No replies have been received. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly expressed concerns about the deteriorating human rights environment in China under President Xi Jinping.



“China’s poor record on participation of independent groups and on peaceful criticism means that other bank member countries will need to press the bank to address rights concerns,” Evans said.



The bank has made a commitment to establish an oversight body in line with principles of transparency, openness, independence, and accountability. The body should be able to investigate, report, and recommend remedies for rights abuses linked to its projects, as well as violations of bank safeguard policies. Bank members should ensure that this body’s policies and practices reflects lessons learned by accountability mechanisms at other international financial institutions, including by:

Ensuring it can function independently of pressure from AIIB management and political influence;

Including representatives of nongovernmental groups on the selection committee for members of the mechanism;

Requiring the bank to develop responsive, time-bound plans to respond to rights abuses and findings that it has not complied with its own policies; and

Providing the mechanism with the mandate to monitor and publicly report on whether rights abuses and policy violations have been remedied.

The AIIB should not approve any more projects until its accountability mechanism is up and running, Human Rights Watch said.



“Without strong commitments to respecting human rights in all AIIB activities and a meaningful mechanism to hold the bank to account, this new lender may do more harm than good,” Evans said. “But if all members insist on higher standards, it could raise the bar globally for sustainable, rights-respecting development.”","Fri, 24 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/multimedia_images_2016/aiib_3.jpg,"['banks', 'accountability', 'watch', 'human', 'china', 'rights', 'policies', 'projects', 'bank', 'development', 'aiib', 'respect']", ,none

87,87,FF-2016-000062-IDN,New Taiwan President Travels to Consolidate Diplomatic Ties - Voice of America,https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/new-taiwan-president-travels-consolidate-diplomatic-ties,"TAIPEI - Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen set off Friday for two friendly nations in Latin America, her first overseas trip after a month in office, to lock in ties that could be disrupted by China. She'll also meet officials from a wider group of countries including the United States.

Tsai left Friday for a nine-day trip to Panama and Paraguay at the invitation of both hosts. In Panama she will attend the inauguration ceremony of the Panama Canal expansion project, an event Sunday due to draw heads of state and dignitaries from about 70 countries.

The president faces the risk that China will pull away some of 22 states that Taiwan has diplomatic relations with, including Panama or Paraguay, as her government’s relations with Beijing grow increasingly strained. Taiwan looks to those nations as a voice in the United Nations and for signs of Taiwan’s legal legitimacy.

China and Taiwan bought off each other’s allies in poor parts of the world until former president Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008 and opened talks with Beijing. Tsai, however, disputes Beijing’s “one China” condition for dialogue, so they have not talked since she came aboard May 20. The condition requires that both sides see each other as part of a single country.

China has seen proudly self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory since the civil war of the 1940s, rather than as its own country.

Tsai’s appearance at the Panama Canal ceremony may give her a rare chance to meet U.S. officials who seldom mix with Taiwan leaders, says Alexander Huang, strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. China has diplomatic relations with the U.S. and opposes Washington's official contact with Taiwan, despite staunch informal ties between the two.

“There might be a chance to talk to the secretary of state or the wife of (Vice President) Joe Biden,” Huang says. “It gives an excuse for foreign leaders or dignitaries to shake hands with President Tsai. If she’s not taking this trip and then if something unexpected happens, then people will blame her for not going.”

The president’s trip also includes two transit stopovers in the United States, a sign that Washington believes she won’t damage already fragile U.S.-China ties. U.S. officials cut off her party’s previous president, anti-China firebrand Chen Shui-bian, from transit stops in the continental United States.

Tsai's visits in Latin America also will cement ties with Panama and Paraguay, Taiwan foreign ministry officials say. Like many of that nations that Taipei has diplomatic relations with, it gives them both development aid. Competition for the most aid pitted China against Taiwan over diplomatic allies before 2008. China, with growing economic and diplomatic power, has ties with more than 170 nations.

Tsai is due to meet Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela to discuss proposals to send Taiwan technical staff to help the Panama in agriculture, education and technology. She also is expected to tour a container terminal run by Evergreen Marine, a Taiwan company and the world’s fourth largest shipping line.

In Paraguay, she is scheduled to meet with President Horacio Cartes and speak to the Paraguayan legislature. She also is scheduled to review the progress of joint cooperation projects.

“We hope this first trip as president Tsai can show sincerity in strengthening our relations with diplomatic allies,” foreign ministry Deputy Minister Javier Hou told reporters.","Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://im-media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-04/F82EBBB7-90B6-419F-AA23-6F3EA6578E86.jpg,"['taiwan', 'tsai', 'panama', 'ties', 'consolidate', 'president', 'china', 'diplomatic', 'trip', 'relations', 'united', 'travels']", ,none
88,88,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Hundreds of thousands face hunger in Kenya - Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/hundreds-of-thousands-face-hunger-in-kenya/a-19345933,"More than 600,000 residents from West Pokot County are in urgent need of food aid after the region was hit by drought associated with the ongoing El Nino weather phenomena. The weather has dried up waterholes and rivers leading to widespread crop failure.

The Kenyan government had promised to release 50 million Kenya shillings ($5 million, 4.4 million euros) to be used to purchase food aid. Despite the pledge, the government is yet to release the funds forcing residents to move to other counties in search of food and water.

The drought started in February as many were preparing their farms for the planting season. In some areas there was insufficient rain which could not support vegetation. North and South Pokot are the worst hit areas. The areas have not seen a single drop of rain for months.

Local concerns

Residents have pleaded with the government to intervene. Residents fear for the worst if the government doesn't deliver on its promises. Joseph Korikumul is one of them. He said that the drought has not only affected people but also their animals. ""The people of this area continue to suffer as they can't even get milk and food to eat,"" said Korikumul said, adding that, ""our people are suffering a lot due to starvation.""

Another resident, John Kipkurit, said that his farm has never been productive even after he tilled in preparation for the planting season. ""People had plowed their farms since March, but now everything has dried up. As residents of this area we have a big problem,"" he said.

Hundreds of children in West Pokot are not attending school due to food shortages

In 2011, Kenya faced one of the worst droughts in history of the country which saw the government distribute relief food to more than 1.7 million people in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

Schools affected

At least two primary schools were reported closed in the county due to food shortages. Children have to walk more than 10 kilometers in search of water instead of being in class.

Korikumul said that the students have no food in their homes or at school. ""If news spreads around that there is no food in schools, then the children are not eager to go to school,"" he said.

The deputy governor of West Pokot, Titus Lotee, is calling on the central government to step in and save the lives of the residents in his county. ""The national government had promised to give us funds to avert hunger in this region. Unfortunately we have yet to receive any money,"" Lotee said. Only 4,000 bags of maize have been distributed to those in the most affected areas by the county government, barely enough to feed them for a week.

The UN has warned that about 36 million people across southern and eastern Africa are facing hunger following the unusually strong El Nino rains coupled with record-high temperatures afterwards.","Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://static.dw.com/image/19050335_6.jpg,"['thousands', 'hunger', 'face', 'county', 'areas', 'worst', 'school', 'kenya', 'residents', 'west', 'pokot', 'hundreds', 'food', 'drought', 'million']", ,drought

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) set a new record with the launch of 20 satellites in 26 minutes on June 22, 2016.

The space agency of the Indian government, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), successfully launched 20 satellites on the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C34) from Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR in Sriharikota, in Andhra Pradesh (South East) on June 22, 2016.

The satellites include Cartosat-2, two student satellites from Indian universities and 17 satellites from US, Germany, Canada and Indonesia.

The 727.5 kilograms Cartosat-2 series satellite would be used for Earth observation and according to ISRO, the imagery sent by the satellite will be useful for many applications: cartographic ones, urban and rural applications, coastal land use and regulation, utility management, water distribution, creation of land use maps, precision study, changed detection to bring out geographical and manmade features and various other Land Information System (LIS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) applications.

Sathyabamasat and Swayam from India, Lapan-A3 from Indonesia, Dove (12 satellites) and Skysat Gen 2-1 from US, Biros from Germany, M3MSAT and GHGSAT-D from Canada, are the other satellites launched into the orbit.

“With this mission, we have launched the current generation Earth observation satellite along with 17 satellites from foreign countries. Each of these small objects will carry out their own activity, which is independent of the other and each of them will live a wonderful life for a finite period,” A.S. Kiran Kumar, ISRO chairman said.

PSLV’s 35th consecutive successful mission

The total weight of all the 20 satellites carried on PSLV-C34 was 1288 kilograms and this is the 35th consecutive successful mission of PSLV and the 14th in its XL configuration.

Most of the satellites will enter the orbit to observe and measure the Earth’s atmosphere, while one of them aims to provide service for amateur radio operators.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the launch as a monumental accomplishment for the state-run ISRO.

ISRO also used the occasion to test its capabilities to launch multiple satellites into different orbits.

B Jayakumar, the mission director, said that multiple launches in a single mission required complex technology and ISRO is working on resolving certain problems that may arise during such launches.

“Initially we were a little hesitant to take 20 satellites in one go but we soon resolved the problems. What we have achieved shows we have the expertise to take up complex missions,” he said.","Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2pslv-c34takeoff-view2.jpg,"['continues', 'mission', 'space', 'launch', 'satellite', 'isro', 'break', 'land', 'technology', 'satellites', 'india', 'indian', 'barriers', 'launched', '20']", ,none

95,95,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Surfing helps veterans cope with PTSD - The Conversation UK,https://theconversation.com/surfing-helps-veterans-cope-with-ptsd-60472,"Surfing often conjures up images of freewheeling hippies, but now military veterans are turning to the waves to help them deal with the traumatic legacy of war. They say it gives them a wonderful “freeing” feeling, and helps them manage the psychological turmoil of their everyday lives. Our research is among the first to document the positive influence surfing can have for veterans struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

PTSD is a debilitating psychological condition that some veterans experience in the aftermath of combat. The symptoms can include flashbacks, vivid nightmares, traumatic memories, and a profound and enduring sense of sadness. There are other symptoms of PTSD too, including hyper-vigilance (such as scanning rooftops for concealed snipers) and hyper-arousal (the classic example of jumping when a car back-fires).

You could be forgiven for believing that all soldiers inevitably come home from war damaged by their experiences, and that a “tidal wave” of PTSD cases are flooding out of the military. But research from Kings College London suggests that the rate of combat veterans being diagnosed with PTSD is around 7%.

Moving meditation

So how could surfing help? In our research we asked British war veterans about their experiences. Their stories – collected over a series of in-depth interviews and observations – reveal the strong emotional benefits that surfing brings. According to the veterans, surfing is like having PTSD “pummelled out” of their system by the force of the waves.

The mental state veterans report when surfing has many parallels with what psychologists call “flow”, where a person becomes fully and completely involved in an activity to the exclusion of everything else. Their minds are emptied of the traumatic memories that continually cycle through them. They become immersed in the activity, much like a moving form of mindfulness or meditation.

When surfing, veterans are rooted in the present moment and experience it with a renewed sense of intensity and pleasure. There’s also a connection with nature that helps to bolster veterans’ sense of mental well-being. When surfing, veterans are immersed in the natural environment, which has mental health benefits according to a growing body of research. As studies conducted with veterans in California suggest, it also helps build resilience, and alleviates the troubling symptoms associated with PTSD and depression.

But surfing is not the only complementary therapy being proposed for veterans suffering from PTSD. A wide range of activities are now being tested. These are often provided by charities and include horse therapy, gardening therapy, fly-fishing, sailing, drama therapy and yoga.

The UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends psychological therapies, including trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitisation and reprogramming. Antidepressants are also recommended for those who don’t want, or don’t respond to talking therapies. Although these treatments help some veterans, they don’t work for everyone. That’s why it’s important that different forms of treatment and support for veterans experiencing PTSD can be shown to be effective.

Indeed, at a time when military charities are coming under increasing pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed solutions to veterans’ mental health, identifying the impact that new approaches have, and the reasons behind such impact, is crucial.

One priority for research in this area now is to understand how innovative approaches like surfing can work alongside clinical approaches to benefit the mental health of veterans struggling to adapt in the aftermath of trauma.","Wed, 15 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.theconversation.com/files/125543/original/image-20160607-15031-1j3ge8l.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C68%2C1000%2C485&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,"['research', 'ptsd', 'helps', 'traumatic', 'veterans', 'cope', 'therapy', 'health', 'symptoms', 'surfing', 'mental', 'war']", ,none

97,97,FF-2016-000062-IDN,Why Lightning Disproportionately Kills the Poor - The Atlantic,https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2016/06/lightning-deaths-india/488261/,"Seventy-nine people died this week in lightning strikes in India. Most of the dead lived in rural areas, and many were farmers. It’s the rainy season and storms are frequent this time of year. It might seem like an astonishing number in such a short time, but Indian government statistics point out that 2,000 people are killed by lightning strikes each year.

India’s population is about four times larger than that of the U.S., but about 2 people in 1 million die from lightning strikes in India; in the U.S., that figure is 0.3 per million.

The discrepancy holds for Europe, where lightning kills a tiny fraction of the population each year, about 0.2 people for every 1 million. Then there are parts of Asia and Africa, where lighting deaths can be 100 times higher. In Zimbabwe it’s around 20 per 1 million. In Malawi it’s 84 people per million. While lightning may seem to strike and kill at random, it’s mostly a problem of the poor.

As my colleague Rebecca J. Rosen has pointed out, the U.S. is a good example of how a country has gone from a relatively high rate of lightning deaths, to one of the lowest. One reason often pointed to is the move from farm to city. In 1900 about 60 percent of Americans lived in rural areas; by 2000 about 20 percent did. In step with that, lightning deaths decreased. This correlation is sometimes regarded as the cause of the decrease––and rural areas certainly are more dangerous when it comes to strikes––but in 100 years the U.S. population has jumped from 63 million to 323 million. There are more people everywhere, even in rural parts.

Why then are people not fried by bolts in increasing numbers? The answer, in part, is plumbing and tractors.

In the 1890s, lightning most commonly killed people asleep on their beds inside their homes. That doesn’t happen anymore. By now, if lightning strikes a home there’s enough wiring and plumbing for the electricity to ground out. In the 1920s, only 1 percent of homes in the U.S. had electricity and plumbing. By the 1930s, the U.S. had developed codes regulating both, and as more buildings followed those regulations they became safer. Since the 1950s, nearly all homes in the U.S. have both electricity and plumbing, and consequently, Ronald Holle, a meteorologist with Vaisala, the world’s largest manufacturer of meteorological equipment, told me lightning deaths inside homes in the U.S. have become nonexistent. In the past 20 years, he said not one person in the U.S. (excluding the elderly or disabled who were caught in fires started by lightning) has died from a lightning bolt that hit a home. But in poor areas of the world, homes may not have all those wires and pipes that help divert electrical shock. Those homes often have a thin roof made of corrugated metal. And if lightning hits that, the bolt can jump to the nearest person.

The other place lightning often struck people in the 1890s in America was in the fields. One hundred years ago, 25 percent of lightning deaths in the U.S. were people working agricultural jobs. And that’s who died in India this week.

Every year Indian farmers make up a large portion of the 2,500 people killed by lightning in the country. A recent report by Holle, the meteorologist, looked at 969 lightning deaths in at least 10 Asian countries and found most farmers died working in rice paddy fields, which are often huge tracts of flat and flooded land. Holle wrote that what famers desperately need in these areas is someplace close to shelter: “Fully enclosed metal-topped vehicles can provide such a lightning-safe location but they may not be available nearby when needed … ”

An Indian farmer named Lal Babu Usvaha told The Guardian that “work is work. We can’t stop because of the weather. We have to keep working in the fields. But we feel scared when we see so many clouds, so much electricity in the sky.”

India has adopted newer farming technologies, but as the man who spoke with The Guardian points out, many poor farmers still use preindustrial methods to work the field. This was the same issue the U.S. had 100 years ago, and that began to change with the advent of the tractor.

Tractors used today in big U.S. agricultural operations are fully enclosed, making them as safe as a car during a storm. Tractors also reduced the number of people needed to raise and pick crops (see The Grapes of Wrath).

“The amount of time it takes to work a field has changed,” Holle told me. “Back then it might have taken you all day to do a small plot of land. Now it can be done in a few hours. ​​​​​​”

That’s another major factor: In developed countries, people work outdoors less, and so are at less risk of being caught in a storm and killed. Nowadays in the U.S., lightning almost exclusively kills athletes and outdoor-leisure enthusiasts––fisherman the most, then beach goers, then campers. For sports, it’s soccer players.

Other technologies, like the advent of CPR, have helped reduce lightning deaths. And another big factor has been information about lightning. John Jensenius, the National Weather Service’s lightning specialist, told me that the number of lightning deaths now are half what they were 15 years ago. Jensenius partly attributed this reduction to Lightning Awareness Week, which started around 15 years ago. Its credo: “When lightning roars, go indoors!”

But in poorer countries, it might not help even if they followed that motto. In some parts of Africa, lightning strikes that hit schools kill hundreds of children each year.

“It’s gotten to the point where some parents have said, ‘I’m not sending my kids to school because that’s where they get killed,’” Holle said.

The numbers are bit of a rough estimate, because not all countries keep the data, but each year lightning kills about 24,000 people. And while the strikes themselves may be random, the victims are almost exclusively poor.","Thu, 23 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_T3pyyJrcAI2M3aLiDd-d_3lRKk=/0x142:2258x1318/960x500/media/img/mt/2016/06/AP_100928134178/original.jpg,"['lightning', 'areas', 'deaths', 'kills', 'killed', 'disproportionately', 'strikes', 'holle', 'told', 'work', 'poor', 'million', 'homes']", ,none
