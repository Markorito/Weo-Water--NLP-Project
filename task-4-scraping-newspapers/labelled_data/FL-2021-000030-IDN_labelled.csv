More than two dozen others were still missing.

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills onto dozens of homes in Lamenele village shortly after midnight on Adonara island in East Nusa Tenggara province. Rescuers recovered 35 bodies and at least five injured, said Lenny Ola, who heads the local disaster agency.

Flash flooding killed at least six people elsewhere, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Relief efforts were hampered by power cuts, blocked roads covered in thick mud and debris as well as the remoteness of the area surrounded by choppy seas and high waves, said the agency's spokesperson, Raditya Jati.

Seasonal downpours cause frequent landslides and floods, killing dozens each year in Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.

Indonesia's disaster agency lowered the death toll late Sunday to 41 — down from 44 — after search and rescue team reverified victims’ data. At least 27 people were still missing.

The bodies of three people were recovered after being swept away by floods in Oyang Bayang village, where 40 houses were also destroyed, Ola said. Hundreds of people fled submerged homes, some of which were carried off by the floodwaters.

In another village, Waiburak, three people were killed and seven remained missing when overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks, sending muddy water into large areas of East Flores district, Ola said. Four injured people were being treated at a local health clinic.

Hundreds of people were still involved in the rescue efforts as of late Sunday, Jati told a press conference. At least six villages have been affected by flash floods and a landslide that cut five bridges on the island, he said.

Photos released by the agency showed rescuers and police and military personnel taking residents to shelters.

Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas, Jati said. Severe flooding also has been reported in Bima, a town in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, forcing nearly 10,000 people to flee.

In January, 40 people died in two landslides in West Java province.","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_13/3462107/210404-flood-indonesia-jm-1440.jpg","['landslides', '41', 'disaster', 'killed', 'missing', 'indonesia', 'flash', 'dozens', 'village', 'ola', 'province', 'agency', 'floods']",flood

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) reported that 46,772 families which consisted of 176,157 people were affected, and 31,396 survivors were evacuated from their homes. It was reported on February 22nd that two people were missing and there were five casualties in this disaster. Days after the initial rain, several areas were still flood-stricken, where the water levels reached up to 10-260 cm in Karawang and up to 40-250 centimetres (cm) in Bekasi.

Yayasan Plan International Indonesia (Plan Indonesia) took swift mitigation measures. Alongside the national disaster cluster, BNPB, and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management (AHA Centre), Plan Indonesia monitored the situation closely and allocated the needed assistance for the flood survivors.

Following the Rapid Need Assessment that was conducted from February 22nd -23rd, Plan Indonesia worked to fill the gap of aid for the flood survivors. The efforts were focused on those who lived in Bekasi and Karawang regencies, the two areas that remained flood-stricken even after days of the initial rain.

During the span of this emergency response period (24 February-10 March 2021), Plan Indonesia has managed to distribute a set of emergency shelter tool kit (tarpaulins, blankets, mats, ropes) as well as family hygiene kit (bucket, toiletries, diapers, sanitary pads, sarong, baby clothes, and detergent). The aid was distributed to 2,700 families or 8,244 beneficiaries in Bekasi and Karawang regencies, with the following details:

5,173 adults (2,613 men, 2,560 women) 1,484 children (743 boys, 741 girls) 187 babies (76 boys, 111 girls) 717 infants (321 boys, 396 girls) 663 elderly people (339 men, 324 women)

This emergency response is part of Plan Indonesia’s Humanitarian & Resilience Program, which serves as one of the organization’s main pillar activities. Plan Indonesia has been consistently carrying out emergency responses to help affected survivors, in partnership with local government agencies and other relevant parties. The activity is typically carried out during a natural disaster, such as when an earthquake, tsunami, or floods occurs. It is also carried out when other types of disaster, such as the COVID-19 pandemic happen.

As an organization that strives for the fulfilment of child rights and equality for girls, Plan Indonesia prioritizes the needs and protection of children and their families in every emergency response. Especially, as children, women, and people with disabilities become more susceptible to threats in a situation that forces them to evacuate.","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/styles/attachment-large/public/resources-pdf-previews/1561805-Plan%20Indonesia%20-%20Emergency%20Flood%20Response%20Short%20Report%20%28Infographic%29%20%281%29.png?itok=BC1Upbjo,"['families', 'girls', 'response', 'disaster', 'karawang', 'indonesia', 'jakarta', 'greater', 'provides', 'flood', 'emergency', 'survivors', 'area', 'days', 'plan']",flood

WIDESPREAD: Floods killed an additional two people in the province of West Nusa Tenggara, while overflowing dams engulfed nearly 10,000 residences

AFP, JAKARTA





At least 44 people were killed after flash floods and landslides swept an island in Indonesia’s easternmost province yesterday morning, rescue officials said, adding that they expected the toll to rise.

“There are 44 people dead, with nine injured” in East Flores Regency and “many ... are still under the mud,” Indonesian National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati told reporters.

Hours before people woke to celebrate Easter Sunday, torrential rain unleashed flash floods in the Catholic-majority Flores Island.

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed.

Rescuers were struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores because of rains and strong waves.

The death toll rose from 23 earlier announced by authorities.

The number of injured is also expected to increase as the agency is still receiving reports from locals, Jati said.

“We are still documenting the total number of people injured,” the spokesperson said, adding that extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week.

Separately yesterday, major floods also killed two people in Bima city in the neighboring province of West Nusa Tenggara, the disaster agency said.

Dams in four subdistricts also overflowed, submerging nearly 10,000 houses in Bima following a nine-hour downpour, Jati said.

Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season.

In January, flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.

In September last year, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo, while a few months earlier dozens died in a similar disaster in Sulawesi.

Deforestation is often a cause of the landslides, environmentalists have said.

The country’s disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians — nearly half of the country’s population — live in areas at risk of landslides.","Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2021/04/05/P01-210405-321.jpg,"['kill', 'landslides', 'grow', 'toll', 'expected', 'disaster', 'killed', 'flash', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', '44', 'yesterday', 'agency', 'floods', 'west']",flood
4,4,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Act now to protect Indonesia's sinking cities from climate change - Thomson Reuters Foundation,https://news.trust.org/item/20210329163742-dj8lq/,"* Any views expressed in this opinion piece are those of the author and not of Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Heavy groundwater extraction, compounded by worsening floods as the climate warms, raises the prospect of lost land and forced relocation

Last month the Indonesian city of Pekalongan trended in the global media when severe river flooding caused a leak from a textile factory, turning the water a surreal blood red.

Bizarre scenes followed as children and people on motorbikes waded through the crimson waters, like a scene from an apocalyptic horror movie.

Had it not been for the arresting images, this would have been ‘just another’ under-reported local flooding event. But for the people in the area the reality is much starker, more chilling and potentially devastating.

This is because Pekalongan City and Regency, home to 1.2 million people, is sinking; just like the much larger metropolis to the west, Jakarta the capital of Indonesia.

As a result, the Indonesian government is faced with tough choices and in the case of Jakarta has plans to move the capital to the less populated island of Borneo at the cost of tens of billions.

Sinking cities, relocating millions of people and essential infrastructure. These are drastic measures, and at Mercy Corps we’re concerned with what’s causing them to sink.

In Pekalongan at least, excessive ground water extraction has led to rapid land subsidence. We know from our own research that land subsidence is occurring due to poor coastal management planning. The lack of clean water services is driving over-extraction of groundwater by communities and businesses.

The rapid and significant rate of subsidence has led to some areas of the Northern Java coast becoming water basins, with the land below sea level. In turn this has led to chronic and sometimes irreversible impacts of flooding, such as land permanently swamped with water.

Combine this with more intense weather-related hazards like flooding fuelled by the climate emergency and the prospect is permanently lost land as well as ruined lives and livelihoods.

In fact, since 2011, nearly 700 hectares of land in Pekalongan City and Regency previously used for farming and aquaculture is now permanently inundated. And as we reveal, by 2035, 90% of the city will be covered by water.

As land is lost, demand for fresh drinking water and food will increase, not least because the local population is growing by about 1% a year.

Villages in Pekalongan Regency have already been partially lost, too.

In one village called Semut, a total of 15 hectares is water-covered due to tidal flooding. The villagers wrestle daily with tidal floods and during peak season the water reaches 5 metres above sea level, forcing people to evacuate.

As you’d expect, this makes life for these people unbearable. It causes economic and non-economic losses, for example biodiversity, assets, cultural heritage, and health.

STARK CHOICES

Something must be done and we’re acting.

Through the Zurich Flood Resilience Alliance program, Mercy Corps Indonesia works with the Pekalongan City and Regency governments to promote evidence-based policy making and program development.

Together we provide insight into how poorly planned development activities, like groundwater dependence for water supply in downstream areas, exacerbates flood impacts.

We also shed light on how current development practices in the downstream and coastal areas intensify the impact of city flooding.

All of this has serious implications for people’s lives and livelihoods. We expect to see a 100-fold increase in residential areas flooded in Pekalongan City and Regency in the next 15 years.

These alarming predictions leave the Pekalongan governments with some stark choices on how to deal with the loss of productive land and assets.

At a minimum they need a water resource strategy to reduce the rate of land subsidence; as well as plans to limit the impact of destructive water force in downstream and coastal areas and adapt to irreversible losses.

In addition, an environmental health strategy is needed to improve the quality of city-wide sanitation; not to mention social and economic blueprints to coastal communities and the fisheries sector. What’s also needed is a plan to promote better water and disaster management.

The severe flooding and loss of valuable land in Pekalongan should alarm the authorities of other coastal cities globally. They face uncertain and unpredictable futures due to climate change, too.

Assessments like our climate risk and impact analysis can provide evidence for decision-makers to better understand current and future risks. It can enable evidence-based policy and program development that sees climate financing (which is massively under-funded and not invested where it’s needed most, our research revealed) as an investment for sustainable solutions.

Communities face a difficult decision – to transform their livelihoods to continue living in flooded areas, or to relocate. Moving away from homelands with deep cultural and socio-economic ties is not a preferred decision for many. Decisions on who will be relocated, when and how will require evidence, cooperation, and transparency in decision-making and planning.

For communities to adapt to the environment, local officials and national-level governments need to make hard choices about how and where to invest in technology and nature-based solutions to protect people and the environment from more intense and severe flood events.

Will we rise to this challenge before rising sea-levels swallow coastal cities? Only time will tell.

The recent widespread flooding from heavy rainfall which hit the provinces of South and East Kalimantan have caused concern among many, with some environmentalists attributing the disaster to the expansion of oil palm plantations.

What is the actual root of the problem? Is it possible for oil palm growers to participate in environmental conservation to reduce potential flood risks? If so, how?

While acknowledging the devastating consequences of the flooding disaster on communities in the two provinces, as well as other areas across Indonesia, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) says that large-scale land use conversion is one factor that contributes to increasing severity of floods.

“This may include deforestation, destruction of floodplains, and construction of flood dams and drainage channels,” says Tiur Rumondang, RSPO Assurance Director.

Research by the World Resource Institute (WRI) Indonesia has found that the factors most commonly responsible for flooding in Indonesia are tree cover loss, excessive rainfall and topographical conditions.

A separate report by the emergency response team of the National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) indicates excessive rainfall as the major cause of flooding disasters. It also adds that land use conversion in the past decade could be a contributing factor, noting a decline in primary and secondary forests, rice fields and shrub groves in 2010-2020.

“Palm oil produced in an unsustainable way can lead to the widespread destruction of tropical forests,” Tiur asserts, adding that excessive rainfall can affect oil palm production.

“Oil palm trees are capable of withstanding temporary flooding, but waterlogged conditions can damage plantations,” she says.

Tiur explains that the RSPO’s sustainability principles, which all members must adhere to in operating their oil palm plantations, can protect the environment and can also contribute to reducing flood risk.

As enshrined in the 2018 RSPO Principles and Criteria (P&C), multistakeholder non-profit emphasises the importance of “Ecosystem Preservation as a Pillar to establish Co-existence between Palm Oil and Environment”.

The preservation of ecosystems and their essential services is a core tenet of the RSPO P&C 2018 standards, says Tiur.

“These are organised into three impact areas, Prosperity, People, Planet, each with their own set of principles.

“Under Planet, Principle 7 sets out the commitment to protect, conserve and enhance ecosystems and the environment. This means our members are responsible for protecting the environment, conserving biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources,” she explains.

She further elaborates: “It includes criteria around preventing the degradation of soil, using topographic information to guide the planning of drainage and irrigation systems, and ensuring that land clearing does not cause deforestation. All of which are important in mitigating flood risk.”

Since the first P&C was adopted in November 2007, the standards have been reviewed every five years and the latest iteration was adopted in 2018.

Tiur says that RSPO can help to reduce flood risk by addressing the first factor: tree cover loss.

“Under the RSPO P&C 2018, all our members [certified or not] have committed to a total ban on deforestation,” she says. “This prohibits the conversion of tropical rainforests for oil palm plantations and ensures that land clearing doesn’t cause deforestation. This is why we take our responsibility to monitor members’ commitment to the P&C 2018 very seriously.”

The RSPO has worked continuously over the past 10 years to develop a set of standards that ensure the sustainable production of palm oil, she underlines.

According to Tiur, the P&C 2018 includes a total ban on deforestation and requires oil palm growers to protect and conserve High Conservation Value (HCV) areas, High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests and rare, threatened or endangered (RTE) species.

“To ensure the responsible development of new land for oil palm cultivation, we introduced the New Planting Procedure in 2009. This framework was further updated in 2015 to include a set of assessments and verification activities to be conducted by growers and certification bodies before any new oil palm development commences.

“These are designed to ensure that oil palm plantings do not negatively affect primary forests, HCV areas, HCS areas, fragile and marginal soil, or people’s land,” she says.

Strict verification process

Meanwhile, RSPO Indonesia Assurance Manager, Djaka Riksanto explains that palm oil producers members of the RSPO are certified through a strict verification process by accredited certification bodies. Further, he says that “this certification can be withdrawn at any time in case of infringement of the rules and standards”.

According to Djaka, grower members are assessed annually for continued compliance.

“To ensure the credibility of the sustainability claim at the end of the supply chain, all organisations that take legal ownership and physically handle RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil products need to be supply chain certified,” he says.

“For our smallholder members, we have designed the RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard to support [them] towards certification. This seeks to increase the inclusion of smallholders into the RSPO system through a mechanism which takes into consideration the diversity in challenges and situations faced by smallholders,” Djaka adds.

According to Tiur, the RSPO will continue to address the environmental challenges associated with unsustainable palm oil production that require urgent collective action, like flooding.

“Every stakeholder in the palm oil supply chain – from growers to investors to manufacturers to consumers – has a shared responsibility to ensure that palm oil production does not harm our environment or local communities,” she says. “In this respect, RSPO continues to strengthen its commitment to transparency and accountability.”

Djaka adds that since 2013, all RSPO grower members, certified or not, have been required to submit concession maps. However, to respect the decision by the Government of Indonesia that considers such information as Government own legal documents and not to make it public by foreign organisation such as RSPO, we exclude this information from our map platform GeoRSPO. The Government of Indonesia also stated that they are in a process to create a data protocol to allow future transparency and we are still waiting for such further actions.","Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.jakpost.net/c/2021/03/26/2021_03_26_111750_1616764778._large.jpg,"['ensure', 'members', 'pc', 'risk', 'reduce', 'indonesia', 'flood', 'flooding', 'oil', 'rspo', 'land', 'palm', 'plantations']",none

The two suspected bombers both died, according to Indonesian police, and so far no other deaths have been reported. A security guard who tried to stop two suspected bombers from entering the churchyard is among the injured, Indonesian Police Inspector General Argo Yuwono told media.

The suspects used a motorbike and detonated outside the church which was holding Easter Holy Week services when they were stopped from entering the yard.

There has been no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Police say the investigation with the anti-terror unit is ongoing.

Authorities were looking into which networks the bombers came from and if the attack was linked to recent arrests of suspected militants, Reuters news agency reported Yuwono as saying.

Indonesian president Joko Widodo strongly condemned the attack in a video broadcast, describing the attack as as an “act of terrorism.”

“I ask the public to remain calm in carrying out their worship” Widodo said adding, “Terrorism is a crime against humanity and has nothing to do with any religion.

“For the victims who were injured, we pray for immediate healing” Widodo said, adding that a “thorough investigation” has been ordered into the incident.","Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2019/10/kmiz-us-world.png,"['reported', 'investigation', 'outside', 'injured', 'bombers', 'indonesia', 'suicide', 'church', 'catholic', 'indonesian', 'attack', 'suspected', 'yuwono', 'bombing', 'widodo', '14']",none

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - A flood, triggered by incessant heavy rain, has claimed two lives and affected 27,808 people or 9,245 families in 29 villages of Bima District, West Nusa Tenggara Province, hsince Saturday .

""The Bima Disaster Mitigation Office (BPBD) reported that two local residents died in the disaster, and 9,245 families comprising 27,808 people were affected,"" Raditya Jati, the office's spokesman, said on Sunday.

A number of people were displaced by the flooding, he added.

The flooding submerged 294 hectares of farming areas, 25 hectares of ponds, and 9,245 houses. It also damaged 12 of the flood-hit houses, and four bridges.

Downpour fell for around nine hours incessantly on Saturday throughout Bima, causing several dams in four sub-districts to overflow.

The affected sub-districts were Madapangga, Bolo, Woha, and Monta.

The Bima BPBD has coordinated with the authorities in the affected areas to distribute relief aid and deploy personnel to help flood victims.

It has also deployed rubber boats and provided emergency tents for displaced people.

Earlier, the Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) has warned that extreme weather such as heavy rains, strong wind and huge waves were forecast to occur in parts of Indonesia, including West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara Provinces.

Authorities said four bodies were found Sunday in the flood's aftermath.

Nashville received more than 7 inches of rain, the second-highest two-day rainfall total ever recorded, Mayor John Cooper said at a news conference Sunday.

Ebony Northern said a normally tame creek running through her Nashville apartment complex swiftly rose after heavy rain started late Saturday night. Within an hour or so, she could see some first-floor units in other parts of the complex being flooded. She said people moved to the second floor and she also heard calls for boats come in over the fire department scanner.

""The units are a mess. Some of the outside air conditioning units have floated off,"" she said Sunday morning.

She said the American Red Cross arrived to assist her neighbors.

At least one church canceled in-person Palm Sunday services. The New Tribe Church in Mt. Juliet said on Facebook that knee-deep water flooded the building, broke out the glass of its front entrance and sent chairs through a hallway.

""I am smiling but our hearts are devastated,"" Pastor Jarod Smith said at the start of an online service. ""We are standing in our worship center and there's just not enough words to describe what it actually looks like.""

Nashville Fire Chief William Swann said swift-water teams were placed on standby in anticipation of the storms. At least 130 people were rescued from cars, apartments and homes, while about 40 dogs were moved from a Nashville boarding kennel, Camp Bow Wow, to another location.

Cooper said first responders walked along creek beds Sunday and worked with the Red Cross to canvass affected neighborhoods.

To the south in Williamson County, more than 34 swift water rescues were carried out, according to county Emergency Management Agency Director Todd Horton. As many as 18 homes in one neighborhood had to be evacuated.

A portion of Interstate 40 was temporarily shut down because of high water that stranded a vehicle and its driver. The driver was able to get out of the vehicle and to safety, the Tennessee Highway Patrol in Nashville tweeted. First responders also told drivers to avoid part of I-24 south of Nashville.

Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said three bodies were found after Seven Mile Creek flooded. The body of a 70-year-old man, a 46-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.

Drake said a 65-year-old man's body was found on a golf course. Police later identified him on Twitter as some who lived nearby and was swept away as he got out of his car after it had become stuck in floodwaters.

Many rivers and creeks were at or near their highest level since 2010, according to the National Weather Service. Floods in May 2010 caused 21 deaths in Tennessee and an estimated $1.5 billion in damage in Nashville.

While there was no longer any precipitation falling, flooding remained a threat, Brittney Whitehead, a weather service meteorologist in Nashville, said Sunday afternoon.

""Over the next couple of days, we'll see some of our rivers continue to rise. And we've got several flood warnings out for those areas that we expect to remain high, at least into Monday,"" she said.

Major flooding was forecast on two rivers. The weather service predicted the Harpeth River near Kingston Springs, west of Nashville, would crest about 20 feet (about 6.1 meters) above flood stage on Sunday night, while the Duck River at Centerville would crest about 17 feet (about 5.2 meters) above flood stage Monday morning.

In Bristol, along the Virginia border, a NASCAR race on a dirt track Sunday was postponed until Monday after torrential rains flooded campgrounds and parking lots surrounding Bristol Motor Speedway.

In Brentwood, eight people and a dog stayed overnight at City Hall after flooding from the Little Harpeth River forced residents from their homes, City Manager Kirk Bednar said. Hotels in the area were booked up, in part because of spring break, he said.

Fifteen people were rescued and two were taken to the hospital at the City View Apartments in south Nashville, where the lower level of the building was flooded in waist-deep water. The fire department responded to reports of a collapse at the building following a mudslide, news outlets reported. The two hospitalized patients had injuries not considered to be life-threatening.

Drake, the Nashville police chief, also said an officer on his way home was hospitalized after his vehicle was caught in floodwaters. The officer got out of the car and was found clinging to a tree when he was rescued.

A collision between a cargo ship and a fishing boat left 17 people missing off Indonesia’s main island of Java, officials said Sunday.

The fishing boat with 32 aboard capsized after hitting the Indonesian bulk carrier MV Habco Pioneer late Saturday off Indramayu district, said the head of the Search and Rescue Agency, Deden Ridwansyah.

Fifteen were rescued from the fishing boat and local fishermen and the navy were searching for the others, said Wisnu Wardana, a spokesperson for the sea transportation directorate general.

The cargo ship, which was loaded with crude oil from Borneo island, was moored after its propeller got caught in the fishing net, Ridwansyah said.

Also Sunday, rescue officials said that at least 23 people were killed and two are still missing after flash floods swept an island in Indonesia's easternmost province.

Hours before people woke to celebrate Easter, torrential rain unleashed flash floods in the Catholic-majority Flores Island.

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed, according to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati.

Rescuers are struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores regency.

""The only access there is by the sea from Adonara Island, but the rains -- as well as strong waves -- have prevented any crossing,"" Jati told AFP on Sunday.

Extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week, he added.

17,17,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Climate Change in the Developing World: The Drowning of Jakarta - The McGill International Review,https://www.mironline.ca/climate-change-in-the-developing-world-the-drowning-of-jakarta/,"Often called the world’s fastest sinking city, Jakarta — Indonesia’s capital and most populated urban area — sinks 10cm deeper into the earth each year. A variety of human-induced processes created this problem, but one in particular is pushing it to the brink of disaster: global warming. For this article, I interviewed some Indonesian relatives for their perspectives on the drowning of Jakarta, hoping to look into how climate change is most hurting the places least equipped to deal with its consequences.

I had the chance to visit Jakarta in the summer of 2019. The ground I was standing on when I took a picture of the city’s shoreline, shown below, has now sunk thirty to forty centimetres since my visit, relative to sea level. It does not sound like a lot — that is only the length of a ruler — but minor tweaks to the order of the natural world can translate into major disorder in the human one.

A city of 11 million people, 40 per cent of Jakarta currently sits below sea level — a number that grows each year. The fastest sinking rates occur in the coastal sector, North Jakarta, where the ground drops as much as 25cm annually. Life at negative altitudes is marked by vulnerability to extreme weather and flooding. In fact, parts of North Jakarta are already flooded for good. By 2050, at present rates, that entire quarter of the city — containing the same number of residents as Montreal — will be permanently swallowed by the Java Sea. According to one Jakartan relative I spoke with, floods have come to feel like “an annual event to us,” wreaking the most havoc from January to March — the monsoon season. In 2020, a new year’s day storm produced a flood that claimed the lives of 66 people and left a further 36,000 displaced.

Another Indonesian man I spoke with recalled floods damaging furniture and electronic devices in his sister’s Jakarta home. “Now whenever a flood is threatening, they raise the items off the floor and hang them from the ceiling.”

There are two main forces pushing Jakarta underwater. Both are man-made; both could be reversible. First, the majority of Jakartans rely on the extraction of groundwater for their daily water consumption. This is because the city’s water pipe infrastructure is outdated and can only sustain 40 per cent of residents’ demand. Hence, rather than looking to unreliable public agencies to supply tap water, most people resort to private ground pumps or wells, which extract water from deposits found dozens of metres below ground. Groundwater extraction is a common form of water subsistence — one-third of Canadians get water to their taps through this method. But when millions depend on groundwater extraction each and every day — a process which often goes unregulated in Indonesia — the earth under the city starts to deflate, and in turn Jakarta starts to sink.

According to hydrologists, Indonesian officials must commit to a full revamp of the city’s water supply infrastructure, constructing a new system that funnels rain and river water into man-made reservoirs connected to the city’s water pipes. In the late 1960s, groundwater extraction in Tokyo created a similar sinking crisis. Fortunately, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government implemented a combination of regulatory laws and infrastructure reform, stopping the sinking by the turn of the century.

Yet, a more daunting problem looms over Jakarta and the rest of the world. Carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels continue to intensify the planet’s greenhouse effect. The result — global warming — induces thermal expansion of the water that makes up Earth’s oceans and the melting of the ice that makes up Earth’s poles. For this reason, sea levels have been rising for over a century across the world. But especially in developing areas like Jakarta, marked by outdated infrastructure and less capital to invest in costly alternatives, rising sea levels blend with pre-existing problems like excessive groundwater extraction, and the result is that the intensity of the climate crisis is felt at a two-fold rate.

Local groundwater extraction is behind Jakarta’s sinking and must be slowed, but global warming is where the long-term humanitarian crises are contained. Indonesian President Joko Widodo invested in the construction of a giant seawall and 17 artificial islands in the Jakarta Bay to protect the city from storms and flooding as it continues to sink. Yet, rising sea levels mean that the Java Sea is slowly climbing on these blockades, rendering them increasingly ineffective at preventing disaster. Asking not to be referenced by name, the same man who told me about his sister’s flooding problems said, “Yes, right now a sea wall stops the seawater from inundating the city, [but] seawater could breach the wall at any time.” He believes that underfunding often results in half-baked infrastructural solutions to many of Indonesia’s safety concerns; a critique authorities do not always react well to when you remind them.

President Widodo’s 2019 decision to move the nation’s capital from Jakarta to the neighbouring island of Borneo foreshadows the long-term displacement, health, and economic predicaments that fester where underdevelopment meets climate change.

In 2007, a particularly strong storm left half of Jakarta flooded; 80 people lost their lives, 600,000 lost their homes, and taxpayers lost over $500 million USD to the recovery, taking away from development projects. Despite this devastation, the people I spoke with had no special memory of this incident; “many floods occur every year in Jakarta, it is numbing.”

In 30 years, when North Jakarta is submerged, what will have happened to the millions who live and work there today? “They will have to move to higher ground,” said one relative, plainly. An increased intensity of meteorological events puts mass displacement in the forecast. The World Bank estimates that by 2050, Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America will generate 143 million climate migrants. While some will seek refuge internationally, most displacement will happen internally because, as UN researcher Arno Tanner highlights, “people whose livelihoods are most sensitive to environmental changes also tend to be those who do not have the means to move very far.” Ultimately then, the heaviest burden will be borne by the same countries experiencing the worst of the climate crisis in the first place.

The melting of polar ice is causing Jakarta to drown, but other developing nations are experiencing the polar opposite effect: drought. In Botswana, for instance, global warming has reduced total rainfall, leading to a drop in agricultural production and increasing food insecurity. In recent years, delegates at the UN General Assembly have warned that climate change is inhibiting countries from attaining their Sustainable Development Goals. The permanent flooding of North Jakarta would compromise $220 billion in assets, and would hinder productivity and economic growth, according to Indonesia’s Ministry of Economic Affairs. Ultimately, the burning of fossil fuels is one of the global economy’s greatest market failures.

Today, a rather topical concern is also raised by climbing ocean levels: the spread of disease. The World Health Organization warns that when rapid flooding uproots sewage systems and carries their contents through the streets, there is a heightened risk of infectious disease spread. “Six common diseases to watch out for during floods,” read the front page of the Jakarta Post at the beginning of 2020.

As predicted, climate change is beginning to disproportionately impact the corners of the globe least equipped to face and finance its consequences. The drowning of Jakarta is ‘exhibit A’ to this process. And yet, the countries that bear the most responsibility for the creation of this crisis, in per capita terms, will likely bear the least of the burden. The carbon footprint of the average Canadian is about seven times greater than the average Jakartan’s, and yet some models predict that Canada could be one of few nations to actually benefit from global warming (as cultivable land and natural resource deposits thaw). Nonetheless, in a globalized world, mass displacement, economic stagnation, and the spread of disease — as we have seen first-hand — are threats which all nations have a shared interest in preventing. The worst of the climate crisis can be avoided if countries legitimately commit to their ‘long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies’ mandated by the 2016 Paris Agreement.

REISTERSTOWN, Md. (April 1, 2021) — Governor Larry Hogan, today, proclaimed the first Maryland Flood Awareness Month. Maryland Flood Awareness Month will run from April 1 to April 30, 2021. Every year, floods in Maryland kill more residents and destroy more property than any other natural hazard.

The frequency and intensity of storms are expected to increase over time. Recent predictions suggest that flooding in normally dry areas is likely in the future. This could mean deeper flooding, floods moving further inland, and more damage from storms. This is not only a potential danger for coastal Maryland but for all communities in Maryland.

The Hogan Administration is joining with the Maryland Department of the Environment, the Maryland Emergency Management Agency, the Maryland Insurance Administration, the Maryland Department of Planning, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the Maryland Department of Transportation, the Maryland Environmental Service, the Eastern Shore Land Conservancy, and the Maryland Association of Floodplain and Stormwater Managers to encourage all Marylanders to learn more about the different flood hazards faced by individuals and communities across the state.

“Our Administration is dedicated to working with our state, local and federal partners to assist Marylanders to become aware of their risk and take steps to protect themselves from the risk,” said Governor Larry Hogan.

Maryland Flood Awareness Month will raise awareness about the many flood hazards faced by individuals and communities across the state and provide information on what Marylanders can do to protect themselves, their property and possessions, their finances, and communities. The Maryland Resiliency Partnership will work with a variety of public and private partners to help educate the public around three key messages as they relate to different flood hazards: know your risk, reduce your risk, insure your risk.

Throughout the month of April, information and activities will focus on these three key messages as they relate to each week’s theme:

Individuals preparing for the impacts of flooding; Riverine flooding and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain; Coastal hazards (storm surge, nuisance flooding, sea level rise, erosion, subsidence, and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain); Urban and flash flooding, dam break, and flooding outside the regulatory floodplain; and Communities preparing for the impacts of flooding.

During the month of April, these agencies will be sharing information on their social media platforms; hosting virtual events to engage in conversations about flooding; and providing digital resources on the Maryland Resiliency Partnership website.

Additional information about Flood Awareness Month can be found on the Maryland Resiliency Partnership website (resiliencypartnership.com).

20,20,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Severe floods hit Timor-Leste capital Dili in Easter disaster - Asia Pacific Report,https://asiapacificreport.nz/2021/04/04/severe-floods-hit-timor-leste-capital-dili-in-easter-disaster/,"Asia Pacific Report newsdesk

Much of the Timor-Leste capital of Dili has been heavily flooded with rivers bursting their banks after three days of heavy rain over the Easter weekend, say disaster relief officials.

The floodwaters in some parts of the city have reached many metres deep with houses on the banks of the Comoro River being dragged into the raging waters, reports Lusa news agency.

The Civil Protection agency told Lusa that it was difficult to take full stock of the situation and determine the full numbers of casualties because ′′the whole city is a disaster zone”.

However, some reports say at least 11 people have died. The floods have come on top of a city already reeling from a serious covid-19 pandemic crisis.

Part of the oceanside Avenue de Portugal, where some embassies are located, has been seriously flooded with the waters entering the homes, including the Lusa office.

Several residents, including Portuguese citizens, have already been forced to leave their homes in spite of the difficulties of moving around Dili because of the floodwaters.

The high tide overnight and large volume of river water has raised the levels across almost the city, with civil protection teams, firefighters and government emergency services desperately spread around the city trying to help people.

Throughout the early morning residents in several parts of the city sent photos and videos to Lusa attesting to the fury of the floodwaters in some places.

An unknown number of families have lost their homes, with several areas – including the Presidential Palace compound – being flooded.

There is also concern about two places used to isolate patients suffering from covid-19 – the Vera Cruz Centre in Dili and the Tasitolu area.

Over the past few days, weather services have warned of the risk of heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, prominently on the north coast, due to the effects of a low pressure system, located on the Indonesian western part of the island of Timor.

Heavy rains had already caused problems in several municipalities in the country in recent days, with reports of destroyed homes and other infrastructure affected, including roads and bridges.

Some residents say the rainfall and situation in Dili today was significantly more serious than last year on 13 March 2020 when flooding affected tens of thousands of people in the capital.

Rivers and their floodplains have the potential to act as shock absorbers to climate change, and are powerful agents for keeping wildlife and communities healthy and resilient.

The most effective climate action plans will account for this and incorporate rivers into their plans for a climate-resilient future, argues Michele Thieme, a freshwater scientist at World Wildlife Fund.

This post is a commentary. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay.

This past December marked the 5th anniversary of the landmark Paris Agreement. Soon after, the Biden Administration rejoined the Paris Agreement as one of their first actions in office. And in January, the Climate Adaptation Summit once again convened global leaders and local stakeholders to accelerate adaptation action.

As these milestones reinvigorate a call to action for our politicians and business leaders to act on climate and “ramp up climate ambition,” all eyes inevitably turn to the usual avenues for addressing and adapting to climate change: forests, clean energy and waving goodbye to our toxic relationship with fossil fuels. And while mitigation efforts continue to dominate the conversation, adaptation is ever-increasing in importance in global discussions as extreme weather and its impacts worsen around the world and countries work to build stronger national commitments.

Funding, policies and actions supporting adaptation, especially nature-based solutions, however, remain weak. They overlook a powerful resource in the fight to adapt to a changing climate: rivers.

We are seeing the climate crisis manifest through water. Droughts and floods are increasing in frequency and severity from the Mekong River to the arid Rio Grande, from the plains of Africa to the world’s largest tropical wetland, South America’s Pantanal.

Rivers and their floodplains have the potential to act as shock absorbers to climate change. But maximizing their ability to do so requires strategic interventions that keep their natural features intact or incorporate green and grey infrastructure that allow natural processes to occur. Governments and business leaders must prioritize climate adaptation actions that include rivers as part of the toolbox of nature-based solutions for solving the climate crisis.

Rivers: Unsung heroes of climate adaptation

Rivers are powerful agents for keeping wildlife and communities healthy and resilient. Their natural functions provide life-giving resources and, critically for sinking deltas around the world, protect coastal areas against rising sea levels. Let’s dive deeper on a few of these functions:

Sediment flow: Rivers carry sediment all the way to the ocean where, over time, the deposited sediment accumulates to build a delta. Deltas that are starved of natural sediment flows are at risk of being inundated by rising seas. The natural flows also provide sediments to reinforce riverbanks and deliver nutrients to fertile agricultural lands and mangrove forests along the floodplains and a river’s edge. Infrastructure, such as dams, blocks the flow of sediment, one of the causes of sinking and shrinking deltas.For example, over 100 billion tons of sediment is now stored behind upstream dams, greatly reducing sediment flows to coasts around the world. According to a recent study, at least 25 million people live in sediment-starved deltas and thus are vulnerable to increased coastal flooding and inundation.

Flood risk reduction: Floodplains and wetlands along rivers are like sponges, providing a buffer for the rising and swelling of rivers, especially during flooding events. As climate change exacerbates floods, it is more important than ever that we protect and restore floodplains and wetlands. Without action, the costs to society are potentially enormous. For example, coastal flooding alone could cost up to $1 trillion per year in damages by 2050 in coastal cities if no adaptation action is taken. Restoring floodplains and coastal wetlands, along with other interventions, is a critical preventative measure against such losses.

Food and water security: River systems are among the most biologically diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet. Early civilizations flocked to rivers for their ability to support fertile agricultural lands, clean drinking water, and protein such as fish. This holds true today. River fisheries and those from other inland wetlands provide a source of protein for hundreds of millions of people As communities become increasingly stressed by climate change, it is more important than ever to protect the basic needs that rivers provide.

Current state of affairs

When rivers are able to flow naturally and are not impeded by infrastructure, like dams, we call these “free-flowing” rivers. They are vital to supplying climate adaptation services, but increasingly, human activities are severing rivers. This decline in river health is sounding alarms to freshwater scientists everywhere:

Connectivity: Infrastructure development and other man-made changes have fragmented or disrupted two-thirds of Earth’s longest rivers.

Species decline: Populations of freshwater species have experienced a staggering 84% decline since 1970

Dams and infrastructure: There are roughly 60,000 large dams around the world, with over 3,700 more hydropower dams currently planned or under construction.

Rivers and their floodplains lose the ability to buffer against floods and to deliver needed sediments to downstream deltas as they are fragmented. The Mekong River illustrates a harsh reality communities face when infrastructure is poorly planned.

The Mekong Delta is currently shrinking and sinking, having lost about 500 hectares of land in the decade leading up to 2012. While sea-level rise and groundwater extraction play a role, the immediate major causes of higher tides and salt intrusion in the delta are sand mining and trapping of sediments behind upstream dams.

Additional planned dams within the Mekong Basin will further exacerbate this problem, putting the tens of millions of people living in the delta at even greater risk for increased land loss, flooding and inundation.

In one hopeful measure, the Cambodian government has put a 10-year moratorium on any new dams on the main stem of the Mekong in Cambodia.

Wins to build on

Countries from around the world and other members of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently signed up to support the motion, ‘Protecting rivers and their associated ecosystems as corridors in a changing climate.’ This sets an important precedent for incorporating river protection into climate action policy.

There are a few other bright spots where governments and civil society are taking action to ensure that rivers and their floodplain and riparian zones can continue to act as corridors and buffers in a changing climate. One example is the recent action of the Colombian government to designate the entire free-flowing Bita River Basin as a Ramsar site, i.e. an internationally protected wetland. Another example is Mexico’s decrees for water reserves across nearly 300 basins that have effectively protected against over-extraction of water or blocking of river flows in some of the most intact basins of the country.

In Mongolia, the government has recently revised and approved 8.2 million hectares of water protection zones including riparian areas from mining and industrial development across seven provinces and is replicating this process in six additional provinces. In the U.S., the Wild & Scenic River designation has so far protected 13,413 miles of 226 rivers in 41 states. And this past autumn, U.S. environmental groups and the hydropower industry signed a joint statement to collaborate on river restoration and decarbonizing US electricity.

The burgeoning efforts to restore rivers began in the United States and have now spread to Europe, where the recent commitment of the European Union to dismantle dams and open up 25,000 km of rivers provides another compelling example. The “Room for the River” initiative of the Dutch government has taken measures at more than 30 locations along the Rhine, the Meuse, the Waal, and the Ijssel to give these rivers space to flood safely.

This progress is evidence that actions that allow rivers to act as corridors and buffers to build resilience in a changing climate are possible and that there is opportunity to replicate these wins.

A path forward

Humanity has always depended on the life-giving resources that rivers provide. As our global temperatures rise, people will be more dependent on rivers than ever before – both in terms of the benefits that they provide and the havoc they can bring if not well managed.

We cannot afford to continue to destroy one of our tools in the fight to adapt to climate change. Rivers need a seat at the table. The best-laid climate action plans will be those that account for the nature-based solutions rivers and floodplains provide in adapting to a changing climate. Business and policy leaders can incorporate rivers into their plans to support the flow towards a climate-resilient future.

When we think of climate solutions, let’s also think of rivers.

At least 70 deaths were reported in several islands in Indonesia's West and East Nusa Tenggara provinces, while 70 others were missing, after the cyclone brought flash floods, landslides and strong winds amid heavy rain over the weekend, disaster agency BNPB said.

In East Timor, which shares the Timor island with Indonesia, at least 27 people were killed by landslides, flash floods and a falling tree, while 7000 were displaced, its government said.

On Lembata island, authorities feared bodies had been washed away.

""We are using rubber boats to find bodies at sea. In several villages, flash floods hit while people were sleeping,"" Thomas Ola Langoday, deputy head of Lembata district government, told Reuters by phone.

About 30,000 people have been impacted by floods in Indonesia, some already taking shelter in evacuation centres, but rescue operations have been made difficult after five bridges collapsed and falling trees blocked some roads, BNPB spokesman Raditya Jati said.

A continuing storm had also halted evacuations in some places, local authorities said.

Hundreds of houses and other facilities such as a solar power plant were damaged, BNPB said. Ships and motor boats sank as the cyclone set off waves as high as 6 metres.

Powerful currents continued to flow through villages in the Malaka district on Timor island on Monday, even though the rain had stopped.

Some residents there hauled themselves to their roofs to escape flood water rising to 3-4 metres.

""We had to dismantle the zinc roof. We went out through the back door and pulled ourselves out with a rope,"" Agustina Luruk, 36, told Reuters as she and her three daughters waited to be evacuated by the side of a muddy road.

President Joko Widodo offered his condolences and ordered speedy disaster relief efforts.

The Seroja cyclone hit the Savu sea southwest of Timor island in the early hours of Monday, Indonesia's weather agency said.

US donates flood relief aid

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), has provided an additional $875,000 in humanitarian assistance for the World Food Programme (WFP) to strengthen preparation and response to natural disasters in Cambodia.

In a press statement released by WFP on April 1, US ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy said that last year’s devastating floods demonstrated how important it was to be ready for natural disasters.

“This funding from USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance will enable the UN World Food Programme to further build upon the successes of its ‘Innovations for Risk Informed Emergency Preparedness and Response’ project – which USAID began supporting in 2019 – through March 2022,” he said.

WFP country director in Cambodia Claire Anne Conan thanked USAID for this additional support to Cambodia, which faced recurrent, climate-related disasters such as floods and droughts.

“This assistance will help government partners and humanitarian groups at the national and sub-national level to better prepare for and respond to these events by increasing the use of information for early action and enhancing humanitarian coordination,” she said.

National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM) spokesman Khun Sokha said the WFP assistance would help the government aid drought victims and the poor.

“The WFP has helped people with food including the poor. This assistance was not only provided through NCDM, but also through other institutions involved in this work,” he said.

Chou Chea, WFP communication and report officer in Cambodia, told The Post on April 1 that this assistance would be used for existing mechanisms to enhance the national disaster management information system – Platform for Real-Time Impact and Situation Monitoring. It will be spent on increasing the platform’s ability to monitor climate-related problems, estimate their impact on the population and target emergency assistance to where it is needed most.

The WFP, she said, will support an existing early warning flood system called EWS1294 to help expand its coverage and strengthen the ability of local officials and at-risk communities to use the information to save lives.

WFP will also continue its support for the Humanitarian Response Forum (HRF), an interagency, multi-sector platform that facilitates emergency preparedness and response activities among humanitarian groups to complement the government’s nationally-led activities.

She added that the assistance would also help existing projects for a year starting April.

Last year, the US donated $700,000 to WFP to help flood-affected communities in Cambodia.

Cambodia suffered prolonged floods in 2020 with the capital and at least 18 provinces across the countries impacted, causing 25 deaths and affecting more than 300,000 people, according to NCDM report released last October.","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.phnompenhpost.com/sites/default/files/field/image/a_tractor_carries_people_through_a_flooded_street_in_phnom_penhs_dangkor_district_in_october_of_last_year._hong_menea.jpg,"['help', 'information', 'response', 'ncdm', 'usaid', 'aid', 'humanitarian', 'wfp', 'cambodia', 'flood', 'donates', 'relief', 'support', 'assistance']",flood

The pond at the Piney Point phosphate plant in central Florida could potentially release 340 million gallons (1.3 billion liters) of toxic water within minutes, threatening nearby homes and causing a potential environmental crisis in the area.

""What we are looking at now is trying to prevent and respond to, if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation,"" DeSantis said during a press conference, after surveying the site by air. The Florida governor declared a state of emergency on Saturday for Manatee County, where the plant is located.

Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said this week the reservoir holds ""waste less conducive to life on land… and in sea."" Manatee County officials had ordered the evacuation of around 300 homes in the area on Saturday, due to ""further collapse of phosphogypsum stacks.""

Phosphogypsum is a byproduct of fertilizer from phosphate rock, and is considered to be weakly radioactive.

Why is the reservoir leaking?

The large reservoir at the Piney Point plant is leaking most likely due to a tear in the pond's liner. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nicole Fried has said there were previous problems with the reservoir's liner and claimed the Piney Point plant has a troublesome history.

""For more than 50 years, this central Florida mining operation has caused numerous human health and environmental disasters and incidents,"" she wrote DeSantis in a letter about the Piney Point plant, which was originally constructed by Borden Chemical Company in 1966.

In 1989, thousands of gallons of sulfuric acid leaked from a holding tank at the plant, forcing hundreds of people to be evacuated from the area. In 1991, air releases of sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide from the facility sickened over 30 people near the plant.

But to make those investments pay off, the U.S. will need designs that can endure the changing climate.

Most U.S. infrastructure is designed to stand for decades, including through what engineers expect to be rare storms and floods.

However, extreme storms that were considered rare a few decades years ago are already becoming more common. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the Houston area’s third “500-year flood” in three years, and it was followed by two more major flooding events.

Building infrastructure today that will be strong enough to manage the extreme scenarios the nation might see a century from now can be expensive. But what if infrastructure were instead designed to meet shorter-term needs and also be easily adapted later for the future climate?

I’m a hydraulic and coastal engineer who has been working on infrastructure design in the Netherlands, where dams and storm surge barriers are being designed to be adaptable. The methods there hold lessons for the U.S. as it prepares for a wave of new construction.

The problem with building for 100-year floods

Bridges in the U.S. are typically designed to allow the unimpeded passage of floods that have a 1-in-100 chance of happening each year. Similarly, a dam spillway might be built to handle a 10,000-year flood, and stormwater drains for two-year rainfall events.

These “return periods” are traditionally calculated using a method based on historical statistics that assume the climate doesn’t change much.

In a warming climate with more extreme rainfall, worsening droughts and rising sea levels, these historical statistics can underestimate the intensity of future floods. That puts critical infrastructure, homes and lives in danger.

Putting adaptive design to work

The Dutch are masters of flood control. When about a third of a country sits below sea level, it becomes a necessity. U.S. engineers have been turning to them for advice in recent years as understanding of climate change and its impact on storms and sea level rise increases.

The Netherlands’ innovative designs, like the giant gates of the Maeslant flood defense, are getting noticed, but equally important is how the Dutch use adaptive designs to prepare for the future and keep costs under control.

To see adaptive design at work, look at the renovation underway of the Afsluitdijk, a 20-mile-long dam that protects Amsterdam’s port from storm surges on the North Sea.

When the dam was completed in 1932, it drained river water to the sea by gravity at low tide. However, sea level rise, combined with the need to keep the water level in Amsterdam’s port low to protect the city, are making drainage by gravity alone increasingly ineffective.

To update the dam, the Dutch have built pump stations for draining water into the North Sea. Importantly, the new design reserves enough land to expand the existing pump stations or build new ones when future storms and sea level rise make it necessary.

Lessons as the U.S. plans new coastal protections

Several U.S. cities, including Houston, New York and Boston, are now considering hurricane defense systems, and the future protection they will actually need to prevent flooding is unknown at this point.

By using adaptive design, they could include room for expanding those defenses as the climate changes.

That might mean building earthen dams and levees wide enough to allow for raising them when necessary, and reserving land for widening and heightening of coastal dunes that form part of the system and for adding pump infrastructure.

Crucially, movable storm surge barriers, which typically make up a short section of a barrier system, offer protection only from sporadic hurricanes and not from long-term sea level rise. The movable barriers may eventually need to be replaced with a dam, shipping lock and drainage pumps – that, too, can be planned for.

By starting with an adaptive design, the U.S. can save billions of dollars compared with having to build new systems decades down the road. The recent renovations of California’s Folsom Dam, built in 1955, illustrate that cost. A new spillway completed in 2018 cost $900 million – with inflation, that’s about the original cost of the entire dam.

Adapting for Mississippi River flooding

When Dutch engineers plan new levees, storm surge barriers and river locks, they consider what are known as the Delta Scenarios – four possible futures for flood risk and sea level rise, ranging from moderate to extreme global warming. These scenarios create a framework for adaptive design.

For example, a complex of locks on the Meuse River, used to raise and lower ships and barges as they travel up- or downstream, needs to be replaced or rehabilitated. A new lock complex must have enough sluice gates, which can be closed or opened to allow high water through after storms, so the water doesn’t flood surrounding farms and cities. The accompanying weir – the low dam that raises the river’s level – must be high enough to retain enough water for ship operations during times of drought.

Building a tall weir with many sluice gates, and raising riverbank levees to match, would allow the lock complex to manage future climate scenarios, but that would be expensive. With adaptive design, the complex can instead be built to be easily modified later to meet changing climate needs. That includes reserving space for additional sluice gates, and designing gates that can be made taller by welding on additional components as needed.

30,30,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Floating gardens as a way to keep farming despite climate change: Bangladesh's historic farming systems could offer a way forward - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210331085648.htm,"Bangladesh's floating gardens, built to grow food during flood seasons, could offer a sustainable solution for parts of the world prone to flooding because of climate change, a new study has found.

The study, published recently in the Journal of Agriculture, Food and Environment, suggests that floating gardens might not only help reduce food insecurity, but could also provide income for rural households in flood-prone parts of Bangladesh.

""We are focused here on adaptive change for people who are victims of climate change, but who did not cause climate change,"" said Craig Jenkins, a co-author of the study and academy professor emeritus of sociology at The Ohio State University. ""There's no ambiguity about it: Bangladesh didn't cause the carbon problem, and yet it is already experiencing the effects of climate change.""

Bangladesh's floating gardens began hundreds of years ago. The gardens are made from native plants that float in the rivers -- traditionally, water hyacinths -- and operate almost like rafts, rising and falling with the waters. Historically, they were used to continue growing food during rainy seasons when rivers filled with water.

The farmers -- or their families -- layer the plants about three feet deep, creating a version of raised-bed gardens that float in the water. Then, they plant vegetables inside those rafts. As the raft-plants decompose, they release nutrients, which help feed the vegetable plants. Those vegetable plants typically include okra, some gourds, spinach and eggplant. Sometimes, they also include spices like turmeric and ginger.

Floating gardens are also in use in parts of Myanmar, Cambodia and India. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization has named Bangladesh's floating gardens a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System.

But as climate change has affected the volume of water in those rivers -- creating extreme highs and floods, along with extreme lows and droughts -- floating gardens have become a way for rural farmers to keep producing food during unpredictable weather. Climate change increases weather extremes and the severity of flooding, and droughts as well.

The researchers wanted to understand whether Bangladesh's floating gardens could be a sustainable farming practice as climate change continues to cause floods and droughts, and to see whether the gardens bring better food security to individual households.

""They've got to be able to grow specific crops that can survive with minimal soil,"" said Jenkins, who is also a research scientist and former director of the Ohio State Mershon Center for International Security Studies. ""And in Bangladesh, a lot of small farmers that had typically relied on rice crops are moving away from those because of the effects of climate change and better returns from alternative crops.""

For this study, the researchers interviewed farming families who use floating gardens, and found strong evidence that floating gardens provide stability, both in the amount of food available to feed rural populations and in a farming family's income, despite the instability created by a changing climate.

They found that farmers typically use hybrid seeds, which must be repurchased each year, to grow a diverse range of vegetables in the floating gardens. The gardens are also susceptible to pests, so farmers end up spending some money on both pesticides and fertilizers. But even with those expenses, they found, benefits outweighed costs.

Generally, entire families work on the gardens, the researchers found: Women, children and the elderly prepare seedlings and collect aquatic plants to build gardens. Men cultivate the gardens and protect them from raiders. Some families also farm fish in the waters around their floating gardens.

One farmer told the research team that he earns up to four times as much money from the gardens as from traditional rice paddies.

Still, the system could use improvements, the researchers found. Farmers often take out high-interest loans to cover the investment costs of building the beds and stocking them with plants. Lower-interest loans from responsible government or non-governmental organizations could alleviate that burden, they found.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['offer', 'forward', 'families', 'food', 'farmers', 'farming', 'historic', 'climate', 'plants', 'way', 'gardens', 'floating', 'despite', 'researchers', 'systems', 'change', 'study']",none

GENEVA

A stitch in time saves nine. When it comes to disaster management, this has been proven correct time and time again. Investing beforehand in risk reduction – think flood defences, early warning systems, evacuation plans – minimises the damage, the loss of life, and the financial cost of the response after disaster strikes.

So why, if this is so obviously true, have humanitarians historically maintained a reactive approach, even when disasters are recurrent and predictable?

Money is certainly part of it. It’s hard to direct stretched resources towards problems that haven’t reached crisis points, and donors have tended to be more comfortable funding post-disaster response. But some have also argued that risk reduction is mission creep and falls more squarely within the development realm – humanitarians should stick to the business of saving lives and providing emergency aid (joining up the two is of course a wider debate).

But change could be afoot. As climate change threatens ever more frequent, powerful, and overlapping disasters, some organisations have begun to shift approach, putting more resources up front. Advances in data and forecasting, as well as the ability to communicate and act upon those forecasts, have allowed for these changes. Whether this move towards “anticipatory action” is just the latest example of preparedness and risk reduction regaining prominence in the humanitarian-development enterprise or a longer-lasting and more significant trend remains to be seen.

This timeline tracks the evolution of this shifting focus from managing disasters to managing risks – among states and within the aid sector, both in policy and in practice.

33,33,FL-2021-000030-IDN,VIETNAM Catholics build a centre for flood victims in Hà Tĩnh - AsiaNews,http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Catholics-build-a-centre-for-flood-victims-in-H%26agrave%3B-T%26%23297%3Bnh-52762.html,"by Paul Nguyen Hung

Retiring Bishop Paul Nguyễn Thái Hợp celebrated the start of the work and the laying of the foundation stone. In October, devastating flooding caused fatalities and extensive damage to the area. Local authorities granted the land free of charge. The building can also be used as a youth or educational centre.

Hanoi (AsiaNews) – The construction of a large community house for flood victims (Nhà Vượt Lũ Cộng Đồng) began a few days ago under the watchful eye of Mgr Phaolô (Paul) Nguyễn Thái Hợp, the bishop of Hà Tĩnh (northern Vietnam) who retired a few days earlier.

The area was hit by devastating floods last October, with fatalities and extensive damage to local infrastructures.

On 13 March, the bishop celebrated the Mass that officially started the work in Tiên Nghĩa, a community in Liên Hòa parish, Hòa Ninh district.

The Nguồn Nậy River, one of the main tributaries of the Gianh River, flows through the region. During the rainy season, life becomes a nightmare for residents, due to the fury of the waters.

The local Catholic community numbers around a thousand, mostly living off fishing, farming and animal husbandry along the waterways, in one of the poorest parts of the Diocese of Hà Tĩnh.

Catholic groups, organisations and volunteers from the diocese provided help during the October floods, as did the bishop and Caritas Vietnam.

During the work, it became clear that some brick structure, elevated and solid enough to withstand frequent flooding was needed.

In his last weeks in office, Bishop Nguyễn Thái Hợp, aware of the needs of the residents, undertook a project with Caritas to build a community house in Tiên Nghĩa, an initiative backed by the Quèng Tiên municipality and the People’s Committee of Ba Đồn.

The authorities granted the land for free for the community house, where people can go in case of floods. When the weather is dry, and danger of flooding is remote, the building can be used as a classroom, for catechism, or as a youth centre for Tiên Xuân residents.

Many Catholics worked on the project for free to help build the centre, and show their gratitude to Bishop Nguyễn Thái Hợp who retired on 19 March for age limits.

In the last few days he led several farewell Masses in many parishes of the diocese, as well as the solemn Eucharistic concelebration of 25 March, on the Feast of the Annunciation.

This highlighted the bond with the community and the commitment to work with the local clergy on the path of the mission.","Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.asianews.it/./files/img/size3/VIETNAM_-_festaOK.JPG,"['centre', 'victims', 'hà', 'build', 'bishop', 'tiên', 'local', 'hợp', 'house', 'nguyễn', 'catholics', 'flood', 'thái', 'tĩnh', 'paul', 'work', 'community']",flood

In his webinar titled, ""Discourse of MINANGKABAU SPECIAL REGIONS, Threats or Blessings?"" Professor Armando laid his suspicion on the proposed separation and autonomy of a new province in West Sumatra. He thinks that those advocating for it are ""from the radical Islamic circles...who want to make West Sumatra like Aceh, an autonomous region that implements Sharia law,"" the International Christian Concern reported.

The professor argued that these radical Islamists are following a narrative that will subject Minangkabau ethnicity under the Sharia law according to what they believe from the Book of Allah, hence the proposed name, ""Special Region of Minangkabau"" instead of ""Special Region of West Sumatra.""

Armando's conjecture isn't groundless as seen in the enforcement of Sharia law in schools in Padang City where teachers obliged their non-Muslim students to wear the hijab. Women in regions under the Islamic law will be vulnerable to such discriminatory regulations and other future policies. He and other speakers from last week's workshop are urging people native to the Sumatra region to oppose the proposition by speaking up and by doing everything they can to stop its implementation.

Juniator Tulius, an anthropologist from Mentawai, also surmises that if given consideration, the proposed MINANGKABAU SPECIAL AREA would discount the principle of a peaceful co-existence among diverse groups. Its regional effect including the future treatment of women and religious minorities could have far-reaching impacts at a national level.

""We remain alert to all developments in the West Sumatra region. A lot of information will appear in the media that we need to monitor to what extent there is an attempt to legalize it as a MINANGKABAU SPECIAL REGION,"" he said.

Fortunately, the critical discourse analysis on the possible expansion of the Sharia Regional Regulations in West Sumatra concludes that a proposition grant will affect the quality of democracy in West Sumatra.

""For most scholars and experts in Indonesia, the presence of religious-based regional regulations is claimed to be one of the sources of fertilizing the seeds of intolerance at the provincial level. As the second most productive region to produce Sharia regional regulations in Indonesia, the position of the province of West Sumatra is like a fire in the husk which over time will create a greater potential for conflict,"" the study said.

Religious reasons aside, the threat of terrorism is also felt in the island of Sumatra. ICC reports that from March 19 to March 21, the Densus 88 Anti-terror unit in Indonesia had arrested 18 suspected terrorists in North Sumatra in a silent operation.

The unit seized several items as evidence of their propaganda including 31 charity boxes used in swindling the unsuspecting people to fund their unscrupulous activities.","Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",http://cdn.christianitydaily.com/data/images/full/7560/sumatra.jpg,"['professor', 'minangkabau', 'warns', 'law', 'regulations', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'implement', 'region', 'sumatra', 'regional', 'attempts', 'sharia', 'special', 'west']",none

She was actually at a hotel - Coconuts Jakarta,https://coconuts.co/jakarta/lifestyle/actress-raline-shah-lectured-online-for-wearing-shoes-in-a-mosque-she-was-actually-at-a-hotel/,"Indonesian actress Raline Shah has been spending time in Dubai for a few weeks now, and has been sharing photos and videos from her time there on social media. However, one recent photo of hers attracted much confusion and scrutiny among her followers, who falsely thought she was wearing shoes inside a mosque.

The 36-year-old actress took to Instagram to post a photo of her wearing a green-white long dress and a pair of nude-colored high-heeled sandals, posing in a hallway that had a typical Middle Eastern design and ornaments.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Raline Shah (@ralineshah)

Raline geo-tagged the photo to the iconic Burj Al Arab luxury hotel, which is well-known for its sail design. The hotel, which is one of the tallest hotels in the world, stands on an artificial island off Dubai’s Jumeirah Beach.

Falsely equating Middle Eastern interior design with that of mosques, many netizens accused Raline of wearing her heels inside an Islamic house of worship and demanded some sort of apology from her.

“Why didn’t you take off your shoes?” one commenter wrote, while another tried to lecture her by saying, “Apologies, why couldn’t you take off your shoes, it’s a pity because Raline is beautiful inside and out.”

Thankfully, some came to Raline’s defense.

“This is the Burj Al Arab hotel, netizens, it’s just the interior that makes it look like it’s a mosque. Kind netizens, you should’ve checked on Google before commenting especially [going as far as] bullying [Raline],” one comment reads.

In the critics’ defense, the concern about wearing shoes in a mosque is not completely unfounded, as one must remove their footwear when entering an Islamic place of worship to keep the surface clean for prayer. Yet hoping for netizens to do their due diligence before commenting on social media is probably asking too much.

TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) announced that 256 people were evacuated from the flash flood-stricken area in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT). The region of East Flores had been devastated by intensifying rainfall caused by the two tropical cyclone seeds forming nearby.

As of April 5, the agency said the hundreds of local residents were evacuated to two village halls in Nelemawangi and Nelelamadike.

“The East Flores BPBD announced that sea crossing endangers sailing activities due to rainfall, wind, and high tides. On another note the evacuation of victims who are buried under sludge are still hampered by the heavy equipment,” BNPB spokesperson Raditya Jati wrote in a statement on Monday, April 5.

He further explained that the Flores Disaster Mitigation Agency (BPBD) recorded 24 people who are still missing and 44 deaths caused by the natural disaster in NTT. 17 houses were reportedly swept by the major flash flood, 60 buried under land, and 5 bridges were completely wiped out.

Nine villages in the East Nusa Tenggara were devastated by the intensifying weather which comprises Nelemadike, Nelemawangi (Ile Boleng district), Waiburak and Waiwerang sub-district (East Adonara), Oyang Barang and Pandai (Wotan Ulu Mado), and Duwanur, Waiwadan and Daniboa (West Adonara).

39,39,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Floodplains aren't separate to a river — they're an extension of it. It's time to change how we connect with them - The Conversation AU,https://theconversation.com/floodplains-arent-separate-to-a-river-theyre-an-extension-of-it-its-time-to-change-how-we-connect-with-them-157890,"Dramatic scenes of flood damage to homes, infrastructure and livelihoods have been with us on the nightly news in recent weeks. Many will be feeling the pain for years to come, as they contend with property damage, financial catastrophe and trauma.

But what if, for a moment, we removed the humans and their structures from these tragic images — what would we see?

We would see a natural process of river expansion and contraction, of rivers doing exactly what they’re supposed to do from time to time. We’d see them exceeding what we humans have deemed to be their boundaries and depositing sediment across their floodplains. We’d see reproductive opportunities for fish, frogs, birds and trees. The floods would also enrich the soils. Floods can be catastrophic for humans, but they are a natural part of an ecosystem from which we benefit.

These scenes clearly depict the intersection of humans and nature, and it’s not working out well for either side.

We must envision a new way of interacting with floodplains – these brilliant social-ecological systems that are not separate to rivers but rather part of the riverine landscape.

Humans can live on and with floodplains — but the way we do that has to change.

AAP Image/James Gourley

What is a floodplain?

Floodplains are relatively flat stretches of land located next to rivers. It helps to think of them as an extension of the river; it is natural and normal for a river to flood their adjacent plains.

Floodplains are composed of sediment the river has transported and then deposited, which makes them incredibly fertile. Flow and sediment regimes interacting over decades — or millennia — determine the physical and ecological character of floodplains, and the way they flood.

There are more than 15 generic floodplain types in Australia. Each harbours a unique set of evolutionary properties, physical features and ecosystems.

These influence the way floodwaters traverse floodplains, how long water remains on a floodplain, the velocity, turbulence and depth of floodwaters, and ecosystem responses to flooding. Floodplains are complex and highly variable.

Floodplains are also dynamic and ever-changing — and we should expect them to change even more in the coming years. Australian rivers have experienced regular periods of increased flood activity in the past 100 years.

And climate change is predicted to increase flood activity.

Humans benefit from floodplains

Floodplains are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet – they are biodiversity hotspots.

That’s in large part due to periodic flooding between different parts of a river-floodplain system; flooding is crucial to the function of floodplains. Without floods, these floodplains wouldn’t “work” — they would not be able to deliver the ecosystem services we benefit from. Those benefits include, but are not limited to:

food grown in these fertile soils

regulation of a balanced ecosystem

cultural heritage

transportation (as floodplains are easy to build roads on)

the supply of good quality drinking water

recreation.

The economic value of floodplain ecosystem services exceed US$25,681 per hectare. Roughly 25% of global terrestrial ecosystem services come from floodplains.

Humans are drawn to live on floodplains because of their productivity. In Australia, the floodplains of the Murray Darling Basin, heavily developed for agriculture, yield more than A$10 billion annually. These floodplain ecosystems provide an estimated A$187 billion per annum from their various ecosystem services.

However, the more we interrupt floodplain processes with development, the more we diminish the supply of ecosystem services.

The perils of living on floodplains

Putting the people back into the news footage reveals a social picture that is costly, traumatic and disruptive. The events of the past weeks have now brought into focus the perils of living on floodplains.

Humans have come up with ways to contend with this peril. Dams and levees. Land use planning. Building codes. Engineered floodscapes. Insurance. Emergency preparation systems and community engagement.

But if floodplains are a social-ecological system, where society gains great benefits but is also periodically placed at risk, which side should get the greatest policy attention? The humans or the ecosystem?

The answer is: both. But they also need to be better integrated.

Balancing the social with the ecological

Balancing the social and ecological aspects of floodplains requires a mindset change. We must combine community participation with research, resilience and adaptation to make long-term decisions about the future of these complex social-ecological systems.

If society wants to continue to derive the billions of dollars of benefits from floodplains, we need to ensure that flooding continues to occur on floodplains, and adapt to risk in imaginative and innovative ways that also protect the benefits.

Business as usual is not an option. The limitations of technocratic controls such as dams and levees should now be obvious. Time and time again, these have increased flood risk and failed to flood-proof the floodplain.

Rarely do such linear solutions solve complex problems in social-ecological systems. Linear solutions often exacerbate a problem or simply move it on to other parts of the system, creating social inequality, environmental decline and future risk.

The Australian government’s 2018 National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework sets the challenge to join up the built, social, economic and natural environments to address disaster risk in Australia.

Accepting the challenge requires a broader focus on balancing the social-ecological sides of Australia’s vast floodplains. Complexity, not linear thinking, must be embedded in the way we reimagine policy about floodplains and floods.

This requires transformative collaborations between government departments, researchers, business, and community stakeholders.

In my role as an ambassador of the mission of Canada to ASEAN, I recently had the opportunity to participate in the ASEAN-Canada Joint Cooperation Committee – or short JCC. The JCC is one of a series of platforms for senior officials from ASEAN and Canada to come together every year to discuss our joint priorities.

This year's JCC – like many other meetings – was conducted virtually for the first time. While many of us have gotten used to a flood of virtual meetings and calls – both in our professional and private lives – this occasion made me reflect on how not being able to meet in a physical space may help us to understand the importance of togetherness – of coming together and working together, of collaborating and cooperating.

In fact, amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its severe impact on health and economies, cooperation and collaboration among countries are needed now more than ever. As we face the greatest challenge of a generation, we need a collective and cooperative global response.

Canada and ASEAN have worked together for more than 44 years across various areas, including economic cooperation, disaster response, gender equality, security and human rights. Our four-decade spanning partnership is built on the spirit of cooperation and collaboration and can show the world what a close knit relationship like ours can accomplish. The recent JCC presented an excellent opportunity to strengthen our ties and discuss ways to come together to support a joint road to recovery and prosperity.

The past year has been a year of unprecedented challenges, and we are still in the middle of a global pandemic, grappling with its effects. However, it is inspiring to witness occasions where we rise to the challenge and find ways to turn them into opportunities.

Since our last JCC in 2020, ASEAN and Canada have come together to advance a possible ASEAN-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which will strengthen our economic ties and help us build back faster and better.

Given the external circumstances, this was no small feat, and we are thankful for the continued spirit of cooperation from our partners in ASEAN.

We are encouraged to see that Brunei, as chair of ASEAN in 2021, has included the launch of free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with Canada as a COVID-19 economic recovery priority. As trade-dependent economies,

Canada and ASEAN have a shared interest in fostering an open, international rules-based trading system that facilitates recovery efforts and benefits everyone. We are now working together with ASEAN to make Brunei's vision a reality and to securing the launch of FTA negotiations later this year.

It is also heartening to see that Canadian companies are increasingly engaged in the ASEAN region, from infrastructure to information and communication technology, to e-commerce, aerospace and defense, oil and gas, sustainable technologies, agriculture and agrifood, education, and beyond. This increasing cooperation translates into real opportunities for our people. We are convinced that with the ASEAN-Canada FTA, we will chart a successful, collective path forward.

However, while strengthening economic cooperation will help us emerge from this crisis stronger and better prepared for the future, it is essential not to lose sight of other critical common goals that the pandemic has impacted. One of them, which is particularly important for Canada, that underpins our policies at home and our international engagements, is the advancement of gender equality.

While more data is needed to understand the full implications that COVID-19 will have on gender balance, it is becoming clear that women make up most of the jobs that have been hardest hit by the pandemic and are far more likely than men to lose work. Also, they are picking up more of the unpaid care work related to stay-at-home orders, the closure of schools and childcare facilities, and an increased need for eldercare.

Empowering women and girls and promoting and protecting their human rights means ensuring the rights of half of the world's population. According to the UN World Food Programme, when women work, they invest 90 per cent of their income back into their families and communities, compared with 30 to 40 percent for men. Ensuring that women have the same opportunities by law and in practice is not only the right thing to do; it also makes economic sense. With much of our recent global progress towards gender equality at stake, Canada is committed to emphasizing that building back better means building a more gender-balanced world.

On the occasion of International Women's Day on March 3, the Mission of Canada to ASEAN hosted a speed mentoring event bringing together prominent women leaders to share their experiences and determination with other young women. During this event, one of the mentors, Col. Sus Ratih Pusparini, a staff member of the Foreign Cooperation Office of the Indonesian National Defense Institute, said she used to feel like she had to work harder in the military than her male counterparts. However, a superior encouraged her to keep having dreams, she then strived to work harder and kept an open mind and was after her perseverance assigned to the UN peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.

Hearing these smart women talk about their experiences we are reminded of how far we have come and what positive impact gender balance can have on our societies and our economies.

Over the past month, I was able to be part of the first virtual ASEAN-Canada JCC and a virtual speed mentoring event. These events have shown me that our cooperation matters – be it economic cooperation, peace and security, gender equality and human rights or people-to-people connectivity. And if we are determined, we can overcome physical distance and work hand-in-hand to build a more equal and connected world. Collaboration is needed now more than ever! Let's keep working and, hopefully, next year, we will be able to share our perspectives face-to-face again at the next JCC.

Australia is providing immediate support to Timor-Leste after its capital and other parts of the country were struck by devastating floods. Up to 21 people are reported to have died and there has been significant damage to infrastructure after a landslide hit the capital, Dili. Low-lying suburbs have been evacuated. Indonesia's weather agency says a cyclone that hit the Savu Sea southwest of Timor island in the early hours of Monday could bring yet more rain, waves and winds. ""We stand ready to assist the government and people of Timor-Leste in response to further requests for assistance,"" a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade official told AAP on Monday. ""Australia and NGO (non-governmental organisation) partners on the ground to whom we provide funding have given support to evacuation centres. ""We are supporting access to clean water for the centres through our existing development program."" Australia's Defence Cooperation Program has provided emergency back-up power for the Timor-Leste Integrated COVID Crisis Centre, the official said. Labor spokesman for the Pacific, Pat Conroy, hopes the government responds to all requests for assistance from the Timor Leste Government.

45,45,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Singapore joins Asia's SPAC race but investors flock to US - Nikkei Asia,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Singapore-joins-Asia-s-SPAC-race-but-investors-flock-to-US,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG -- Asian exchanges are keen to get in on the boom in ""blank-check"" company initial public offerings, or SPACs, that has swept the U.S. But the region may not generate the same kind of frenzy.

SPACs are shell corporations whose sponsors, or promoters, raise capital via a stock market listing. They then look to acquire or merge with operating companies, which as a result can go public more quickly than through a traditional initial public offering. In other words, SPAC shareholders do not know which business they are investing in until later.

The popularity of such listing vehicles has surged. In the first ten weeks of 2021, global SPAC IPO volumes -- overwhelmingly in the U.S. -- reached $76.7 billion, just $2.5 billion behind the amount for all of 2020, according to data from Refinitiv.

The wave of SPACs includes a number aimed at capturing Asian investment. Six Asia-focused SPACs have raised a total of $2.7 billion so far this year, almost double the entire volume for 2020, according to Dealogic.

And some notable Asian startups are considered to be potential targets for SPACs. They include Singapore super app provider Grab, its Indonesian rival Gojek, and e-commerce giant Tokopedia, also from Indonesia. All are reportedly being circled by SPACs as a vehicle to go public.

But compared with the U.S., Asia is still considered less fertile ground for SPACs. Sponsors say onerous disclosure requirements, long vetting processes by listing committees and a reluctance to relax rules -- after recent clampdowns on backdoor listings -- are among the issues likely to inhibit SPAC takeup in the region.

""Unlike in the U.S., Hong Kong and Singapore undertake a qualitative review of whether a candidate is suitable to be listed, as they focus on shareholder protection,"" said Marcia Ellis, Partner of Morrison & Foerster. ""If there are too many safeguards in place, that decreases the advantages of a listing compared to a traditional IPO and this will dampen the appetite of sponsors and SPAC targets.""

Asia's approach is now becoming clearer. Singapore Exchange last week sought feedback on a new regulatory framework for SPACs that it hopes to finalize midyear. RegCo, SGX's regulatory arm, has proposed a minimum market capitalization of $300 million Singapore dollars ($222.6 million) for SPACs, with up to three years for blank-check companies to combine with a target.

Hong Kong, Singapore's main rival as an Asian financial center outside Japan, is set to unveil its own rules in coming months, people familiar with its plans have said.

In Japan, a government panel suggested in March that authorities consider whether to allow SPACs as a possible way of channeling capital to startups.

South Korea and Malaysia have both dabbled in blank-check companies on their stock exchanges, but have not seen the interest captured by the U.S. Refinitiv's data shows that as of March 30, only four SPAC IPOs in Asia this year have been registered on South Korea's Kosdaq.

""It takes time for investors to understand the product, and for the regulator to improve protection mechanisms for the SPAC investors,"" said Stephanie Tang, head of private equity for greater China at law firm Hogan Lovells.

Flush with cash eagerly seeking returns, Asia's investors are not waiting for Singapore and Hong Kong and are putting money into the U.S., with New York's Nasdaq drawing massive capital flows. For instance, almost half the funding for three of the recent Asia-sponsored SPAC listings in the U.S. came from Asia-based institutions, two people involved said.

""We are seeing and expect to see more activity among Asian SPAC sponsors and investors,"" said Gaurav Maria, Asia-Pacific head of equity-linked and private capital markets business at JPMorgan Chase & Co in Hong Kong.

SoftBank Group's Vision Fund listed three SPACs on the Nasdaq exchange in January and in March. The vehicles raised a total of $1.15 billion, including from the Vision Fund 2, which is so far entirely funded by SoftBank. They are targeting ""IPO-ready technology companies"" as acquisition targets.

Primavera Capital, a top private equity specialist in China, raised $360 million through a SPAC in January and said it will look to acquire a consumer sector company in China. Meanwhile, CITIC Group became the first state-owned Chinese company to do so, setting up a $200 million SPAC this year.

Arrow Capital, an investment advisory company, whose founder Rohit Nanani is Singaporean, and Silicon Valley-based Tribe Capital last month raised $240 million on Nasdaq for a technology SPAC.

""A SPAC is a liquidity driven product,"" said Nanani, in response to Nikkei Asia's queries on why he did not wait for SGX to decide how to handle blank-check companies. ""At this stage, there is a huge appetite and liquidity for this product in the U.S.,"" he said.

Vistas Media Capital, a Singapore-based media holdings company, also looked to New York for a SPAC deal as the parent sponsor for Vistas Media Acquisition Company, a Nasdaq-listed blank-check company. VMAC merged in March with Abu Dhabi-headquartered Anghami, a music streaming platform, at a valuation of $220 million.

Announcing its SPAC proposals, SGX acknowledged such transactions offered ""speed to market and ability to offer price certainty in valuing target companies."" However SGX also noted that risks included excessive dilution of shareholders and the rush to acquire target companies.

""We are therefore proposing measures to address these risks, with the aim of creating credible listing vehicles that will increase investor choice,"" said Tan Boon Gin, CEO of SGX RegCo.

A spokesman for Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing said that while the bourse regularly looks at ways to enhance its IPO market, it will also strive to maintain ""market quality.""

Analysts and investors suggest technology companies will continue to prefer to merge with SPACs in the U.S., where they are part of a bigger peer group, while Singapore can aspire to become a hub for Southeast Asia startups, and Hong Kong for greater China targets.

""Ultimately, companies will still choose the SPAC to merge with based on the valuations and liquidity that they get after they become public,"" noted Mak Yuen Teen, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore Business School who specializes in corporate governance.

Craig Coben, co-head of Asia-Pacific global capital markets at Bank of America in Hong Kong, said that regional interest in SPAC deals, whether in the U.S. or locally, will increase.

""We are seeing significant interest from the Asian investor community, as they now understand the full value of the product and the efficient capital recycling it provides,"" Coben said.

Udhay Furtado, co-head of equity capital markets for Citigroup in Asia, said, ""SPACs as a form of capital-raising are here to stay in Asia for quite some time. More and more Asian sponsors getting interested.""

48,48,FL-2021-000030-IDN,These Carbon-Belching Zombie Fires Just Wouldn't Die—Until Now – Mother Jones - Mother Jones,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2021/03/these-carbon-belching-zombie-fires-refuse-to-die/,"Humanity’s got a full-tilt zombie outbreak on its hands. As the world warms and certain regions—particularly the Arctic—dry, so does the super fuel known as peat. It’s basically concentrated carbon from dead plants, and it burns not at all like your typical Californian or Australian wildfire. Instead of sending towering flames upward, a peat fire burns in the opposite direction, smoldering deep in the soil. Firefighters often soak the ground with water and declare victory, only for the soil to reignite a surface fire months later. The land might even snow over while the smoldering persists undetected. That’s why scientists dub these menaces “zombie fires.”

Peat fires can release 100 times the carbon that a wildfire does. That’s terrible for both the planet and human health: In Indonesia, which has massive stores of peat that regularly burn uncontrolled, the smoke creates public health crises. Since peat fire spreads down into the soil and across the landscape, they also threaten nearby farmlands and people.

Yet researchers have found a weapon that could help put down a zombie fire for good—the equivalent of destroying its brain instead of just mangling its body. “Smoldering is the most persistent type of combustion on earth, because it’s really easy to start and very difficult to stop,” says Imperial College London engineer Guillermo Rein, co-author of a new paper describing the work in the International Journal of Wildland Fire. “They call them zombie fires, but the equivalent would be like an army of zombies. They are very, very difficult to suppress.”

Just ask the firefighters who battled North Carolina’s Evans Road Fire in 2008, which simmered through swampy peatland. Engineers ended up pumping 7.5 billion liters of water from lakes to flood the area. It took seven months to drown the fire.

If you’ve got a big air tanker that can drop huge amounts of water on a zombie fire, good for you. But it’s not going to work. “No one fights smoldering fires, which are massive, with air tankers,” says Rein. “If they do, they’re doing PR. They’re telling everyone, ‘Don’t worry, we have it!’ But they don’t. They don’t. When I see these airplanes in a smoldering fire, I know they are completely desperate.”

That’s because deluging a zombie isn’t guaranteed to quickly kill it. Say you’re pumping massive quantities across a peatland like firefighters did in North Carolina. That doesn’t mean the water is getting to the right places as it trickles underground. “It creates a channel, and the fire in that channel is suppressed, but then the water doesn’t go anywhere else,” Rein says. Other parts of the fire can fester untouched. And so the zombie lives on.

If firefighters don’t have enough water at their disposal, they may try compacting the soil with heavy machinery in a bid to cut off the fire’s oxygen. But that equipment is not always available to a crew. Even then, such a maneuver is dangerous work since it requires driving over an active fire. Also, these fires can be huge, and heavy machinery can cover only so much ground.

In the lab, Rein and his colleagues experimented with a novel anti-zombie weapon: water mixed with a nontoxic, readily available fire-extinguishing surfactant, also known as a wetting agent or suppressant. “It’s a little bit actually like soap—it just reduces the surface tension of the water and allows the water to penetrate better into a porous medium,” says Rein. “Peat is a porous medium.”

Using a small custom-built “peat reactor,” stuffed with the plant material and lined with ceramic insulators, they could set a zombie fire and monitor it as it burned. Above the box they situated a nozzle to spray either regular water or their special blend on different fires. Compared to the same amount of plain water, the water with surfactant cut the time needed to extinguish the blaze by 40 percent. Thanks to that decreased surface tension, instead of creating channels, the mixture more uniformly penetrated the soil, so little patches of zombie fire had nowhere to hide.

It wasn’t that the surfactant had some sort of chemical effect on the fire—for instance, by decreasing oxygen levels. Instead it was more of a thermal effect, “in the sense that the surfactant allows the water to reach more hot spots and reach them faster,” says Rein.

That’s promising because the less time a peat fire has to burn, the less land it will destroy and the fewer emissions it will spew. “If we have the ability to suppress these peat fires, that will help mitigate not only ground-level smoke pollution impacts but also the potential feedback with climate change where these deep, very prolonged, smoldering peat fires emit tons and tons of ancient carbon back into the atmosphere,” says Sophie Wilkinson, a wildfire scientist at McMaster University who studies peat fires but wasn’t involved in this new work.

For now, researchers have demonstrated the effect in the lab, but the next step is to try it on a controlled outdoor burn. Combined with the researchers’ previous work modeling how peat fires spread, the discovery could give firefighters a powerful weapon for putting down zombie fires. The team can build “what if” scenarios for, say, fighting fires burning in Indonesia, and offer advice on how to distribute resources when quashing a particular fire.

“There is no positive outcome of peat burning,” says Rein. “Now we have an understanding of how to suppress them.”","Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GettyImages-103186468.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['rein', 'firefighters', 'peat', 'surfactant', 'smoldering', 'soil', 'work', 'wouldnt', 'zombie', 'dieuntil', 'fires', 'water', 'carbonbelching']",none

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has announced a £150 million funding package to be shared between 25 local schemes aiming to improve waterway defences and coastal resilience.

This is part of the Government’s new Flood and Coastal Resilience Innovation Programme – an effort to develop and test new approaches to tackling coastal erosion and mainland flooding – and will be managed by the Environment Agency.

A wide range of approaches tailored to local communities will be trialled, including the restoration of sub-tidal habitats like kelp beds, oyster reefs and sea grass near South Tyneside, and an app to warn residents about the threat of groundwater in Buckinghamshire.

Artificial intelligence and new sensor technology to detect rising water levels will be used in Northumberland, and in Cornwall sand dunes will be protected and saltmarshes restored.

In Slough, the Chinese “sponge city” concept will be deployed, which is the use of permeable roads to soak up surface water, along with natural vegetation to improve drainage.

Environment minister Rebecca Pow said the Government has pledged to invest £5.2 billion in 2,000 new flood and coastal defences over the next six years, adding that “long-term approaches to improve communities’ resilience” is vital in the face of climate change.

She said: “These 25 projects will not only help to inform future approaches to prepare communities for flooding and coastal change across the country, but also help reinforce the UK’s position as a world leader in innovation and new technology as we build back better.”

Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said the project is “extremely exciting” and could be replicated on a larger scale around the world if successful.

She said: “The innovation programme is extremely exciting as it begins to put new aspects of the national flood and coastal erosion risk strategy to the test.

Andi Jatmiko, The Associated Press





JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian navy divers have recovered the cockpit voice recorder of a Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea in January, killing all 62 people on board, officials said Wednesday.

Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said divers retrieved the cockpit recorder at about 08.00 p.m. Tuesday local time, near where the flight data recorder was recovered three days after the accident.

The contents of the recorder were not immediately available. However, the device could help investigators determine what caused the Boeing 737-500 to nosedive into the ocean in heavy rain shortly after it took off from Jakarta on Jan. 9.

If the voice recorder is undamaged, it might tell investigators what the pilots were doing - or failing to do - to regain control of the plane during its brief, erratic flight.

Searchers have recovered plane parts and human remains from an area between Lancang and Laki islands in the Thousand Island chain, just north of Jakarta. The flight data recorder tracked hundreds of parameters showing how the plane was being operated.

Most retrieval efforts ended about two weeks after the crash, but a limited search is continuing for the missing memory unit of the cockpit voice recorder, which apparently broke away from other parts of the device during the crash.

The bright orange voice recorder was taken to Jakarta and given to the National Transportation Safety Committee, which is overseeing the accident investigation.

“We hope the KNKT could share information about what is contained in this VCR to improve our aviation safety,” Sumadi said, referring to Indonesian acronym for the transportation committee.

The KNKT chairman, Soerjanto Tjahjono, said the device will be taken to the investigators' “black box” facility. It will take five to seven days to dry and clean the device and to download its data, he said.

“Without the CVR . . . it would be difficult to determine the cause of the plane crash,” Tjahjono said, “We would disclose it transparently to avoid similar accidents in the future.”

Rear Adm. Abdul Rasyid Kacong, the navy's western region fleet commander, said the voice recorder was buried under 1 metre (3 feet) of seabed mud at a depth of 23 metres (75 feet). Divers removed debris and carried out “desludging” operations to reach the voice recorder, he said.

Data from a preliminary investigation report, which didn't state any conclusions, showed that the plane's left engine's throttle lever moved backward on its own while the autopilot was engaged, reducing the power output of that engine before the jet plunged into the sea.

That report provided new details on persistent problems with an autothrottle on the 737-500 Sriwijaya Air jet and the airline's efforts to fix them. An autothrottle can be used by pilots to set the speed automatically, thereby reducing workload and wear on the engines.

It also might help answer questions for those who lost people in the disaster.

“I warmly welcome the CVR finding . . . this is some relief from our despair,” said Rafik Yusuf Alaydrus, whose wife Panca Widia Nursanti, a teacher, died in the crash.

“We hope this could answer what caused the crash, especially for us who lost our loved ones,” he said.

The 26-year-old jet had been out of service for almost nine months because of flight cutbacks due to the pandemic before resuming commercial flights in December.

The disaster has reignited concerns about safety in the aviation industry, which has grown quickly along with the economy since the fall of dictator Suharto in the late 1990s. The United States banned Indonesian carriers from operating in the country in 2007 but lifted that restriction in 2016, citing improved compliance with international aviation standards. The European Union lifted a similar ban in 2018.

Sriwijaya Air had had only minor safety incidents in the past, though a farmer was killed in 2008 when a plane went off the runway while landing due to a hydraulic issue.

In 2018, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 jet operated by Lion Air crashed shortly after taking off from the airport in Jakarta, killing 189 people. An automated flight-control system played a role in that crash, but the Sriwijaya Air jet did not have that system.

Huawei Tech Investment, also known as Huawei Indonesia, a local arm of the Chinese tech giant, has launched a series of campaigns to give back to the Indonesian community, recognizing a need to create shared value and support economic, social, and environmental progress.

Huawei had launched the “I Do” campaigns last year to tackle many issues, Jacky Chen, Huawei Indonesia's chief executive officer (CEO), said on Thursday.

“We have been rooted in this beautiful land for more than 20 years, and we’ve grown together with Indonesia and Indonesian people. At this new point, we want to give more in return than take,"" Chen said.

“Through “I Do Contribute,” we strive to find ways out through the latest technologies to accelerate Indonesian economic recovery in the post-pandemic scenario. We also launched a program to cultivate 100,000 Indonesian digital talents for 5 years to build a solid foundation for future-ready human capital,” he said.

A team of Huawei technicians took on the task to restore Jakarta's communication network early last year when the capital experienced the worst flooding in more than 154 years that saw 50 deaths and 170,000 displaced from their homes.

The initiative was under Huawei's ""I Do Care"" campaign that also provides relief aid for the flood victims.

“We shared our happiness to the needy during Ramadan by paying visits and donations to 30 orphanages in 15 cities across the archipelago,” Jacky said.

Under “I Do Collaborate,” Huawei worked with the government, business communities, and key stakeholders to accelerate digital transformation in Indonesia.

During the pandemic, Huawei's “I Do Create” campaign enhanced government institutions', enterprises', and hospitals' operation with the implementation of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, and cloud computing platform.

The company had also given more than 1,000 cloud accounts for free to 500 universities across Indonesia to support the “Never Stop Learning” initiative in distant learning and digital transformation, Chen said.","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://img.beritasatu.com/cache/jakartaglobe/640x441-4/2021/04/1617248239.jpg,"['chen', 'transformation', 'digital', 'launched', 'shared', 'indonesia', 'indonesian', 'tech', 'support', 'huawei']",none
59,59,FL-2021-000030-IDN,New promise of forecasting meteotsunamis: Photographer's images aid research of rare Great Lakes wave - Science Daily,https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210401151245.htm,"On the afternoon of April 13, 2018, a large wave of water surged across Lake Michigan and flooded the shores of the picturesque beach town of Ludington, Michigan, damaging homes and boat docks, and flooding intake pipes. Thanks to a local citizen's photos and other data, NOAA scientists reconstructed the event in models and determined this was the first ever documented meteotsunami in the Great Lakes caused by an atmospheric inertia-gravity wave.

An atmospheric inertia-gravity wave is a wave of air that can run from 6 to 60 miles long that is created when a mass of stable air is displaced by an air mass with significantly different pressure. This sets in motion a wave of air with rising and falling pressure that can influence the water below, as it synchronizes with water movement on the lake's surface like two singers harmonizing.

""That meteotsunami was hands down off the chart awesome,"" said Debbie Maglothin of Ludington who took photos of the event. ""The water in between the breakwaters didn't go down like the water on the outside of them, so it created waterfalls that cascaded over the breakwaters. Had this event occurred during summer it could have washed people right off the breakwaters.""

Meteotsunamis generated from this type atmospheric condition are common around the globe, but in the Great Lakes, the few well documented meteotsunamis have been driven by sudden severe thunderstorms where both winds and air pressure changes have played significant roles.

Combining water and weather models

While there are currently no forecast models that effectively predict meteotsunamis in the U.S., new NOAA research based on the Ludington wave demonstrates that existing NOAA numerical weather prediction models and hydrodynamic forecast models may enable scientists to predict these meteotsunami-driving atmospheric waves minutes to hours in advance. The research is published in a special edition of the journal Natural Hazards about meteotsunamis.

""The good news with this type of meteotsunami is that it is easier to predict than ones triggered by thunderstorms,"" said Eric Anderson, an oceanographer at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory and lead author of the study. ""Our short-range weather models can pick up these atmospheric pressure waves, whereas predicting thunderstorms is more difficult.""

Meteotsunamis are a lesser known category of tsunami. Unlike the more well known tsunami -- such as the catastrophic 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia, which was caused by an earthquake on the seafloor, meteotsunamis are caused by weather, in particular some combination of changing air pressure, strong winds and thunderstorm activity.

""Because the lakes are relatively small, meteotsunamis typically need more than a jump in air pressure to drive them,"" said Anderson. ""That's where the thunderstorms and wind come in to give them a push.""

Great Lakes have history of meteotsunamis

Meteotsunamis occur around the world, and are known to occur in the United States primarily on the Great Lakes and along the East and Gulf of Mexico coasts. Meteotsunami waves in the Great Lakes can be particularly insidious because they can bounce off the shoreline and come back again when the skies are clear. They are relatively rare and typically small, the largest producing three to six foot waves, which only occur about once every 10 years.

Predicting these waves in advance would give communities potentially life-saving warnings and would allow residents and businesses to take measures to better protect property. The Ludington meteotsunami resulted in some property damage but no serious injuries. Had the meteotsunami struck in the summer when swimmers, anglers and vacationers flock to the lakeshore beaches, parks and waters, it might have been a different story, as was the case with a meteotsunami that took the lives of eight people in Chicago in June 1954.

""It's a gap in our forecasting,"" said Anderson. ""With this study and other research we are getting closer to being able to predict them in advance.""","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['rare', 'promise', 'forecasting', 'images', 'research', 'waves', 'pressure', 'water', 'meteotsunamis', 'wave', 'atmospheric', 'photographers', 'great', 'models', 'air', 'meteotsunami', 'lakes']",flood

61,61,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Ensuring Biden's Infrastructure Plan Accounts for Climate Risks — and Saves Money - BRINK,https://www.brinknews.com/ensuring-bidens-infrastructure-plan-accounts-for-climate-risks-and-saves-money/,"Photo: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images

The U.S. administration, led by President Joseph Biden, is proposing a massive infrastructure plan to replace the nation’s crumbling bridges, roads and other critical structures. But to make those investments pay off, the U.S. will need designs that can endure the changing climate.

Most U.S. infrastructure is designed to stand for decades, including through what engineers expect to be rare storms and floods.

However, extreme storms that were considered rare a few decades years ago are already becoming more common. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was the Houston area’s third “500-year flood” in three years, and it was followed by two more major flooding events.

Building infrastructure today that will be strong enough to manage the extreme scenarios the nation might see a century from now can be expensive. But what if infrastructure were instead designed to meet shorter-term needs and also be easily adapted later for the future climate?

Methods surrounding infrastructure design in the Netherlands — where dams and storm surge barriers are being designed to be adaptable — hold lessons for the U.S. as it prepares for a wave of new construction.

The Problem with Building for 100-Year Floods

Bridges in the U.S. are typically designed to allow the unimpeded passage of floods that have a 1-in-100 chance of happening each year. Similarly, a dam spillway might be built to handle a 10,000-year flood, and stormwater drains for two-year rainfall events.

These “return periods” are traditionally calculated using a method based on historical statistics that assume the climate doesn’t change much.

In a warming climate with more extreme rainfall, worsening droughts and rising sea levels, these historical statistics can underestimate the intensity of future floods that puts critical infrastructure, homes and lives in danger.

Putting Adaptive Design to Work

The Dutch are masters of flood control. When about a third of a country sits below sea level, it becomes a necessity. U.S. engineers have been turning to them for advice in recent years as understanding of climate change and its impact on storms and sea level rise increases.

The Netherlands’ innovative designs, like the giant gates of the Maeslant flood defense, are getting noticed, but equally important is how the Dutch use adaptive designs to prepare for the future and keep costs under control.

To see adaptive design at work, look at the renovation underway of the Afsluitdijk, a 20-mile-long dam that protects Amsterdam’s port from storm surges on the North Sea. When the dam was completed in 1932, it drained river water to the sea by gravity at low tide. However, sea level rise, combined with the need to keep the water level in Amsterdam’s port low to protect the city, are making drainage by gravity alone increasingly ineffective.

By using adaptive design techniques to manage climate risks, infrastructure will be more cost-efficient to face an uncertain future.

To update the dam, the Dutch have built pump stations for draining water into the North Sea. Importantly, the new design reserves enough land to expand the existing pump stations or build new ones when future storms and sea level rise make it necessary.

Lessons As the U.S. Plans New Coastal Protections

Several U.S. cities, including Houston, New York and Boston, are now considering hurricane defense systems — the future protection they will actually need to prevent flooding is unknown at this point.

By using adaptive design, they could include room for expanding those defenses as the climate changes.

That might mean building earthen dams and levees wide enough to allow for raising them when necessary, and reserving land for widening and heightening of coastal dunes that form part of the system and for adding pump infrastructure.

Crucially, movable storm surge barriers, which typically make up a short section of a barrier system, offer protection only from sporadic hurricanes and not from long-term sea level rise. The movable barriers may eventually need to be replaced with a dam, shipping lock and drainage pumps — that, too, can be planned for.

By starting with an adaptive design, the U.S. can save billions of dollars compared with having to build new systems decades down the road. The recent renovations of California’s Folsom Dam, built in 1955, illustrate that cost. A new spillway completed in 2018 cost $900 million — with inflation, that’s about the original cost of the entire dam.

Adapting for Mississippi River Flooding

When Dutch engineers plan new levees, storm surge barriers and river locks, they consider what are known as the Delta Scenarios — four possible futures for flood risk and sea level rise, ranging from moderate to extreme global warming. These scenarios create a framework for adaptive design.

For example, a complex of locks on the Meuse River, used to raise and lower ships and barges as they travel up- or downstream, needs to be replaced or rehabilitated. A new lock complex must have enough sluice gates, which can be closed or opened to allow high water through after storms, so the water doesn’t flood surrounding farms and cities. The accompanying weir — the low dam that raises the river’s level — must be high enough to retain enough water for ship operations during times of drought.

Building a tall weir with many sluice gates, and raising riverbank levees to match, would allow the lock complex to manage future climate scenarios, but that would be expensive. With adaptive design, the complex can instead be built to be easily modified later to meet changing climate needs. That includes reserving space for additional sluice gates and designing gates that can be made taller by welding on additional components as needed.

On the Mississippi River and its tributaries, many of the old lock complexes that raise and lower the barges carrying agricultural products and industrial materials are now undergoing replacement. Using similar adaptive design techniques would be a cost-efficient way to face an uncertain future.

BANGKOK (Reuters) – Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is “gravely concerned” about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.

That leaves Thailand out of step with some members of the 10-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator.

“(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner,” Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.

The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to “support democracy” within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Prayuth, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019 and rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.

The personal relationship began much earlier: within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.

In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand’s King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant “in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military,” the Bangkok Post said at the time.

BROTHERHOOD

“For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important,” said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand’s Kasetsart University.

“I don’t think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees…I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more.”

Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400-km (1,500-mile) border that is also Myanmar’s longest with any neighbour.

The geographical position, and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup – only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar’s crackdown on anti-coup protesters.

Thailand’s wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar’s forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar’s wars in previous decades.

Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.

GESTURES

While Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayuth’s government was unlikely to be moved.

“They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that’s it.”

Business links are also strong.

Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.

Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers – who officially number 1.6 million.

Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.

But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.

He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar’s generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors.

“If you have one friend you’ve known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn’t mean you won’t be friends with him, right?” he said.

“You are still friends, but the best thing is to talk to him, to show that the thing he has done is very wrong.”

A major state of emergency was declared in Timor-Leste overnight after torrential rain led to flash flooding and landslides, a situation exacerbated by an alarming COVID-19 outbreak that sent much of the country into an extended lockdown last month. Mollymook local and former UN Peacekeeper Grant Schultz lived and worked in Timor-Leste and said photos of the flooding were extraordinary. ""It's a double blow for people in Timor-Leste, particularly in Dili which seems to have suffered the worst flooding, as the COVID infection rates are skyrocketing, and vaccinations due to be rolled out are now at risk because there is no refrigeration due to power cuts,"" he said. ""I recognise some of those Dili streets and to see that amount of water is just extraordinary, locals are used to heavy downpours during the wet season but certainly nothing like this."" Mr Schultz encouraged people to donate what they could to an online fundraiser for the flood victims. ""Timor is only a 45 minute flight from Darwin and we've got a long history of those people looking after Australia in World War II, at great personal sacrifice to themselves,"" he said. ""It's important to support them in times of need, particularly as they deal with these floods and a COVID outbreak at the same time. ""If people can dig deep into the pockets and find a few dollars, every little bit counts."" On Monday, authorities confirmed 11 people were killed in Dili with 6,000 left homeless and warned those numbers could increase as the country grappled with the heaviest rainfalls in recent history. The National Directorate of Civil Protection told Portuguese News Agency Lusa ""the whole city is a disaster zone"" and it was not yet possible to determine the number of victims. Dili, the capital of Timor-Leste, and neighbouring Flores Island in Indonesia were reported to be the hardest hit by three days of torrential rain which caused floods and landslides and cut power supplies and communications. Timor-Leste was also due to receive its first COVAX vaccines this week but the medical supplies storage depot where they were supposed to be stored was flooded. The fundraising webpage, established by Timor Awakening director Michael Stone, raised more than $20,000 in the 20 hours following the Easter Sunday flooding event, and the organisation appealed to the Australian government to provide humanitarian assistance. ""I hope in this time of dire need our great country Australia, with one of the best humanitarian and disaster relief capabilities in the world, together with our friends in New Zealand and other good neighbours, can provide a co-ordinated disaster relief effort, including the protection of the front line workers,"" Mr Stone wrote in a Facebook post.

66,66,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Can Myanmar's Protesters Win? – The Diplomat - The Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2021/04/can-myanmars-protesters-win/,"They are up against a ruthless, entrenched military. But history tells us not to underestimate the power of the people.

Nobody – least of all the Tatmadaw, Myanmar’s military – could have imagined that the February coup in Myanmar would trigger such a flood of outrage, mass civil disobedience, and the forging of a multi-ethnic alliance across the nation.

Most Myanmar experts from the region’s plethora of think tanks would have scoffed at the suggestion that even two months after the coup, Myanmar’s military would not have been able to crush the revolt.

The heady days of the protest are best described by long-time analyst and ex-political prisoner Dr. Khin Zaw Win, writing for openDemocracy: “The protests are marked by their size as well as diversity. It is truly amazing to witness people from different ethnicities, faiths, and occupations from everywhere in Myanmar coming together in a single purpose – to bring down the dictatorship.”

Khin Zaw Win, the director of the Tampadipa Institute in Yangon, also observed that even the much-persecuted Rohingya are included in the movement: “Long-suppressed voices like those of the Rohingya and Muslims are now being seen and heard prominently, and women are participating in strength.”

The regime has unquestionably been weakened by the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) that mushroomed all over the country after the coup. The nationwide non-compliance has throttled almost all sectors, from government administration to banks and the rest of the economy.

The military has responded with force. A brutal crackdown has turned parts of Yangon and Mandalay into war zones in the last two weeks. The civilian death toll of both protesters and hapless bystanders has surpassed 536, with 2,600 people detained.

A Myanmar specialist at Chiang Mai University, Dr. Ashley South, told The Diplomat that, despite the repression, “It is impossible for the junta to normalize this coup. Schools have closed down. It is amazing the only functioning schools in Myanmar today are in the liberated zones of ethnic armies such as the KNU [Karen National Union] and parts of Kachin, Mon, and Shan States.”

On the day of the coup, most the senior National League for Democracy (NLD) leaders were detained, but a number of members of parliament escaped from the capital, Naypyidaw, and set up a an anti-coup Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), as Myanmar’s parliament is known. The committee claims to be the legitimate government as a representative of the NLD government that was re-elected in a landslide in the 2020 polls.

Amid the brutal crackdown, thousands have left the cities and headed for ethnic states. The CRPH has joined thousands of urban activists in fleeing from the military raids in urban areas on a mission to develop a parallel clandestine government, now being set up in under the protection of the ethnic peoples’ movements.

However a series of air strikes on Karen villages near the Karen National Liberation Army’s 5th Brigade sent more than 5,000 villagers fleeing to the Thai border seeking aid and sanctuary. This raises serious doubts as to the degree of protection ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) can provide against a major Tatmadaw offensive.

The KNU has also recommended that urban activists who wish to take up arms do not visit their areas, as they are already stretched to supply Karen people with food, shelter, and security, now with the additional influx of over a thousand refugees from the cities.

General Min Aung Hlaing’s regime has struggled to establish a functioning administration at home, while on the international front few countries have so far formally recognized Naypyidaw’s new regime.

The U.N. secretary general has strongly pledged to work for the restoration of democracy. His special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, has warned that no country should recognize or legitimize the junta

However the warning did not stop the representatives of eight countries from attending a Myanmar Armed Forces Day parade on March 27 – the same day the nation mourned the killing by police and military of 114 people, including bystanders and children.

Russia and China, major arms suppliers to the Tatmadaw, attended the event, along with India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Among Myanmar’s nine fellow member states of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN), only Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam attended. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, which have expressed alarm over the shooting of unarmed demonstrators, were conspicuously absent.

Meanwhile, a major international lobbying battle over which government will represent the people of Myanmar is likely unfold in the coming months leading to the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting in September.

Myanmar’s current ambassador to the United Nations, Kyaw Moe Tun, has lambasted the regime back home, making a passionate speech urging the U.N. to use “any means necessary to overturn the military coup.”

Despite being fired by the junta, Kyaw Moe Tun continues to work for U.N. recognition of the CRPH government. Many Myanmar diplomats abroad have also affirmed their allegiance to the ousted democratic government that appointed them.

There are various precedents for recognizing the CRPH as the legitimate government. The U.N. credentials committee will no doubt be reminded of the U.N. General Assembly verdict on the Cambodia seat in 1979 after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge, and its ongoing recognition of a Cambodian coalition government in exile. This controversial precedent could be adapted to deny the U.N. seat to a regime that is driving Myanmar toward civil war.

However the clinching argument should be that the new head of state in Myanmar, Sen. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, was cited as the general who ordered the ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar’s west, according to a U.N. Fact-Finding Mission report published in 2018.

The U.N. report stated that “Myanmar’s top military generals, including Commander-in-Chief Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine State, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan States.”

If the junta cannot persuade the U.N. General Assembly to accept its credentials, that will be a huge victory for a CRPH parallel government. Even if China and Russia try to block this move, there could be a compromise option of leaving the seat vacant until democracy is restored.

The hopelessly unrealistic expectations of a speedy U.N. intervention or ASEAN pressure to halt the bloodshed are fast fading. The R2P (responsibility to protect) slogans seen on many protest posters and placards in the streets of Yangon represent a desperate appeal for U.N. humanitarian intervention, but so far the protocol has never been used to prevent to prevent crimes against humanity from taking place.

However, South argues that R2P status could be applied to the only organizations currently protecting civilians in Myanmar – the EAOs. “As the U.N. seems unable to protect the people of Myanmar,” South proposes, “it is imperative to recognize and support EAOs, who are struggling to provide assistance and protection both to ethnic nationality civilians targeted by the Myanmar Army, and to those fleeing from the SAC junta’s murderous violence in the towns and cities.”

As the killing continues unabated and U.N. action is blocked by Russia and China, this idea could have a special relevance as Myanmar moves dangerously close to civil war. A new humanitarian crisis is looming along the Thai-Burmese border after a several air force planes bombed Karen villages in zones patrolled by ethnic soldiers belonging to the Karen National Liberation Army. Thailand accepted 3,000 refugees on a temporary basis, but turned back another 2,000.

Western analysts and risk consultancies have generally concluded that despite the bravery and tenacity of Myanmar’s People Power, their struggle is doomed to defeat, given they are pitted against a ruthless military caste that has run the country for the last 70 years.

I recall how many diplomats and analysts routinely expressed the same attitude toward East Timor’s demands for independence, as if ending the Indonesian occupation was some absurd fantasy. I was told it would never happen. But by 2000 it had happened, and East Timor – now Timor-Leste – became the first new state of the 21st century.

Long–running dictatorships in Indonesia and Philippines were also overthrown by a combination of “people’s power” and other factors.

In the case of the Philippines, the defection of Gen. Fidel Ramos and the defense minister expedited the downfall of the dictator President Ferdinand Marcos. The United States then crafted the end-game. Marcos and his family were extracted from Manila in a U.S. helicopter, providing a safe exit to Hawaii.

Clearly a precise replica of that end-game is not possible in the case of Min Aung Hlaing and his junta. However, the defections of more than 600 police officers to the side of the CDM offers evidence that demoralization can happen side-by-side with brutal repression.

In just two months it is hardly surprising that the protest movement, despite massively successful boycotts and a general strike, has yet to topple one of Asia’s most entrenched and feared armed forces. But what they have achieved is the isolation of the regime, which is now floundering in a post-coup quagmire and hoping to somehow shoot their way out of the crisis.

No one knows if there are army captains or colonels who enjoyed Myanmar’s period of opening up and the economic growth of the last decade from 2011 until the coup – and are now seething with a secret anger. Are they quietly calculating the right moment to join the Spring Revolution, either as defectors or leaders of a mutiny?

What will be the end-game in Myanmar? It’s too soon to tell, but history has taught us not to count out the determination of the people, whether in Myanmar, the Philippines, or Timor-Leste. It could still be that Min Aung Hlaing is the one left scrambling for an exit strategy when all is said and done.","Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat-2021-03-31-1.jpg,"['win', 'min', 'protesters', 'karen', 'coup', 'ethnic', 'general', 'myanmar', 'military', 'myanmars', 'regime', 'crph']",none

Domestic violence surge in SA during pandemic

Newly released police data has revealed a surge in domestic violence assaults during South Australia’s COVID-19 lockdowns and periods of heightened restrictions.

According to the South Australian Police figures, there were 9,526 domestic violence assaults reported to police in 2020 compared to 8,587 in 2019 — an increase of 11 per cent.

There was a particularly pronounced spike in the six months South Australians were encouraged to stay inside from March to August, with an additional 440 reports of DV assaults compared to the same period in 2019.

White Ribbon Australia executive director Brad Chilcott said the figures should compel the South Australian Government to treat the situation as an emergency and immediately put more resources into housing for women and safety services.

The rise in incidents matches similar spikes around the country and globally.

A survey by the Australian Institute of Criminology in 2020 revealed almost 10% of Australian women in a relationship had experienced domestic violence during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, with two-thirds of those women reporting the attacks started or became worse during this period.

The United Nations has declared the global surge in violence against women a “shadow pandemic”.

People who feel concerned should contact the 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) phone number, DV Crisis Line on 1800 800 098, or contact SAPOL through 131 444 or Triple 000 if it is an emergency.

Ardern to reveal bubble opening on Tuesday

After months of planning, abandoned deadlines, dashed hopes and lingering doubts, the time may finally have come for the trans-Tasman travel bubble.

On Tuesday, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s cabinet is expected to sign off on an opening date for quarantine-free travel from Australia.

For separated families and tourism-reliant industries, pre-COVID travel rules can’t come soon enough.

Ms Ardern has walked away from two previous deadlines to create the bubble.

Last month, under pressure from her political opponents, Ms Ardern pledged to give a new start date on April 6.

Government officials have been tinkering with plans, including regulations for airports, airlines, how to contact trace Kiwis while overseas, and response protocols to Australian outbreaks.

One of the conditions of the plan is a separation of airports into ‘green zones’ for quarantine-free flights and ‘red zones’ for flights carrying passengers from countries with COVID in the community.

Airport executives say they ll be ready from mid-April, and health officials are due to inspect Auckland Airport this week with a view to clearing the country’s biggest airport for takeoff.

The NZ Herald reports Air New Zealand is planning on adding additional quarantine-free flights from Auckland to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane from next week.

The national carrier hopes to fly from NZ’s three other international airports, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown, when the bubble is announced.

Most Australian states have allowed Kiwis to visit without the need for a fortnight of hotel quarantine for months.

Australian couple freed in Myanmar

An Australian couple has been freed from house arrest in Myanmar and allowed to leave the country without charge.

Business consultants Christa Avery and her husband Matthew O’Kane were refused permission to leave Myanmar last month when they were about to board a flight home.

The country has been in turmoil since a military coup on February 1 that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

“I am, of course, incredibly relieved to have been released and to be on my way home with my husband Matt,” Avery said in a statement.

“Even though I knew that I had done nothing wrong, it was very stressful being held under house arrest for 2 weeks.”

Another Australian, Sean Turnell, an economic adviser to Suu Kyi, has been detained since shortly after the army seized power and is in prison.

“I hope that even if Sean cannot be released very soon, he can, at least, be moved to house arrest for his physical, mental and emotional wellbeing,” Avery said.

Authorities have said Turnell is under investigation, but no charge has been announced against him.

A lawyer for Suu Kyi said last week that he understood Turnell faced charges under the Official Secrets Act, but no charges have been confirmed.

More than 2500 people have been detained since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners monitoring group.

Thousands of protesters again took to the streets over the weekend, with demonstrators inscribing messages of protest on Easter eggs.

Messages including “Spring Revolution”, “We must win” and “Get out MAH” – referring to junta leader Min Aung Hlaing – were seen on eggs held in the air by protesters in photographs on social media on Sunday.

SA coronavirus patient in critical condition

A man rushed from hotel quarantine to the Royal Adelaide Hospital on the weekend is in critical condition.

The ill expatriate in his 40s, who is believed to have the South African strain of COVID-19, reported difficulty breathing and was moved to the hospital on Saturday.

He is understood to be the first COVID-19 patient in the hospital’s intensive care unit since May.

Australian Medical Association (AMA) South Australia president Chris Moy told the ABC he felt for the family of the man.

“My thoughts go out to the individual and their family — they’d be very, very worried at the moment. For them, COVID and the serious complications of COVID are real,” he said.

He warned that the increased infectivity of new strains such as the South African variant meant there was a higher risk of the virus “escaping” from controlled settings, and that South Australians should not get complacent about restrictions even as the vaccine is rolled out.

According to figures released on Sunday, 145 vaccinations were administered across the state the previous day.

South Australia reported a new case in hotel quarantine on Sunday in a young girl returned from overseas.

“She is considered an old infection but has been added to our case numbers as she has not been diagnosed and counted overseas,” SA Health said.

Labor wants new vaccine rollout timetable

Labor is demanding the Morrison government provide a new set of target dates for the vaccine rollout, saying it has made a mess of the timetable so far.

But Health Minister Greg Hunt insists as the domestic supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine from CSL ramps up, so will the vaccine program, although he is vague on the precise timetable.

The daily rate of vaccinations is increasing with over 79,000 completed on Thursday, compared with 55,000 on Monday last week.

But that brought the total number of Australians vaccinated to just 841,855, well short of the four million by the end of March once promised by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

“The Morrison Government is making a mess of this vaccine rollout and Australians expect and deserve clearer answers on when they are going to get the vaccine,” Labor’s health spokesman Mark Butler told reporters in Adelaide on Sunday.

He said just 14 per cent of those in aged care have received their two doses of the vaccine, when that program was also supposed to be finished last week.

“Australians want to know when their loved ones who might be in aged care facilities are going to get vaccinated because they know they are the most vulnerable people in our community,” Mr Butler said.

Mr Hunt defended the progress made so far and is confident that everyone that wants to get vaccinated will have their first dose by October.

He said there were three initial targets – to start the 1a Pfizer vaccinations in late February, to commence the 1a AstraZeneca rollout in in early March and to begin the 1b program on March 22.

“The principal three targets in terms of those commencement dates started exactly as we intended and then the other major goal for Australia is the end of October for all first doses,” Mr Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.

NSW boat explosion leaves four critical

A boat has exploded on the Hawkesbury River north of Sydney, leaving four people fighting for life with critical burns.

Eight people suffered burns and smoke inhalation in the explosion at Brooklyn near Danger Island on Sunday afternoon.

NSW Ambulance confirmed four of those on board were critically injured in the Easter Sunday incident that drew at least a dozen emergency crews.

They were taken to Royal North Shore Hospital under police escort.

Another two patients were transferred to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition, while the remaining two others were treated at the scene.

Fire and Rescue NSW said firefighters were tasked with driving ambulances to allow paramedics to treat patients in transit because of the seriousness of their injuries.

The vessel has sunk in shallow water with a slow fuel leak, with hazardous materials experts called in to contain it.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Pope slams weapons spending in Easter message

Pope Francis has urged countries in his Easter message to quicken distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly to the world’s poor, and called armed conflict and military spending during a pandemic “scandalous”.

Coronavirus has meant this has been the second year in a row that Easter papal services have been attended by small gatherings at a secondary altar of St Peter’s Basilica, instead of by crowds in the church or in the square outside.

After saying Mass on Sunday, Francis read his “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message, in which he traditionally reviews world problems and appeals for peace.

“The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nonetheless – and this is scandalous – armed conflicts have not ended and military arsenals are being strengthened,” he said.

Francis, who would usually have given the address to up to 100,000 people in St Peter’s Square, spoke to fewer than 200 in the church while the message was broadcast to tens of millions around the world.

The square was empty except for a few police officers enforcing a strict three-day national lockdown.

Facebook data on over 500m accounts found

Details from more than 500 million Facebook users have been found available on a website for hackers.

The information appears to be several years old, but it is another example of the vast amount of information collected by Facebook and other social media sites, and the limits to how secure that information is.

The availability of the data set was first reported by Business Insider. According to that publication, it has information from 106 countries including phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, and email addresses.

Facebook has been grappling with data security issues for years. In 2018, the social media giant disabled a feature that allowed users to search for one another via phone number following revelations that the political firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed information on up to 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge or consent.

In December 2019, a Ukrainian security researcher reported finding a database with the names, phone numbers and unique user IDs of more than 267 million Facebook users – nearly all US-based – on the open internet. It is unclear if the current data dump is related to this database.

Deadly floods, landslides in Indonesia

Flash floods unleashed by torrential rains have killed 41 people on the Indonesian island of Flores, the disaster management agency BNPB says, and at least three more were reported killed in neighbouring East Timor.

At least 49 families were hit on Flores, in the east of Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago, Raditya Jati, a BNPB spokesman said in a statement on Sunday.

“Dozens of houses were buried in mud in Lamanele village… residents’ houses washed away by the flood,” Raditya said, referring to the eastern part of Flores.

On Adonara island to the east of Flores, a bridge collapsed and rescuers were battling heavy rain, strong wind and waves, he added.

In East Timor, a two-year-old child was among at least three people killed in a landslide on the outskirts of the capital, Dili, a Reuters witness said, although there was no official toll of casualties or deaths.

“Heavy rains and overflowing water have drowned people’s homes and have also claimed the lives of several victims,” East Timor deputy prime minister Jose Reis said in a statement.

Power supplies were cut and the presidential palace was flooded as heavy rain and strong winds have lashed Dili since late on Saturday.

Outrage over ‘secret restaurants’ in Paris

France is in an uproar over a television report about secret meals in luxury restaurants in breach of COVID-19 restrictions – and now the authorities have become involved.

The report by channel M6 shows, for one thing, a secret high-end restaurant in Paris open despite the coronavirus measures.

“I have eaten this week in two or three restaurants that are so-called illegal restaurants with a number of ministers,” a man introduced as an organiser of a secret party says in the report.

The Paris prosecutor’s office launched an investigation on Sunday.

“The aim of the investigation is to verify whether parties were organised in violation of health regulations and to determine who the organisers and participants may have been,” it said.

Restaurants in France were closed at the end of October because of the pandemic.

“People who come here take off their masks,” says an unrecognisable staff member.

“Once you are through the door here, there is no COVID.”

The coronavirus situation in France is extremely tense, with new nationwide restrictions only coming into force at the weekend.

SA with edge over Victoria in Shield clash

Victoria were all start but not much finish as they struggled to match South Australia’s first innings 333 in their Sheffield Shield clash.

At stumps on day two at St Kilda’s Junction Oval, Victoria were 7-201 with Sam Harper (25) and Mitchell Perry (4) the not out batsmen.

Much like the Redbacks, the Victorian batsmen largely failed to go on with the job after solid enough starts.

Things started poorly when Travis Dean lasted just two balls, dismissed lbw to the retiring Chadd Sayers (1-22) for a duck.

Marcus Harris (42) and Peter Handscomb (26) kept the score ticking over before falling to Travis Head and David Grant respectively.

Despite a handy 60 from James Seymour, the Bushrangers mostly struggled from there as they slipped from 3-161.

Earlier, spinner Sam Kerber (55) hung in for a bright half century for the Redbacks to help bolster their total.

He was one of seven batsmen to score 25 or more for SA.

The reliable Head had top-scored with 76.

Truck movements around southern Queensland continue to be restricted as floods subside and roads are repaired but grain movements are getting back to normal. Some roads remain closed around Condamine, Bungunya, Goondiwindi and Tallwood but the logistics concerns have eased considerably from last week.

Rail lines form Moree to Narrabri have also reopened as the flood waters south of Moree retreated which allows trains to Newcastle to resume.

Local grain markets finished the week steady to mixed as traders contend with logistical and quality difficulties.

Sprouting has been a problem for sorghum, which has seen some loading being downgraded. Sprouting problems are expected to increase when harvest resumes after the recent torrential rains.

Sorghum is holding at $300 delivered into the Downs for an April delivery while barley was down $5 to $263. Stockfeed wheat was steady at $287 delivered.

Australia exported a record monthly high 2.68 million tonnes of wheat in February, exceeding the previous monthly high of 2.57mt set in May 2017. The record monthly wheat shipments were up from 2.4mt in January and about 2.5mt in December.

WA was the single largest export state in February with just under 1mt of wheat shipments, aided by large contributions from NSW, Victoria, and SA.

Queensland exported around 110,000 tonnes of wheat in February, lifting the total November to February shipments to 375,000t.

Indonesia was Australia's largest wheat export destination in February, taking 420,000t, followed by Vietnam and the Philippines.

February barley exports from Australia reached 930,000t. Saudi Arabia has emerged as Australia's largest destination after China introduced import taxes on Australian barley, with imports of almost 1.5mt of barley to Saudi Arabia since October.

It was a choppy week for global grain markets where international wheat markets slipped lower while feed grain prices moved higher.

Improving northern hemisphere winter wheat production prospects pressured global cash markets lower. Conversely, US corn markets rallied after the USDA released survey results that showed farmers intend to plant less corn than expected.

As rapid Covid-19 vaccine campaigns in the U.S. and some other rich countries hold the promise of a return to more normal life for their citizens, some countries, particularly poor ones, face a starkly different reality: soaring coronavirus cases, including new highs, more than a year into the pandemic.

Public health experts have for months warned that uneven vaccine distribution would leave swaths of the world exposed to fresh waves of infection, economically devastating lockdowns and potentially new virus strains. That divide—between rapidly vaccinating nations poised for an economic revival and those still trapped in the throes of the pandemic—is beginning to emerge.

The schism is particularly pronounced between rich countries such as the U.S. and the U.K and developing nations.

In the Philippines—a nation of 110 million people that has received around 1.5 million vaccine doses so far—daily caseloads since mid-March have regularly exceeded last year’s peak. The U.K. and South Africa variants of the virus, associated with infection spikes in those places, are spreading in the Philippines, health authorities say. The Catholic-majority country has banned religious gatherings in the capital of Manila and its surrounding areas ahead of the Easter holiday and curbed travel.

The surge is mirrored in other largely unvaccinated countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Brazil. In Brazil, Covid-19 has killed more than 300,000 people, and about 3,000 people are dying a day now.

By contrast, in the U.S., where more than a quarter of the population has received at least one dose, around 15% are fully vaccinated and the Biden administration aims to hit 200 million doses during its first 100 days in office, schools and businesses are reopening and restrictions are being lifted in many places.

Similarly, fast-moving vaccination drives in the U.K. and Israel have prompted officials there to ease some restrictions. The U.K. has administered at least one shot to roughly 40% of its population and plans to offer vaccination to all adults by the end of July. More than 55% of Israelis have received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Instead, in the Philippines, with cases rising fast, the government is enacting new rounds of curbs. For the two weeks leading up to Easter on April 4, residents of Manila and some surrounding areas are barred from going to other parts of the country except for essential travel. As infections climbed this past weekend, the Philippines government tightened restrictions further, imposing a 6 p.m. curfew and ordering companies to strictly limit on-site staff.

For a second year in a row, Easter festivities will be muted. Mario Panaligan, a doctor in the capital, would typically travel to his family village for Maundy Thursday, a holiday that precedes Easter Sunday. Instead, he will tune into online mass this year. “It’s definitely a sad reality,” he said of the Philippines’ difficulties in acquiring vaccines.

The pandemic has already upended livelihoods, with workers bringing in nearly 10% less income than they had before Covid-19, according to the World Bank, which predicts that the Southeast Asian country’s economic output won’t return to pre-pandemic levels before mid-2022. The economic contraction was due in part to strict nationwide lockdowns and mobility restrictions, the bank said.

Limited global supply of vaccines and large orders by rich countries have made it harder for developing nations to secure deals. The Philippines has so far received around 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca PLC’s shot from a World Health Organization program for poorer countries and a million doses of Chinese company Sinovac’s vaccine, donated by Beijing. Moderna Inc. said last week it would begin supplying the Philippines with 20 million doses of its vaccine by the middle of the year.

“We would like to have done vaccination in the areas with an uptick in cases, but the world does not function that way,” said Cynthia Saloma, executive director of the Philippine Genome Center, which analyzes Covid-19 samples to determine which variants are circulating. “Countries which are not vaccinated will become…new ground for more variants coming out.”

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom last week described inequitable vaccine distribution as a moral outrage. The gap between shots administered in rich countries and through the Covax program for poorer countries was “becoming more grotesque every day,” he said. Although some wealthy European countries like France and Germany have been slower to vaccinate than the U.S. or Israel, they still have immunized a higher share than poorer countries like Mexico, Philippines and Bangladesh.

Scientists in the Philippines blame the new wave in part on loosened restrictions to boost the economy and pandemic fatigue. In addition to the U.K. and South Africa variants now circulating in the country, recent genomic sampling uncovered a new strain called P.3, first discovered in the Philippines. Health authorities say they don’t yet know if it is more transmissible or dangerous and are studying it.

The emergency room at metro Manila’s St. Luke’s Medical Center is at full capacity, with Covid-19 patients waiting to be admitted. Despite an increase in critical care beds, a post on its Facebook page said that its Covid wards were occupied and those needing immediate treatment for Covid-19 should head to other institutions.

“It’s really stressful,” said Kristine Gregorio, a nurse at St. Luke’s who is working 12-hour shifts. “If we move [a recovering] patient outside of the ICU another very sick patient will replace [them].”

“Delhi is where I grew up, and where my IPL journey began six years ago. To lead this team one day is a dream I’ve always harboured. And today, as that dream comes true, I feel humbled. I am truly grateful, especially to our team owners, who considered me capable enough for this role. With an amazing coaching staff, and a plethora of accomplished seniors around me, I can’t wait to give my absolute best for Delhi Capitals,"" Pant said in a statement by the franchise.

Cricket fans, who have been going gaga over youngster’s exciting form in the past few months, were pleasantly surprised with the new development and they celebrated the news of Pant turning DC’s skipper with memes.

72,72,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"Thailand 'prepared' to take Myanmar refugees, says Prayuth - Nikkei Asia",https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Myanmar-Coup/Thailand-prepared-to-take-Myanmar-refugees-says-Prayuth,"BANGKOK -- Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said Monday the kingdom is ready to accommodate a flood of Myanmar refugees, albeit reluctantly, as the government expects thousands more to cross the border.

""We don't want to have an exodus into our territory, but we have to take care of human rights, too,"" Prayuth told reporters on Monday. ""We have prepared an area for the influx. Organizing shelter or refugee centers -- we have not talked about that yet,"" the prime minister added.

Many have fled Myanmar as the military steps up its clampdown of pro-democracy protesters. ""At the moment, villagers are hiding in the jungle as more than 3,000 crossed to Thailand to take refuge,"" said ethnic rights group Karen Women's Organization. Kayin state, previously Karen state, shares the border with the provinces of Kanchanaburi, Tak, and Mae Hong Son in northwestern Thailand.

An airstrike was launched on Sunday against Karen National Union, one of Myanmar's largest independent armed groups. The bombing was seen as a retaliation by the Tatmadaw, the army, against the armed group's overrun of a military base in Kayin state. The first-ever air assault since the coup on Feb. 1 frightened villagers, who were already concerned about military violence.

At least 114 civilians were killed on Saturday by the military, according to local media. Tom Andrews, a United Nations Special Rapporteur for human rights, described the killing as mass murder. ""Words of condemnation or concern are frankly ringing hollow to the people of Myanmar,"" said Andrews, urging countries around the world to add pressure on the Tatmadaw.

According to nonprofit human rights organization Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 459 people have been killed by March 28 since the coup.

On the bloodiest Saturday, the military was also celebrating Armed Forces Day, an annual event. While defense chiefs from 12 different countries including the U.S., the U.K., and Japan issued a statement to condemn violence against the Myanmar citizens, Thailand's representative attended the celebration along with those from China, India, Bangladesh, Laos, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Russia.

Their attendance at the ceremony sent a message that could be interpreted as endorsement of the regime and its violent methods of quelling dissent.

""Where does Thailand support the Myanmar military? I do not understand,"" Prayuth said defiantly on Monday. ""There is probably no one to support the use of violence against the people,"" he said.

Since last year, Thailand has ramped up border patrols to block Burmese from coming over, claiming that it was a coronavirus lockdown measure. It is unclear if such patrols will now be relaxed, but many have interpreted Prayuth's sudden change of attitude as a move to fend off international criticism.","Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F3%252F8%252F7%252F3%252F33293783-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-161700317520210329%2520prayuth.JPG?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['prepared', 'state', 'human', 'violence', 'prayuth', 'karen', 'rights', 'armed', 'myanmar', 'refugees', 'military', 'thailand']",none

74,74,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Politics take center stage in popular South Korean films - Nikkei Asia,https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Arts/Politics-take-center-stage-in-popular-South-Korean-films,"HONG KONG -- When director Woo Min-ho first thumbed through the novel ""The Man Standing Next,"" he knew he had found the perfect template for a film that could tap into increasing domestic and global interest in South Korea's often fractured political history.

""Films that deal with the painful political past have been well-received by the critics and gained commercial success [recently],"" said Woo. ""Also, there are many TV series that depict and criticize social and political weaknesses. I believe today [Korean audiences] are almost entirely open-minded.""

Woo was on the money. While director Bong Joon-ho's Oscar-winning dark satire ""Parasite"" and the flood of K-dramas sweeping the world's streaming platforms have helped shed light on day-to-day issues within contemporary Korean society, there have also been a number of films -- such as ""The Man Standing Next"" -- that have dug deep into politics, and have been commercial and critical hits.

""Many Koreans are interested in politics and have the strong will to dig up the wrong histories of the past and to correct them,"" explained Woo. ""As there is a preference of audiences for these certain contents, if the idea is good, I thought the investment would go smoothly.""

Inspired by the novel written by Kim Choong-Sik, the film looks at the lead-up to the 1979 assassination of South Korean President Park Chung-hee. Over the past 12 months, it has picked up a slew of local and regional awards, including the Best Actor nod for the film's Hollywood-based standout star Lee Byung-hun at the Asian Film Awards. It was also South Korea's submission for this year's Best International Film at the Oscars, although it did not make the second round of voting.

The number one domestic hit of 2020, Woo's film has so far collected $36.4 million in global ticket sales, an impressive amount considering that it was touring at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has closed many cinemas across the world.

Lee Byung-hun was named Best Actor at the Asian Film Awards for his role in ""The Man Standing Next'.""

Woo said the success of ""The Man Standing Next"" was due to the layers of political intrigue that drew in viewers. He said he had to take extra care in this portrayal of the characters, as some were based on living people.

""I adjusted the level of creative liberty with the real people, incidents, by presenting the most balanced point of view possible,"" said Woo. ""The film deals with sensitive topics, but it approaches the psyches and the relationships between the characters, rather than making judgments or interpretations on the incident itself. Also, I left much room for the audiences to make their own interpretation based on their perspectives.""

""The Man Standing Next"" follows the path forged by a series of politically charged South Korean hits to have toured international festivals and cinemas, dating back to Im Sang-so's dark comedy ""The President's Last Bang"" in 2005. That film also circled around events leading to and directly following the aftermath of Park's assassination.

Over the last decade, audiences saw ""Parasite"" star Song Hang-ho play a character based on future President Roh Moo-hyun in the Yang Woo-suk-directed 2013 box-office smash ""The Attorney,"" set around the trial, on trumped-up charges, of a group of people accused of working against the authoritarian hardman Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled South Korea from 1980 to 1988

""A Taxi Driver"" and ""1987: When the Day Comes"" -- both released in 2017 -- have also won audiences over with storylines that are set around political events in the country.

Jung Hanseok, programmer for the Korean cinema section of South Korea's annual Busan International Film Festival, suggested that Korean filmmakers had previously held back on diving into politics because they were unsure if such films would find an audience.

""It rather seems like there is this certain confidence [now] that political films based on contemporary history can also be a box-office hit [and this] has been shared among industry professionals,"" he said. ""Therefore, foreign audiences now have more chance to watch Korean political films.""

It was not always so. Censorship under a procession of autocratic leaders post-Korean War right up to the start of the 1990s meant that any films that touched on issues deemed sensitive were either banned or disappeared quickly when deemed problematic by the authorities.

Jung pointed to the military-led rule of Chun in the 1980s as an example of how politics played a direct role in influencing subject matter in South Korean cinema. Chun's so-called ""3S Policy"" -- standing for the then-government's focus on the promotion of ""sport, sex, and screen"" -- was implemented in those years as a way of ""dumbing down"" Korean society, Jung said. There were bans on political content in cinemas, restrictions placed on how many local films could be made, and directives laid down about what topics films should focus on.

“The Man Standing Next” is one of a number of contemporary South Korean films to focus on the nation’s fractured political past.

""It was also when pro-league baseball was initiated at the instigation of the government,"" said Jung. ""The government was trying to turn the people's eyes away from politics. In the film industry, numerous low-quality sexual films were produced. In those days, Korean cinema most severely suffered from industrial and aesthetic hardship. It was clear the impact Korean politics had on the film industry.""

The 26-year-old Busan festival emerged from the shadows of South Korea's troubled past and has helped champion the search for, and screening of, much of the country's ""lost"" cinema. It regularly programs previously banned films through its annual retrospectives, including the likes of director Lee Man-hee's scorching modernist-style social critique ""A Day Off"" which was banned in 1968 upon completion and thought lost for decades after.

The annual event -- which bills itself as the preeminent festival in Asia -- also gives the international film industry first sight of any trends in cinema emerging from the country. ""The President's Last Bang"" and ""The Man Standing Next"" both screened at BIFF.

The festival itself has not escaped being dragged into local politics. Its funding was cut back in 2015, after the festival screened a documentary about the 2014 Sewol ferry disaster that was critical of the government then.

But Jung said there were no longer ""restraints"" imposed on the industry that is flourishing. On the horizon is director Byun Sung-hyun's much-anticipated ""Kingmaker,"" which delves further into the political intrigue and backroom machinations that haunted the reign of President Park.

""There are no themes, incidents, people that are off-limits to Korean filmmakers,"" Jung said.","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%253A%252F%252Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%252Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%252Fimages%252F6%252F8%252F3%252F2%252F33372386-3-eng-GB%252FCropped-161727013720210404%2520Man2.jpg?width=1024&height=512&fit=cover&gravity=faces&source=nar-cms,"['film', 'political', 'man', 'festival', 'center', 'south', 'korean', 'popular', 'politics', 'stage', 'audiences', 'standing', 'films']",none
75,75,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Bulls Run As Liquidity Floods Market - Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bulls-run-as-liquidity-floods-market-200570266,"As liquidity floods the market, the bulls continue to run the market. However, was the recent consolidation enough to reset market exuberance?

Over the last few weeks, I discussed the weekly “sell signals.” Such suggested upside would be somewhat limited for markets near-term. However, that flood of liquidity also limited the downside. Such has indeed been the case, as volatile markets made little headway since February, but dips continue to get bought.

SPX Daily Chart

With “stimmy” checks hitting bank accounts, “retail trading” stocks should get a boost as former gamblers and “pandemic lock-ins” return to Robinhood.

Furthermore, the surge in liquidity from the CARES Act last March is now working its way back into the economy as well. Those Treasury balances are getting drawn down to fund expenditures such as extended unemployment benefits.

Treasury Cash Balance

Unsurprisingly, all this liquidity is finding its way into the markets.

Monthly Mutual Fund And ETF Equity Fund Flow

Such has pushed equity allocations to nearly “Dot.com” level highs.

Equity Allocations

In other words, the bulls see “no risk” in being invested in “risk” assets.

Stock Buybacks Return With A Vengence

As I noted in “Powell’s Easy Money Promise,” stock buybacks have returned with a vengeance.

“No, this is not the argument which I debunked previously. Following the pandemic, corporations drew down credit lines and hoarded cash due to economic uncertainty. Now, with expectations of recovery, corporations are once again beginning to deploy that cash.”

Total Investment By Each Category Of US MMF

As I said then, while the mainstream media hope is all this cash will be flowing back into the economy, the reality is that it will primarily go to stock buybacks. Again, while not necessarily bad, it is the “least best” use of the company’s cash. Instead of expanding production, increasing sales, acquiring competitors, or making capital investments, the money gets used for a one-time boost to earnings on a per-share basis.

This past week, share buybacks hit a new record.

Corporate Buybacks

Not surprisingly, the most prominent players in buybacks are the ones that need to subsidize their earnings the most to beat estimates; technology and financials.

Buybacks By Sector



Net Purchases

While share buybacks primarily are for the benefit of corporate insiders “cashing out,” it does have the effect of supporting asset prices as well. when stocks were hitting records amid record share repurchases:

“What is clear, is that the misuse, and abuse, of share buybacks to manipulate earnings and reward insiders has become problematic. As John Authers recently pointed out: ‘For much of the last decade, companies buying their own shares have accounted for all net purchases. The total amount of stock bought back by companies since the 2008 crisis even exceeds the Federal Reserve’s spending on buying bonds over the same period as part of quantitative easing. Both pushed up asset prices.’ In other words, between the Federal Reserve injecting a massive amount of liquidity into the financial markets, and corporations buying back their own shares, there have been effectively no other real buyers in the market.”

Cumulative Net Purchases Of US Corporate Equities

I bring this up for two reasons:

The buybacks ARE SUPPORTIVE of asset prices in the short-term; and, We just had to “bailout” these companies because they couldn’t weather an economic downturn as they have spent years piling into debt and buying back shares.

While Janet Yellen is okay with the buybacks, as she thinks the banks are healthier now, why doesn’t anyone ask the question:

“If banks are so healthy, why do they need a constant monetary stimulus to remain in business and a bailout every time the economy declines?”

It doesn’t sound very healthy to me. But for now, there is only one headline that matters:

Headline



The Risk Of “No Risk”

The problem of assuming there is “no risk” is that it leads to “investor complacency.” As discussed in “Willful Blindness:”

“Willful blindness, also known as willful ignorance or contrived ignorance, is a term used in law. Being ‘willfully blind’ describes a situation where a person seeks to avoid civil or criminal liability for a wrongful act by keeping themselves unaware of the facts that would render them liable or implicated. The phrase ‘willful blindness’ also means any situation in which people avoid facts to absolve themselves of their liability. ‘Investors regularly dismiss the ‘facts’ which run contrary to their current opinion. In behavioral investing terms this is As markets rise, investors take on exceedingly more risk with the full knowledge that such actions will have a negative consequence. However, that ‘negative consequence’ is dismissed by the ‘fear of missing out,’ or rather F.O.M.O. As ‘greed’ overtakes ‘fear,’ investors become emboldened as rising markets reinforce their convictions. When the negative consequence occurs, instead of taking responsibility, they blame the media, Wall Street, or their advisor.”

This currently where we are in the markets today.

As discussed, with investors fully allocated, the risk remains that markets are trading at near-record extensions of longer-term means. The monthly chart below shows the current deviation from the long-term mean. Two things to note:

The market is exceptionally overbought longer-term; and,

The negative divergence in relative strength is highly concerning.

SPX Monthly Chart

It is generally near market peaks when investors are the most complacent about risk. While I certainly agree in the shorter-term, the liquidity flood has mitigated downside risk; it only exacerbates longer-term consequences.

Another Surge Coming

Currently, investors are very exuberant about markets, although they can get more so.

BofA Bull & Bear Indicator History

With the flood of stimulus into the market, another surge higher would not be a surprise. Such would correspond both with the peak of liquidity inflows and the peak in earnings and economic growth expectations. From a technical perspective, this also aligns with the weekly “money flow” index, turning positive. Typically, these weekly “buy” signals last roughly two to three months before reversing.

S&P 500-Buy Signal Weekly Chart

Note the blue vertical dashed lines below. Those lines are the weekly “buy” and “sell” signals overlaid on the daily chart. The blue boxes show where the daily and weekly sell signals converged previously.

S&P 500- Daily Chart

When both indicators align on “sell signals,” blue boxes, market volatility rises markedly. However, markets tend to increase when both indicators align with “buy signals.”

With both “buy” signals close to aligning, I would not be surprised to see markets make another advance higher near term. However, focusing back on longer-term market dynamics, the deviation from the longer-term mean is extreme.

Reversions always occur when least expected, and always for a reason “no one sees coming.”

Buy Now, Sell Later

With markets still in the “seasonally strong” period of the year, lots of liquidity, and plenty of exuberance, this is not a time to be “bearish” on markets.

We are using recent weaknesses to add to positions we took profits in recently, such as energy and financials. We will also add to beaten-up “growth” names that have strong earnings trajectories and strong fundamentals.

It should be evident that an honest assessment of uncertainty leads to better decisions.

The problem with “Eternal Bullishness” and “Willful Blindness” is that the failure to embrace uncertainty increases risk, and ultimately loss.

We must be able to recognize and be responsive to changes in underlying market dynamics. If they change for the worse, we must be aware of the portfolio model’s inherent risk. The reality is that we can’t control outcomes. The most we can do is influence the probability of specific outcomes.

Focusing on risk not only removes “willful blindness” from the process, but it is also essential to capital preservation and investment success over time.

In other words, “buy now,” just don’t forget to “sell” later.","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,"['markets', 'risk', 'signals', 'willful', 'buybacks', 'sell', 'market', 'weekly', 'investors', 'liquidity', 'run', 'bulls', 'floods']",none
76,76,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Madagascar: Businesses drive disappearance of a wetland 'reed forest' - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/madagascar-businesses-drive-disappearance-of-a-wetland-reed-forest/,"Lake Alaotra and its surrounding marshes are Madagascar’s largest wetland, a Ramsar Site that is home to globally significant biodiversity.

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh disappear each year to make way for rice cultivation, much of it perpetrated by businesses.

Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

The government is implementing a zero-tolerance campaign against illegal environmental destruction, but it remains to be seen whether this can reduce the lawlessness and impunity enough to safeguard the lake.

LAKE ALAOTRA, Madagascar — Madagascar’s environment minister, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, celebrated World Wetlands Day last month by planting native reeds and sedges along the shore of sprawling Lake Alaotra in the country’s central highlands. The plants’ tufted tops waved high above the heads of students, officials and local residents as they carried them across the marsh and joined the minister in settling them, one by one, into the mucky ground.

The planting on Feb. 2, which covered 4 hectares (10 acres), was an attempt to revitalize a tiny portion of the lake’s marshland that people call the “reed forest” in Malagasy. Rice agriculture, overfishing, introduced species and siltation due to upland deforestation have all contributed to the striking decline of a wetland the minister described in a Facebook post the next day as being among the largest and most ecologically important not just in Madagascar, but in all of Africa.

“Unfortunately, this marsh is now completely destroyed and Lake Alaotra is drying up,” she wrote. “Many species of Alaotra are endangered.”

Despite layers of legal protection and conservation programming, sources say much of the destruction is being perpetuated by businesses involved in rice growing and fishing and by widespread defiance of protective laws. Local people are keenly feeling the lake’s decline, though, and a commitment to protecting it, along with some success stories, persist in pockets around its shores.

A natural jewel

With 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of open water surrounded by an equal area of marsh, Lake Alaotra is a natural jewel. It is home to globally significant biodiversity, including several endemic species of fish and birds and unusual mammals, such as the mongoose-like carnivore Durrell’s vontsira (Salanoia durrelli), which scientists only described in 2010, and the critically endangered bandro or Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis).

With some 120,000 hectares (300,000 acres) of rice fields surrounding the lake, the vast Alaotra wetland is Madagascar’s main rice bowl, yielding an average of 360,000 tons of rice annually, or around 10% of the nation’s annual yield.

The lake was also once the country’s biggest inland fish supplier. But annual catches have declined precipitously, from around 2,400 tons in 2000 to barely 330 tons in 2020, according to the regional fishing department. Locals feel the loss acutely.

“I was 10 years old in 1973. We just spent a half-hour to harvest about 100 kilos [220 pounds] of quality fishes at the time,” said Randriamatsarasoa, a fisher and head of the fishers’ community association in Vohitsivalana, a village in the commune of Imerimandroso on the lake’s northeastern shore. “Nowadays, we struggle to bring home 5 to 12 kilos [11-26 pounds] after working hard from the morning to the evening.”

Such a significant shift in resource availability has resulted in fierce competition among residents that only exacerbates the ecosystem’s decline.

“These marshes represent the remaining history of the Alaotra region,” said Honoré Randriangalisa, the mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, a regional body that facilitates communities’ management of the lake and marshes. “Their existence will be only a legend for the next generations if we are unable to put a stop to their destruction right now.”

Due to its importance for biodiversity and Madagascar’s agro-economy, Alaotra’s 722,500-hectare (1.78-million-acre) watershed was inscribed as a Ramsar Site under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance in 2003. The Madagascar government designated a temporary new protected area there in 2007 and granted 46,000 hectares (114,000 acres) permanent protection in 2015.

The transformation of marshland into new rice fields is the main threat to the marshes and the lake’s health. In recent years, rice farmers have been planting vary jeby, or flood recession rice, pushing into flood-prone areas that are now often farmable during the dry season, which has become elongated by climate change. They may farm a plot for a few years then leave it fallow when conditions aren’t ideal.

“The rising trend in the reliance on the flood recession rice is a very big issue,” said Miora Ratsimanohatra, chief of the agricultural engineering division for the wider Alaotra-Mangoro region, where Lake Alaotra is located. “People clear the temporarily dried up marshes and set them on fire to cultivate them. They even go beyond the protected area’s boundaries. This is illegal.”

Compounding the problems, centuries of deforestation have eliminated the tropical forest that once encircled the lake. Annual rains now carry tons of red earth from the surrounding terrain via deep, eroded gullies to submerge the lowlands, rivers and the lake itself. Moreover, the extended dry seasons, now lasting from June to November or December, have diminished the lake’s water. Today, the lake has a maximum depth during the dry season of just 2.5 meters (8 feet).

Last year, the extended dry season and higher temperatures than usual resulted in widespread and devastating bushfires that began in July and continued to late December, according to Fidimalala Bruno Ralainasolo, the conservation biologist who runs the Alaotra program of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT). The Jersey Island-based NGO has been active at the lake since 1996.

Altogether, around 850 hectares (2,100 acres) of marsh are lost every year, reducing their total cover by as much as 4,000 hectares (9,900 acres) since 2005, to the present 20,000-hectare extent, according to Ralainasolo. “Only around 20% of this inland ecosystem remains untapped,” he said.

Contrasting conservation

In 2015, as part of the government’s designation of the Alaotra protected area, DWCT started a conservation program in collaboration with Alaotra Rano Soa. The regional body, established as part of the lake’s Ramsar designation, helps oversee activities relating to the lake, such as rice growing, fishing, aquaculture, goose and cattle husbandry, water management, tourism, crafts, and transportation, at the community level. Alaotra Rano Soa manages the sprawling Ramsar site while DWCT manages the smaller protected area within it.

DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established four activity sectors to provide a forum for local people to manage the Ramsar site: 45 commune-level federations that collectively involve 333 village-level community associations, each one active in either watershed protection, water-resource management, fisheries management or marsh conservation. The program employs 96 polisin-jetra, or marsh police agents, as its ambassadors in the protected area. They report any environmental violations to DWCT, but can’t make arrests.

In 2017, DWCT, Alaotra Rano Soa and government authorities publicly marked the limits of the protected area. Parcels totaling nearly 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of marshland were set aside for the use of local communities, who rely on the lake’s resources for foods and income. However, with some exceptions, this area has largely succumbed to commercial rice planting, forcing subsistence farmers into protected marshland to meet their needs.

“The biggest issue we were facing was the fact that local businesses managed to control 90% of the set-aside 7,000 hectares, instead of the community members,” said Ralainasolo, the DWCT conservation biologist.

Two of the lake’s rural communes offer a study in contrasts when it comes to managing their slices of set-aside marsh. Imerimandroso’s marsh cover is on the verge of disappearance, whereas its neighbor on the northeastern lake shore, Andrebakely Avaratra, has retained most of its marsh. Like the dozens of communes around the wetland, Imerimandroso and Andrebakely Avaratra, with respective populations of around 16,000 and 19,900, rely on rice growing, farming, fishing and crafting for their food and income. For centuries, the lake has provided people’s daily needs.

Of the 400 or so hectares (about 1,000 acres) the marsh community association in Imerimandroso is responsible for, scarcely a dozen persist, and the local businesses and subsistence farmers who grow vary jeby are clamoring for access even to these.

“Little by little, they invaded the protected area as of 2008,” Dauphin Andriakotoarivony, deputy mayor of Imerimandroso and a deputy president of Alaotra Rano Soa, said. “Hardly 7 hectares [17 acres] of the initial 209 [516 acres] we have secured where I am [in Marovato sector] has been left. Practically 99% of the protected area is ruined. Also, the rest is already prone to invasion. The encouraging thing is that the community association has never abandoned the fight.”

Randriamatsarasoa, the fisher from Imerimandroso, is very concerned with the eventual exhaustion of the fish stocks. According to him, the introduced tilapia (several species in the family Cichlidae) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) that were once abundant in Lake Alaotra and are the main source of income for local fishers have declined precipitously, having long since displaced native fish species. He attributes the disappearance of the fish to people using insecticide-laced mosquito nets with small meshes that scoop up juveniles, and clearing marshes where fish and other aquatic animals reproduce.

“When the water is well managed, I can tell you that fishing is more profitable than rice growing,” he said. A kilo of freshwater fish now costs seven or eight times more than a kilo of rice.

The failure of the marsh conservation project in Imerimandroso was attributable to political leadership, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. He said the commune’s previous mayor was under a great deal of pressure from local powerbrokers to permit illegal marsh clearing.

The current mayor, Randriangalisa, elected in December 2019, professed his commitment to turning things around. “We will be standing up as long as we can to conserve the little left. We will keep silent only when our voice is heard,” Randriangalisa said.

By contrast, the people of Andrebakely Avaratra have been “stricter” than their neighbors about protecting the marshes, José Ramaninjatovo, the commune’s mayor, told Mongabay. “As meadow, they are the zebus’ larder,” he said, referring to Malagasy cattle. “They supply us with fishes. They protect the rice fields from alluvial deposits from the hills.”

The previous mayor of Andrebakely Avaratra showed strong leadership and the population appreciated the importance of the marshes, according to Ralainasolo.

The current mayor, Ramaninjatovo, said he intends to carry on that commitment. He said 19 people were caught destroying the marshes in mid-February, and the environment ministry’s local offices made them replant the areas with reeds and sign a letter promising never to harm the marsh. “We will never allow such a violation to happen again,” he said.

Thanks to Andrebakely Avaratra’s enduring marsh, the commune has become one of the main suppliers of dried reed to Imerimandroso, where women use it to weave baskets, hats, bags and other crafts for income.

Everyone seems to comply with the rules in Andrebakely Avaratra. Two fishermen sailing back from the open lake on an afternoon in late October each had a pile of locally made basketry fish traps called vovos. “We have removed them from the water to the village as the water is now closed,” one of them told Mongabay, referring to the lake’s annual fishing closure. It had started the day before and would last eight weeks to allow the fish to reproduce. “We take our fishing tools into water again when the water reopens.”

That kind of compliance with protective rules is typical in Andrebakely Avaratra, regardless of whether people belong to the community association or not, according to a marsh police agent named Gabriel Ralijaona in the commune’s main village. “We are very strict with the protection of the 658 hectares [1,626 acres] of marshes inside our common land,” he said. “An array of endemic birds, countless animal species including four specimens of bandro — three adults and one baby — live there. We never let anyone disturb these places.”

The bandro is the emblematic species of Lake Alaotra. With a population of less than 3,000, down from the first estimate of between 7,000 and 11,000 in 1990, the lemurs are among the world’s most endangered primates. The adults in Andrebakely Avaratra were former pets reintroduced into the wild in 2015. Andrebakely Avaratra’s marsh was chosen to host them because it was in good shape after the community had nursed it back from being “totally broken down” in the 1990s, according to Ralainasolo of DWCT. Of the five animals released in the area, two disappeared and were thought to have been hunted. But one female appeared with a newborn soon after.

Businesses behind the destruction

Around the lake, however, Ralainasolo pointed out that the bandro’s unmistakable population decline closely tracks the loss of marsh habitat. And most of the time, he said, businesses are behind the clearing. His team estimates it costs an average of 1 million ariary ($254) to clear one hectare of marsh. If so, the average destruction of around 850 hectares annually would theoretically require around 850 million ariary, or $216,000.

That kind of money, even to clear a single hectare, is out of reach for most residents. Instead, powerbrokers and banks finance the marsh’s destruction, paying poor locals to do the clearing, according to local public servants who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Mayor Randriangalisa of Imerimandroso said he had experienced pressure tactics. “After a TV station broadcast my criticism of the marsh destruction, high-placed people and one bank officer called me and asked me to stop questioning their business,” he said.

It’s a similar story when it comes to fishing. According to an anonymous source at the regional fishing department, local businesses fund the fabrication of nets up to a kilometer long that cost 6 million to 8 million ariary (up to $2,033). Businesses deploy around 30 of these killing machines in Lake Alaotra, plus another 50 smaller ones. “They are illegal and their use not only endangers stock availability in the future but also harms aquatic species,” the source said.

Over the years, marsh restoration projects on the banks of the lake, like the one the environment minister attended in February, have been successful. Experts say that if the reeds are left to regrow in peace they can recover in a few years’ time. But against the backdrop of pervasive lawlessness, the outlook for Lake Alaotra’s marshes remains uncertain.

Like many other people weary of the impunity, Randriangalisa calls for exemplary sanctions for the marshes’ destroyers. Meanwhile, the environment ministry is implementing a zero-tolerance policy against any illegal environmental destruction across the country.

According to sources interviewed for this story, eight powerbrokers residing in the area’s main city of Ambatondrazaka are suspected of funding illegal activities imperiling the wetland, including marsh clearance and fishing with large mosquito bed nets. They were summoned to appear in court in December, but the court date was postponed and a new one has yet to be made public. The outcome of the case could be a bellwether for Lake Alaotra’s future.

Clarification 4/8/21: The story has been updated to clarify that the forum that DWCT and Alaotra Rano Soa established, comprising commune-level federations and village-level community associations, manages the Lake Alaotra Ramsar Site, and not just the lake itself.

Therefore, the students do not only memorize the teaching materials they have received, she said.The quality of direct learning at campus may get lowered due to online learning. However, the phenomenon does not happen at her college. The learning quality does not change though an online learning method is applied, she pointed out.White, UTS Deputy Head – Students and Subjects Faculty of Business, noted that the most important point is to trigger the students to study together in fun ways. Moreover, the lessons learned will match to jobs they aspire.Thus, both lecturers and students necessitate to discuss about current issues that will lead them to identify and create their contribution to business sector and local communities.Previously, UniSadhuGuna International College (UIC College) under PT UniSadhuGuna along with global partner, UTS College held a workshop on topic “Understand What Are Employers Seeking and How to Keep Building Career Readiness During this Uncertain Time”.Head of UniSadhuGuna at the Pondok Indah Campus, Yani Oktaviana, said that the discussion was aimed at giving the students the exposure and insight to face the unpredictable changes. In addition, it offers the solutions on how to become qualified human resources and make changes to be ready to work in any industrial sector.Oktaviana added that this fast changing world needs to be well-adapted. Therefore, conducting some trainings for students is important to give them exposure and insight in line with global issues.“As one of the educational institutions, we want to focus on preparing future leaders during the study period until they have to plough through the real world, career world,” she pointed out.","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://cdn.antaranews.com/cache/800x533/2021/04/04/Jepretan-Layar-2021-04-01-pukul-14.08.14.png,"['lecturers', 'change', 'expert', 'online', 'need', 'students', 'pointed', 'world', 'unisadhuguna', 'learning', 'assessment', 'uts', 'methods', 'teaching', 'college']",none

79,79,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"After a year of COVID-19, muddy mission work feels blessedly normal - Christian Chronicle",https://christianchronicle.org/muddymission/,"Campus ministry forgoes the beach to serve in flood-stricken Kentucky. ""They were loving every second of it,"" minister says.

After a year of lockdowns, nasal swabs and Zoom lectures, it’s understandable that college students would be sorely tempted to head for the beach.

But 13 members of the RiverHawks for Christ campus ministry in Tahlequah, Okla., picked a different destination for their spring break — eastern Kentucky, the heart of the Cumberland Plateau. There, in the small towns of Jackson and Beattyville, they spent the better part of a week ripping rotted drywall and floorboards from homes devastated by floods back in March.

“They worked hard — came back muddy and tired,” said John Albright of Churches of Christ Disaster Response Team, who coordinated the work.

But after a year of COVID-19, “they were loving every second of it, absolutely,” added campus minister Tyrel Hatfield. “It was great to feel a little bit normal again.”

RiverHawks for Christ, a ministry of the South College Church of Christ in Tahlequah, serves nearby Northeastern State University. The church’s previous campus minister, Wade Bullard, planned to lead a group from the ministry on a spring break mission trip last year. They were going to help the Disaster Response Team organize its warehouse in Ohio.

‘They were loving every second of it, absolutely. It was great to feel a little bit normal again.’

The pandemic canceled those plans and turned the 2020 spring break into the longest — and arguably the worst — spring break ever. Classes, church services and ministry activities all moved online.

So did the final weeks of Andrea Stone’s high school career. Stone, who goes by Andy, grew up in the pews of the Stonewall Church of Christ in southern Oklahoma. She earned her diploma virtually before moving 150 miles northeast to Tahlequah last fall for her freshman year at Northeastern State.

“Classes have been real iffy,” she said. “Some days you go to class as normal, but at the drop of a hat anything can change.” If a classmate is diagnosed with COVID-19 or has been exposed to someone with the virus, classes may have to move online. For Stone, checking email before class — to see “whether you’re going to class or not” — is the new normal.

She didn’t know a soul when she arrived on campus but quickly found a home with RiverHawks for Christ, which hosts devotionals and Bible classes in addition to other activities with the South College Church of Christ.

Despite the uncertainty of the pandemic, the campus ministry has “been very regular,” Stone said. “We have stayed together and have been able to meet.

“It’s an escape from the panic of the virus. I find my solace here.”

Jackson, KY, USA

She was eager to join the mission trip to Kentucky — even though it meant a week of pulling up old, damp floorboards from homes. She quickly learned what it sounds like when a board pulls free with all of its nails intact — meaning she wouldn’t have to rip them out of the studs one by one.

“That’s the greatest sound in the world,” she joked, “when the nails come up with the board.”

Albright coordinated the Oklahomans in addition to church groups from California and Alabama who came to help in eastern Kentucky. They helped distribute boxes of food and cleaning supplies provided by Churches of Christ Disaster Relief Effort in Nashville, Tenn.

The area where they served was at the western edge of the McCoy family’s land during the infamous Hatfield-McCoy feud of the late 1800s. Albright made sure to point that out to Tyrel Hatfield, who brought three of his children on the trip — one of them a Northeastern State student. Hatfield, a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, has served with the South College for 20 years and recently took on the role of campus minister.

Thankfully, no feuds broke out during the trip, joked Albright, who worships with the Clear Creek Church of Christ in Hixson, Tenn.

However, he does remember the Oklahomans singing with at least one of the homeowners they helped.

They also worshiped — and sang beautifully — with one of the Churches of Christ in the area, Albright said. When they weren’t working, the team slept on the floor of the church’s classrooms.

In addition to singing, “we prayed with people,” Hatfield said. “They were the mission, not the homes.”

Stone said that focusing on others helped take her mind off the pandemic. It also “brought us closer, as a family, to God,” she said.

Hatfield added, “I couldn’t think of a better way to spend spring break.”","Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://christianchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/WEBEX_floorboards.jpg,"['trip', 'campus', 'ministry', 'kentucky', 'feels', 'mission', 'normal', 'church', 'muddy', 'break', 'work', 'blessedly', 'college', 'christ', 'hatfield', 'spring', 'covid19']",none
80,80,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Parametric insurance comes of age - Insurance – general - Nat CAT - Asia Insurance Review,https://www.asiainsurancereview.com/Magazine/ReadMagazineArticle?aid=44424,"Climate change, natural catastrophes and environmental stress from urban densification are all contributing to a new risk landscape in Asia Pacific. Taken together, they act as a ‘threat multiplier’ that increases the impacts of existing industry exposures.

In recent years, a diverse range of perils dominated losses across the region. The year 2020 saw comparatively less Pacific tropical cyclone activity than the climatological average, yet total economic loss from cyclones exceeded $26bn, according to top brokers’ recent climate and Nat CAT reports.

This was largely due to record-breaking super typhoons: Goni (Rolly) in the Philippines, with the strongest wind speed at landfall (195 mph/315 kph) ever recorded and Ampham, the strongest storm on record to form in the Bay of Bengal, impacting India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

Notably, droughts in China and Vietnam at the start of the year were followed by extensive flooding throughout the region, impacting 19 countries with total losses exceeding $55bn. After two years as the lead bearer of Nat CAT loss in the region, Japan also sustained significant $8.5bn in economic damage due to flood, namely in the Kyushu Islands.

The country was hit with less typhoon-related loss than the devastating Jebi, Trami, Hagibis and Faxai of the 2018 and 2019 seasons, but sadly marked the 10-year anniversary of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami. Wildfires, extreme weather, including major hail events in Australia, all rounded out a recorded total $102bn in economic losses due from Nat CAT, down slightly from the total $107bn of 2019.

Hardening market accentuates protection gap challenges

With significant year-over-year recorded losses, the Nat CAT protection gap in APAC keeps widening with only 23% of losses insured in 2018, falling to 19% in 2019 and further to only 12% in 2020.

Hardening market conditions from 1 January 2021 renewals indicate that this gap is likely to continue to grow. The past two renewal seasons have seen the trend in increasing property prices continue, ranging from 5-15%, with magnified impacts on highly Nat CAT exposed assets. More recently brokers also report further restrictions by reinsurers on terms and conditions, especially policy extensions such as non-damage business interruption covers.

With continued hardening, pressure mounts on Nat CAT deductibles and availability of competitively priced capacity, while corporates are urged to contain their premium spend. The current trend is expected to continue for at least the next 12-18 months and reinforces the role of the broker in thorough programme engineering.

This market evolution around Nat CAT has dealt a particularly heavy blow to the hospitality industry, as well as other assets that face limited market capacity, e.g. overhead telecommunications overhead transmission and distribution (T&D) lines, transportation infrastructure and offshore property.

Use of parametrics is increasingly common to cover Nat CAT

Thankfully, as budgets and market capacity tighten, the growth of innovative risk transfer alternatives - such as parametric insurance - are also picking up speed. Driven by the availability of high quality data and new technologies, these alternatives are quickly becoming mainstream and cost-effective solutions to keep corporate and public sector clients covered in all market conditions.

For example, when a client experiences rate hikes in their property programme, their broker can suggest carving out their Nat CAT risks to a parametric cover. Often we see that this increases traditional player’s risk appetite, thus easing negotiations and enabling placement of their remaining programme.

The parametric cover also allows brokers to preserve their clients’ Nat CAT limits at an affordable premium. It provides swift liquidity of predetermined amounts in the event of a triggering natural event - cyclone, earthquake, drought, heavy rainfall, extreme weather, etc. - introducing much needed transparency following the unsettling lessons in coverage exclusions that the market learnt with COVID-19.

APAC: Parametrics in action

Infrastructure – How to cover a highway in the most earthquake- and cyclone-exposed region of Southeast Asia

Pain point: The traditional product offering, with double digit rate increases, was prohibitively expensive and did not offer lender set limits. Additionally, the nature of the asset, including various structure categories (bridges, tunnels) made it difficult for the client and broker to find capacity.

Solution: We designed a parametric combined earthquake and cyclone cover for the entirety of the highway that took into account the changing soil nature and civil infrastructure along the route, adjusting payout for earthquake or wind speed severity accordingly. Earthquake exposure is measured in near-real time using peak-ground-acceleration recordings while cyclone activity is monitored using official data from JTWC. The highway got covered to the full required limit with bespoke terms that satisfied both risk management and financial parties.

Manufacturer – Covering flood while accounting for flood barriers, a challenge addressed by parametric insurance

Pain point: An electronics manufacturer in Thailand with significant flood exposure and heavy losses from 2011, now has its premises protected by a dike fortified riverfront. The risk accumulation, loss history and changing landscape due to the installation of flood barriers, made it difficult to find capacity for high value assets.

Solution: A parametric flood cover was designed to take into account client installed flood barriers. Custom tailored to the client’s risk exposure, the structure swiftly pays out when river water levels overtop the dike at predefined thresholds, as measured by on-site IoT gauges. Descartes monitored their exposure in real-time, notifying the client and providing quick indemnification if the policy triggered.

Distributed assets – T&D lines in the eye of the cyclone

Pain point: By nature, overhead T&D networks have extensive exposure to cyclone risk, making them heavily impacted by premium rate hikes when market conditions harden. Their locational distribution also adds an additional challenge to traditional loss adjustment.

Solution: Our parametric models precisely mapped the grid and network of T&D lines, providing a granular assessment of their cyclone exposure. Hand-in-hand with the client’s in-house risk management, we designed payout structures for each wind speed based on the modelled impact to the network, flexibly matching the client’s budget and ensuring a full-limit cover. Remote, near real-time monitoring of wind data allowed for payment within just a few days following a triggering cyclone, without undergoing the hassle of loss-adjustment on these wide-spread assets. Carving-out these heavily exposed assets also facilitated the traditional placement of the rest of the client’s programme. A

81,81,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Former city manager Tommy Turney passes away - Runnels County Register,https://www.runnelscountyregister.com/story/news/2021/03/29/former-ballinger-city-manager-passes-away/7044490002/,"Former city manager Tommy Turney passes away

Former Ballinger city manager Tommy Turney passed away unexpectedly on March 24. Turney was 50 years old.

Turney, originally from San Angelo, graduated from Angelo State University with a bachelor's degree. After graduation, Turney worked overseas for oil companies in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Iraq for approximately 20 years before coming to Ballinger. After he was fired as city manager, Turney worked as a corrections officer at the Runnels County jail. He was still employed at the jail at the time of his death. Jail captain Kimberly Dunn released a statement on social media regarding Turney's passing:

""It's with a saddened heart, that the Runnels County Jail says goodbye to Officer Tommy Turney. For both, staff and inmates alike, the emotions associated with spending time in the jail are often negative due to the nature of the environment. Tommy’s fun sense of humor, calm demeanor, and encouraging words brought light into our world. It’s a true blessing when God sends someone, like Tommy, into our lives who can lift our spirits on a daily basis. Tommy will be truly missed. Please join the Runnels County Jail family in extending our deepest condolences to the Tommy Turney family.""

Turney was hired as Ballinger city manager in August of 2018. While his first few months were relatively quiet, he did make repairs around the city, particularly to the groan and shudder evoking ""13th street dip,"" as locals referred to it. He also had workers clear out the creek bed along the street to help with flood control.

Turney also hired a collections agency to collect outstanding utility bills and municipal court fines. He also applied for grants to improve the city streets. The grant was eventually awarded to Ballinger, bringing in $275,000 for street repairs.

Turney hired a painter to 'beautify Ballinger,"" by painting murals around the city. He spoke with local business owners to get their permission to paint murals on the sides of their buildings. He also conducted the first city-wide cleanup in 3 years. He conducted the first capital assets inventory since 2006. He worked with TXDoT to help make repairs at the export. The agreement would have TXDoT paying 50% of the cost, ""even down to the cost of a light bulb,"" Turney said at the time. Turney also worked with the probation office to provide probationers to help clean up the city while they work off their community service hours.

In addition to the changes he made throughout the city, Turney also weathered several storms. The biggest issue he inherited was looking for money from 3 CDs cashed out by the city in 2016. He tackled that by bringing in an accountant to track down how the money was spent and to get the city’s books in order. The 3 CDs totaled $360,000. There was also the matter of a $225,000 grant reimbursement the city received, bringing the total to $585,000. No accusations of wrong-doing were made, but Turney got help from the Texas Ranger Shea, who investigated the case, ultimately not filing any charges. Eventually, Turney would determine that the money had gone into the general fund and was spent without accurate tracking. An auditor was brought in and said that the money was used to keep the city ""in the black."" Once that money was spent, the city had no reserves and their credit rating dropped. The money was spent prior to Turney being hired. He helped coordinate the work to find answers for the citizens of Ballinger.

Trouble would pop up when several local business owners accused Turney of ""making the city go broke."" According to the books, and the auditor, the city was broke before Turney arrived. He nevertheless shouldered responsibility for not fine-tuning the budget and, ultimately, kept his job.

The next salvo of criticism came from several city employees who accused Turney of HR violations. The employees contacted the mayor and a council member to have meetings with them to discuss Turney's use of foul language. The employees then wrote letters to the council. The council meetings, originally attended by only a handful of citizens, were now standing room only as over 100 people would come to the meetings. People spoke on Turney's behalf while a few of the employees openly addressed the council with their grievances. One employee even went so far as to say that he had secretly tape recorded private conversations with Turney. The meeting resulted in the council stating that they would find HR classes for Turney to attend. A vote on Turney's employment was taken with all 5 council members voting in favor of him keeping his job.

In November of 2019, Dawni Seymore was elected mayor, defeating former mayor Sam Mallory by 3 votes. Kristi Goetz also won a council seat, defeating Eloyed Fuentes. Concerns soon arose when city councilman Rick Morrish said that Ballinger had not paid Abilene per an agreement. The city was allegedly $90,000 behind in their payments with Abilene threatening to cancel the deal. Morrish and the council felt that it could jeopardize the long-term deal for Ballinger. Turney was dismissed in a 3-2 vote (Yea: Goetz, Seymore, Morrish. Nay: Jason Gore and Bob McDaniel). The vote to dismiss Turney caused Gore and McDaniel to walk out of the meeting and resign from their positions in protest.

Turney didn't miss a step after leaving the city. He soon went to work for the Runnels County Sheriff's office as a jailer. Turney's wife, Carrie Turney, had attended a regional police academy and been hired as a police officer in Winters. The family was in the process of moving from Ballinger to Winters when Turney died.

While city did not release a statement regarding Turney's service to the community and his death, former councilman Bob McDaniel commented about it, ""It doesn't bother me one bit to say that I loved Tommy Turney. He was a gentle soul who truly loved people, his family, and he had a special place in his heart for Ballinger and he was a dreamer. During my years serving on the Ballinger City Council, I served under five city managers and not one had the love of community and it's residents that Tommy had. From day one he launched himself into a campaign of showcasing Ballinger. The downtown fountain, the scout hut, the city park, the mural, and on and on, he had some degree of ownership in them all. He and I would get in the suburban and he'd talk about his wish list, an acre of bluebonnets behind city hall, a walking trail along Elm creek. I even went out and bought a canoe because he wanted to map out a plan for a trail along the creek from the park to the Colorado River. The night Tommy was terminated as manager, he said his goodbye to Jason and walked over to me, coffee cup in hand, and said ""I love you Bob, thanks for supporting me."" Those words I will forever cherish. Farewell old friend. There will come a day when we meet again.""","Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2021/03/29/NRCR/90968f9b-c29f-475c-92a8-435f6dffa917-Ballinger_City_Manager_Tommy_Turney_was_dimissed_by_the_city_council_on_January_6th_copy.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2975,1674,x0,y387&format=pjpg&width=1200","['away', 'council', 'jail', 'tommy', 'manager', 'ballinger', 'money', 'city', 'hired', 'passes', 'turney', 'turneys']",none
82,82,FL-2021-000030-IDN,"Philippines' Duterte extends coronavirus curbs in capital, nearby provinces - Gulf Times",https://www.gulf-times.com/story/688041/Philippines-Duterte-extends-coronavirus-curbs-in-c,"Reuters/Manila

* Strict quarantine measures extended by at least a week

* Philippines logs its second-highest daily Covid-19 cases

* Hospitals in the capital reach critical capacity

Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has extended a strict lockdown in the capital region and adjacent provinces by at least one week to try to contain a renewed surge in coronavirus infections, his spokesman said on Saturday.

The Philippines, which has the second-highest Covid-19 cases and deaths in Southeast Asia, reported 12,576 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, putting further strain on the healthcare system.

Restrictions, which include a ban on non-essential movement, mass gatherings and dining in restaurants, will remain for at least another week, Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said in a televised announcement. The measures had been set to end on April 4.

""This will go with intensified prevention, detection, isolation, tracing and rehabilitation that we will monitor on a daily basis,"" Roque said.

Active cases in the country have hit a record 165,715, 96% of which were mild, health ministry data showed.

But intensive care capacity in the capital region's hospitals have reached a critical level, with 80% of beds utilised and many hospitals being forced to turn away patients.

The congested capital region, an urban sprawl of 16 cities home to at least 13 million people, accounts for two-fifths of the country's 784,043 confirmed cases and a third of the total 13,423 deaths. A University of the Philippines research team on Saturday called for a speedy construction of isolation facilities to prevent infections spreading through households.

Extended coronavirus curbs will continue to hurt the Philippines' economy, which posted a record 9.5% slump last year.

The Philippines has so far inoculated nearly 739,000 people. This is just 1% of its target of vaccinating 70 million of its 108 million population to achieve herd immunity and safely reopen the economy.","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 12:01:00 GMT",https://img.gulf-times.com/Content/Upload/Slider/42021315126299512928.jpg,"['duterte', 'strict', 'provinces', 'nearby', 'spokesman', 'week', 'hospitals', 'philippines', 'coronavirus', 'capital', 'million', 'infections', 'curbs', 'cases', 'extends']",none

By Akhona Matshoba and Tanisha Heiberg

JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Reuters) - The animals that roam South Africa's Balule Nature Reserve have a new ally in the battle to keep them safe from poachers - camera phones mounted in protective cases that stream images of their activities to thousands of ""virtual rangers"" worldwide.

With reserves across Africa cutting back on anti-poaching patrols amid a coronavirus-induced tourism lull that has hit funding, Balule has teamed up with handset manufacturer Samsung and tech pioneer Africam to supplement staff numbers with eyes and ears online.

Over 55,000 people have become virtual rangers since the project, Wildlife Watch, went live this month.

""We need more eyes; we need more people helping us,"" said Leitah Mkhabela, a member of the park's all-female anti-poaching unit known as the Black Mambas.

""They can become a ranger while staying at home and they can save a rhino every single day.""

Located in Limpopo province and home to the ""big five"" of rhino, lion, leopard, elephant and buffalo, Balule forms part of South Africa's flagship Kruger National Park.

Mkhabela and her colleagues use the same model of phone for communication and to capture images of suspicious activity during patrols, while other handsets have been installed to monitor perimeter fences.

Swiss-based environmental network, International Union for Conservation of Nature, said anti-poaching patrols have been cut in more than half of Africa's protected sites due to the impact of the pandemic.

One in five rangers has been laid off globally since the pandemic began, said deputy leader of the Wildlife Practice at WWF-International, Wendy Elliott.

Meanwhile, job losses and increased poverty have driven a growth in the hunting of bush meat.

But, to Mkhabela's relief, Balule is striking back.

Viewers of the park's streaming service have already reported hearing gunshots - signalling the possibility of poachers - and alerted rangers to trapped animals needing rescue.

""I want to be the reason my grandkids see rhinos in the years to come,"" said Mkhabela. (Writing by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo and John Stonestreet)

File photo courtesy of SippakornYamkasikorn/Pexels

Editor’s note: This story was originally published by Wired. It appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Humanity’s got a full-tilt zombie outbreak on its hands. As the world warms and certain regions— particularly the Arctic—dry, so does the super fuel known as peat. It’s basically concentrated carbon from dead plants, and it burns not at all like your typical Californian or Australian wildfire. Instead of sending towering flames upward, a peat fire burns in the opposite direction, smoldering deep in the soil. Oftentimes, firefighters will soak the ground with water and declare victory, only for the soil to reignite a surface fire months later. The land might even snow over while the smoldering persists undetected. That’s why scientists dub these menaces “zombie fires.”

If that wasn’t terrifying enough, peat fires can release 100 times the carbon that a wildfire does. That’s terrible both for the planet and for human health: In Indonesia, which has massive stores of peat that regularly burn uncontrolled, the smoke creates regular public health crises. Because a peat fire spreads both down into the soil and laterally across the landscape, they also threaten nearby farmlands and people.

Yet researchers say they have now found a weapon that could help put down a zombie fire for good—the equivalent of destroying its brain instead of just mangling its body. “Smoldering is the most persistent type of combustion on earth, because it’s really easy to start and very difficult to stop,” says Imperial College London engineer Guillermo Rein, coauthor on a new paper describing the work in the International Journal of Wildland Fire. “They call them zombie fires, but the equivalent would be like an army of zombies. They are very, very difficult to suppress.”

Just ask the firefighters who battled North Carolina’s Evans Road Fire in 2008, which simmered through swampy peatland. Engineers ended up pumping 7.5 billion liters of water from nearby lakes to flood the area. It took seven months to finally drown the fire.

If you’ve got a great big air tanker that can drop huge amounts of water on a zombie fire, good for you. But it’s not going to work. “No one fights smoldering fires, which are massive, with air tankers,” says Rein. “If they do, they’re doing PR. They’re telling everyone, ‘Don’t worry, we have it!’ But they don’t. They don’t. When I see these airplanes in a smoldering fire, I know they are completely desperate.”

That’s because deluging a zombie isn’t guaranteed to quickly kill it. Say you’re pumping massive quantities across a peatland, like firefighters did in North Carolina. That doesn’t mean the water is getting to the right places as it trickles underground. “It creates a channel, and the fire in that channel is suppressed, but then the water doesn’t go anywhere else,” Rein says. Other parts of the fire can fester untouched. And so the zombie lives on.

If firefighters don’t have enough water at their disposal, they may try compacting the soil with heavy machinery in a bid to cut off the fire’s oxygen supply. But that equipment is not always available to a crew. Even then, such a maneuver is dangerous work, since it requires driving over an active fire. Also, these fires can be huge, and heavy machinery can only cover so much ground.

So in the lab, Rein and his colleagues experimented with a novel anti-zombie weapon: water mixed with a nontoxic, readily available fire-extinguishing surfactant, also known as a wetting agent or suppressant. “It’s a little bit actually like soap—it just reduces the surface tension of the water and allows the water to penetrate better into a porous medium,” says Rein. “Peat is a porous medium.”

Using a small, custom-built “peat reactor,” which was stuffed with the plant material and lined with ceramic insulators, they could set a zombie fire and monitor it as it burned. Above the box they situated a nozzle to spray either regular water or their special blend on different fires. Compared to the same amount of plain water, the water with surfactant cut the time needed to extinguish the blaze by 40 percent. Thanks to that decreased surface tension, instead of creating channels, the mixture more uniformly penetrated the soil, so little patches of zombie fire had nowhere to hide.

It wasn’t that the surfactant had some sort of chemical effect on the fire—for instance, by decreasing oxygen levels. Instead it was more of a thermal effect, “in the sense that the surfactant allows the water to reach more hot spots and reach them faster,” says Rein.

That’s promising, because the less time a peat fire has to burn, the less land it will destroy and the fewer emissions it will spew. “If we have the ability to suppress these peat fires, that will help mitigate not only ground-level smoke pollution impacts but also the potential feedback with climate change where these deep, very prolonged, smoldering peat fires emit tons and tons of ancient carbon back into the atmosphere,” says Sophie Wilkinson, a wildfire scientist at McMaster University who studies peat fires but wasn’t involved in this new work.

For now, the researchers have demonstrated the effect in the lab, but the next step is to try it out on a controlled outdoor burn. Combined with the researchers’ previous work modeling how peat fires spread, the discovery could give firefighters a powerful weapon for putting down zombie fires. The team can now build “what if” scenarios for, say, fighting fires burning in Indonesia, and offer advice on how to distribute resources when quashing a particular fire.

“There is no positive outcome of peat burning,” says Rein. “Now we have an understanding of how to suppress them.”","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Wildfire_mountain.jpg,"['rein', 'firefighters', 'release', 'carbon', 'peat', 'surfactant', 'wildfires', 'times', 'smoldering', 'work', 'underground', 'soil', '100', 'zombie', 'fires', 'water']",none
86,86,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Fake ‘Survey Reports’ Flood Bengal Ahead Of Phase 2 Polls - Outlook India,https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-fake-survey-reports-flood-bengal-ahead-of-phase-2-polls/378841,"At least three “survey reports” are doing the rounds in Bengal’s social media sphere and as printed leaflet formats, predicting victory for either the Trinamool Congress (TMC) or the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to registration of at least one police case in the state.

Of these, two “survey reports” that went viral on social media concerns Nandigram, from where chief minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting in a high-voltage battle with her one-time lieutenant Suvendu Adhikari, now with the BJP. Nandigram is going to polls on April 1.

The purported surveys were allegedly conducted by poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s organisation, Indian Political Action Committee, or the I-PAC, and have predicted a defeat for Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram.

The first such report was only about Nandigram, predicting each candidate’s vote share up to decimal points. The I-PAC was quick to call out this as fake. In a tweet on March 29, the organisation wrote, “Anticipating a huge loss, @BJP4Bengal has resorted to doing what it does best – spread fake news! This document is fake $ and has ZERO credibility, just like BJP’s leaders & their promises! Circulating such fake reports won’t work.”

BJP IS LOSING BIG IN NANDIGRAM!

On March 31, I-PAC had to take to social media again to call yet another “survey report” attributed to it as fake. This was a screenshot from a desktop computer showing a PDF file predicting the results of all the 30 Assembly seats going to the polls on April 1, including Nandigram. The “report” predicted 23 of the 30 seats for the BJP, including Nandigram.

The text accompanying I-PAC’s tweet calling out the image as fake said, “Facing imminent defeat, @BJP4Bengal has now gone down to the level of using FAKE surveys in the name of I-PAC to keep the morale of their workers up!! P.S: In I-PAC, no one uses desktops so at least be smart in your effort to create fake survey/ reports.”

Till Wednesday afternoon, there was no news of any formal police complaint lodged by the I-PAC with regard to these “survey reports”.

However, in West Midnapore district, parts of which polled in the first phase and the rest will poll on April 1, the police have lodged a complaint after getting in hand leaflets printed using the logo of the state police. The leaflet claimed to be made of an intelligence report prepared by the police on the probable election result in Keshpur assembly seat and said that the TMC stood ahead of the BJP.

The district police has categorically denied having conducted any such survey.

Another leaflet that was distributed in parts of Chandrakona Road assembly seat, was a survey attributed to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent organisation of the BJP, and predicted the TMC’s win in the assembly seat. The RSS has denied having conducted any such survey.

Yet another ‘internal letter’ went viral on social media over the past couple of days. This one is a purported letter written by the BJP’s Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh to the party’s national president J P Nadda. In that letter, Ghosh was purportedly reporting Nadda that the party’s state unit conducted an internal survey which predicted only 2-4 seats for the BJP among the 30 that went to the polls in the first phase.

Union home minister Amit Shah had earlier claimed a day after the first phase polling that the BJP will bag 26 of these 30 seats.

Dilip Ghosh has termed this letter as “absolute rubbish” and saw “thumbprints of PK’s team’s work”. By ‘PK’, he was referring to Prashant Kishor.

Meanwhile, the BJP on Wednesday submitted a deputation with the Election Commission of India, demanding implementation of section 144 of the CrPC in Nandigram on the polling day. On the other hand, the TMC has submitted a deputation with the ECI listing names of places and houses in Nandigram where alleged hooligans and outsiders have gathered at the behest of the BJP’s Nandigram candidate.

89,89,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Raw material and finished goods — changing dynamics amid climate push - The Financial Express,https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/raw-material-and-finished-goods-changing-dynamics-amid-climate-push/2225803/,"Steel industry in China has performed well in the Covid 19 pandemic year with a 5.2% rise in production (@1053MT) in 2020 and a projected growth of 8% in steel consumption at 980.1 MT, according to WSA.

For any commodity it is universally true that raw material availability, its quality and price provide fundamental basis for the pricing of the finished products. Any risk associated with the input materials are perceived with utmost concern. In the recent past, both in the world market and inside the country, these types of events get major media publicity which in a way influence the marketing of the finished goods. It is fair to assume that supply scenario of the finished products also influences the demand and price of the raw materials and in a way, both are correlated.

Thus as the report on heavy rains and flood leading to the closure of the main rail link to Newcastle port and disruption of rail link to export terminals in South Africa have been made public, Indian buyers of thermal coal were looking for alternate sources of supply like Indonesia and coal prices started to move up. It is apparent that premium low vol coking coal HCC which sharply came down from $160.5/T FOB Australia in Jan’21 to $112/T in 4th week of March’21 may move further northward in the coming weeks.

The environmental push by the Chinese government in specific provinces (Tangshan etc.) may impose production ban on polluting industries and lead to supply constraints. However, as the overall demand scenario in China is good buoyed by stimulus measures and easing of the property market, the demand for merchant iron ore by China would continue unabated, thereby sustaining iron ore prices (current price CFR Chinese port $ 164.8/T) with marginal rise in H1 of 2021.

Current projections uniformly expect a contraction of demand and production in China in 2021. If this takes place, it would cause significant flutter in the trading price of iron ore.

Steel industry in China has performed well in the Covid-19 pandemic year with a 5.2% rise in production (@1053MT) in 2020 and a projected growth of 8% in steel consumption at 980.1 MT, according to WSA. In the first two months of 2021 the Chinese production (175MT) has grown by as high as 12.9% with a corresponding positive push to steel consumption.

Although production restriction on account of environmental reasons in the current year may lead to correction in provincial performance, degrowth in total production volume in 2021 which is predicted by most of the analysts may not come true. And therefore the estimates by WSA at keeping the consumption in 2021 at the same level in 2020 does not seem to be warranted as of now. The share of China in global steel consumption which started at 16.6% at the beginning of the century has already reached 54.6% share (India: 5.6%) in total consumption.

Another aspect arising out of this interdependence of raw materials and finished products, global and domestic, relates to the perception of the various players. For instance, when the global price of a commodity rises due to supply constraint or higher demand, the message to the producers of similar product in the domestic market is a positive signal towards raising the prices irrespective of the quantum. The oft-repeated import parity is a well established phenomenon that is called upon for justification. Needless to mention this is applicable to commodities that are regularly traded in the global market.

The other part is through direct import of the commodity which now becomes costlier to put pressure on the similar goods in the domestic market for price push. In the event of rise in global prices of specific commodities, there exists a sense of relative deprivation on the part of the domestic players, and this is most important, there is no demand shrinkage for the product.

Technology has a significant role to play in influencing the prices of raw materials and finished goods. It is anticipated that use of fossil fuel would undergo a paradigm shift in the coming decade.

Coal based power and steel, as it causes environmental problem, would be substituted by renewable energy and alternative routes for steel making like syn gas (coal syn gas, natural gas) and hydrogen based. The demand for metallurgical coal would be reduced over the years, while demand for non-coking coal for generation of syn gas for DRI and other downstream industries like Chemical and fertiliser would still be there.

Increasing use of scrap (incentivised by vehicle scrappage policy and setting up of scrap processing centres) by furnaces would enhance EAF capacities relatively more compared to BF-BOF process. A time is fast approaching when export products entering markets in EU and other regions would have to pass through rating benchmarked on CO2 emission levels.

90,90,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Strong relations likely to keep Thailand from toughening stance on Myanmar coup - The Japan Times,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2021/04/03/asia-pacific/thailand-myanmar-coup/,"Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is “gravely concerned” about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.

That leaves Thailand out of step with some countries of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator.

“(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner,” said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University.

The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha to “support democracy” within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.

Prayut, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019, rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.

The personal relationship began much earlier and from within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.

In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand’s King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant “in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military,” the Bangkok Post said at the time.

Brotherhood

“For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important,” said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand’s Kasetsart University.

“I don’t think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees. … I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more.”

Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400 kilometer border that is also Myanmar’s longest with any neighbor.

The geographical position and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup — only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar’s crackdown on anti-coup protesters.

Thailand’s wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.

The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar’s forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar’s wars in previous decades.

Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.

Gestures

While Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayut’s government was unlikely to be moved.

“They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that’s it.”

Business links are also strong.

Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.

Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers — who officially number 1.6 million.

Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.

But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.

Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers are hoping to use the tools of their discipline to solve a growing problem: how to identify and choose reviewers who can knowledgeably vet the rising flood of papers submitted to large computer science conferences.

In most scientific fields, journals act as the main venues of peer review and publication, and editors have time to assign papers to appropriate reviewers using professional judgment. But in computer science, finding reviewers is often by necessity a more rushed affair: Most manuscripts are submitted all at once for annual conferences, leaving some organizers only a week or so to assign thousands of papers to a pool of thousands of reviewers.

This system is under strain: In the past 5 years, submissions to large AI conferences have more than quadrupled, leaving organizers scrambling to keep up. One example of the workload crush: The annual AI Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)—the discipline’s largest—received more than 9000 submissions for its December 2020 event, 40% more than the previous year. Organizers had to assign 31,000 reviews to about 7000 reviewers. “It is extremely tiring and stressful,” says Marc’Aurelio Ranzato, general chair of this year’s NeurIPS. “A board member called this a herculean effort, and it really is!”

Fortunately, they had help from AI. Organizers used existing software, called the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS), to help assign papers to reviewers. TPMS, which is also used at other conferences, calculates the affinity between submitted papers and reviewers’ expertise by comparing the text in submissions and reviewers’ papers. The sifting is part of a matching system in which reviewers also bid on papers they want to review.

But newer AI software could improve on that approach. One newer affinity-measuring system, developed by the paper-reviewing platform OpenReview, uses a neural network—a machine learning algorithm inspired by the brain’s wiring—to analyze paper titles and abstracts, creating a richer representation of their content. Several computer science conferences, including NeurIPS, will begin to use it this year in combination with TPMS, say Melisa Bok and Haw-Shiuan Chang, computer scientists at OpenReview and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

AI conference organizers hope that by improving the quality of the matches, they will improve the quality of the resulting peer reviews and the conferences’ published literature. A 2014 study suggests there’s room for progress: As a test, 10% of papers submitted to NeurIPS that year were reviewed by two sets of reviewers. Of papers accepted by one group, the other group accepted only 57%. Many factors could explain the discrepancy, but one possibility is that at least one panel for each paper lacked sufficient relevant expertise to evaluate it.

To promote good matches, Ivan Stelmakh, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, developed an algorithm called PeerReview4All. Typically, a matching system maximizes the average affinity between papers and reviewers, even if it means some papers get really well matched reviewers and others unfairly get poorly matched reviewers. PeerReview4All instead maximizes the quality of the least good match, with an eye toward avoiding poor matches and increasing fairness.

Last year, Stelmakh experimented with using PeerReview4All at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), and reported results in February at another, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) conference. The method improved fairness significantly without harming average match quality, he concluded. OpenReview has also begun to offer a system aimed at increasing fairness, called FairFlow. NeurIPS will try at least one of these this year, says Alina Beygelzimer, a computer scientist at Yahoo and the NeurIPS 2021 senior program chair. “NeurIPS has a long history of experimentation.”

These systems all match a known set of papers to a known set of reviewers. But as the field grows, it will need to recruit, evaluate, and train new reviewers, conference organizers say. A recent experiment led by Stelmakh explored one way, which did not rely on AI, to ease those tasks. At last year’s ICML, he and collaborators used emails and word of mouth to invite students and recent graduates to review unpublished papers collected from colleagues; 134 agreed. Based on evaluations of those reviews, the team invited 52 to join the ICML reviewer pool and assigned them a senior researcher who acted as a mentor. In the end, the novice’s ICML reviews were at least as good as those of seasoned reviewers, as judged by metareviewers, Stelmakh reported at the AAAI meeting. He says organizers could potentially scale up the process to recruit hundreds of reviewers without too much burden. “There was a lot of enthusiasm from candidate reviewers” who participated in the experiment, Stelmakh says.

Matching systems that use affinity to measure reviewer expertise also let prospective reviewers bid on papers to review, and some recent work has attempted to address potential bias in this approach. Researchers have heard tales of bidders picking only their friends’ papers, essentially hacking the algorithm. A preprint posted on the arXiv server in February describes a countermeasure that uses machine learning to filter out suspicious bids. On a simulated data set, it reduced manipulation–even when potential cheaters knew how the system operated—without reducing match quality. Another algorithm, presented at NeurIPS last year, limits any one reviewer’s chance of being assigned a manuscript by enough to make it unlikely that multiple friends of an author bidding on it will all be assigned; researchers demonstrated the method’s effectiveness in reducing manipulation using a combination of simulated bids and real data from a previous conference.

One problem with the tools is that it’s difficult to evaluate how much they outperform alternative methods in real-world settings. Hard evidence would require controlled trials, but there have been none, says Laurent Charlin, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal. In part, that’s because many of these tools are new.

As they evolve, methods like these could also one day help journal editors outside computer science find peer reviewers—but so far uptake has been limited, says Charlin, who led the development of the TPMS affinity-measuring tool about 10 years ago. (Meagan Phelan, a spokesperson for AAAS, which publishes the Science family of journals, says they do not use AI in assigning peer reviewers.)

But in AI, Charlin says, “We are quite comfortable as a field with some level of automation. We have no reason not to use our own tools.”

92,92,FL-2021-000030-IDN,The nine boundaries humanity must respect to keep the planet habitable - Mongabay.com,https://news.mongabay.com/2021/03/the-nine-boundaries-humanity-must-respect-to-keep-the-planet-habitable/,"All life on Earth, and human civilization, are sustained by vital biogeochemical systems, which are in delicate balance. However, our species — due largely to rapid population growth and explosive consumption — is destabilizing these Earth processes, endangering the stability of the “safe operating space for humanity.”

Scientists note nine planetary boundaries beyond which we can’t push Earth Systems without putting our societies at risk: climate change, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol pollution, freshwater use, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals.

Humanity is already existing outside the safe operating space for at least four of the nine boundaries: climate change, biodiversity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance). The best way to prevent overshoot, researchers say, is to revamp our energy and food systems.

In 2021, three meetings offer chances to avoid planetary boundary overshoot: the Convention on Biological Diversity meeting in Kunming, China; the U.N. Climate Summit (COP26) in Glasgow, U.K.; and the U.N. Food Systems Summit in Rome. Agreements with measurable, implementable, verifiable, timely and binding targets are vital, say advocates.

Advanced human societies emerged during an unprecedented period of stability on Earth. During the 12,000 years prior to the Industrial Revolution, our planet’s surface temperature varied by less than 1° Celsius (1.8° Fahrenheit) above or below the average for that entire period. As a result, life — both human and wild — thrived.

But over the past two centuries, humanity has dramatically increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, pushing us outside this “safe” climate zone; outside the conditions for which civilization has been designed.

Unfortunately for us, climate change represents just one of nine critical planetary boundaries, which the imprudent actions of our species risk dangerously destabilizing and overshooting.

A safe operating space for humanity

In the mid-2000s, Johan Rockström, founding director of Sweden’s Stockholm Resilience Centre, gathered an international, interdisciplinary team of scientists to unite behind a single goal: define the boundaries for a “safe operating space for humanity” on Earth. They asked themselves: what are the safe operating limits of our planet, and what changes can we force on it before we trigger rapid, catastrophic environmental harm?

In 2009, the center published the Planetary Boundaries Framework, which outlined nine key processes, influenced by humanity, that threaten the stability of the entire Earth System. These are: climate change, biodiversity integrity (functional and genetic), ocean acidification, depletion of the ozone layer, atmospheric aerosol pollution, biogeochemical flows of nitrogen and phosphorus, freshwater use, land-system change, and release of novel chemicals (including heavy metals, radioactive materials, plastics, and more).

Together, the stability of these nine processes is essential to maintaining the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans and ecosystems in the delicate balance that has allowed human civilizations to flourish. However, these are also the processes that human activities have impacted most profoundly.

The researchers then estimated a limit of just how much human activities could exploit and alter each of these processes before the global system would pass a tipping point — a threshold beyond which we risk sending the Earth spiraling into a state that hasn’t been experienced for the entirety of human existence, bringing extreme change that could crash civilization and endanger humanity.

“Systems — from the oceans and ice sheets and climate system and ecosystems — can have multiple stable states separated by tipping points,” explained Rockström, now the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. If those “stable” systems are pushed too far, he said, they lose resilience and can transition, abruptly and irreversibly, into a new self-reinforcing state — one that might not support humanity.

The original 2009 Planetary Boundaries report, and its update in 2015, revealed a stark assessment: researchers found that humanity is already existing outside the safe operating space for at least four of the nine planetary boundaries: climate change, biodiversity, land-system change, and biogeochemical flows (Earth’s nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, which are being heavily impacted by global agribusiness and industry).

However, the experts warn, these limits are estimates: what we don’t know is how long we can keep pushing these key planetary boundaries before combined pressures lead to irreversible change and harm. Think of humanity, blindfolded, simultaneously walking toward nine cliff edges, and you gain some sense of the seriousness and urgency of our situation.

Dawn of the Anthropocene

The dynamics of large, complex and interconnected biogeochemical systems like those operating on Planet Earth can be thought of in terms of pathways or trajectories, weaving between different steady states. The Earth’s trajectory can be altered by tipping points, which shift us from one steady state to another (something like a car changing gears). A number of complex feedback processes can either reinforce the current steady state, or weaken it, and send the planet spiraling toward a completely new state, like a bowling ball with too much spin careening toward the gutter.

Climate change, the best known of the nine planetary boundaries on which we’re encroaching, offers a good example of how this equilibrium process works.

Today, “We are at risk of triggering tipping elements in the Earth System towards a ‘Hothouse Earth’ from which it would be very difficult to recover to pre-industrial climate,” explained Steven Lade, a Stockholm Resilience Centre researcher specializing in social-ecological system modeling.

However, “with rapid decarbonization we could possibly reach a ‘Stabilized Earth,’” he added, maintaining our climate within the safe window of conditions to which humanity has adapted over the last 12,000 years.

The period of Earth climate stability in which our societies have thrived is known as the Holocene epoch. Beginning some 12,000 years ago, it marked the end of more than 100,000 years of alternating glacial and interglacial periods that saw the planet’s temperature fluctuate by as much as 6°C (10.8°F).

Modern humans have existed for about 200,000 years, but it was “only in the last 10,000 years that we were able to develop civilization as we know it,” Rockström said. “The very origins of modern civilization, namely domestication of animals and plants and the establishment of agriculture, happened in the Holocene.”

Hear Claire Asher discuss the planetary boundaries and solutions to the challenges on Mongabay’s podcast, here:

Yet these very same hallmarks of our extraordinary success — agriculture, sedentary living, industrial manufacturing — are today fundamentally altering many Earth System processes responsible for keeping conditions on Earth stable.

In fact, our transgressions of the nine planetary boundaries have been so severe that geologists believe we have entered a new epoch in the Earth’s history. The start of the Anthropocene — a human-influenced period that scientists say was initiated somewhere between 10,000 and 70 years ago — has been marked by rapid, human-triggered increases in greenhouse gas emissions, large-scale land-use change, extreme biodiversity loss, and massive global consumption and pollution brought on by rapidly advancing technology and a booming Homo sapiens population.

The dawn of the Anthropocene, a new epoch, needs to serve as a warning, Rockström said, that “we’re starting to hit the ceiling of the biophysical coping capacity of the whole Earth System.”

On a path to climate and biodiversity overshoot

Six years on from the last Stockholm Resilience Centre update (another is due this year), Rockström noted there is little evidence we’ve reversed course to avoid looming tipping points. “If anything, we are even deeper into the transgression of climate, on biodiversity, on land-use, and on nitrogen and phosphorus. So we have not turned around the [2015] trends.”

Of the four boundaries that researchers say we have already exceeded, climate change and biosphere integrity are considered “core” planetary boundaries because either one, on its own, could change the course of Earth’s trajectory and endanger humanity.

“There’s enough science today to say that [human-induced climate change] on its own can knock the planet away from the Holocene state,” Rockström said. “Similarly, if we just continue our mass extinction, losing more and more species, from phytoplankton to top predators, you will come to a point where the whole planet [system] collapses.”

There is strong evidence we’re already in the midst of a global mass extinction. A 2019 assessment by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) reported that 25% of plants and animals assessed — totaling 1 million species worldwide — are threatened with extinction. A separate study found that more than 500 vertebrate species are on the brink, each with fewer than a thousand individuals remaining in the wild.

Importantly, researchers say we are flying blind when it comes to both the quantity or quality of biodiversity loss that can be tolerated by ecosystems before triggering irreversible change.

“IPBES made it clear that we have really high extinction rates right now and they’re getting higher,” said Rebecca Shaw, chief scientist and senior vice president of WWF. However, data not on extinctions, but on total population declines, are actually more informative for assessing biosphere health, she said, noting, “By the time species are moving to extinction there’s very little you can do.”

“We should really be looking at population [abundance] declines around the world, and nest that with ecosystem integrity measures, and nest that in [measures of] the way ecosystems are functioning to deliver services to humans,” Shaw explained.

According to WWF and the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) 2020 Living Planet Report, population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish declined by 68% on average between 1970 and 2016 — a strong alarm call.

Early warnings

Scientists are now detecting the first flashing warning lights on the Earth System dashboard, telling us humanity is already pushing beyond our world’s safe operating space for multiple planetary boundaries and approaching tipping points.

“We have changed the planet so much that it is very likely that there will be significant impacts, and we’re seeing those impacts in the last five years,” Shaw said.

An example: melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets has accelerated since the early 1990s, suggesting these colossal ice deposits may have now entered a new state of sustained and escalating retreat, after many centuries of stability. Contained within these now vulnerable ice sheets is enough water to raise the global sea level by more than 65 meters (213 feet).

Similarly, Arctic sea ice is retreating and scientists predict the region could be mostly ice-free in the summer as early as 2035 — with no certainty of what extreme changes this might bring.

Other early warning signs that we are approaching a climate change tipping point include increasingly frequent and severe droughts, heat waves, storms, and tropical cyclones.

“The number of climate-related natural disasters is climbing at an alarming rate, with significant economic and health impacts, especially for the most vulnerable,” said Ana María Loboguerrero Rodríguez, head of Global Policy Research for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).

No one knows how much stress civilization can withstand before it starts to collapse.

Feedback loops upon feedback loops

These early changes are signs of an impending shift from once stable Holocene conditions, say scientists. More concerning: many of these changes are expected to create positive feedback loops that further accelerate change.

For example, the continued melting of the Greenland ice sheet will not only cause major sea level rise, but also could alter ocean surface temperature and salinity, potentially triggering a transition in ocean circulation systems like the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC), which in turn could drastically alter global climate, and even accelerate the loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

However, it’s not all likely to be bad news: some feedback loops may have a balancing effect on the climate and on other planetary boundaries. “Which of these feedback loops wins, and when, is one of the big questions about our future climate,” Lade said.

Still, these reinforcing loops could trigger more complicated cascades of change. “The whole Earth System is a complex self-regulating system,” Rockström said, “if you push one [planetary boundary] too far it can cascade like a domino and impact the others.”

For example, land-use change due to agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation worldwide; it reduces the amount of water released to the air from plant leaves. In the Amazon Basin, this transpiration is a major source of rainfall. But signs are strong that rapid Amazon deforestation — combined with global climate change — may be triggering more extreme drought, leading to an abrupt shift from rainforest to degraded savanna, with profound implications for the entire planet. That biome-wide shift would release a vast store of ancient sequestered carbon, exacerbating climate change, leading to more drought and more tree die-off — a vicious, self-multiplying cycle.

“There is growing concern that, with the recent increase in deforestation rates under Brazil’s [Jair] Bolsonaro government, we may be approaching a tipping point for the Amazon rainforest,” said Will Steffen, emeritus professor at the Australian National University, Canberra, who was part of the team that developed the original planetary boundaries framework. “The three [Earth System tipping points] of greatest concern in my view are the Amazon rainforest, the Greenland ice sheet, and Siberian permafrost.”

The Amazon Rainforest example shows how disruptions to regional processes — such as the cycling of water by trees — can add up and push us toward planet-wide tipping points.

Another tipping point example: the devastating wildfires striking Australia and California in 2019 and 2020. They arose from multiple factors — intensifying drought due to climate change, accumulated leaf litter, unusual wind patterns — that built up slowly. Then, a small human intervention, such as a spark from a utility company power transformer as happened in California, was enough to “change a forest to a shrubland overnight because of climate change,” potentially altering biodiversity, Shaw said. “Climate change really manifests itself in these bursts of catastrophes.”

Regional interactions between planetary boundaries may already be accelerating our trajectory away from a safe Earth operating space. “At a planet scale, you don’t [yet clearly] see these types of things; [but] at the regional scale, it’s really phenomenal how [the interaction between] climate change and biodiversity loss [for example] is manifesting itself,” Shaw noted. “We never thought we’d see [biodiversity] collapse like we’re seeing at the regional scale this early.”

As regional and global change intensifies, scientists warn that it’s what we don’t know about the vast complexity of interactions between Earth System processes — only a fraction of which have been well studied — that concerns them most.

“It is quite frustrating to have to admit that we don’t yet fully understand the fundamental interactions between planetary boundaries,” Rockström said. Even if we are able to bring the climate system back into a safe operating space, he added, “we may by that time have triggered so much forest dieback and so much permafrost thawing and so much ice melt … that the planet has already chosen another route” — another trajectory and steady state not conducive to human civilization.

Food systems key to conserving a habitable Earth

If we are to steer our planet away from a devastating new trajectory, phasing out fossil fuels to reach a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions world economy is a key priority. But even more pressing, experts say, is a change to our food systems.

Food production accounts for nearly 25% of climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions, is the biggest driver of biodiversity loss, the primary cause of land-use change, one of the largest sources of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, and it generates huge freshwater demand. Because food production generates big carbon emissions, it adds to ocean acidification too. That covers six of the nine planetary boundaries.

Together, “a food-system transformation and an energy transformation would take us a long way back into the safe space,” Rockström said.

“Nothing short of a systemic transformation of food systems is required to feed the world’s current and future population sustainably under climate change,” said CGIAR’s Loboguerrero. Making that sweeping change would not only reduce emissions, but improve health and food security, “providing multiple incentives for behavior change.”

Setting ambitious policy priorities

The next 12 months offer golden opportunities for the global community to come together and agree on policy priorities to set Earth on a trajectory for long-term stability.

Three major international meetings are scheduled for 2021: the Convention on Biological Diversity’s (CBD) 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kunming, China, from Oct. 11-24; the U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, U.K., from Nov. 1-12; and the U.N. Food Systems Summit in Rome from July 19-21. Measurable, implementable, verifiable, time sensitive, and most importantly, binding targets and agreements are vital.

“It’s a big year for outcomes and for commitments for the next 10 years that will determine whether or not we stay within these planetary boundaries,” Shaw said. At WWF, she added, “we’re looking to work with other stakeholders through those three meetings to get actions to stay within the safe operating zone at both the regional scale and planetary scale.”

In a paper published in Science last October, Shaw joined an international team of scientists calling for the CBD to set “ambitious goals” for biodiversity and sustainability, such as no net loss of biodiversity by 2030.

What makes this year’s meetings more crucial than ever: reminders of past failed global summits, and a clear understanding that time is fast running out.

Cause for hope

Experts are calling for a transformative, holistic approach to avoid risky tipping points, seeing the entire Earth System as a shared global commons, with humans as stewards. “The intertwisted nature of this framework calls for the development of a novel governance approach at global, regional, and local scales,” Loboguerrero said.

One such framework is the Global Commons Alliance, which brings together more than 50 international NGOs, multinational corporations, and city policymakers to promote the adoption of science-based targets to operate within planetary boundaries. But that partnership will need to grow geometrically if we are to act effectively.

That’s a daunting global goal. But there is one planetary boundary — the first we ever realized we were in danger of crossing — that offers hope: the depletion of the ozone layer. In 1987, the world’s nations recognized the urgency and validity of the science, and embraced the politically binding requirements of the Montreal Protocol. We stepped back from the brink, shrinking the ozone hole, which could now be healed by 2050.

If nations can come together to address climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, as they did to address the threat to the ozone layer, then there is a chance we can reverse current trends and steer Earth’s trajectory back toward a stable Holocene state. That chance is growing dimmer — but it is an effort we absolutely need to make.

The Nine Planetary Boundaries: A closer look The Planetary Boundaries Framework (last updated in 2015) defines nine key Earth System processes and sets safe boundaries for human activities. They are: Climate change: Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are leading to increasing global temperatures. We passed the safe boundary of 350 parts per million of CO2 in 1988. By 2020, levels were 417ppm. Novel entities: One of the more elusive planetary boundaries, novel entities refers to harmful chemicals, materials, and other new substances (such as plastics), as well as naturally-occurring substances such as heavy metals and radioactive materials released by human activities. We release tens of thousands of synthetic substances into the environment every day, often with unknown effects. These risks are exemplified by the danger posed by CFCs to the ozone layer, or of DDT to biodiversity. Stratospheric ozone depletion: The depletion of O3 in the stratosphere as a result of chemical pollutants was first discovered in the 1980s and led to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The ozone layer is now showing signs of recovery. Atmospheric aerosols: Atmospheric aerosol pollution is a bane to human health and can also influence air and ocean circulation systems that affect the climate. For example, severe aerosol pollution over the Indian subcontinent may cause the monsoon system to abruptly switch to a drier state. Ocean acidification: Rising atmospheric CO2 levels are increasing the acidity of the world’s oceans, posing a severe risk to marine biodiversity and particularly invertebrates whose shells dissolve in acidic waters. Biogeochemical flows: We have profoundly altered the planet’s natural nitrogen and phosphorus cycles by applying these vital nutrients in large quantities to agricultural land, leading to runoff into neighboring ecosystems. Freshwater use: Agriculture, industry and a growing global population are putting ever greater strain on the freshwater cycle, while climate change is altering weather patterns, causing drought in some regions and flooding in others. Land-system change: Changes in land-use, particularly the conversion of tropical forests to farmland, have a major effect on climate because of the impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, on biodiversity, freshwater, and the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface. Biosphere Integrity: The functional integrity of ecosystems is a core planetary boundary because of the many ecoservices they provide, from pollination to clean air and water. Scientists are concerned about rapid declines in plant and animal populations, the degradation of ecosystems, and the loss of genetic diversity which could disrupt essential biosphere services.

The combined events caused over $360 billion in damage and washed 1.5 million tons of debris, including wrecked cars, buildings and homes, into the ocean. The tsunami also flooded Japan’s Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, which melted its cores and leaked radiation. More than 18,000 people died, and many others were reported missing.

The California coast experienced over $100 million in damage. Locally, tsunami surges and strong currents caused flooding and minor damage, mainly to the boating community. The County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services and San Diego County’s hazardous materials division also worked with local, state and federal agencies to develop emergency plans to document and handle debris that could potentially wash ashore in the years following.

The events on March 11, 2011 have helped shape local and statewide emergency planning and preparedness efforts and serve as a lasting reminder of the importance of being prepared. While tsunamis are rare along San Diego’s 70 miles of coastline, it is important to know your risks and be prepared. Whether you work, live, or visit the coast, here are some simple and no-cost steps you can take to be this tsunami preparedness week to be ready for tsunamis:

The effects will be felt in the long-term, according to the World Economic Forum, which in its annual Global Gender Gap Report found that the goalposts for gender parity appeared to be moving further away.

The organisation, which usually gathers the global elite in the plush Swiss ski resort of Davos each year, had found in its previous report, published in December 2019 right before the pandemic hit, that gender parity across a range of areas would be reached within 99.5 years.

But this year’s report shows the world is not on track to close the gender gap for another 135.6 years.

“Another generation of women will have to wait for gender parity,” the WEF said in a statement.

The Geneva-based organisation’s annual report tracks disparities between the sexes in 156 countries across four areas: education, health, economic opportunity and political empowerment.

– Workplace equality in 267 years –

On the plus side, women appear to be gradually closing the gender gap in areas such as health and education.

But inequality in the workplace — which has long appeared to be the stickiest area to fix — is still not expected to be erased for another 267.6 years.

And the pandemic has not helped.

The WEF pointed to a study by the UN’s International Labour Organization showing that women were more likely to lose their jobs in the crisis, in part because they are disproportionately represented in sectors directly disrupted by lockdowns.

Other surveys have shown that women were carrying a greater share of the burden of increased housework and childcare during lockdowns, contributing to higher stress and lower productivity levels.

Women were also being hired back at a slower rate than men as workplaces opened up again, according to LinkedIn data referenced in the report.

“The pandemic has fundamentally impacted gender equality in both the workplace and the home, rolling back years of progress,” WEF managing director Saadia Zahidi said in the statement.

“If we want a dynamic future economy, it is vital for women to be represented in the jobs of tomorrow,” she said, stressing that “this is the moment to embed gender parity by design into the recovery.”

– Political gender gap growing –

It was in the political sphere that the march towards gender parity did the biggest about-face, with several large-population countries seeing the political gender gap widen, the WEF study found.

Women still hold just over a quarter of parliamentary seats worldwide, and only 22.6 percent of ministerial positions.

On its current trajectory, the political gender gap is not expected to close completely for another 145.5 years, the report found.

That marks a 50-percent hike from the estimated 95 years in the 2020 report, WEF pointed out.

Progress across the categories varies greatly in different countries and regions.

The report pointed out that while Western European countries could close their overall gender gap in 52.1 years, countries in the Middle East and North Africa will take nearly 142.4 years to do so.

Overall, the Nordic countries once again dominated the top of the table: the gap between men and women was narrowest in Iceland, for the 12th year running, followed by Finland and Norway.

New Zealand took fourth place, ahead of Sweden.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government extended a lockdown by another week Monday after an alarming spike in coronavirus infections continued to surge and started to overwhelm many hospitals in the capital and outlying regions.

President Rodrigo Duterte placed Metropolitan Manila and four outlying provinces, a region of more than 25 million people, back under lockdown last week as daily infections breached the 10,000-mark. Leaders of the dominant Roman Catholic church shifted its Holy Week and Easter events online after all public gatherings, including in places of worship, were temporarily banned.

The government-run Lung Center of the Philippines became the latest hospital in the capital region to announce over the weekend that it can no longer accept walk-in patients after its COVID-19 ward reached full capacity while its emergency room was now handling twice its capacity.

“We are not just full. We are very full. In fact, the hospital has been full for the past two weeks,” Lung Center spokesman Dr. Norberto Francisco said.

Ad

Other hospitals said they could take steps to expand bed capacity but there was inadequate number of medical workers partly because many had also been infected.

Duterte’s administration has increasingly faced criticisms of mishandling the pandemic but presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the spread of more infectious coronavirus variants came as a surprise. “No one could have probably foreseen how infectious these new variants are and as a result of which we have these ballooning numbers,” Roque told ABS CBN News, adding officials would inaugurate a 110-bed intensive-care unit in a hospital in the capital region Monday and were planning to launch mobile COVID-19 intensive-care centers.

The Philippines has reported more than 795,000 COVID-19 cases with 13,425 deaths, the highest totals in Southeast Asia after Indonesia.

HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:

BEIJING — COVID-19 cases in the southwestern Chinese city of Ruili bordering on Myanmar have now topped 100.

That comes as authorities have launched an aggressive campaign to vaccinate all 300,000 residents of the city, whose outbreak is something of an anomaly in a country that has all-but eliminated local transmission of the virus.

The National Health Commission reported an additional 20 cases on Monday, five of them in which the persons showed no symptoms.

The cases were detected during city-wide nucleic acid testing, bringing the city’s total to 51 confirmed cases and 56 asymptomatic cases, which China has placed in a separate category.

Confirmed cases are treated in hospital while those who test positive without showing symptoms are isolated and placed under isolation.

Ruili on Friday launched a five-day drive Friday to vaccinate its entire population, with state media showing people lining up to get the jab.

Ad

Some of those infected are Myanmar nationals and authorities have offered free vaccinations to foreigners living and working in the city.

Residents have been order to quarantine at home and non-essential businesses have been closed. Security measures have also been tightened along the porous border to prevent illegal crossings.

China got off to a slow start in vaccinating its population of 1.4 billion people, despite having four vaccines approved for general use, but has now rolled out a nationwide vaccination drive in an effort to build herd immunity.

China has reported 90,305 total cases and 4,636 deaths, with 238 patients being treated in hospitals for COVID-19, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.

ROME — Priests, nuns and other people living in community settings are among the vaccination priority groups permitted under Italy’s revised national rollout. The country’s Piedmont region is going a step further by opening a special vaccine center just for the leaders of religious communities.

Ad

Medical personnel at the Cottolengo hospital complex in Turin are set to administer the vaccine to official representatives of Buddhist, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, as well as Waldensian and other non-Catholic institutions in Piedmont starting Wednesday.

The shots must be given in accordance with the national plan that requires the general population to be vaccinated in descending order of age, beginning with individuals 80 or older or have grave disabilities, then moving down the rollcall to those in their 70s,

Piedmont Gov. Alberto Cirio has called the vaccination initiative an example of inter-faith fraternity and sharing. Italy’s public health service is providing the vaccines.

HONOLULU — Hundreds of Special Olympics athletes with intellectual disabilities have received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine at a facility in Hawaii.

Physicians and medical employees from Kaiser Permanente worked in tandem with Special Olympics Hawaii to administer shots at Consolidated Theatres Kapolei on Saturday.

More than 250 people attended to receive their first shot of the Pfizer vaccine.

Kaiser Permanente hosted the vaccination clinic to inoculate community members who are at higher risk of severe illness after contracting the virus.

Daniel Epstein, president and CEO of Special Olympics Hawaii, said social isolation is one of the challenges that individuals with intellectual disabilities often deal with and the pandemic has exacerbated this.

BETHEL, Alaska — Alaska tribes will receive over $1 billion from the $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus relief bill from March.

KYUK-AM reported Wednesday that the tribes can take as long as three years to spend these funds, unlike a similar bill that was passed in 2020, which had a shorter deadline.

Teresa Jacobsson from the Alaska Tribal Administrators Association says tribes will have more leeway on how to spend the funds compared to previous legislation, but tribes still will be required to document their spending because records will be reviewed by auditors.

Ad

They can spend part of the federal funds to get professional help to manage the spending, but Jacobsson said beneficiaries will have to be cognizant of consultants and contractors who have taken advantage of tribes who have received virus relief funds in the past.

LA PAZ, Bolivia — Two nurses in Bolivia are in jail after being accused of stealing 500 COVID-19 vaccines in a small town on the border with Brazil.

Prosecutor Javier Colque requested two months of detention for the women at a hearing Saturday night in the small city of Guayaramerín in the Amazon.

Sealed boxes containing the vaccines were stolen on Thursday from a medical facility in Guayaramerín and were returned the next day by two hooded men who fled, according to authorities. However, Dr. Maicol Borches, coordinator of the city’s health network, said the vaccines won’t be used because they weren’t refrigerated after the theft.

WASHINGTON — Johnson & Johnson is taking over “full responsibility” for a subcontractor’s Baltimore facility that produces the drug substance for its single dose COVID-19 vaccine after an embarrassing mix-up.

The company says it’s adding leaders in operations and quality control to the Emergent BioSolutions plant to supervise the work of its vaccine line.

It comes after enough drug substance for about 15 million doses was contaminated by human error at the plant. The issue was flagged to federal regulators, who have yet to approve any doses from the Baltimore plant, last week.

J&J has delivered about 20 million doses from another plant to the federal government already and says it expects to deliver about 80 million more by the end of May.

DAMASCUS — Scores of Syria’s Christians gathered for prayers in one of Damascus’ largest Churches on Sunday, the second Easter under pandemic restrictions.

Ad

Church-goers eschewed masks but maintained their distance in the Our Lady of Damascus Church, many praying for a way out of the economic and political crises in the war-torn country that have become more dire during the pandemic.

Syria is witnessing a sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases. Intensive care units in the capital are full, and hospitals prepared for an influx of COVID-19 patients. The country has not yet started a national vaccination campaign.

So far, the war-ravaged country has reported more than 19,000 confirmed cases, including nearly 1,300 deaths. But the numbers are likely much higher given Syria's battered health care system and sparse testing.

In territories outside of government control, there are about 30,000 infection cases reported in the west and east of the country.

Church celebrations offered a respite from the pandemic, unemployment and inflation.

“We know that outside the country everyone is in a lockdown and closing down. But for us, this celebration is joyous,"" Jimmy Babek, a Christian scout at Our Lady of Damascus, said. “We can’t stop everything. We need to be happy.”

CAIRO -- Authorities say Libya has received its first shipment of coronavirus vaccines.

The Libyan Health Ministry said 101,250 doses of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine landed in the capital, Tripoli and were taken to the ministry’s storehouses on Sunday.

Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah said in a tweet that other shipments would arrive, although he didn’t set a timeframe.

Libya has seen a swell in confirmed COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.

The county of around 7 million people has reported more than 161,000 confirmed cases and 2,684 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. However, the actual number of cases in Libya, like elsewhere in the world, is thought to be far higher, in part due to limited testing.

LONDON — Britain’s government is planning to trial a coronavirus status certification plan over the coming months to allow the safe return of mass gatherings at places like sports grounds and nightclubs.

Officials are expected to consider passports that show whether a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has immunity due to having tested positive in the previous six months.

Ad

The trial events will include soccer’s FA Cup semi-final and final, the World Snooker Championships, and a comedy club show.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details on Monday. He said the trials will play an important role in allowing the “reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible.”

However, dozens of Johnson’s Conservative Party lawmakers have opposed the plans, and Johnson could struggle to get Parliament to approve the trials.

PARIS — Some 9,000 people are getting vaccinated at a huge stadium in Lyon during Easter weekend, and thousands more around France are spending the holiday lining up for injections elsewhere as the government tries to speed up vaccinations amid a new virus surge.

But as France faced its second Easter in a row under the cloud of the pandemic, some cities pushed back against President Emmanuel Macron’s insistence that “there are no weekends or days off during vaccination.”

Ad

Authorities in Strasbourg on the German border shut down their vaccination facilities Friday through Monday, to allow workers “a little rest at last,” according to a city official. To ensure residents still had access to potentially life-saving vaccines, the city expanded vaccination hours during the week and injected all its weekly supply of doses between Monday and Thursday instead.

The city of Sarcelles north of Paris is among those staying open Sunday, amid mushrooming infections and demand. The surrounding Val d’Oise region now has the highest infection rate in France along with some of its poorest neighborhoods, and Sarcelles’ challenges symbolize inequalities worsened by the virus.

The Easter acceleration efforts stand in contrast to the beginning of France’s vaccine rollout in late December, when low staffing for the end-of-year holidays meant a slow start to injections, which initially focused on nursing homes.

France has reported one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, at 96,280 people, and the highest number of virus infections in Europe.

SEOUL, South Korea — A limited number of Christians attended Easter Sunday services in South Korea wearing and adhering to the country's stringent social distancing rules.

Yoido Full Gospel Church, the biggest protestant church in South Korea, allowed only about 2,000 church members to attend its Easter service, or about 17% of its main building's capacity. Masked church members sang hymns, clapped hands and prayed as the service was broadcast online and by Christian TV channels.

Seoul’s Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral, the biggest Catholic church in South Korea, limited Mass attendance to 20% of its capacity and livestreamed the service on YouTube.

Under current physical distancing rules, religious facilities in the greater Seoul area are allowed to have up to 20% of worshippers attend their regular services. Earlier Sunday, South Korea reported 543 new coronavirus cases, taking the country’s total to 105,279 with 1,744 deaths.

LAS VEGAS — Nevada regulators say casinos seeking the state’s OK to raise the current gambling floor occupancy limit above 50% must take steps to encourage their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

The Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission on Friday issued a memo with guidelines pushing casinos to provide paid time off for employees to be vaccinated, coordinate transportation to vaccine sites and make arrangements with pharmacy companies for vaccine distribution.

The state on March 15 increased maximum gambling floor occupancy to 50% of capacity, up from 25%, and the regulators have been authorized beginning May 1 to approve reopening plans with higher occupancy limits.

The memo said operators’ requests for higher capacity limits “will only be taken in cases where licensees have taken measurable and material steps” to vaccinate their workforce.

The memo said Nevada’s hospitality workforce has a “relatively low degree of vaccination penetration,” though some companies have begun taking steps to encourage employees to be vaccinated.

Kerala Polls: Salman Khurshid urges Keralites not to break the trend of choosing alternate fronts

India

oi-Deepika S

Thiruvananthapuram, Mar 28: Senior Congress leader and former External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid on Sunday urged the people of Kerala not to break the pattern of choosing alternate political fronts- LDF and UDF- every five years and said the decades-old election trend has given the state its best possible advantages.

Very sensibly and judiciously, the people of the state have always ensured that the best is available to them between the two fronts, he said while addressing the media here ahead of the April 6 Assembly polls.

Khurshid also urged Keralites to ensure that the secular features of politics in the state is ''kept alive'' always.

''There is a pattern of behaviour by which the voters shift from one front to the other every five years.

And that has given Kerala the best possible advantage...

possible alternative. Nothing should happen to break that pattern here. Its our appeal,'' he said.

With this, the message Kerala would be sending out is that what was being attempted everywhere in the country, including where there is a viable BJP-NDA presence, would be reversed from here, he said.

''Lets go to the very beauty and ideology of India, which combines all religions... combines together Hindus and Muslims...like in a beautiful bouquet of flowers. That is India,'' the former union minister said.

Criticising the LDF government over gold smuggling case and alleged misuse of flood relief funds, Khurshid said some recent developments in the state were not part of Kerala's culture and character.

The floods in 2018 had caused enormous damage to the state, he said.

''But the relief money that should have gone to the needy and victims of the flood has gone into private hands. That is very unfortunate,'' the senior Congress leader added.

Alleging that the unemployment rate in Kerala was double the national average, which was ''unacceptable'', Khurshid also slammed the Left government over crimes against women and children and incidents of 'police brutality.'

Last month, the U.S. Air Force’s Tyndall base received semi-autonomous robot dogs, which are to be deployed in security surveillance roles there, marking the first time the U.S. military has done so.

In a news release published on March 29, the air force has noted that the dogs, designed by private firms Ghost Robotics and Immersive Wisdom, were delivered to the base in Florida on March 22 for integration with the 325th Security Forces Squadron (325th SFS). The Quad-legged Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Q-UGV) – which some might find mildly creepy – “will significantly increase situational awareness for defenders,” the release quoted Mark Shackley, Tyndall AFB Program Management Office security forces program manager, as saying.

“The robot dogs can operate in minus 40-degree to 131-degree conditions and have 14 sensors to create 360-degree awareness. They are also equipped with a crouch mode that lowers their center-of-gravity and a high-step mode that alters leg mobility, among other features,” the release also noted.

The Tyndall AFB has tried to brand itself as the “Installation of the Future,” with “smart-building sensors, increased hurricane wind load levels, and design flood elevation specifications,” and other enhancements to increase resilience, according to military officers responsible for the base.

“Across the base, every squadron has been pushing the envelope of how we do things and expanding our optics of what is possible. One huge attraction piece of the robot dogs is that it’s highly mobile and with the amount of construction we will face over the next few years, it helps us maintain and increase our security posture,” the March 29 air force news release quoted 325th SFS Master Sargent Krystoffer Miller as saying.

In November last year, the U.S. Air Force selected Boca Raton firm Immersive Wisdom to build a 3D Virtual Operations Center at Tyndall AFB through which base security personnel would be able to use the Q-UGV to patrol the base integrating sensor and video data streams in real time.

Commenting on the how the Immersive Wisdom tech will interface with the robots built by Philadelphia-based Ghost Robotics, 325th Security Forces Squadron commander Major Jordan Criss was quoted by an industry news website as saying, “We will be able to see exactly what the robot dog is detecting through its mobile camera and sensor platform if desired, we will also be able to issue verbal commands to a person or people through a radio attached to the dogs.”

Separately, robotics firm Boston Dynamics announced in September last year that their robot dog Spot – which can also be used for surveillance – was available for purchase for commercial use in Canada, European Union and United Kingdom. Spot made news last May when it was, well, spotted in a Singapore park relaying COVID-19 instructions, leading comedian Stephen Colbert to compare the spectacle with scenes from Netflix show “Black Mirror.” Incidentally, a larger, load bearing, variant of Spot – BigDog – was passed over by the U.S. Marine Corps in 2015 because it was a “loud robot that’s going to give away their [marines] position.”

In February, Spot yet again made news after a group of meme-makers equipped it with a paint gun allowing users to use the robotic canine to go on a rampage. At that time, Wired quoted a member of the collective as saying “… if we actually talk candidly about what it’s [Spot] going to be used for in the real world, you could say it’s police, you could say it’s military.”

99,99,FL-2021-000030-IDN,Claims Against Cuomo: A Look At The Womens Allegations - News18,https://www.news18.com/news/world/claims-against-cuomo-a-look-at-the-womens-allegations-3586646.html,"NEW YORK: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing allegations that he sexually harassed or behaved inappropriately toward women who worked with him or met him elsewhere now including one he encountered while on official business. The woman, Sherry Vill, said at a press conference Monday that Cuomo forcibly kissed her cheeks and made her uncomfortable while examining flood damage at her home.

Other accusations range from groping under a woman’s shirt and planting unwanted kisses to asking unwelcome personal questions about sex and dating.

The Democratic governor has said that he “never touched anyone inappropriately and never made any inappropriate advances, and that no one ever told him at the time that he was making them uncomfortable. He has called some allegations false.

Cuomo has also suggested that he was simply being an old-school politician in greeting people with hugs and kisses but that sensitivities have changed.

Here’s a look at some of the workplace allegations, in the order they became public:

LINDSEY BOYLAN, 36, a former state economic development adviser, says the governor kissed her on the lips as she was leaving a one-on-one meeting in his office and suggested playing strip poker on a state plane. Cuomo says both stories are false. Among her other allegations: Cuomo summoned her alone to his office after a holiday party and made what she took to be a reference to former President Bill Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The governor also sent Valentine’s Day roses to Boylan and other female staffers, she said.

CHARLOTTE BENNETT, 25, a former Cuomo aide, said the governor asked her about her love life including whether she ever had sex with older men and talked about his own, saying that age differences didn’t matter in relationships and he was open to dating women over 22. During a meeting alone in his office, the governor said he was lonely and talked about wanting to hug someone, Bennett said. She said she swiftly complained to Cuomos chief of staff and was transferred to another job. She said she spoke to a lawyer for the governor, but didnt insist on further action because she liked her new post and wanted to move on.

ANNA RUCH, a guest at a wedding where Cuomo officiated, told The New York Times that right after meeting her, he put his hand on her lower back, called her aggressive for removing it, placed his hands on her cheeks and asked to kiss her. She said she turned away.

ANA LISS, 35, a former aide, said Cuomo asked her whether she had a boyfriend, once kissed her hand at her desk and called her by patronizing names, including blondie,"" sweetheart and honey."" At a reception, the governor hugged her then put his arm around her lower back and waist as they posed for photo, Liss said. She said she eventually asked for a job transfer. In an interview, Liss said she was not claiming sexual harassment per se, but felt the administration wasnt a safe space for young women to work.

KAREN HINTON, who worked for Cuomo when he was Clinton’s federal housing secretary in the 1990s, said Cuomo gave her an overly long and intimate hug after calling her to his hotel room for a conversation that turned to personal topics on a trip where she was serving as a consultant to the housing agency. Cuomo said Hinton’s account was not true.

A MEMBER OF CUOMO’S STAFF alleged that he closed a door, reached under her blouse and fondled her after summoning her to the governors mansion in Albany for help with his cellphone, according to the Times Union of Albany. The newspaper didnt name the woman, who said that she told Cuomo to stop groping her and that he had touched and flirted with her previously.

The Times Union’s reporting is based on an unidentified source with direct knowledge of the womans accusation.

The woman recently told a supervisor, and at least one of her bosses reported the allegation to a lawyer for the governor this month, according to the newspaper.

Cuomo called the report gut-wrenching in a statement and said: I have never done anything like this.

ALYSSA McGRATH, 33, a current administrative assistant in Cuomo’s office, told The New York Times that he looked down her shirt, quizzed her about her marital status, and told her she was beautiful, using an Italian phrase she had to ask her parents to interpret.

McGrath didnt say the governor made sexual contact with her but thought his behavior was sexual harassment. She recalled Cuomo kissing her on the forehead and gripping her firmly around the sides while posing for a photo at a 2019 office Christmas party.

Cuomo lawyer Rita Glavin responded by reiterating his denials of inappropriate advances and touching. She told the Times he has greeted both men and women with hugs and kisses on the cheek, has put his arm around people for photos and uses such Italian phrases as “ciao bella (“hi, beautiful"" or ‘bye, beautiful), though she said he didnt say that to McGrath.

None of this is remarkable, although it may be old-fashioned,"" Glavin added.

SHERRY VILL, 55, said she felt manhandled when Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her cheeks while visiting her Rochester-area home in spring 2017. He was there to inspect the aftermath of flooding near Lake Ontario.

The governor planted kisses on both her cheeks in front of her family members, told her she was beautiful, and then held her hand, grabbed her face and kissed her on the cheek again outside her home, she said.

Vill said she found Cuomo’s behavior was flirtatious and inappropriate, his body language made her uncomfortable and the episode embarrassed her in front of her family and neighbors.

There was no immediate comment from the Cuomo administration on her allegations.

The governor has said his tendency to hug and kiss people as a greeting stems from his Italian-American heritage.

Vill said she has Italian relatives herself, and they don’t kiss strangers.
