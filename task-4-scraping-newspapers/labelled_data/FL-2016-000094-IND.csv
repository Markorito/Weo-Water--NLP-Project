Over 22 people have been killed and 23.71 lakh affected in the Bihar floods with many areas, specially the riverine belt of 12 districts, submerged.

Bihar is facing one of the worst floods in the decade despite receiving less than normal rainfall as all the major rivers flowing through the state are in a spate. Ganga, Sone, Punpun, Burhi Gandak, Ghaghra and Kosi rivers have affected 23.71 lakh people in 1,115 villages living in 12 districts of the state, a statement from the Disaster Management Department said.

Of the 38 districts in the state, nearly 20 have been affected by the recent floods.

Bhojpur district, which accounted for the maximum number of deaths, reported 12 deaths followed by Vaishali (6), Bhagalpur (2) and one each in Buxar and Lakhisarai district.

On Tuesday, at least one person was killed as a boat carrying 25 people overturned in Punpun river in Aurangabad, Bihar. As per the latest reports, at least 18 people are still missing, which includes some school children who were on the boat.

The situation worsened after Monday after water was released from Nepal and adjoining states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, leading to further rise in water levels of major rivers in the state, according to a report in The Times of India. Responding to this, the Centre on Monday night rushed 10 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams to the flood-hit areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in order to launch a massive relief and rescue operations to help those marooned in these states.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the Centre's intervention to desilt the river Ganga and also demanding the removal of Farakka barrage which, he insisted was behind increasing silt in the river. Speaking to the media after his meeting with the Prime Minister, Kumar insisted that desilting the river Ganga is the only solution to avoid the almost annual occurrence of floods and making it flow unhindered.

Ganga was flowing above danger mark at seven places in various parts of four districts — Digha ghat, Gandhi ghat, Hathidah in Patna, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district, Munger district and Buxar district.

River Sone was flowing above the danger level by 129 cm near Maner in Patna.

The 12 flood-affected districts of the state are Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna, Vaishali, Saran, Begusarai, Samastipur, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Munger, Bhagalpur and Katihar.

The authorities concerned are estimating the crop loss and total areas affected due to the floods. Around 179 relief camps have been set up in the flood-hit areas, giving shelter to 1,07,000 people even as 160 medical teams were providing services. Besides, 49 camps were being run only for animals.

However, an article in The Hindu argues that capacity-building to handle catastrophic weather events is poor, and serious attention is not given to setting up relief camps, creating crisis-proof health infrastructure and stockpiling dry rations and medicines.

Also, given the state's track record in healthcare, the cascading effect of healthcare problems, typical after the flood water recedes, will be another catastrophe that Bihar will have to battle. The situation is oddly reminiscent of the 2008 Kosi floods in the state.

On 18 August 2008, the Kosi river breached its embankment and displaced 45,000 people. According to a paper published in India Environment Portal, the sheer magnitude and expanse of the devastation escalated purely due to the lack of awareness, warning and preparedness for flood disaster. And this is the case when floods are a perennial phenomenon in most parts of Bihar.

According to the United Nations's Development Plan report on the 2008 floods, floods affect the existing inequalities and widen the socio-economic differences. Household level analysis confirmed that the districts affected by floods were vulnerable in terms of human development and have limited access to basic amenities.

Following the 2008 Kosi floods, in addition to minor ailments, more than one in three households reported dehydration/dysentery. Sadly, given the current situation, it cannot be said that the healthcare machinery in the internal parts of Bihar is well-equipped to battle such outbreaks.

The case is not very different this year. Districts like Bhojpur, Vaishali, Begusarai are considered to be among the most backward in Bihar, according to a report in the Deccan Herald . Once the flood water has receded and the media spotlight has gone off from Bihar, how the state will fare in combating healthcare needs apart from renovation of already dire state of infrastructure remains to be seen.

During a visit to flood-hit riverine area in Fatuha and Bakhtiarpur blocks of Patna on Tuesday, the RJD chief, along with his son and the state health minister Tej Pratap Yadav, was trying to apply balm to the bruised and the marooned awaiting relief. Instead, he ended up delivering some sermons.

“You are fortunate that the Ganga has reached your homes. It does not always happen. In most cases you go to it,” he said, in his characteristic style to TV news channels.

Perhaps, Prasad’s jibe was aimed at the BJP, which recently came up with a scheme for making Gangajal available to people at their doorsteps through post offices.

Prasad did not stop there. He extolled the virtues of Gangajal and how difficult it was to get its “pure” nature these days.

“Who gets pure Gangajal these days? In the last one decade, the Ganga has moved away from us. It has now returned,” he said, as the locals looked on in confusion.

In the past, Prasad used to term lack of rain in Bihar as ‘bad omen’ and often attributed it to chief minister Nitish Kumar’s act of eating biscuits during a solar eclipse when he should have been observing fast.

But when cornered by the media over his statement, Prasad felt the troubled waters and amended his statement, describing the floods as a ‘divine calamity’ as he took stock of the relief and rescue operations.

“The situation is worse than even 1975 floods. There is extensive damage to crops and it would be assessed for proper relief,” he added.

When the locals told him about lack of boats and adequate relief, he said he would ensure all help was extended to the people. “I have requested the state government for more boats, food material and fodder. The government is doing its best to provide nutritious food and medicines to the people,” the former chief minister said.

He also said the prime minister should take care of flood-hit people of Bihar. “The local political representatives should also ensure maximum help to the people in the hours of need, forgetting their differences,” he added.

Bihar has been badly hit by the floods with several areas inundated. After his aerial survey of the flood-hit areas recently, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday met PM Narendra Modi in New Delhi, drawing his attention to the need for instant relief measures.

JD(U) leader KC Tyagi defended Lalu Prasad’s statements said, “Nothing wrong should be read into his statement. Since he is of religious bent of mind and what he said was to assuage the people and keep faith.”","Fri, 19 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_800x600/HT/p2/2016/08/24/Pictures/lalu-prasad-yadav-making-aerial-survey_0f5a8f94-69d5-11e6-8382-bd2fa398f652.jpg,"['relief', 'tells', 'victims', 'prasad', 'flood', 'gangajal', 'statement', 'floodhit', 'reached', 'floods', 'fortunate', 'bihar', 'chief', 'homes', 'minister', 'ganga', 'lalu']", ,flood

Half hour later, she was fished out of the water by her mother with a half eaten guava still in her hand. The body of 12-year-old Suman Kumar, who had come to visit his sister in nearby Asja village, was found hours after he went missing. Local fishermen recovered his lifeless body clinging on to a small tree submerged in water. As the flood water started receding from the Seemanchal of Bihar, every village in the four districts in this region – Kishanganj, Purnea, Kathihar and Araria – have similar tragedies to share.

Continuous rain and rise in water levels in Mahananda, Kankai, Retua, Mechhi and Bakra rivers have caused massive flooding in this part of the state, with Seemanchal being the hardest hit. Water released from Nepal has also compounded the tragedy. A record 1,000 mm rain the last one week threw life out of gear affecting around 20 lakh people. Mud houses have been damaged, crops destroyed and livestock washed away in the flood. Though teams of the National Disaster Management Force are carrying out rescue operations, victims say the scale of the devastation is too large and that current strength of NDRF personnel is not enough.

Road links to scores of villages have been cut off. “Pichala panchayat in Kishanganj is cut off totally as all the roads connecting the villages have been damaged in the floods,” Raju of Daula panchayat under Kishanganj district told IndianExpress.com over phone.

People are using small boats to reach safety. “We are using makeshift boats to commute. Many people in our village have no ration for days. We have arranged food material to distribute to the affected families,” said Wasim Akram of Asja village. He said many people have volunteered to help the needy.

Though the government has begun relief and rescue mission, they seem to be overwhelmed by the scale of the tragedy. “The government is distributing 5 quintals of eatables which includes chura and jaggery per panchayat. It is definitely not enough to serve every affected household in a panchayat,” he said.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar conducted an aerial survey of the area on Thursday and held a meeting in Purnea with the District Magistrate (DM) and other officials. When contacted over phone, Purnea DM Pankaj Kumar Pal said he was busy in relief camps and that he will give comments later.

The issue was raised in the Lok Sabha also when All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi demanded that the Centre should send a team to asses the damage and compensate the victims.

Speaking about loss of property, Wasiqur Rahman, a teacher, told over phone that the flood has pushed the region back by decades. “On the ground, nothing is visible except water. Paddy crop, the mainstay of the region, has been completely destroyed. And small farmers are severely hit by this,” he said.

The ravaging waters have displaced thousands of people and the river channels have also reached dangerously close to villages. “A tributary of the Mahananda river has breached its course and is within a striking distance of Pokharya village under Baisa block in Purnea,” Rahman said.","Sat, 30 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/bihar-flood-480.jpg,"['flood', 'villages', 'loss', 'village', 'bihars', 'panchayat', 'water', 'crop', 'seemanchal', 'communication', 'links', 'destroys', 'source', 'counts', 'kishanganj', 'district', 'snaps', 'bihar', 'purnea']", ,flood

The Ganga and five other rivers were still flowing above danger mark in many parts of Bihar having triggered a flood-like situation in the districts situated along their banks. The districts witnessing flood-like situation included Patna, Vaishali, Buxar, Bhojpur, Saran, Begusarai, Samastipur, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Munger, Bhagalpur and Katihar, a Disaster Management Department statement said.

The six rivers including Ganga were flowing above danger mark in Patna, Bhagalpur, Khagaria, Katihar, Siwan, Bhojpur and Buxar districts, it said. Ganga was flowing above danger mark at six places – Digha ghat, Gandhi Ghat, Hathidah in Patna, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district – and in certain points of Munger district and Buxar district, it said.

However water level in Ganga at Gandhi and Digha ghats here showed a receding trend, indicating that the state capital does not face imminent flood threat from the swollen river. “Both Gandhi Ghat and Digha Ghat are witnessing a receding trend. The water level is 50.18 meter and 51.74 meter at Gandhi Ghat and Digha Ghat respectively. The water level are receding or would remain constant,” Patna District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar Agarwal told PTI. At present, there is no possibility of Ganga waters entering the city, he said.

As per the Water Resources Department, several other rivers, apart from Ganga, were too flowing above danger mark. The rivers were Sone at Koilwar (Bhojpur) and Maner (Patna), Punpun Sripalpur (in Patna), Ghaghra at Gangpur-Siswan in Siwan, Kosi at Baltara and Kursela in Katihar district and Burhi Gandak in Khagaria. Quoting Central Water Commission’s report, the department said water level of Ganga was flowing above danger level at Gandhi Ghat, Digha Ghat and Hathidah (Patna) by 168 cm, 79 cm and 141 cm respectively at 6 AM today. The department said there will be a decline of water level by 20 cm further at Digha ghat (Patna) by tomorrow morning.

Altogether 1,39,330 persons have been evacuated to safer places so far, the statement said, adding around 1.05 lakh people have taken shelter in 162 relief camps. All camps have the facilities of medical teams apart from halogen tablets to clean drinking water. 1,537 boats are pressed into service by the government to evacuate the affected people to safer places, besides National and State Disaster Response Force teams, already been deployed in the affected districts.

Kishanganj district in north Bihar is reeling under severe flood affecting 1.65 lakh people across 285 villages. An alert has been sounded and a team each from the NDRF and SDRF are carrying out relief and rescue works. The district received 100 cm rain over the past week causing the worst flooding in the last 30 years.

“Three people have died due to rain and two others because of lightening. We have provided ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the families of the victims,” said Pankaj Dixit, DM, Kishanganj.

The Mahananda river is in spate leading to massive flooding in the catchment areas. Dixit said 85 villages are severely hit. He said the situation continued to be grim as the water level is not receding from the danger mark.

Minhaj Sawar, an advocate, said the government’s response to this calamity should have been more proactive. “The NDRF team has not been able to reach the worst affected parts. It is yet to ascertain how many people are still trapped in rain water,” he said.

Waters have reached National Highway No 31 along the Bihar-West Bengal border. People have taken shelter in relief camps set up at schools and other government facilities. Many villages in North Dinajpur have also been affected. “Over a thousand families have been affected by the floods at Kanki panchayat alone” said Rajiv Jain, a member of the local civic body.

Senior officials said relief and rescue operations were going on in full swing.

He said the flood situation was grim in some districts following rising water level in rivers.

The government has deployed 587 personnel of the National Disaster Response Force and the state disaster response force in the worst hit areas.

A water resources department official said 2,034 villages had been affected by the floods.

Of the five lakh people displaced till Sunday, nearly 2.50 lakh are living in different shelters.

“Thousands have taken shelter in higher areas, on national highways and in schools and other buildings,” an official said.

The government has set up 412 relief camps and deployed 1,019 boats in relief and rescue work.

The worst hit districts are Purnea, Kishanganj, Araria, Darbhanga, Madhepura, Katihar, Supaul and Saharsa.

Unconfirmed reports say at least 28 people, including women and children, have perished in the floods.

The authorities have asked people living in low-lying areas to move to higher ground.

Major rivers in the state including the Koshi, Gandak, Bagmati and Ganga are in spate following heavy rains, officials said.

“With heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in (neighbouring) Nepal, the water level of these rivers has been rising for several days,” one officer told IANS.

Chief minister Nitish Kumar has ordered officials to survey the damage to houses, crops and other properties.

He has asked the health department to arrange for medicines to check the outbreak of water-borne diseases.

7,7,FL-2016-000094-IND,Sudden water release from Madhya Pradesh dam may have caused Bihar floods - The Indian Express,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bihar-flood-madhya-pradesh-dam-water-release-cause-farakka-barrage-2994833/,"Bansagar, about 50 km south of Rewa town in Madhya Pradesh, is a multi-purpose irrigation-cum-hydroelectric project on Sone river that flows through eastern Uttar Pradesh and south Bihar before meeting Ganga at Patna. (Source: PTI) Bansagar, about 50 km south of Rewa town in Madhya Pradesh, is a multi-purpose irrigation-cum-hydroelectric project on Sone river that flows through eastern Uttar Pradesh and south Bihar before meeting Ganga at Patna. (Source: PTI)

While Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been blaming the Farakka barrage for the flooding in Patna and elsewhere in the state, it is now getting increasingly clear that sudden release of large volumes of water from Bansagar dam in Madhya Pradesh could have been the main reason for the worst “man-made floods” in the country in several years.

Bansagar, about 50 km south of Rewa town in Madhya Pradesh, is a multi-purpose irrigation-cum-hydroelectric project on Sone river that flows through eastern Uttar Pradesh and south Bihar before meeting Ganga at Patna. The reservoir has a capacity to store over 5 billion cubic metres of water.

With central India, particularly Madhya Pradesh, having received very good rainfall this season, water level at the reservoir was steadily rising from the first week of July. Throughout August, water level in the reservoir was well above 336 m, very close to the full reservoir level of 341.64 m. With more rains forecast later in the month, it was expected that water would be slowly released from the reservoir to avoid a breach.

However, Madhya Pradesh authorities hoarded the water till the level crossed 341 m on August 18. Information on the website of state’s water resources department shows that after that mark was reached, the dam released as much as 14,08,571 cusec of water between August 18 and August 20. Prior to that, water was released only once in the previous 10 days. The sudden release of huge volumes of water flooded downstream areas which were already having good rain during that time.

“If water had been released in phases over a longer duration, this kind of flooding could have been avoided,” a water official in central government said.

“It is difficult to say whether there would not have been flooding in Bihar in the absence of such massive release of water in a short period, but the situation would definitely have been much better. Some amount of flooding is definitely a result of good rainfall in Himalayan region in the last two weeks which have brought waters in rivers like Ghagra or Rapti that flow into Bihar,” he said.

Another official said states tend to hoard water in their reservoirs due to uncertainties in rainfall in future. However, this time the forecast by Indian Meteorological Department had been repeatedly predicting continued good rainfall over central India.

Data shows that Bansagar dam released 59046 cusec of water at 8 am on August 18, immediately after the water level crossed the 341 m mark. It released another 1,42,672 cusecs at 5.30 pm. The next morning, it discharged a massive 5,57,906 cusecs at one go. The dam had opened 16 of its 18 gates to let the water flow out. On August 20, it released even more water, 6,48,947 cusecs in three tranches. Some water was released Tuesday and Wednesday as well.

Despite the discharges, the water levels in the Bansagar reservoir has been kept well above the 340 m mark. On Wednesday, it was at 340.9 m.","Thu, 25 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/bihar-floods-480.jpg,"['bansagar', 'water', 'released', 'reservoir', 'madhya', 'south', 'dam', 'pradesh', 'floods', 'm', 'caused', 'bihar', 'release', 'level', 'sudden']", ,flood
8,8,FL-2016-000094-IND,Why floods in Assam and Bihar are worsening over time - DailyO,https://www.dailyo.in/politics/floods-assam-bihar-kaziranga-brahmaputra-disaster-himalayan-dam/story/1/12158.html,"The Brahmaputra has been called a nada (a male river) in Indian tradition. Here's why.

Brahmaputra, the lifeline of Assam, is an antecedent river, older than the Himalayas. With steep gorges and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh, the river entering Assam becomes braided- at times 16km wide - and with tributaries creates a flood plain spanning 80-10km and 1,000km in length in what is known as the Brahmaputra Valley, says the Assam State Disaster Management Plan.

One can easily imagine the span of devastation when Assam is hit by the annual floods, a phenomenon unabated for centuries but, sadly, the destruction witnessed has increased in the last few decades.

Already more than 30 people have lost their lives and media reports say over 300 animals, including 221 hog deer and 21 one-horned rhinos, died in the floods at Kaziranga National Park (KNP) alone.

As on August 1, 2016, more than 11 lakh people and more than one lakh hectare of land have been affected in 21 districts.

Infrastructure has taken a hit, with roads washed away or rendered ineffective due to floods, according to the daily flood report issued by the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).

About seven per cent of land in Assam's 17 riverine districts has been lost because of river erosion over the last five decades, the disaster management plan tells us.

The destruction caused by floods has increased in the last few decades.

The increasing damage each year has equally to do with human activity, including faulty planning, as with rapid changes in climatic conditions.

""The floods are caused by the runoff of extremely heavy rainfall during the monsoon and high sediment loads from upper watersheds that are geologically unstable and degraded because of deforestation and changing land use. The flood combined with river erosion has significant impact each year,"" says the document.

The situation in Bihar

Almost 60 people have been reported dead due to floods in Bihar, which have affected 29 lakh people across 12 districts. Fed by heavy rains in the Terai region of Nepal, most rivers in the state - mainly Ganga, Ghaghra, Mahananda and Bagmati - are flowing above the danger mark.

A major difference between the Himalayan rivers flowing towards Bihar and other parts of Himalayas such as Uttarakhand is that these rivers originate in the highest regions of the Nepal Himalayas and, crossing very small distance, rapidly reach the plains of Bihar, making them far more forceful.

In Uttarakhand, the rivers descend gradually from relatively lesser Himalayan heights and travel much longer before touching the plains.

Bihar's Flood Management Information System tells us that as much as 76 per cent of the population in the state's north lives under recurring threat of flood devastation, with about 68,800sqkm of total geographical area of 94,163sqkm (almost 73.06 per cent) being flooded almost annually.

Many areas of Bihar traditionally had what was called - is rather still called - chaurs, a natural depression to be used as a natural detention basin for flood water that can be utilised later in the year. These chaurs actually helped lessen the intensity of floods.

But over the years, rapidly increasing population, rising urbanisation (leading to greed for land for houses, infrastructure or agriculture) and faulty planning without taking into consideration the natural contours of water flow, have meant almost nil water storage, which leads to greater than before flooding, which in turn leads to more destruction.

Almost 60 people have been reported dead due to floods in Bihar.

Modern solutions and increasing problems

There has been no dearth of funds for the ""flood management programme"", as the government calls it.

For instance, according to statistics maintained by the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), as much as Rs 751.37 crore was spent in Assam and Rs 891.15 crore in Bihar during the XI and XII Plan period up to March 2015. Before that, the count goes into thousands of crores.

A lot of work is being done otherwise too. In fact, technology has enabled preventive/post-flood relief measures, especially in Assam. Construction of raised platforms is one such exercise in Assam, and the state disaster management website gives locations of such raised platforms and community halls in each district.

A few years ago, a satellite image-based ""flood hazard map"" was prepared for literally each and every one of the 250 revenue circles of Assam's most vulnerable flood-prone tehsils.

""The revenue department identifies flood prone areas using the map, and on the available government land in villages, at times one or two bigha, a raised platform is built under the MGNREGA. People gather on these platforms with livestock and can be rescued,"" says Mirza Mahammad Irshad, project manager (response and recovery), ASDMA.

Despite such measures, the number of people getting killed due to floods and the number of people affected/property damaged due to floods is increasing every year, Irshad says, ""simply because of increased population pressure. People need more land; they occupy places in vulnerable areas near the rivers.""

But this is bound to happen. Floods can't really be stopped, neither in Assam nor in Bihar.

Modern day planners have completely discarded traditional wisdom and have gone for structural solutions.

These include building new embankments or upgrading existing ones and carrying out river bank protection programmes, complete with sluice or canals.

Authorities have also carried out flood risk mapping; year by year, flood warning systems are improving and the response systems too.

Policymakers had advocated increasing use of dams and embankments. But dams and embankments have caused disfigurement in the natural course of rivers in modern times.

Damming a Himalayan river may bring temporary succour but in the long term, knowing well the fragile Himalayan geology, prone to earthquakes and landslides, these are not the correct solutions.

If a dam breach happens, the resulting flood would be far more devastating.

So what is missing?

Two important things stand out: lack of information at the grassroots level and the attitude of policymakers, and to some extent people too, towards dealing with floods.

Assam has pretty much improved the information network at the ground level, but population explosion brings in the compulsion to risk lives for a few weeks of floods by living right at the river bank.

But in Bihar, information outreach is inadequate. Large scale migration from these districts means it is mostly women and the elderly who are left to deal with day-to-day situations and modern signals such as early flood warnings fail to reach this segment.

In north Bihar, embankments have caused increased instances of flooding, if not because of actual rivers spilling over, then because of accumulation of rainwater and river backflow in between the embankments.

Despite that, people have survived these floods for years. ""Should we not define different kinds of floods so that we can identify and work on different kinds of responses?"" asks Eklavya Prasad of Megh Pyne Abhiyan that works in north Bihar for sustainable water management solutions.

Also read: Uttarakhand cloudburst: Has the state not learnt any lessons from 2013?

Anupam Mishra, environmentalist, author from Gandhi Peace Foundation, has always said how people in Bihar never looked at its rivers in spate as ""disasters"".

""Centuries of wisdom had taught them how to live with the floods. The rivers' silt would bring in fertile soil that would enrich their fields after the water receded. Dams actually changed this. Embankments were constructed without considering the natural flow of the river. These did not prevent floods but instead added to the problems,"" Mishra, who had written an eye opening commentary, on the Bihar floods, told me.

The community was never dependent on the government and mostly managed their own lives before the British came in the picture.

So the flood preparation would start beforehand and due diligence was done each year as part of mitigation, as against the last minute after-flood measures taken by the modern-day governments.

Ditto, says a friend who runs an NGO for improving rural livelihoods in Assam. ""Traditionally, Assamese people never built houses right near the river bank. Moreover, houses anywhere near the river would necessarily be stilted. Now with increasing demographic pressure, every single inch of land is occupied - by houses, kutcha makaans and what not. Naturally, the damage is more.""

Living with the rivers - however mighty they may be - was an art the riverine population had learnt. And indigenous knowledge about hazards and disasters helped them.

Instead of just pouring in more and more money every passing year, rather than creating infrastructure, how many of our policymakers are ready to integrate environmental indicators and localised solutions into disaster management and mitigation planning?","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/dailyo/fb_feed_images/story_image/201608/flood-insta_080316045452.jpg,"['land', 'management', 'water', 'increasing', 'flood', 'rivers', 'floods', 'assam', 'bihar', 'worsening', 'river']", ,flood

Working round-the-clock to help flood victims in Bihar, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel rendered timely help to two marooned pregnant women at separate places deliver their babies safely. The NDRF personnel took a woman experiencing labour pain at Gyaspur village in Bhakhtiyarpur of Patna district to the nearest Primary Health Service on Tuesday night, Commandant of 9th battalion of NDRF Vijay Sinha told PTI today.

“Due to the timely assistance, the woman delivered a healthy baby girl at Bhakhtiyarpur PHC,” he said. The NDRF personnel had earlier on Tuesday heard cries of help of another pregnant lady at Sinha village in Barhara block of Bhojpur district and ferried her to the nearest hospital for safe delivery, he added.

Engaged in relief and rescue of marooned people, the NDRF personnel came to know about the woman in distress in Bhojpur from the Disaster Management department control room and immediately rushed to help the 22-year-old woman who was in labour pain. The Bihta-based NDRF Commandant said the force personnel get training in child birth to help people in need.

He said during the floods in 2015, the NDRF team had helped a woman in Ara town give birth to a baby in midstream Ganga on board one of the boats of the central disaster force.

Similarly, another lady in Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh received timely help from the NDRF to deliver safely at the time of floods there. The Commandant said in the Ara case 2015, the family had named the baby boy as ‘NDRF Singh’ out of gratitude for the help extended by the NDRF personnel.","Wed, 24 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/ndrf480.jpg,"['disaster', 'men', 'woman', 'flood', 'deliver', 'babies', 'patna', 'ndrf', 'help', 'floods', 'safely', 'women', 'bihar', 'personnel', 'district', 'pti', 'timely']", ,flood

In a flash, the floodwaters emptied the village. Residents who had seen it coming left for higher ground – everyone except Uma Sahu (name changed) and her two-year-old son.

By the time Sahu realised what had happened, water was girdling the legs of her charpai (cot). With her son strapped to her breasts and floodwaters inching towards her, even moving to the relative safety of the roof was perilous. Her husband, a migrant worker, was away at a construction site in Delhi.

With nowhere to go and no help at hand, Sahu stood for 12 hours in chest-high water, with her child in her arms. When the sun was making its way to a watery horizon, it was a miracle in the form of a boat that saved mother and child that day.

Untold stories

But Punita Yadav (name changed) didn’t have the same luck. When a flash flood swept through Baiju Bhagatkatola, a few miles west of Sahu’s village, the entire family moved to the roof of the house. Tired and deep in sleep, no one noticed when her five-year-old son slid off the roof and fell into the floodwater. His body was never recovered.

Such heart-breaking stories of loss are an undercurrent to the tales of adaptation and resilience on the flood plains of Gandak River in Bihar’s West Champaran district. In the absence of state support, luck is often the only thing between life and death.

For women, being married into families living in this floodplains is akin to being wedded to impermanence. “Kua mein dakheldiya” (we have been pushed into a well) is a common refrain among those who have moved to these low-lying and flood-prone areas, locally known as diara.

In these harsh landscapes, these women have had to survive floods, dacoits on the run, crop attacks from wild animals and disease. There is little surprise that the silt-enriched soil of the diara harbours productivity and resentment.

Parul Devi’s (name changed) first tryst with floods draws a toothy grin from her mother-in-law. Marriage brought her from West Bengal to Bariarpur village in West Champaran. The sight of water gushing into her room put her in a state of shock.

“I put my storage chest on top of my bed and perched myself on it, refusing to come down,” she said. “It took a lot of effort to get me off the bed and join my family on the roof.”

Tough lessons

Women who come to the floodplains of Bihar after marriage often have to hit the ground running, with little time to prepare for a life always under the threat of a deluge.

From keeping food grains dry to climbing onto roofs, preparing food on a makeshift kitchen and protecting children from disease and death, there is a lot to learn. The toughest, most women said, is learning how to relieve oneself. With no dry ground in sight, most of them bashfully admit, there are only two ways to cope – either stop eating or eat as less as possible.

“If the government could only tell us in advance about an approaching flood, we wouldn’t be stranded in water every year,” said Ganga Saini from Telua village in West Champaran.

No assistance

However, her plea does not find a place in flood policy in India. In a world obsessed with big data, flood alerts deliver information in its sparest form to the poor.

Through the scratchy noise of old transistor sets, people get to hear how many cubic centimetres of water have been released from the Gandak barrage upstream. Then, it is up to the villagers to figure out if the water will enter their village, and how high it will reach. The state reaches out the people only through the safe distance of the long wave radio.

This information gets amplified and circulated in the male-dominated space of newspapers, radio and television. Women are mostly caught unawares, unless the male member of the family brings such news home. Rural Bihar, in the last decade, has been steadily emptied of men as they migrate out of the state to look for work.

This has left women more vulnerable to not receiving flood alerts on time. Many women, like Sahu, find themselves at greater risk if they have small children or are pregnant. Reaching the orbit of Mars has proved easier than sending an advanced flood alert to a woman in rural India.

Finding a way out

Being on the blind side of the state has led women in the Gandak river basin to find their own solutions. Mobile phones have allowed some freedom from an insulated world. In 2013, Dalit women in Navrahi village in West Champaran used their mobile phones to contact boatmen to arrange for a pick up. They also stored the phone number of local doctors to come to the aid of those who were pregnant or sick.

This left the older women in the village awestruck. “Earlier, we made makeshift stretchers using saris and bamboo and carried pregnant women out of the village,” one of them said. “Now with the mobile phone, the boatman was instructed to bring the doctor to the doorstep. How times have changed”.

Times are indeed changing, but very slowly. This year, floods have claimed 89 lives in Bihar so far. The river has breached its banks again this month and submerged 800 houses in the Gandak river basin. Behind each submerged house is a story of struggle and loss.

Such narratives will not spill over into national discourse. As national news gets flooded with footage of waterlogging, traffic jams and woes of the urban rich in Delhi and Gurugram, women on Gandak’s floodplains brace for another year of apathy and obscurity.

There's no food, no relief from the government -- it's just water everywhere.

news Bihar floods

By Anand Singh

At 9 in the morning Gauri Devi is waiting for her 15-year-old son to bring rats. That's the only food the family now depends on, being surrounded by flood water.

It's about 50 kilometres from Saharsa in Salakhua block where the fury of nature has forced hundreds of villagers of Banahi Tola to hunt and eat rats - with no other food available to them.



""We are surrounded by Kosi's water. All the roads that lead to the main market have been submerged for several days. We don't have any foodgrain and so we are cooking rats,"" Gauri Devi told IANS.



She and other villagers belong to the Dalit Musahar community and are impoverished. The flood has made life even worse for them. There's no food, no relief from the government -- it's just water everywhere. Marooned in an island in the middle of the river Kosi, these villagers have no alternative source of food except rats.

And rat-catching is a booming business in the region. Several villagers are skilled in hunting the rodent which they sell to the villagers in need.



Bechan Sada is one such hunter. Every day he hunts about 12 kg of rats during the floods and sells these creatures for Rs 40 per kilogram.



""I hunt these rats during monsoon when they move out of the fields and take shelter in the village,"" Bechan told IANS.



During the monsoon, Banahi Tola is cut off from the rest of the state. To reach there one has to cross several swamps, as it lies between the eastern and western embankments of the Kosi river.

Boats are the main modes of transport to reach the village from Radhanpur Bandh which is about 12 kilometres away. It takes around five hours to traverse this distance, travelling upstream the Kosi.



The village has no toilet and the people defecate in the open. There is no electricity. And with most of the hand pumps out of order, there is no source of clean drinking water either.



According to village headman Kalar Sada, the village lies in the bed of the Kosi river. ""So when it rains heavily, we are surrounded by water from all the sides,"" he told IANS.



Has any relief material reached them?



""So far no relief material has reached our village, even though the Block Development Officer has ordered the PDS shops to deliver the grains to the people,"" Kalar added.

""We have not received any such information as you are saying. But I shall check it,"" he told IANS.



""The area comes under the western and eastern embankments of Kosi; so there is regular flow of water there. Earlier the government had allotted these people land, but they did not move out as the riverine belt is very fertile,"" Gunjiyal said.

The Ganga river was flowing above danger mark at Digha ghat, Gandhi ghat and Hathidah here and Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur district, it said.

Other rivers which were flowing above danger mark are- the Sone at Maner and the Punpun at Sripalpur, while the Ghaghra remained in spate in Siwan district.

The water level of Kosi was above the red mark at Baltara in Khagaria and Kursela in Katihar district and Burhi Gandak in Khagaria, the statement said.","Sun, 14 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2016-07/30/full/1469875989-4838.jpg,"['water', 'nalanda', 'khagaria', 'rivers', 'flooded', 'red', 'flowing', 'mark', 'bihar', 'level', 'statement', 'marks', 'district', 'danger', 'river']", ,flood

Across the flooded Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar and Kaziranga National Park in Assam, smaller animals are struggling to avoid drowning while the bigger ones like the tiger and rhinos face a threat to their lives from poachers, who take advantage of the situation to hunt them down.

But at the VTR and KNP, dedicated groups of forest guards and amateur wildlife enthusiasts are working round-the-clock to keep wildlife casualties to a minimum and rescue smaller and younger animals which don’t have the strength to negotiate the strong currents and are often swept away.

At the VTR, 50 swimmers employed by the forest department are helping in rescue of wildlife such as hog deer and barking deer, carrying them to dry land. Nearly 400 forest guards are also working with anti-poaching squads, tiger trackers and regular patrol teams, officials said.

Man-animal conflict

At KNP, rescuers are adopting innovative means to help the confused animals.

On Friday, rescuers carefully covered the eyes of a rhino calf with a piece of cloth to prevent more trauma to the young animal during the journey to safety and a shelter. The rhino was separated from its mother and was lost in the surging flood waters of the Brahmaputra.

“We are trying to get the animals out of the flood zone and guide them to safer areas,” said RB Singh, the field director of VTR, spread across 800 sq km in West Champaran district. But rarely does the Gandak river causes so much flooding in the game safari.

The only tiger reserve in the state, a census last year had put the number of big cats in VTR at 28.

With food sources running low for the animals in VTR, migration of wildlife from Chitwan National Park in Nepal has only aggravated the situation, he said.

Besides tigers, the reserve also has several species of deer, including chital, a few rhinos, bisons and neelgais.

A community leader in Madanpur, on the fringes of the VTR, said that the park was witnessing this level of floodwater after nearly two decades.

The field director said that such situations increases the possibility of man-animal conflict as wildlife often migrate to nearby villages in search of food and shelter.

Rescue efforts

In a village located near the Kaziranga National Park, people woke up to find a rhino calf washing up to the door before it was rescued by workers from an animal rehabilitation centre.

The park boasts of more than 1,800 one-horned rhinos, 70% of the world’s rhino population besides about 45 tigers.

Forest personnel have so far rescued eight rhino calves --- aged between one month and one year --- from flood waters in the World Heritage Site park.

“They were separated from their mothers and got washed away. We are now treating them at our veterinary centre,” said Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India that runs the centre.

The Assam forest department has deployed over 1,000 persons including staff on the highway to ensure passage of animals to the hills from low lying areas.

This is also the time when poachers prey on the vulnerable rhinos which are often disoriented by the surging waters, said a forest official.

Many rhinos were killed in Kaziranga during similar displacement during the 2013 floods. However, no poaching incident has been reported this year.

Forest officials found the remains of six rhinos drowned by floodwaters in Kaziranga while another rhino died in another national reserve in the state.

18,18,FL-2016-000094-IND,Why many of Bihar's bridges are under threat - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/811982/no-bridges-over-troubled-waters,"Every January, fishermen at Beldour and Chautam administrative blocks in Khagaria district of Bihar take part in the rather strange practice of donating boats at the confluence of Koshi and Bagmati rivers. They collect close to 60 boats, place them in a straight line connecting the riverbanks and build a temporary pontoon bridge.

“These boats are pillars and we are going to construct a bridge over it,” local boatman Gopal Yadav said. “Keeping a straight line matters or else heavy vehicles that will ply on this bridge will drown,” he added, showing of his newly acquired engineering skills. The villagers complete construction of the pontoon bridge within a fortnight by laying bamboo poles tied with ropes over the boats.

Local villagers started making this bridge, locally known as Nauka Setu (boat bridge), every year since 2011 after the nearby concrete bridge, BP Mandal Setu, and a steel bridge over the rivers collapsed due to the heavy flow of the rivers. The pontoon bridge saves the villagers a detour of nearly 150 kilometres to reach Supaul and Madhepura districts in Bihar and also to reach Nepal.

Although small buses, cars, loaded vans and even government vehicles bumpily cross this Nauka Setu, no scientific study has ever been done on how much load the bridge should be allowed to carry. The boat bridge is risky and can collapse anytime, according to Amarendra Sinha, block development officer of Beldour. This bridge is closed or dismantled from May to December when both the rivers are in spate. “But the villagers have no option because it’s the only mode of transportation for nearly a million people from January to May,” Sinha told thethirdpole.net.

Bridges and climate change

Bridges getting washed away due to floods and riverbank erosion is becoming more common in Bihar as severe weather conditions increase in frequency because of climate change. This leads to hardship for large numbers of people, who are in some places trying to cope by making temporary bridges of doubtful safety.

Ever since it was inaugurated, the bridge faced mild to severe damage to its pillars due to unpredictable water flow. Finally on August 29, 2010, the Koshi River washed away around 10 pillars of the bridge. The district administration declared the bridge to be dangerous and closed it till further notice. Several efforts were made to repair the bridge but the strong current of the river foiled every attempt.

The government then decided to construct a steel bridge some distance away from the BP Mandal Bridge. The 566-metre bridge built on steel piles was constructed at a cost of INR 1.7 million (USD 25,337) and inaugurated on June 8, 2011. Local residents named it the caterpillar bridge as it had as many as 92 pillars to withstand the strong currents of the Koshi and Bagmati rivers.

On July 16, 2012, the new bridge too succumbed to the strong current of the rivers. A 200-metre portion of the bridge was washed away. Government engineers tried to retrieve the bridge by pulling it up by ropes and chains but failed to prevent it from being washed away repeatedly.

“While the steel pile bridge is beyond repair, the Mandal bridge is being repaired again,” Satyendra Kumar, superintendent engineer of the water resource department of the Bihar government, Khagaria division, told thethirdpole.net. The repair was supposed to be completed by 2016. Now, “repair work is still going on and it will take another one year to complete it,” Kumar estimates.

Many bridges in danger

These two bridges are not the only ones in the state that have suffered massive damage because of raging rivers that are changing course more frequently. In Bhagalpur, the 4.7 km Vikramshila Setu on Ganga River, the third-longest river bridge in India – connecting the districts of Purnea and Katihar – is also suffering massive damage.

In the same region, the 1.8 km Koshi Mahasetu inaugurated in 2012 is facing a threat because of a weakening guide dam on the eastern part of the bridge. This is also threatening to submerge at least five villages. The bridge was built to save travel time by nearly five hours between Madhubani and Supaul districts. A similar bridge between the two districts was destroyed in an earthquake in 1934. After that, it took the government 78 years to connect the two districts.

In the case of Koshi Mahasetu, the situation is so alarming that Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejaswi Yadav wrote a letter to federal transport minister Nitin Gadkari to immediately help the state to strengthen the guide dam. Yadav in his letter has mentioned that even the Central Water and Power Research Station has recommended repairing the eastern guide dam to protect the Koshi Mahasetu from damage.

Alarm bells started ringing for the Vikramshila Setu after its pillars started crumbling. A team of retired engineers from Tilkamanjhi University voluntarily inspected damaged pillars 15 and 16. One of the engineers, Ashok Kumar Sinha, told thethirdpole.net, “Pillars number 15 and 16 have gone down by 15 mm. A major portion of wall around the pillars has been washed away triggering collapse threat of the bridge due to erosion caused by the Ganga.”

Expert advice

The Bihar government consulted Nayan Sharma, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology at Roorkee to seek a solution to protect the BP Mandal Setu and the adjoining steel bridge.

Sharma points out that he gave warning to the state government regarding the imminent adverse impact of climate change and erratic flow of rivers on both the bridges. “It’s not only about these two bridges; other bridges constructed over the rivers in Bihar need to braced to the changing rainfall and flood patterns,” he told thethirdpole.net. Sharma says that in his report he advised the state government to immediately strengthen the pillars of both bridges, as strong currents of the Koshi and Bagmati rivers are weakening the pillars of the bridge.

Sharma also studied in detail severe erosion caused by the Ganga in Vikramshila. In his research paper, he says that at the point around 3.5 km downstream of Vikramshila Setu, there has been 1,100 metres of erosion between 2003 and 2011. The high rate of erosion makes it probable that the river will weaken the pillars of the bridge. “It needs a further detailed study,” he reiterates.

Erosion is also threatening the Bhagalpur College of Engineering and Bihar Agriculture University buildings, national highway 80 and Fatehpur Masjid, his report says. “These are the findings of 2011. The situation has changed for the worse and the state should immediately take action to control erosion,” Sharma warns.

River expert Mishra points out that apart from climate change affecting the flow of rivers, the engineering of BP Mandal and steel bridge were also defective. “First, constructing a bridge at the confluence of rivers itself was a risk. Second, the engineers tried to flow Bagmati through Koshi River,” he explains.

Forced confluence

The Koshi-Bagmati confluence did not naturally exist at Khagaria, he claims. “Engineers created the confluence. Since Bagmati is at higher level and Koshi at a lower elevation, the former should have been merged with the latter,” he says. The result of this was that sedimentation increased in the lower Koshi riverbed. It increased water flow in both the rivers, causing stress on the pillars of the bridges.

Both Mishra and Sharma accept that bridges over the rivers are important for transportation. But the climate change and disaster management components need to be taken into consideration to avoid damage and inconvenience. “It’s important that old bridges are readied to meet the unpredictability of rivers,” Sharma cautions.

Bihar is constructing a large number of bridges under the Chief Minister’s bridge plan that funds construction of small bridges under the cost of INR 2.5 million. The state has spent nearly INR 191.5 billion for construction of a large number of bridges under the scheme. A majority of these bridges are over rivers.

Anil Kumar Sinha, vice chairman of Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA), accepts that old bridges constructed over the rivers in the state do not have any preparedness for disasters. “We are also aware of how bridges failed on confluence of Koshi and Bagmati rivers,” he says.

Sinha says that in 2014, the planning and development department of the state, keeping in view disaster management and climate change, issued a directive, making it compulsory for every department to ensure the disaster management component in taken into consideration in all works.

Bihar has added the climate change component for the proposed Ganga expressway project. Experts are awaiting similar action for old bridges over rivers. Sinha says that efforts are underway to protect the bridges but they it will take some time to take effect.

Associated Press

GAUHATI, India - The death toll in flooding from heavy monsoon rains in India has climbed past 90, with about a million people taking shelter in government-run relief camps, officials said Tuesday.

Incessant downpours have damaged swaths of land, uprooted trees and snapped telephone cables in dozens of districts in the states of Bihar in the east, Assam in the remote northeast and Himachal Pradesh in the north.

A total of 96 people have been killed in the flooding in the three states over the past week, according to state officials.

At least 17 rare one-horned rhinos have been killed due to the flooding of vast tracts of Assam’s Kaziranga National Park, said Pramilla Rani Brahma, the state’s forest and environment minister. “Most of the rhinos killed are calves, separated from their mothers during the massive flooding,” Brahma said.

The park had 1.5-meter-high (5-foot-high) floodwaters in some places, forcing many of the park’s animals, also including wild elephants, wild buffaloes and boars, to cross a highway to move to higher ground.

The heavy monsoon rains have come after two straight years of drought in India.

On Monday, landslides and heavy rains blocked highways leading to Tibet and Manali, a tourist resort in Himachal Pradesh state, with hundreds of people stranded for several hours before rescuers cleared the way, the Press Trust of India news agency said.

In Bihar state, around 260,000 flood victims were taking shelter in more than 400 relief camps set up by the state government. At least 400 medical camps have been set up as well to aid people who have spent several nights outdoors after their homes were submerged by rainwaters.

In Assam, where floodwaters started receding on Tuesday, some 3.8 million people have been affected by the floods, according to state authorities. More than 700,000 have taken shelter in 770 relief camps.","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2ce84fe4496b879421507ac472b67ef2214c801b/c=0-81-4093-2393/local/-/media/2016/08/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636057112524985596-EPA-INDIA-MONSOON-83705974.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,"['kills', 'relief', 'forces', '96', 'states', 'shelter', 'state', 'killed', 'heavy', 'rains', 'million', 'camps', 'india', 'flooding']", ,flood

The state water resources department has issued a flood alert for north Bihar districts bordering Nepal.

With heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in neighbouring Nepal, water levels of these rivers have been rising for the last 24 hours.

""The Gandak river is near the danger mark at some points in West Champaran district and Kosi is also in spate in Supaul district. Bagmati is showing rise in its water level in Sheohar district. Similarly, water level of Kosi and its tributaries is on rise in Shaharsa and Khagaria districts,"" an official of the department said.

The rivers have flooded more than 150 villages in Supaul, West Champaran and East Champaran, forcing people to abandon their homes. The river system is threatening hundreds of villages in over half a dozen districts, officials said.

Water level of the Ganga is rising in Patna and other places in Bihar.

Bihar Water Resources Development Minister Lalan Singh said preparations have been made to tackle the flood situation. ""There is no need to panic. The state government is alert. All embankments are safe,"" he said.

Singh said the eastern Kosi embankment, which had breached in 2008, was safe.

In 2008, more than three million people were rendered homeless in Bihar when the Kosi river breached its banks upstream in Nepal and changed course.

According to Bihar Disaster Management Minister Chandrashekhar, the department has put its rescue and relief teams on a standby in flood-prone districts of the Koshi belt.

Now with just over a month left to go, the Southwest Monsoon is bringing regular pulses of rain across northern India. This brings flooding with it, but even without the rain, rivers are still rising as a result of earlier monsoon outbursts.

Uttar Pradesh

With heavy rainfall throughout this monsoon season, the River Ganges (Ganga) in Uttar Pradesh has risen above the danger mark and water has now entered residential areas in Allahabad in eastern India. The Ganges joins the River Yamuna at Allahabad and the city has been suffering flooding of this confluence for weeks.

According to a Union Water Resources Ministry statement, the River Ganges is likely soon to be at unprecedented flood levels further downstream. Ghazipur and Ballia are now at risk.

The 2,525km long river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, and flows south and east through the Gangetic Plain of North India into Bangladesh. Here, it empties into the Bay of Bengal. It is the third largest river in the world by water discharge and at least 400 million people live beside it.

Bihar

The threat of flooding looms large now over Patna, the capital of the eastern Bihar state. In the Gandhi Ghat area, the level of the Ganges touched 50.28 metres on Saturday evening and was rising at 5cm an hour. The highest level recorded in recent times was 50.27 metres. That was in 1994.

Patna District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar said: “The Ganga has been flowing above the danger mark and the situation is alarming. The water level broke a 22-year-old record on Sunday morning.”

All drains in the 8.5km long Patna town protection wall have been closed. This defence was built after the floods in 1975, when the waters of the Ganges and the Sone rivers caused extensive damage.

Further downstream

The remains of Tropical Storm Dianmu have become reinvigorated over Bangladesh and another 100 to 200mm of rain are now likely over the Ganges’ lower reaches.

Without fail, hundreds of villages are inundated in Saharsa and Supaul areas every year.

The locals resigned themselves to the fury of \'mother\' Kosi long ago. They move out of their villages to make way to the river, as if out of reverence, and shift to higher locations.

That same cycle is repeated year after year.

Which is why, unsurprisingly, the Kosi is approaching the danger mark yet again. According to local reports, the flow in the river has reached up to 233 lakh cusec - the highest level this year. Many villages in Supaul are already submerged and around 200 houses have been washed away.

But the government and the administration have not yet come out of slumber. There is neither any advisory on the part of the state government nor any arrangement for people fleeing their homes from flood-affected areas.

The floods of 2008 have still not faded from the public memory when a breach in Nepal\'s Kusha Dam had resulted in submersion of 3.40 lakh hectares of land in North Bihar. Around 30 lakh people across seven districts were badly hit. The government figures claim 250 people lost their lives.

Once again, a similar situation is looming large over these areas leading people to migrate to safer regions. Every day, there are reports of land erosion in yet another locality.

These pictures show how people are trying to shift their worlds away from the wrath of a swollen Kosi.

Rains have been good this monsoon season so far. But instead of welcoming the bounty, urban India seems to be wallowing in misery. Guwahati is flooded. People in Delhi, Gurugram, Mumbai and Hyderabad are beset with water-logged streets and traffic snarls. Even half an hour of rainfall is enough to make a lot of places go under water. And every time there is flooding, or water logging, the elements stand accused. It is true that, in recent times, rains have been unseasonal. It’s also true that, at times, they have been high on intensity. Overall, however, there is no evidence that it rains more now than it used to half-a-decade ago. By blaming urban floods, or water-logging, on the weather gods, city administrators have been overlooking poor planning and the neglect of natural drainage.

In the past, most cities had water bodies — lakes, ponds, streams, rivulets — which served three purposes: They replenished groundwater, catered to the city’s water needs and channelised excess rainfall to larger water bodies. Most such aquifers have fallen prey to concrete. In Delhi, for example, a stream used to feed the Yamuna at about the place where the busy ITO today stands. It’s not without reason that the area is one of the most water-logged when it rains heavily in Delhi. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes in the 1960s. There are scarcely 10 such water-bodies in a healthy state in the city today. Chennai’s flood sink on its southern outskirts — the Pallikarnai marsh — was around 5,000 hectares in the 1950s. After the horrific floods in November last year, it was found that it had shrunk to 600 hectares. The rivers, Cooum and Adyar, and the Buckingham Canal in Chennai have become dumping grounds. So have Mumbai’s wetlands near Sewri and other areas in New Mumbai. In fact, the city became alive to the river it has lost to real estate — the Mithi — after the terrible floods of 2005.

When real estate activity blocks the path of water, the city roads get waterlogged. Stormwater drains cannot take the burden of the water that once used to seep into the ground. Moreover, cities do not make the distinction between stormwater drains and sewage disposal outlets. With most cities lacking proper sewerage facilities, people dispose sewage in stormwater drains. The problem becomes worse when industries discharge their polluted water into such drains. All this compromises the capacities of stormwater drains and also results in polluted water flowing into the larger water bodies. While our urban planners issue homilies about environmentally-sensitive planning, it is time they also pay regard to urban hydrology.","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/chennai480.jpg,"['city', 'water', 'hectares', 'takeover', 'drains', 'used', 'concrete', 'floods', 'stormwater', 'sink', 'urban', 'waterlogged']", ,flood

National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams, already pre-positioned in Patna, Vaishali and Gopalganj, have been put on alert while State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been put on alert in Patna and Bhagalpur, it said.

Ganga and four other rivers -- Punpun, Ghaghra, Kosi and Burhi Gandak -- are flowing above danger mark in Patna, Bhagalpur and Buxar districts, the statement said.

All the District Magistrates have been directed to ply sufficient numbers of boats for ferrying flood affected people to safer places besides opening and running relief camps.

DMs have also been asked to depute mobile medical team along with 'halogen' tablets for purification of drinking water and other materials in flood affected areas.

Boats are being ferried to ferry people from flood affected areas of Bhojpur, Khagaria, Buxar, Vaishali and

Samastipur but DMs have been asked to strictly ensure that no boat ply after 5:30 PM, the statement said.

30,30,FL-2016-000094-IND,World weather: 2016's early record heat gives way to heavy rains - The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/01/world-weather-2016s-early-record-heat-gives-way-to-heavy-rains,"The record-breaking worldwide heat of the first six months of 2016 has turned to abnormally severe seasonal flooding across Asia with hundreds of people dying in China, India, Nepal and Pakistan and millions forced from their homes.

In India, the Brahmaputra river, which is fed by Himalayan snowmelt and monsoon rains, has burst its banks in many places and has been at danger levels for weeks. Hundreds of villages have been flooded in Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and other northern states.

Some of the heaviest rains in 20 years have forced nearly 1.2 million people to move to camps in Assam. Floods have submerged around 70% of the Kaziringa national park, home to the rare one-horned rhino which was visited by Prince William earlier this year.

“The situation is still very bad. We are taking measures to help people in every possible way,” the Indian forest minister, Pramila Rani Brahma, told Reuters.

In the state of Bihar, 26 people have died, nearly 2.75 million people have been displaced or affected, and 330,000ha of land inundated. Many major rivers are still flowing at or above danger levels.



In China, the summer monsoon which started in June after a series of heatwaves is said to have caused $22bn of damage so far. State officials say it has killed more than 500 people, destroyed more than 145,000 homes and inundated 21,000 sq miles of farmland.



Around 500,000 people were last week still displaced in the hardest-hit central Chinese provinces of Henan and Hebei. According to the Chinese ministry of civil affairs, 125,000 people were in urgent need of basic assistance.



This monsoon season has been one of the strongest in China’s recent history, with 150 towns and cities reportedly suffering record rainfall. The Yangtze river basin has been particularly hard hit, with 22 inches of rain falling in 24 hours last month at Wuhan, the Hebei state capital.

The city, which is downstream of the Three Gorges dam and protected from flooding, was inundated after its drainage system and flood controls failed. Much of the damage is thought to have occurred because the city’s rapid expansion in the past 20 years filled in many small lakes and wetlands which used to store water.

Elsewhere, Nepal has been lashed by torrential monsoon rains, flash floods and landslides. The government says 14 of the mountainous country’s 75 districts have been affected by floods, 54 people have died and many major rivers are running at dangerous levels. Tens of thousands of Nepalese are still living in tents following devastating earthquakes last year.



The army has been deployed to repair dams and helicopters are being used to distribute food and medicines to homeless people who have taken shelter on roads and in upland areas.



Meteorologists say that the 2016 Asian monsoon is one of the strongest in many years, and has been intensified by the El Niño natural phenomenon which sees Pacific water temperatures rise and leads to droughts and severe weather worldwide.



The summer heatwaves that have affected much of the Middle East, north Africa and north America have slackened in the last few days.

“At the [north American] heatwave’s peak on July 22, almost 124 million people in north America were under heat-related warnings or advisories. Additionally, high overnight low temperatures meant little relief from the oppressive heat,” said the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).

The WMO has set up a committee to examine whether a 54C temperature recorded in Kuwait in July has set the new highest temperature for Asia, as well as for the entire eastern hemisphere.

Climatologists at the WMO said they expected more heatwaves because of climate change. “The length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves will likely increase further during this century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,” said the agency.

But they said it was likely that only a weak “La Niña” will follow the strong El Niño phenomenon later this year. La Niña is the opposite of El Niño and is marked by cooler temperatures worldwide.","Mon, 01 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1aa39481d36087ac8ef0a8d176694383e3537d0a/0_57_5149_3091/5149.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e59ffe9235fe648a16da157b0da1c123,"['floods', 'way', 'rains', 'world', 'record', '2016s', 'temperatures', 'heavy', 'weather', 'state', 'north', 'million', 'heat', 'monsoon', 'niño', 'inundated', 'early', 'gives', 'heatwaves']", ,flood

Huge crowds of villagers following a wild elephant stranded in Bangladesh for more than a month by floods are hampering efforts to rescue it, forest officials said Saturday.

Severe floods in the northeastern Indian state of Assam separated the four-ton female elephant from its herd as strong currents in the Brahmaputra river washed it across the border to northern Bangladesh late June.

This week Indian wildlife officials travelled to Bangladesh to join local forest rangers and vets to rescue the animal, which is now struggling to stand on its feet after a journey of more than 100 kilometres (60 miles).

""It's now standing in a five-feet flood water in Jamalpur district. It is extremely weak. There are more than 10,000 people watching her from a close distance,"" Bangladeshi vet Sayed Hossain told AFP.

Hossain said the crowd was hampering its efforts to reach higher ground as ""thousands of villagers have been constantly following the animal,"" even at night.

Forest official Tapan Kumar Dey told AFP a team had brought a dart gun, crane and lorry to carry the animal once it reaches dry ground and can be tranquilised—but the operation cannot be carried out while the elephant is in water.

""Her condition is very bad. Last night it travelled 12 kilometres, but it mostly avoided dry ground because of presence of so many people,"" Dey said.

A trained elephant was being brought to the scene in a desperate attempt to lure the wild animal away from the water.

""It is so weak that it can't even lift its trunk. You can see her ribs from a distance,"" Ritesh Bhattacharjee, a visiting Indian forest official, told AFP.

The rescue bid comes days after Indian wildlife officers appealed for help in caring for eight rhino calves pulled from the floodwaters in Assam.

Scores of people die every year from flooding and landslides during the monsoon rains in India and neighbouring Nepal and Bangladesh.

So far this year 96 people have died in the worst-hit Indian states of Assam and Bihar while 41 people have died in downstream Bangladesh.

34,34,FL-2016-000094-IND,Floodplains and flash floods - Livemint,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/a8herzL1neqG1YQ35Yj6RI/Floodplains-and-flash-floods.html,"My first exposure to “the field"" as a budding administrator was during a “village attachment"" in central Uttar Pradesh in northern India. The year was 1983. I still remember the name of the village, Chaturabehar, in Sitapur district. Every villager we met, owner cultivator to landless labourer, had the same woeful tale of collapsed houses and submerged crops to narrate.

Floods have long been a regular feature of life on the Indo-Gangetic plains. The administrative records of British India, however, indicate that the chief threat in these parts before the advent of canal irrigation was not floods but monsoon failure. Successive failures caused famine, disease and epidemics. Excessive rainfall caused short-term havoc with positive spin-offs.

My own research on the eastern reaches of the same vast floodplain on which Chaturabehar was located is illustrative. The rains in south Bihar were excessive in 1867, about 50% above the long-term average. Both the Ganga and Sone rivers were in spate, destroying the standing bhadoi crop. H.W. Alexander, collector of (erstwhile) Gaya district, noted that “the lands near the river sown with this crop are always liable to be flooded and are moreover sown with the full knowledge of this risk; should they escape a flood in any year, a full harvest is reaped; should they be destroyed, the land is rendered by the flooding more rich and fertile for the ensuing rubee (winter) crop. No crops could look finer than do the rubee crops now on the very lands which a few months ago were under water... thus the gains on the rubee almost compensate for the loss to the bhadoi."" The 60-day bhadoi was a bonus crop, grown in just 10% of the area, and when it was lost a better rice harvest ensued.

Two years later the Sone flooded again on 18 July, 1869, but receded within a few days, doing little damage to the bhadoi on the ground and improving “the land considerably by leaving behind it a mouldy deposit"".

Medieval Europe followed an extensive protocol of cyclical fallowing, the “three-field system"", under which only one-third of the cultivable area was actually available each year. The densely populated floodplains of northern India, on the other hand, were cultivated without fallowing and fertilizers year after year. Cow dung was mostly used as household fuel. Would this have been possible without these periodic mouldy river-borne deposits? The Indo-Gangetic plains are one of the most naturally fertile regions in the world, home to some of the oldest and densest human habitations.

The floods in Chaturabehar were however not caused by discharge from rivers swollen with bountiful monsoon precipitation. They were man-made. The flood waters could not recede because of water logging and seepage from the Sharda Canal which, along with the new all-weather road and rail embankments, now blocked the natural lines of drainage.

Commenting on the flood prone nature of the river Sone over a century earlier, J. McNamara, district engineer of the erstwhile Shahabad district (adjoining Gaya), felt that the construction of the East India Railway mainline had increased the frequency and intensity of floods. The track embankments tampered with the natural drainage of the country. The construction of the Shahabad canal created new obstructions. A new kind of fever which district officials called the “Shahabad Fever"", soon became endemic in the area.

Something similar had happened in village Chaturabehar. British India civil servants had pointed to potential drainage problems while opposing the Sharda Canal scheme. Work on the canal began only after being shelved for half a century. Sub-soil saturation along the canal was more acute than in the western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain, where modern canals were first built in India. Chaturabehar was in the Awadh region, so plentifully supplied with water that the British called it the “Garden of India"".

What had once been a purely temporary flooding phenomenon of several hours, with beneficial spin-offs, now became a pervasive problem of water logging, breeding despair and disease. This also discouraged the kind of risk-taking and entrepreneurship in evidence in the Green Revolution western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain.

It is no coincidence that the oldest and most dense civilizations were all located on alluvial flood plains in Mesopotamia (Tigris-Euphrates), Egypt (Nile), China (Yellow River) and India (Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra). Alluvium is a natural freshwater sink. Floods are the flip side of nature’s abundant bounty. Good drainage was always an issue. Before the emergence of big cities and modern development works, the flood waters were unimpeded, followed natural lines of drainage and receded seamlessly back into the river while recharging sub-surface aquifers and restoring soil fertility.

The drainage challenge in dense urban centres on the floodplains is more acute. Indian cities consequently need better drainage than their European counterparts. They need to evacuate large quantities of silt-laden flood waters, in addition to human sewage. The earliest urban centres in India, in the Indus Valley about five millennia ago, were global pioneers in constructing drainage and sewage systems. Mega European cities like Paris and London from early on built huge underground tunnels to evacuate large quantities of sewage generated by urban sprawls. Their Indian counterparts like Delhi and Kolkata do not have comparable underground sewage or drainage systems on this scale. Worse, extant water bodies and lines of drainage have been built over with concrete and asphalt. Delhi and Gurgaon now need just three hours of heavy rainfall to be flooded. The same narrative is repeated in Mumbai, Chennai and several other Indian cities.

Bangladesh and India are mounting a major rescue effort for a wild elephant struggling to survive after it was separated from its herd by floods and then washed across the border.

On Thursday three Indian forest officials will travel to a flood-hit area in northern Bangladesh to investigate how they can help the stranded animal, which was separated from its herd in northeast India more than a month ago.

A vet dispatched to the scene by Bangladesh authorities said the elephant, a female that weighs an estimated four tonnes, was ""weak and tired"" after its solo odyssey across the Brahmaputra river that separates the two countries.

""For the last month it has been separated from its herd and stranded mostly in flood water,"" Sayed Hossain told AFP.

""It crossed the mighty Brahmaputra and has been living mostly on paddy (rice) crop, sugar canes and a limited amount of banana plants.""

Forestry official Shahab Uddin said thousands of villagers in boats have been following the elephant, which has so far crossed around 100 kilometres (60 miles) of flooded terrain in northern Bangladesh.

Bangladeshi authorities have dispatched a team of forest rangers, police inspectors and vets to track the wild animal, but the floods were hampering rescue efforts.

""Our effort to rescue the animal has been hampered by ongoing floods as there is no way we can tranquillise it in water as it might be floated downstream. The elephant must be driven to a higher ground in a bid to rescue it,"" Uddin said.

""After seeing her latest conditions, both teams will decide how we can rescue her,"" he added.

Uddin said the hundreds of villagers who were flocking to see the elephant were also likely hampering her ability to seek higher ground unaffected by the floods.

The wild elephants of India and Bangladesh have dwindled in number in recent decades as their habitat is destroyed.

The rescue bid comes days after Indian wildlife officers appealed for help in caring for eight rhino calves pulled from the floodwaters in the northeastern state of Assam.

After a scorching summer this year, parts of urban and rural India are now going under water.

Over the last week, the monsoon rains, which account for 70% of the country’s annual rainfall, have wreaked havoc across the country, turning roads into rivers and flattening entire villages.

In the information technology hub of Bengaluru, residents took to fishing in the streets, while locals in the northern city of Gurgaon (Gurugram)—dubbed the Millennium City—left behind their vehicles, exasperated by a seven-hour traffic snarl. In the rural states of Assam and Bihar, at least 80 persons lost their lives and millions have been uprooted.

India loses a little over $7 billion to floods every year, according to a United Nations report. Yet, the country quickly moves on without addressing the fundamental causes of flooding.

Drainless urban India

India’s struggle with the rains is a direct result of its inefficient drainage systems and poor planning, particularly in the country’s overcrowded metropolises.

As an ever-growing population squeezes into cities such as Mumbai and Bengaluru, natural flood barriers like wetlands get swallowed and new buildings frequently rise over storm drains. Any unexpected excess in rainfall, thus, throws the city totally out of gear. The story’s the same in most of India’s smaller towns too.

“Every country has faced such issues, but they had the political and the collective will of the people to make a change,” Usha P. Raghupathi, a professor at the New Delhi-based National Institute of Urban Affairs, said. Quite often, she said, Indian authorities ignore a crucial aspect of planning: the hydrology of the region.

“Water never forgets its course. It has a natural drainage and that’s why roads become rivers,” Raghupathi said. “In most situations, vested interests force administrators to ignore these factors.”

Now, with India pushing for further urbanisation, experts believe even moderate rains may lead to crises. Over the next six years, India looks to make “smart cities” out of 98 of its existing city centres, which account for 35% of its urban population.

“The magnitude of the crisis will keep increasing… as the water has no infiltration points,” V. Rajamani, professor emeritus at the New Delhi-based Jawaharlal Nehru University said. Rajamani has researched the flood crises in Srinagar (2014) and in Chennai (2015) and his work has him convinced that policy is to blame.

“Human beings are changing the urban landscape like never before. In Srinagar, 80% of the river line has been occupied by humans now.”

Rural India’s multifold crisis

The situation is as bad in rural India, notably in states such as Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, and Assam, where a combination of climate change and poor policy decisions has turned deadly.

As global temperatures rise, Himalayan glaciers are melting more rapidly and rainfall patterns have been disrupted, leading to heavier rains during monsoons. In Uttarakhand, this situation has been worsened by massive hydroelectric projects that have significantly degraded the environment, besides extensive deforestation and construction along the hills.

In 2013, these dams sparked cataclysmic landslides. The year also saw one of the worst floods in the state’s history, affecting over nine million people (PDF), with hundreds killed and thousands missing.

Uttarakhand is struggling again this year with flash floods that have killed more than 30 people across the hill state in June.

The northeastern state of Assam has fared worse in 2016.

According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, around 1.6 million people have been displaced in 21 districts in the past few weeks as nine of the state’s rivers, including the Brahmaputra, have overflowed. As of July 31, 31 people have been killed and the state’s infrastructure has suffered extensive damage.

Assam’s wildlife has suffered, too. The Kaziranga National Park, home to the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinos, has been hit badly. The floods have so far killed 218 animals at the national park, including 17 rhinos and 166 hog deer.

“Until and unless the Indian government accepts the floods in Assam as a national problem, there isn’t much one can do,” Sanjoy Hazarika, director of the Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research at the New Delhi-based Jamia Milia Islamia university, said. “The Indian government tends to keep the data (on water volume) on the Brahmaputra a state secret. I am not really sure how much information is passed on to the state government, which can take preventive measures if needed.”

Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has forecast more heavy rain in the following months.

For now, it seems India will have to do with fishing in the city streets or climbing up to the village rooftops.","Tue, 02 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ap_16209317339010-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,"['city', 'states', 'swim', 'state', 'killed', 'calm', 'hellhole', 'floods', 'assam', 'rains', 'national', 'urban', 'indian', 'india', 'monsoon', 'stay']", ,flood

“During the next 1-5 days, river Ganga is likely to flow in high to unprecedented flood situation in the districts of Ghazipur and Balia in Uttar Pradesh; Patna, Munger and Bhagalpur in Bihar; Sahibganj in Jharkhand and Murshidabad in West Bengal. The river is likely to flow in moderate to high flood situation in Allahabad, Mirzapur and Varanasi districts of UP,” the Ministry cautioned.

The number of Indian states facing the risk of floods this monsoon season.

Why is it important? Underlines the need for infrastructure to face both scarcity and abundance of water. This season, 90% of India has received normal to excess rainfall after two consecutive years of drought. The government is responding. Flood response centres have been set up in 62 places across the country and mock drills are being conducted in flood-prone areas besides training people living on river banks.

Tell me more: The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has placed the following states on alert for floods: Bihar, Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.

8-12%

What is it? The proposed benefits, as a percentage of the total cost of the new vehicle, buyers would receive if they exchange their old cars (over 11 years old) for a new one.

Why is it important? This is part of a vehicle policy that has the potential of taking 28 million polluting vehicles off the road. This is also likely to boost the automobile industry’s sales and revenues, which recorded a manufacturing capacity utilisation rate of 54.25% in 2015-16.

Tell me more: The benefits totalling 8-12% of the cost of a new vehicle would be in three forms: scrap value from the old vehicle, a discount by the manufacturers and a partial excise duty exemption. The replacement vehicle should be BS-IV compliant, the norms of which would come into effect from April 2017.

11

What is it? The number of Indian firms that have been given licences by US biopharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences to market its Epclusa drug to treat Hepatitis C.

Why is it important? In 2013, as many as 12 million people were estimated to have been infected with Hepatitis C in India, which often remains unknown, undiagnosed and untreated. Hepatitis C virus causes inflammation of the liver and could lead to jaundice, bleeding, fluid accumulation in the abdomen, liver cancer and death. This drug is the first to treat all six major forms of the virus.

Tell me more: The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration last week. The medicine can be prescribed to anyone testing positive for Hepatitis C and a pill a day for 8-12 weeks can lead to curing them.

4

What is it? The number of members on the panel that would look into the feasibility of having a new financial year.

Why is it important? India is the only one among the major countries to follow an April-March financial year, making international comparisons difficult. Most countries follow a January-December fiscal year. If a change is recommended and accepted, it would effect major changes in taxation systems, businesses, preparing the national budget and data collection.

Tell me more: The committee is headed by former chief economic advisor Shankar Acharya and it has to submit its report by December 31, 2016. The committee also has to suggest a way of making the transition, if it suggests a new financial year.

30%

What is it? The percentage of the country’s land that is undergoing degradation, according to a study.

Why is it important? Land degradation is the long-term loss of ecosystem function and productivity caused mainly by human activities and natural disasters. This makes it challenging for India to meet its commitment of fully stopping land degradation by 2030, as per the UN Convention on Combating Desertification.

Tell me more: The degrading area has increased by 0.5% to 29.3 million hectares over an eight-year period, as shown by comparing satellite imageries of the states for the years 2003-05 and 2011-13. Desertification has increased by 1.16 million hectares to 82.64 million hectares in 2011-13.

40,40,FL-2016-000094-IND,The Swachh Bharat Mission may just trip up Bihar’s fledgling ecological sanitation movement - Scroll.in,https://scroll.in/article/812385/the-swachh-bharat-mission-may-just-trip-up-bihars-fledgling-ecological-sanitation-movement,"At 25.1%, the state of Bihar has the lowest toilet coverage in India. This means only a quarter of Bihar’s total population of 10.4 crore has access to toilets. The remaining 75% defecates in the open, causing both health problems and environmental degradation.

Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Gramin, both the Government of India and the state government are making concerted efforts to increase toilet coverage in Bihar. However, the lack of focus on ecological sanitation and contractor-driven toilet construction targets is hurting the sanitation sector.

Technologically speaking, there are various options for household sanitation. These include the simple pit latrine, pour flush latrine, soak-pit and those that run on the septic tank system.

However, in recent years, the concept of ecological sanitation has gained ground in the country. Commonly known as ecosan, this concept is based on the principles of recycling.

In such toilets, human excreta and urine are separated at the source to be later used as fertiliser in agricultural fields. A flush of water is not required; at the most a minimal amount of wash water is required. Thus, an ecosan toilet not only saves water and reduces the risk of groundwater contamination (conventional underground soak-pits often leak or overflow), it also reuses nutrients in faeces and urine to boost crop production and reduces consumption of chemical fertilisers.

North Bihar has abundant surface water sources and a shallow groundwater table (2-5 metres below the ground level). It also faces frequent floods, as 73% of the state (mostly North Bihar) is flood prone.

Ecosan toilets are particularly useful in such areas.

“Shallow groundwater table and frequent floods means high risk of groundwater contamination due to human excreta stored in the underground soak-pits of conventional latrines,” said Eklavya Prasad, managing trustee of Megh Pyne Abhiyan, a public charitable trust working on water and sanitation issues in North Bihar. “Also, during floods, the conventional flush toilets are rendered useless as flood water enters the pits and chokes the system.”

Groundwater contamination is a major concern in Bihar because groundwater is the primary source of drinking water.

In order to promote ecological sanitation, Megh Pyne Abhiyan has tied up with Water Action, a Pashchim Champaran-based Non-Governmental Organisation, to promote ecosan toilets in rural areas of the district where overall toilet coverage is mere 24.7%.

“We are promoting ecosan toilets in the villages of Pashchim Champaran,” said Vinay Kumar, secretary of Water Action. “But, competing with free, conventional pit toilets being constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission is turning out to be a big challenge.”

Floods and ecosan toilets

The floods of 2008-’09 introduced the concept of ecosan toilets in North Bihar. “During the floods, villagers were openly defecating barely 10 feet away from the drinking water handpumps,” reminisced Kumar, who was carrying out flood-relief works in Nautan block of Pashchim Champaran at that time. “We realised the need of providing sanitation facilities to the flood-affected population.”

In 2007, Kumar had attended a workshop on ecosan toilets in Khagaria district of North Bihar where sanitation experts from Bengaluru trained local Non-Governmental Organisations on ecosan toilets.

Kumar decided to implement the idea during the 2008-’09 floods.

“On a slightly raised platform, we constructed 10 makeshift ecosan toilets using two-hole pan and an empty Dalda ghee plastic container,” explained Kumar. “Faeces were collected in large Dalda ghee container whereas urine was collected separately in a large bottle using a pipe.”

After the floods, when people moved back to their villages, they dismantled the ecosan toilets and carried the materials with them to reconstruct the toilets.

The niche for ecosan toilets had thus been created.

Based on local conditions and community feedback, Megh Pyne Abhiyan designed a unique ecosan toilet called Phaydemand Shauchalay (beneficial or productive toilet), particularly meant for the flood prone areas of North Bihar.

Phaydemand Shauchalay

On an average, the faecal matter and urine one human being produces every year contains 4.6 kg nitrogen, 0.6 kg phosphorous and 1.3 kg potassium, the three main nutrients in commercial fertilisers. From these nutrients, 250 kg of rice can be produced annually, reads Megh Pyne Abhiyan’s manual on Phaydemand Shauchalay.

The basic design of a Phaydemand Shauchalay includes two specially-designed ecosan toilet pans placed above two concrete chambers, which are constructed above ground level, on a raised platform, to account for floods. Each pan has a 10-inch diameter space in the centre, which leads to the chambers below, where the faeces are collected. Sloping away from this open space are two basins at the front and back with their own drainage. The basin at the front collects urine, while the one at the back drains out the water used for cleaning.

After defecating, the user needs to sprinkle two spoons of ash or sawdust on the faeces and close the lid of the excreta hole. Not even a drop of wash water or urine should get inside the excreta chambers. This prevents insect attack, and there is absolutely no bad odour.

For the first five to six months, the family uses one chamber only. Once the first chamber is filled, it is sealed, and the fecal matter naturally decomposes into manure in three to four months. During this time, the family switches to using the second chamber for defecation. Once ready, the humanure is harvested by family members and used in the fields. The urine, which is collected in a separate container, is mixed with water and sprinkled in the fields.

“We ensure that before constructing Phaydemand Shauchalay, the community is educated about ecological sanitation and the proper use of an ecosan toilet,” said Prasad.

In order to address the threat of floods, Megh Pyne Abhiyan and Water Action carry out village-based studies to mark flood water levels of the last 10 years. “Based on the 10 years data, we decide the height of the toilet, which is always built on a raised platform to ensure flood waters do not enter the excreta chambers,” said Kumar. Local villagers have also been trained to make pre-cast standardised Phaydemand Shauchalay pans.

A young ecosan warrior

In early 2012, after securing a Bachelor of Arts degree, 21-year-old Vinita Kumari, a resident of Poorvi Tola, Rupaulia panchayat in Gaunaha block, enrolled herself with the Indira Gandhi National Open University for a Master of Arts degree via correspondence. Kumari, the fourth of five girls, also decided to take charge of her family’s farmland.

Around the same time, Kumar was regularly visiting Poorvi Tola to educate villagers about ecological sanitation. The hamlet did not have even a single toilet at the time and all the 37 households were practicing open defecation.

After a long community mobilisation programme, the construction of Phaydemand Shauchalay started in the village in April 2012. The cost of construction of one such toilet was about Rs 8,000-Rs 9,000. Water Action raised money from Public Health Engineering Department (funds and donor assistance). The balance amount of Rs 1,000-Rs 1,500 came from the user families.

While the construction of Phaydemand Shauchalay were underway, Vinita Kumari started taking a keen interest in ecosan technology. She also gave useful suggestions on toilet design to Water Action. However, convincing her own family members to construct a Phaydemand Shauchalay wasn’t easy.

“My father and his brother were against the idea of harvesting excreta and urine,” reminisced Kumari. “They thought it was a menial job. I assured them I will harvest humanure and use it in the fields.”

By December 2012, 31 Phaydemand Shauchalay were ready for use in Poorvi Tola, one of them belonged to Kumari’s family. And, on May 1, 2013, she formally joined Water Action as an ecosan warrior.

Eco-friendly and savings too

Between 2013 and 2015, Kumari and her family have harvested humanure four times – a total of 10 quintals – as well as 72 gallons of urine. “Earlier the sugarcane crop used to be yellowish in colour and wasn’t very strong,” she said. “But, after using humanure and urine, it is both tall and strong.”

For the last two years, her family has stopped buying chemical fertilisers and are saving Rs 10,000-Rs 12,000 per annum. On 17 acres of land, she organically grows wheat, paddy, corn, and sugarcane. A 2.5 acre plot is used as a kitchen garden to grow vegetables.

The entire hamlet of Poorvi Tola has benefited from the 31 Phaydemand Shauchalay, which have together generated 108 quintals of humanure and 24,900 litres of urine in two years. As against a conventional latrine that uses eight to nine litres of water per flush, Phaydemand Shauchalay requires very little wash water. Thus, Poorvi Tola is saving 2,160 litres of water every day by using these ecosan toilets.

Free pit toilets vs ecosan toilets

Early last year, Vinita started visiting Kairi village in Domath to educate the villagers about ecological sanitation. Kairi is a Tharu tribe village of 138 families, and till last year, it did not have even a single toilet.

After holding meetings with the villagers, four Tharu families decided to end open defecation and construct Phaydemand Shauchalay. By April 2015, four ecosan toilets were ready. “Earlier women and young girls in my family used to walk long distances to defecate every morning,” said Yogendra Nath, smiling. “Now they use Phaydemand Shauchalay at home. I am very happy.”

Five-year-old Sunil happily poses in front of the Phaydemand Shauchalay at his house in Kairi village in Bihar. (Photo credit: Nidhi Jamwal).

Nath’s Phaydemand Shauchalay cost a total of Rs 18,015 of which Rs 12,000 was sourced from government funds and the balance was paid by Nath himself.

However, Kumari is now finding it very difficult to convince other families in Kairi to adopt these ecosan toilets as the Government of India is providing a subsidy of Rs 12,000 per individual household latrine under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

“The village panchayats are hiring contractors and getting conventional pit latrines constructed to make a killing out of the central subsidy,” said Kumari. “Since more toilets mean more subsidy, latrines are being constructed at a rapid speed with no quality control or monitoring.”

Till April last year, there wasn’t even a single toilet in Kairi village. But, within nine months, more than 16 pit toilets were constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission, which was launched in October 2014 to end open defecation across India by 2019. Predictably, a free toilet sells faster than one where a user family has to contribute to the cost of construction.

Another issue is that the Baseline Survey data of 2013 collected by the states, as per which free toilets are being constructed in rural households, is flawed.

“We are aware of the wrong entries in the survey,” said Bhogendra Mishra, executive engineer, Public Health Engineering Department (Bettiah), Pashchim Champaran. “Several families without a toilet have been marked as already having a toilet. But, since the data has already been forwarded to the Central government, we cannot do anything about it.”

Clearly, the Swachh Bharat Mission will fail to meet its goal of an India free of open defecation unless it promotes innovative technology built around the principles of ecological sanitation. The errors in the Baseline Survey, too, need to be addressed.

41,41,FL-2016-000094-IND,From drought to floods in 45 days | News - eco-business.com,https://www.eco-business.com/news/from-drought-to-floods-in-45-days/,"By the end of July, an estimated 300 people have been killed by floods, around three million have been forced to flee their homes, over 100,000 animals have been drowned – including 21 rare and endangered one-horned rhinoceros – as a water-parched South Asia has suddenly got too much of it since the start of the monsoon in mid-June.

As the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus and their tributaries swelled with rain water large swathes of farmland were inundated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Parts of large cities such as Dhaka, Guwahati, Patna, Allahabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala went under water, and the same fate threatened New Delhi.

It is not as if it has been an especially vigorous monsoon. In fact, the India Meteorological Department says the rainfall during June and July has been exactly the same as the long-period average. It has even been 13 per cent deficient in east and northeast India.

Southern Bhutan flooded

Relative to its size, Bhutan is perhaps the worst flood-hit country in South Asia right now. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk has joined ministers and officials in the rescue and relief efforts in the southern parts of the country.On July 21, the town of Sarpang Bazar was entirely washed away by floodwaters, which also cut off the road to the town of Gelephu.

Choden Drukpa, a 40-year-old resident of Sarpang Bazar who earns her living by renting out farmland and shops, said her life had been shattered. She was one of 52 families left homeless when the Sarpang River broke its banks, following continuous heavy rainfall. “We managed to take out some belongings but lost the source of our livelihood, the land,” said Drukpa.

With floodwaters and landslides cutting off the highway from Phuentsholing on the India border, landlocked Bhutan is already experiencing shortages of food and fuel. Power transmission lines have been brought down by landslides and many parts of the country are without electricity. The highway was reopened after five days, and the shortages are expected to ease soon.

Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay went public with a declaration that there was enough food in every district warehouse and asked people not to panic.

The department of roads has reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off when the Buduney Bailey bridge in Samtse district collapsed on July 21. Many other roads, especially to remote districts in the eastern parts of the country, were blocked by landslides.

“ We managed to take out some belongings but lost the source of our livelihood, the land. Choden Drukpa, resident, Sarpang Bazar

Floods affected the construction site of the second hydropower project on the Punatsangchu River, with its water diversion tunnel and coffer (temporary) dam under water. Ironically, this was a year when Bhutan had faced a rare drought before the onset of the monsoon, and many farmers had been forced to leave their lands fallow. The Bhutan government is now laying emphasis on developing flood early warning systems along its rivers.

Assam, Bihar worst hit in India

As Bhutan struggles to bring things under control, India’s northeastern state of Assam is struggling. In terms of size of area affected, it is the worst hit. In the Brahmaputra basin 34 people have died and another 1.1 million have been displaced, according to official records. Kaziranga, the world famous rhinoceros sanctuary on the bank of the Brahmaputra, is flooded – some of the rhinos have been drowned, others run over as they tried to cross a busy road to higher ground.

Such widespread flooding during a normal monsoon season is in line with the prediction of scientists – climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days. In this situation, the rainwater has less chance of percolating underground and recharging the water table. It rushes along the surface instead.

Riverbeds silted due to ill-planned embankments, dams and barrages do not help.It is the same story elsewhere in India, where 118 people have been drowned by floodwaters according to official records, mostly in the Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. The situation is particularly dire in northern Bihar, where the Gandak River has flooded many villages and forced residents to take shelter on railway lines that are built on embankments.

In many cases, people were flooded out when officials were forced to open the gates of dams or barrages to protect the structures. That is why the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in India’s capital New Delhi.

In Himachal Pradesh, the Sutlej – which joins the Indus downstream in Pakistan – has inundated villages through multiple flash floods in the mountain areas. The rains have been followed by landslides throughout the Himalayas. Hundreds of tourists are stuck behind them in the resort town Manali.

(TOI photo)

PATNA: Trained as an aerospace engineer at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, 26-year-old Kolkata boy Siddharth Agarwal, is currently walking along the Ganga. He has covered 750 kms from Ganga Sagar to Patna. The lone walker Agarwal is deeply curious about the effects of human activities and policies on the river and on the lives of the people directly dependent on the river.

""I want to know how the river affects people's lives. Want to know the narrative of people who are worst affected by what we as a community and our government are doing to the river’, Agarwal told TOI before leaving from Patna for his onward journey on foot.

The idea behind the four-month, 3,000km-long Ganga: Moving Upstream expedition, Agarwal says, is to pick up and interpret stories from the immediate vicinity of the Ganga.

He started from the Sagar Island, also known as Gangasagar, at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, on June 6. Agarwal has been sticking as close as possible to the river, walking through embankments and muddy trails. The stranger in a hippie beard is often confronted with two questions by villagers: What are you selling, and which address are you looking for? He has his own set of questions, though.

Before leaving from Patna on Sunday morning, he says: ""I am back on the road after a short break in Patna and the weather couldn't have been better!"". Talking about Ganga in Patna he said, ""new pillars are coming up for a ""Marine Drive"" that is supposed to bypass Patna. ""Locals are excited, but housing construction on the flood plains is rampant. Sewer lines still open directly into the river, currently under water and hence not-visible"", he said.

""I'm hoping that this walk helps broadcast the voices of the people of the river to a larger audience, making them and their concerns audible and a party to the ongoing discussions about rivers in the country,"" he said.

His plan is to go up to Tapovan, beyond Gangotri, in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand, will eventually come together as a documentary film that can be viewed at festivals, private screenings, schools and colleges, the objective being ""to create awareness about the Ganga.

""All old ideas/images of global warming and social-cultural issues took centre stage and in the company of one of my dear friends Ujjwal Chauhan, the decision to test ourselves and taste the waters of matters we would often discuss led to a 2500 km cycle ride across the country, Kolkata to Mumbai in 2014. I never looked back and this was followed by a 700 km walk across Rajasthan, learning about the local culture, especially Shekhawati architecture.

Talking about the mood of the onlookers, he said onlooking stranger often ask weird questions like - ""Why would I be walking through these villages? Am I there to meet someone, if not, what am I selling? Is this a religious pilgrimage? Am I from the government? Am I from the army or the police? Am I a terrorist? And I’m definitely from the CID if you were to listen to what most kids have to say!""

Crowd-funded to keep out “corporate vested interests”, he has generated around Rs three lakhs through donations made by his friends and well wishers.

""In the past few years I have dabbled with various activities ranging from cultural to social to entrepreneurial, with these often taking me places and helping me learn in depth. Somewhere while participating in all these activities, my curiosity grew and the zeal to learn multiplied”, he told TOI.

Smiles disappear, conversations die out, huddles form and eyes widen with amazement, such is the welcome that i receive often. He only carries a ruck sack that weighs around 15 kg, two cameras, audio recorder and a handful of questions about the river and it’s people to sate my curiosity.

Beautiful, landscaped and equipped with modern amenities, Srivastava thought she and her family would have the time of their lives.Then, one July evening, the rains turned her plans of life in a posh gated community into mush. “It doesn’ta lot here, but the mess is terrible. You are stuck on the road for hours, then you are completely cut off because of the waterlogging. You are used to the idea of floods in rural Bihar, but floods in Gurgaon or Delhi? That is not something one considers,” says Srivastava. Flooding and disruption have become the new normal for the monsoon season in urban India. Water runoff on paved surfaces is common during rains. Towns and cities have a high proportion of built-up areas, tarmacked and paved surfaces. Paucity of open areas slows the pace at which rainwater percolates to the ground.During intense or prolonged rainfall, the capacity of natural and built-up drainage is overwhelmed; this is when flooding occurs. Typically, it begins as localised waterlogging. As the rain continues, the water level rises and larger areas are inundated.Waterlogging during rains is part of the urban experience. However, in the past decade, there has been an increase in urban flood events across the world. Scientists and urban planners say that climate change and increased urbanisation are contributing factors. And that the incidence and intensity of urban floods will escalate.Climate scientists say that global warming has altered rainfall patterns; that, along with melting glaciers and rising sea levels, has increased the risk of urban floods. Scientists in India have found a growing trend of intense rainfall in short durations. Given the unplanned development and poorly maintained drainage systems, the increased intensity of rain results in higher chances of urban floods in India.But fixing its existing drainage systems will not be enough. India is projected to urbanise rapidly. At the projected compounded annual growth rate of 2.1%, almost 600 million people and a large proportion of assets will be located in urban centres by 2031.In their paper in the International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research, Farhat Rafiq and Sirajuddin Ahmed of Jamia Milia Islamia in New Delhi, Shamsad Ahmad of King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia and Amir Ali Khan of the National Institute of Disaster Management stressed on addressing unplanned development of buildings and infrastructure and poor management of urban drainage – warning that increased urbanisation would raise the risk of floods “by up to three times.”Urban planners say haphazard construction, with little regard for natural drainage patterns and topography, and the near-total absence of soft areas (not concretised) have contributed to making Indian cities veritable nightmares. The practice of reclaiming wetlands for development, choking avenues of natural drainage, made things worse.“There is a growing realisation that reclaiming wetlands for urban development is not desirable,” says Raina Singh, Fellow, Centre for Research on Sustainable Urban Development and Transport Systems at the New Delhi-based think tank The Energy and Resources Institute.This is reflected in the Chennai Corporation’s efforts to restore the city’s buffer zones. “Extensive efforts for restoration have been undertaken over the last few years. But rebuilding a wetland takes way longer than destroying it. The good news is that urban planners are beginning to understand the importance of wetlands,” says Singh.Guwahati and Panjim are making similar efforts. The appreciation, however, is not universal. The Supreme Court recently had to order builders in Bengaluru to push back their projects from the city’s lakes and wetlands. Poor drainage makes matters worse.“The drainage infrastructure doesn’t have adequate capacities. These were developed some 30 or 40 years ago for much lower levels of rainfall,” explains Singh.It’s not just inadequate capacity. Manit Rastogi, who heads the architecture and urban design practice Morphogenesis, says the problem is compounded by poor planning, maintenance and misuse. Rastogi says that since Delhi gets intermittent rains, the city’s drains are not cleaned all year round, which is why they are choked. When desilted, the waste is rarely disposed of properly and is often kept along the drain and in time, it ends up back in there.He said the drain network also carries sewage. Additionally, in many places, the drains have been blocked off or built over.“There is no plan for groundwater percolation. Say the water cannot flow through the drains effectively, the next best thing is for it to seep through the ground. This does not happen either as much of our land is paved over or built upon,” says Rastogi. Singh, too, points to a compromised drainage network: houses building ramps over drains, roads built by cutting off drains and drains clogged with solid waste – making the already inadequate infrastructure even less effective and resulting in massive flooding, like in Gurgaon, Mumbai and Bengaluru.Efforts at reducing urban floods must begin with the planning process. Authorities must conduct vulnerability assessments, demarcate no-development areas, build urban drainage infrastructure in sync with natural drainage patterns and allow for redundancies.To fix existing conditions in the cities, Singh suggests retrofitting. Providing porous pavements to allow infiltration of water and large tanks to store rainwater.“There is no single solution. The main cause for flooding in every area is different. Each area needs to be analysed in order to adopt the most effective and optimum retrofitting measure,” says Singh. Alternatives, too, need to be explored.“Our current approach of connecting local drains to larger networks that in turn empty into our rivers is ineffective as conditions currently stand. A far more practical solution would be to short-circuit the drains to local parks that can incorporate bioswales and aquifers, which will effect groundwater percolation very well. It will also have a greater impact on improving the groundwater table,” says Rastogi.“Authorities say that things will improve. Will it?” asks Srivastava.A sustainable solution will require more than planning and technical intervention. It requires stakeholders to work together – urban centres are administered in silos.“There are design and technical interventions that have been proposed, but these are rendered meaningless when there is no single cohesive entity to ensure these are deployed and used in an effective manner. The real problem in most of our urban centres is how you deal with the multiplicity of governance structures when tackling a problem that requires a cohesive approach,” says Rastogi.The lack of cohesion means that every authority approaches the problem from its own perspective and often works at odds with other stakeholders. The result: an urban mess.A plan to overhaul India’s towns and cities will require tackling multiple ownership of land, which is a hurdle to implementing a cohesive vision of an urban centre.“We need to start looking at our new smart cities through the lens of urban design as against one of master planning. The land-use concept that underpins our urban centres is that land is divided into multiple ownerships—private and public. What an effective urban plan requires is that the horizontal plane is all owned by the state – that is roads, pavements and city centres – while the vertical plane – that is built volumes – can have private/mixed ownership.It means fewer barriers and better-managed infrastructure as a result,” says Rastogi.Not addressing these fundamental issues will mean continuing to tinker around the edges and the next heavy downpour could well turn our towns and cities into mush.","Sat, 20 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-53779757,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111358,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg","['act', 'cities', 'bikes', 'drains', 'streets', 'floating', 'say', 'floods', 'centres', 'start', 'infrastructure', 'urban', 'areas', 'cars', 'development', 'drainage', 'flooding']", ,none

The government weather forecaster issued a red alert warning for Chhattisgarh for the next two days; Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha for Wednesday, and Rajasthan for the next two days.

Since the monsoon season started in June, 28% of the country’s area has recorded excess rainfall, while 56% of the area has received normal rainfall. So far, the country has received 3% excess rainfall this monsoon season. IMD has forecast 107% of the Long Period Average rain in August and September.

According to a National Disaster Management Authority official, standby teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) are deployed in around 18 places in the country. Operational teams are deployed in Assam, West Bengal, Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.

Rajasthan has been facing very heavy rainfall in the past few days with reports of flood-like situation in parts of the desert state. On Tuesday, west Rajasthan recorded 782% more than average rainfall and east Rajasthan recorded 436% more than normal rainfall. Two NDRF teams have been deployed in the state.

Although the flood situation in Assam has eased, the Dhansiri river in the state is still flowing above the danger mark.

Central Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidarbha, which faced drought-like conditions last year, have also recorded excess rainfall this year, causing concerns for the crops. Madhya Pradesh, which has already faced floods this monsoon, along with Rayalaseema and northern interior Karnataka, have also recorded excess rainfall during the rainy season so far.

NDRF personnel have been deployed in metros such as Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi in anticipation of flood-like situation. IMD has forecast above normal rainfall at 106% of Long Period Average.

Patna: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Saturday demanded removal of Farakka barrage on river Ganga, saying ""the disadvantages of the barrage appear to be higher than its benefits"".

Raising the issue of Bihar's share in Ganges waters at the 11th Inter State Council meeting in New Delhi, Nitish also sought the Centre's intervention to ensure uninterrupted flow of water from the states of upper co-basin so that the entire length of Ganga has continuous supply of water even during lean season. The meeting was chaired by PM Narendra Modi and attended by CMs of different states and union ministers.

""About 16% of the catchment area of river Ganga is in Bihar, but in the lean season 3/4th of the total water flowing in Ganga comes from rivers of Bihar. Estimated 400 cusecs of water flow is received at the (Uttar Pradesh) border of Bihar in river Ganga. However, at Farakka barrage, 1500 cusecs of water flow is to be ensured, which is achieved mainly through the water contributed by the rivers of Bihar. Indeed, during lean season, not even 400 cusecs of water flow is available at the border of Bihar. In this regard, Centre's intervention is required to ensure uninterrupted flow of water from the states of upper co-basin, so that the entire length of Ganga river in Bihar has continuous supply of water even during lean season,"" Nitish said while presenting Bihar's views at the meeting.

The CM also told the meeting that responsibility to ensure the required water availability at Farakka barrage has been put solely on Bihar. ""Bihar's fundamental right to use the water of Ganga and its tributaries in the state is also being violated. Currently the upper states use more than their share of the Ganges waters, whereas objections are raised even on little use of Ganga waters by Bihar for its development needs,"" he said.

Nitish also demanded formulation of an effective National Silt Management Policy, saying such a body at the national level is essential for silt management as well as for ensuring uninterrupted flow of water not only in Ganga, but all the other rivers.

The CM also pitched for a complete ban on sale and consumption of liquor across the country and reiterated his demand for special category status to Bihar and other backward states.

""Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Radha Mohan Singh has approved to extend the cut-off date for applying for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojna till 31st August, 2016 for Bihar,"" an official statement said.

The farmers can apply for the scheme and Banks can take the premium under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojna in Bihar up to extended date, it added.

Earlier this week, the Bihar government agreed to implement the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana on an experimental basis in the kharif season after a slugfest over name of this scheme.

""The state government has decided to implement the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) in the state keeping in mind the sentiments of cooperative federalism,"" Bihar Cooperative Minister Alok Kumar Mehta had said.

The last date for implementation of the scheme is August 15, Mehta had said.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had recently said that the scheme should have been named 'PM-CM farmer insurance scheme' or 'Kendra-Rajya Fasal Bima Yojana' instead of being named exclusively after the Prime Minister as both the Centre and states have to bear the financial burden.

To provide financial support to farmers suffering crop loss arising out of unforeseen events, a new scheme Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has been approved for implementation in all States/Union Territories from Kharif 2016 season.

A budget provision of Rs 5,501.15 crore has been made for the scheme during 2016-17.

As the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus and their tributaries swelled with rain water, large swathes of farmland were inundated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Parts of large cities such as Dhaka, Guwahati, Patna, Allahabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala went under water, and the same fate threatened New Delhi.

It is not as if it has been an especially vigorous monsoon. In fact, the India Meteorological Department said the rainfall during June and July has been exactly the same as the long-period average. It has even been 13% deficient in east and northeast India.

Southern Bhutan flooded

Relative to its size, Bhutan is perhaps the worst flood-hit country in South Asia right now. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk has joined ministers and officials in the rescue and relief efforts in the southern parts of the country.

With floodwaters and landslides cutting off the highway from Phuentsholing on the India border, landlocked Bhutan is already experiencing shortages of food and fuel. Power transmission lines have been brought down by landslides and many parts of the country are without electricity.

The highway was reopened after five days, and the shortages are expected to ease soon. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay went public with a declaration that there was enough food in every district warehouse and asked people not to panic.

The department of roads has reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off when the Buduney Bailey bridge in Samtse district collapsed on July 21. Many other roads, especially to remote districts in the eastern parts of the country, were blocked by landslides.

Floods affected the construction site of the second hydropower project on the Punatsangchu River, with its water diversion tunnel and coffer (temporary) dam under water. Ironically, this was a year when Bhutan had faced a rare drought before the onset of the monsoon, and many farmers had been forced to leave their lands fallow. The Bhutan government is now laying emphasis on developing flood early warning systems along its rivers.

Assam, Bihar worst hit in India

As Bhutan struggles to bring things under control, India’s Northeastern state of Assam is struggling. In terms of size of area affected, it is the worst hit. In the Brahmaputra basin 34 people have died and another 1.1 million have been displaced, according to official records. Kaziranga, the world famous rhinoceros sanctuary on the bank of the Brahmaputra, is flooded – some of the rhinos have been drowned, others run over as they tried to cross a busy road to higher ground.

Such widespread flooding during a normal monsoon season is in line with the prediction of scientists – climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days. In this situation, the rainwater has less chance of percolating underground and recharging the water table. It rushes along the surface instead. Riverbeds silted due to ill-planned embankments, dams and barrages do not help.

In many cases, people were flooded out when officials were forced to open the gates of dams or barrages to protect the structures. That is why the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in India’s capital New Delhi.

In Himachal Pradesh, the Sutlej – which joins the Indus downstream in Pakistan – has inundated villages through multiple flash floods in the mountain areas. The rains have been followed by landslides throughout the Himalayas. Hundreds of tourists are stuck behind them in the resort town Manali.

Scores killed in Nepal landslides, floods

Over 50 people were killed by landslides and flash floods in Nepal in the last week of July alone, according to the home ministry. The toll since May has crossed 150; of them 97 have been killed by landslides.

In the last week of July, almost all the major rivers of Nepal breached danger levels, which experts say is rare. “Normally it doesn’t happen that almost all rivers get above danger level at the same time but on July 26, the water level on most of the rivers that we monitored was above the danger mark,"" said Binod Parajuli, hydrologist at the department of hydrology and meteorology. ""It is pretty unusual to have such heavy rainfall within a short span of 24 hours.” Climate scientists call it the new normal.

Still, in a country with over 6,000 rivers and rivulets rushing down the steep mountain slopes of the Himalayas, the early warning systems are few and far between. “Flood early warning systems have helped reduce human casualties. If more resources are provided we can reduce it further in coming days,” Parajuli said.

Same story in Bangladesh

By the end of July, floods had killed 14 people in Bangladesh and displaced almost 1.5 million people, washing away 9,000 houses and damaging another 12,000, according to official records. Most of the deaths and damage have taken place in northwestern Bangladesh, where the Brahmaputra enters the country from India.

Ripon Karmakar, duty forecasting officer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), does not expect more damage in northwestern Bangladesh, but is more worried about the central and southern parts of the country, as the floodwaters rush to the Bay of Bengal.

Ataur Rahman, a hydrologist who teaches at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that apart from floods in Tibet and India, siltation in the rivers and lack of structural measures were worsening the situation.

So far, the government’s response has been to give 5.50 crore Bangladeshi Taka (USD 702,000) and 13,000 tonnes of rice to the affected districts, apart from 13,000 packets of dry food, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said in the last weekend of July.

Parts of Pakistan flooded

Residents of Pakistan’s capital Islamabad are enjoying the downpours this monsoon without being waterlogged, since the city is built on a slope on the Himalayan foothills. But life in the waterlogged parts of Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and other towns along the Indus and its tributaries has come to a standstill.

Islamabad’s twin city Rawalpindi shows how unnecessary it all is. In 2006, the Pakistan Meteorological Department installed an early warning system in Leh Nullah, a natural storm water drain that flows from Islamabad to Rawalpindi. Thanks to the warning, the Rawalpindi city administration now cleans up the city drains on time and gets vigilant about encroachments, so there is no flooding.

The same cannot be said about the northern provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan administered Kashmir and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where the rainfall so far has been 10-20% above average. By the first week of July, 46 people had already been killed and 21 more injured in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa alone, according to media reports. There are continuous reports of more damage due to lack of preparedness on the part of the government.

“Given the pattern of intensifying monsoons over the past five years, it is becoming imperative that our cities are built with adequate drainage, and that nullahs (storm water drains) are in proper condition prior to the commencement of the monsoon season,"" said Ghulam Rasool of Pakistan Meteorological Department. ""The drainage of rainwater is not rocket science. It requires a little investment, and some government capacity to put in place by-laws and ensure that appropriate space is allocated on roads for the purpose of maintaining storm water drains.”

Predicting heavier rainfall in August, Rasool said, “The showers were not unprecedented, but poor drainage is the reason why our cities are increasingly witnessing urban flooding.” City administrators need to factor in climate change while planning, he added.

Storm water drains were traditionally planned keeping extreme records in mind, but the extremes are being breached more and more often. “We have to look at future projections and develop climate resistant infrastructure,"" he said. ""That is the need of the time, but our engineers have yet to realise this.""

The other problem is encroachment on the drains due to migration from villages to cities. Many of the poor immigrants settle down in low lying areas because they have no alternative.

Bihar - 26 people dead

26 people have died and about 21.99 lakh people in 1500 villages, have been affected by the floods in Bihar. 15 people died in Kishanganj and Purnia districts alone. The Disaster Management Department statement said rivers like Kagmati-Benibad in Muzaffarpur, Aghwara-Kamtaul in Darbhanga, Koshi-Baltara in Khagaria, Koshi-Kursela in Katihar, Mahananda-Dhengra in Purnia and Jhawa in Katihar were flowing well above the danger level.

Assam and Arunachal Pradesh - 2000 villages affected; Kaziranga submerged

According to the Assam State Disaster Management Agency, more than 10 lakh people have been affected by floods in many areas of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Over 2000 villages come under direct impact of overflowing rivers. Almost all of Kaziranga National Park in submerged right now. People have been advised to drive slow along the roads in that area, so as not to run over animals desperately trying to escape the rapidly advancing water.

Madhya Pradesh - 3 lakh people affected

Over 3 lakh people have been affected by the flooding in parts of Madhya Pradesh, since the first week of this July. The worst hit areas are the districts of Bhopal, Shajapur, Jabalpur, Satna, Harda and Panna.

West Bengal - Over 58,000 villagers affected

Following heavy rains in Bhutan and Sikkim in July this year, major parts of West Bengal, especially around northern parts are facing heavy floods. Around 58,000 people in 150 villages in Alipurduar, Cooch Bihar and Jalpaiguri districts have been adversely affected by the overflowing rivers.

Uttarakhand - More than 30 people dead

Earlier this month, heavy rains hit the northern state of Uttarakhand, which resulted in the deaths of 30 people. The affected areas are currently the districts of Chamoli and Pithoragarh. River levels have increased dramatically and the Alaknanda River and a tributary, the Mandakini, are said to have overflowed.

We're not trying to say that the flood in one state is more important than that in another. It's not a Gurgaon/Bengaluru vs Rest of the country battle here.

“A helicopter of the Indian Coast Guard from Daman along with teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) from Surat were pressed into action along with local police to carry out rescue operations in affected villages, mainly those situated along the coastal areas,” Valsad Collector Remya Mohan said.

Water level at Auranga river was recorded at 11.5 metres, which is about one metre above the danger mark, disaster management officials said.

Damanganga river in Vapi in Valsad district was also flowing near danger level due to water released from Madhuban dam in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, they said.

In Navsari, Ambika river was flowing near the danger level, with nearly a dozen villages affected due to flooding, officials said. Gandevi in Navsari was particularly affected with several villages cut off due to flooding of connecting bridge over Ambika river.

From Assam and Bihar to Gujarat and Maharashtra, it seems as if concerns about a third consecutive year of scanty rainfall might be allayed – and replaced instead with the more abiding concern of flood management.

The India Meteorological Department also said that after a shaky start, India now has only 9% deficit rain. This year is certainly better than 2015, when the monsoon season ended in September with a 14% deficit across the country.

But a closer look at rainfall data for the months of June and July 2016 suggests a slightly more complicated picture.

Take Gujarat. Five people died in flash floods in southern Gujarat on Monday. Heavy rain is expected to continue. The state, however, continues to have deficit rain. The worst affected regions of Kutch and Saurashtra continue to report scanty rainfall, as marked in yellow. While Surendranagar and Anand both received 60% less than normal rain as of August 3, Kutch has reported a 72% deviation from normal.

The drought in Gujarat has been heavily under-reported. With the state government in denial, those dependent on agriculture seem to have fallen under the radar.

Up north, Lahaul and Spiti in Himachal Pradesh has had only 15% of its normal rain so far, and Kinnaur only 37%. Most other districts in the state have had steady rain through June and July. As IANS notes, most agricultural activity in Himachal Pradesh is rainfed and more than two thirds of the state is employed in this sector.

More than half of Punjab has had deficient rain so far. Firozpur, marked in yellow on the Pakistan border, has received 77% deficit rain. On the other hand, Kapurthala in blue which lies just to its north, has had 47% more rain than usual.

Even as floods wreaked havoc in Assam and the Brahmaputra breached its embankments once again, Meghalaya to its south was relatively dry. South Garo Hills had the highest deficiency across the country, with less than 89% of its usual rain as of July 27. East Garo Hills, just to its north, had 105% of normal rain.

The empirical situation in at least three states in the North East is unclear, as the IMD does not seem to have more than two or three rainfall recording stations each in Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Large parts of these states appear blank on the department’s maps.

Hiding in averages

None of this is new. Figures for average rainfall will always hide nuances across the country. Even in a year when India has had regular rain, or more than regular rain, there have been parts that received less than normal rain.

The political boundaries of a state naturally do not align with the physical features of the land, so it is not surprising either that a single state can bear witness to both extremes of rainfall. What is worrying, as an article in The Third Pole points out, is that even those places which are flooding now have still recorded an overall below average rainfall in this monsoon.

One of the defining factors of climate change, the article reminds us, is an increase in extreme weather events – intense dry spells followed by intense wet ones, but with no moderation in between. This, it seems increasingly clear, is what the central and state governments need to prepare themselves for.","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://s01.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/facebook/813137-37541-qnbshheisf-1468243986.jpg,"['remain', 'credit', 'flood', 'normal', 'rain', 'places', 'state', 'dry', 'north', 'deficit', 'gujarat', 'india', 'rainfall', 'meteorological', 'parts']", ,flood

But this organisation’s creative up-cycling of flex proves that every problem has a creative, eco-friendly solution.

We’ve all heard the famous dictum ‘When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.’ Simply put, it means that when life gives you a challenge, you can turn it into an opportunity. This story shines light on how innovative ideas can turn around the most complex of issues.

Banners are a common nuisance, a necessary evil and a part and parcel of our urban landscape. Most are made of what we commonly call flex (poly-vinyl chloride), a material similar to plastic. Its durability and cost effectiveness makes it the preferred material for display. Like plastic, flex too is harmful for the environment, since it is not biodegradable. However, adopting the flex for alternative uses will go a long way in reducing its harmful effect on the environment.

This story is about how we made the most of a potential problem and turned it into an opportunity, by creatively connecting the problem of flex with the challenges of the people we work with.

Back in 2013, a large roll of flex was used to cover the leaky roof of the school, Achrumal Saraswati Shishu Mandir School, situated in the interiors of Gangori in Uttarkashi. The flex lasted for an entire year, and saved the school from incessant worry about repairs and the impact of monsoons.

Flex pieces have also been sent to various villages in Uttron and Nald, in Uttarakhand on various occasions.

During the Uttarakhand floods, flex was used to cover the tin-roofs of shanties and on the floor of flood relief centres to prevent against moisture and cold.

In some centres, the flex continues to be used to ease the severe cold characteristic of the region and to make cleaning easier.

Soon, flex began to find its way into other products as well.

“I was discussing a product with the workshop supervisor. I needed to buy a lot of Bukram to ensure stiffness in our products. One day, I experimented with flex and used it instead of Bukram, as a base in making a men’s wallet. It worked beautifully,”says Reena, a Goonj member from Delhi.

“Gradually, we started using flex in many of our Green by Goonj recycled products. It’s definitely made our products more durable and strong.”



These flexes have also been very useful in protecting buildings from moisture, especially in areas where there is an absence of direct sunlight.

As a result, flexes have been sent to Bihar, Uttrakhand and Odisha as well. This in turn has helped in safeguarding material or stock stored in these buildings across the country.

Promotion

After the 2008 Bihar floods, a lot of Vocational Training Centers were set up using local resources like bamboo, and by renovating abandoned structures under Goonj’s CFW initiative. Flex was used for roofing and covering the walls of these centers. Over the years, these centers have provided livelihood to many women in the neighboring 6 to 7 villages. The Vocational Training Center in Keshopur in the Medhepura district, has trained 750 girls and women so far; many of them have gone on to purchase sewing machines and set up their own businesses.

In schools where students were once forced to sit on tattered mats and daris, flex pieces have been cut into pieces and are being used as sitting mats.

At many Chehak Centers (informal tuition centers that complement formal government school education) started by Goonj, flex is taking the place of expensive tarpaulin, and the same funds are being used for other pressing needs. Two Chehak Centres (one in Saharsa and another in Purnea district of Bihar) are currently operational with over 200 children, with parents taking ownership of the center.

Flex pouches are also being distributed along with Goonj’s cloth sanitary pads called MY Pads.

These pouches are useful for women in far flung villages, who spend the entire day at work and do not have a place to store their used cloth pads for wash and reuse at a later stage.

Keeping in mind this practical difficulty, the little pouch is made from flex banners and used tarps. It is leak-proof, cheap and a sustainable way to ensure reuse of cloth pads.

So far, more than 13,000 such pouches have been made and distributed, along with MY Pads, in many states like Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, apart from many slums in Delhi and NCR.

This story is also about another dictum: ‘Let’s improve the world before we change it.’

From the roofs of makeshift shanties, to wallets and even pouches for sanitary napkins, finding alternative uses of flex is undoubtedly a step in the right direction to not only make full use of existing material, but to also save the environment while doing so.

53,53,FL-2016-000094-IND,Drafting drones to help farmers - India Climate Dialogue,https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2016/08/24/drafting-drones-help-farmers/,"Drafting drones to help farmers

From the fields of Kansas to the farms of Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, drones are helping researchers to develop and monitor improved varieties of wheat and fight a pest that is becoming more dangerous due to climate change

Many heads turned when drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles, started hovering over the expansive farmlands of Kansas. It was not a military exercise. Researchers at Kansas State University are using drones for a very different purpose — to develop a climate-resilient wheat variety that can combat rising heat and drought.

The same drones with enhanced equipment are now flying over the wheat fields of Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Kansas is known as the wheat basket of the United States, a distinction associated with Punjab in India. They share many similar agricultural problems — stripe rust is one of them. The rust attacked the standing wheat crop in Punjab and Kansas early January this year, shocking many wheat experts.

Globally, stripe rust, leaf rust, root rust and spot blotch have been destroying wheat fields for centuries. But in recent years, stripe rust has become more frequent, forcing wheat breeders to race against time and develop new rust-resistant varieties. Experts say this pest is mutating faster, attacking newer wheat varieties and spreading to more areas due to climate change.

India is facing an extreme stripe rust crisis right now. A stripe resistant wheat variety PBW 343 released in 1996 became so popular with farmers in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that it occupied nearly 25% of 27 million hectare of wheat fields. After 10 years, it was phased out as it became severely susceptible to stripe rust in 2006 .

A new variety, HD 2967, was released in 2011 to counter the rust menace. This variety too became susceptible to stripe rust in barely five years. In January, HD2967 became prone to rust in a few districts of Punjab. The variety is sown in nearly 10 million hectares. Now, a new variety HD 3086, and PBW 725 and WH 1105 are replacing HD2967.

Race against time

The battle against rust becomes grim as a new variety of wheat with a new resistance to rusts takes nearly 10 years to develop. Uttam Kumar, a wheat breeder with the Global Wheat Programme of CIMMYT and Borlaug Institute of South Asia ( BISA ), told indiaclimatedialogue.net that stripe rust pathogens are becoming stronger with every attack. “We have to ensure that the new variety is more resilient to the rust,” he said.

A rust attack can become an epidemic depending on the wind pattern. A stronger wind can destroy or severely impact wheat yield.

The struggle does not end with the development of new rust-resistant wheat. One of the most daunting tasks is to convince farmers to use the new variety. H.S. Gupta, Director General of BISA, points out that farmers develop trust and habit of using the same variety season after season. “A lot of effort goes into convincing them to use the new rust-resistant wheat,” he said.

Changing weather

Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns have further stoked rust attacks. The situation is so alarming that in 2011 at the International Wheat Stripe Rust Symposium in Aleppo, Syria , scientists and policymakers from 31 countries said in a statement, “Climate change brings rising temperatures, and has increased the variability and intensity of rainfall, contributing to the spread and severity of rust diseases. Emerging variations (or races) of rust are showing that they can adapt to extreme temperatures – a phenomenon not seen before.”

Gupta agrees that combat against rust resistant wheat is going on for many decades, but the situation has aggravated with rising temperature. “We need resources, efficient data to develop climate resilient wheat variety. Slowly, the data collection is becoming efficient,” he said, adding that BISA and CIMMYT are adding new technology to boost faster collection of data.

“Drones are a part of fast data collection initiative,” he says.

Drones at work

Initially, drones were used in 2014, under a research funded by the Kansas Wheat Alliance and carried out by Kansas State University for efficient and fast data collection using near-infrared light to select high yielding, heat and drought resistant wheat lines.

Daljit Singh, a researcher of plant pathology at Kansas State University, points out that drones have a vast potential to assist in wheat variety development. Under the guidance of Jesse Poland, Singh mounted a point and shoot camera on a drone to study the wheat lines. “Drones at KSU captured two sets of data —normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) and near-infrared light,” he told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

“NDVI calculates greenness of the plant and near-infrared light measures its heat resistance,” he said. If a plant reflects low infrared light, it means the plant is heat-stressed.

Earlier, data was collected through a manual field visit that would take two persons nearly two working days. Drones collect the same data with additional data sets in barely 20 minutes.

Farmers benefit

Experts of BISA, CIMMYT and KSU are collecting similar data from the wheat fields of Punjab, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. They are also using data to directly benefit the farmers.

Uttam Kumar said that apart from developing climate-resilient wheat, BISA has been developing a series of calculators for providing precise information to farmers. Using the data collected through drones, BISA’s urea calculator application determines the precise amount of nitrogen needed in the field.

Thus farmers are told the exact amount of urea needed in a wheat field. “It’s a massive supportive information for poor farmers of Bihar,” Kumar said. Most farmers in the state are poor and farming is hardly mechanised. Under such circumstances, saving on urea and water saves farmers a lot of money.

In a situation where climate change is making water supplies more erratic, wheat is a better bet than India’s other major cereal crop, rice. Wheat needs less water than rice – 766 litres to grow one kg, where rice needs 2,200 litres. So it is important to safeguard India’s wheat crop.

Bihar has one of the lowest wheat yields in the country, 2,210 kg per hectare , while in states like Punjab, the per acre wheat yield is more than double at 4,895 kg per hectare.

“One of the biggest challenges in India is diverse weather and farming practices. Punjab suffers from stripe rust but Bihar suffers largely from spot blotch disease,” Uttam Kumar said.

The drone research in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar is a joint initiative by BISA, CIMMYT and KSU. The three partners are planning similar drone use in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.","Wed, 24 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Drone-1.jpg,"['variety', 'rust', 'kansas', 'wheat', 'punjab', 'farmers', 'stripe', 'help', 'data', 'drones', 'develop', 'drafting']", ,none
54,54,FL-2016-000094-IND,Bihar docs perform 176 ortho surgeries on poor free of cost - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/bihar-docs-perform-176-ortho-surgeries-on-poor-free-of-cost/articleshow/53578470.cms,"

Patna: International days devoted to healthcare are usually marked by seminars and awareness walks, but the Indian Orthopaedic Association (IOA) decided to perform 5,000 free surgeries to mark the Bone and Joint Day under the theme ""one member, one free surgery"" and set a world record of sorts. The members of its state unit, Bihar Orthopaedic Association (BOA), performed 176 surgeries for free in three days beginning Thursday.

Of the 176 surgeries, 62 were performed in Patna alone. While 18 surgeries were performed in PMCH, one was performed in NMCH and the rest in private hospitals. AIIMS-Patna and IGIMS did not participate in this campaign, BOA president Dr Rajeev Anand said on Saturday, adding apart from the cost of surgery, the cost of drugs and pre and post- operative care was also borne by the doctors concerned.

""One of the criteria was that the patient should be poor and the surgery should not be very serious,"" Dr Anand told TOI. Muzaffarpur's Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital doctors went a step ahead and performed two partial hip-replacement surgeries which are not considered minor surgeries. In private sector, such a surgery could have cost anywhere between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000.

For the surgeries in government hospitals requiring implants, the doctors convinced the supplier firms to provide them for free. ""Many of them agreed. Anaesthetists also supported us. It was a team effort,"" said Dr Anand.

In PMCH, Dr Ranjit Singh performed one arthroscopic surgery in which the doctor inserts a camera on the knee joint to correct the damage. In private sector, it could have cost above Rs 1 lakh, Dr Anand said. As many as 17 surgeries were done in Darbhnaga, 16 in Muzaffarpur, four in A N Medical College, Gaya and seven in JLNMCH, Bhagalpur. Doctors from Kishanganj, Samastipur, Bettiah, Purnia and Moithari also participated in the drive.

In Patna, Dr Rajeev Kumar's hospital did four surgeries while Dr Amulya Singh's hospital performed five surgeries. One of the beneficiaries at Dr Singh's Akshat Seva Sadan hospital was Ravi Mani Tiwari of Bettiah. He had a fracture of tibia, a bone below the knee. ""The surgery, investigations, ICU stay and medicines -- everything was provided free of cost,"" 46-year-old Tiwari told TOI over the phone.

Dr Prabhakar of Kishanganj performed four implant removal surgeries. The cost of an implant removal surgery comes to Rs 15,000 or so in the private sector.

While the IOA is still collating figures, initial reports suggest Tamil Nadu tops the chart with 700-odd surgeries followed by Andhra Pradesh with 500-odd surgeries. In fact, ""In fact, Hyderabad's Dr A V Guruva Reddy has created a record of sorts by performing 10 knee-replacement surgeries for free in one single day as usually a doctor does not perform more than one or two such surgeries in a day,"" Dr Anand said. tnn

55,55,FL-2016-000094-IND,Experts Think Dredging Won't Tame the Brahmaputra - The Wire,https://thewire.in/politics/assam-dredging-brahmaputra-floods-silt,"Dredging of the Brahmaputra river is being seriously considered by the Assam government as one of the answers to the problem of erosion that has gobbled up huge chunks of land on both banks of the river.

“Dredging of the Brahmaputra will yield a plethora of benefits. It is possible that erosion would be reduced as the depth of the river bed will increase and the force of the water would be less on the banks,” Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal told The Wire. He added that the exercise could be carried out along all the affected spots including Majuli which he represents in the assembly.

Dredging is a measure to dig out sediments from the river bed and is usually used for clearing river mouths or narrow constrictions. Dredging, it is believed, will increase the water retention capacity of the river, with the result that the pressure on the bank would be reduced.

Erosion and floods are as much burning issues in Assam as are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The master plans prepared by the Brahmaputra board suggested constructing hydel projects over the major tributaries of the river for stemming floods. However, this has not materialised so far. Thousands of crores have been spent to check erosion in the past few decades both by state and central agencies but the situation has only turned worse.

From 1912 to 1996, it has been estimated estimated that Assam lost 2,358 sq. km of land due to erosion. From Dhubri to Sadiya, the river flows for a distance of 891 km. It is also one of the most braided rivers in the world with width variation from 1.2 km at Guwahati to more than 10 km at Dibrugarh.

With an annual discharge rate of about 19,830 cubic meter per second at its mouth, the river becomes the fourth biggest river in terms of discharge. Having such a large drainage area, the river is also heavily charged with sediment. The Brahmaputra transports approximately 13 million tonnes of suspended sediment per day during floods.

In sync with the chief minister’s views, a report was prepared two years ago by a Parliamentary Standing Committee that suggested dredging as a solution to the annual mayhem of flood and erosion in Assam. It appealed to the government to explore low-cost technologies for the exercise.

But dredging may be easier said than done. The Wire spoke to a former minister and experts and officials engaged with the issue and almost all of them were of the opinion that dredging is not a feasible proposition to put an end to erosion in Assam.

The Assam government undertook to dredge the Brahmaputra on an experimental basis in 1975 but the high cost ensured that the exercise remained confined to small stretches only. The result of this small experiment was not very convincing.

Bharat Saikia, a former superintendent engineer in the department of water resources and expert on erosion, recalls the operation that was carried out near Guwahati and at Majuli. “For dredging to be effective, it is first necessary to understand the nature and quantity of silt deposition. Silt gets deposited very fast and so it is doubtful if such schemes would be successful,” he said.

It was not until 2010 that the government launched an operation again at a small stretch at Rohmoria to check erosion with equipment brought from Kolkata. The outcome was however positive this time around but the exercise was stopped due to heavy expenditure.

Former water resources minister Prithvi Majhi who had approved the exercise explained that dredging helped remove the silt from the river bed. “But dredging would have to be a continuous process since sediments get deposited very fast. And it has to be complemented by other measures for checking erosion.”

As a result of siltation, the Brahmaputra has been expanding – ranging from 2 km near Guwahati to 14 km at places like Sadiya and Dibrugarh. This is considered a major hurdle for dredging, an official of the Brahmaputra Board explained, and added that that no river in the country had as many braided channels (small streams splitting from the main river) as the Brahmaputra, which was another impediment to the plan proposed by the chief minister.

The official’s views are echoed by other experts and previous reports. A report submitted by IIT-Roorkee in 2012 recommended “comprehensive watershed management as well as development programmes” for controlling sediment ingress into the Brahmaputra river system. As an antidote to erosion, it has made a case for the deployment of cost-effective control measures such as “single or multiple tier Jack Jetty system along with submerged vanes as per site condition feasibility.”

Arupjyoti Saikia, a professor of history at IIT Guwahati who is researching on the environmental biography of the Brahmaputra, blames the lack of a competent techno-bureaucracy and social capital required for such a massive river engineering and ignorance about the river. For effective management of the river, he makes a case for making the flood plains a part of human actions through “extraordinary care and tenderness” and an evaluation of the embankment strategy that has been followed for the past several decades.

Besides dredging, the Assam government has also decided to expedite the projects that will link Majuli by bridge with both the banks of the Brahmaputra as a means to reduce the speed of the water that hits the banks of the river island. After completing of the schemes, the island will be connected to Lakhimpur and Jorhat.

The government has also firmed up plans to form an expert committee to be sent to China to study the management strategies of the Yellow River (Hwang Ho) and whether they could be replicated in the Brahmaputra for taming floods and erosion. The study, which will be conducted in association with the World Bank, will prepare a road map and take into account all details related to river engineering, basin characteristics, hydrology, channel morphology and floodplain evolution.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday, conducted an aerial survey of four districts after the water level in Ganga river swelled following heavy downpour in the past few days.

A state Disaster Management Department release said in view of threats of flood following the rise in the water level of Ganga, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday, conducted an aerial survey of Patna, Nalanda, Jehanabad and Gaya districts and was also scheduled to hold a review meeting with officials at Gaya.

Rains in the past few days have raised the water level of Ganga threatening inundation of areas close to the mighty river.

The floods have almost totally receded and almost all 2.25 lakh people who had taken shelter in relief camps since July — barring 60 in Jorhat — have returned home and begun repairing their houses. But Biren Das, Himeswari Das, Robison Das, Bhakatram Das and Madan Das of Samaguri village of Majuli, the island on the Brahmaputra, saw their homesteads disappear into the river Friday.

Since the floods, Majuli has been facing fresh erosion. At least 19 families of Samaguri village have lost all their land. Unless it can be checked, the erosion is set to affect over 80 more families in addition to three primary schools and a high school.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who incidentally represents Majuli in the assembly, asked the water resources department and the Brahmaputra Board Saturday to send a team of senior officers to Majuli, make an assessment of erosion and come up with an action plan in the next ten days. “Now that the floods have receded, the water resources department and Brahmaputra Board must immediately identify all erosion-prone areas and take immediate steps before a long-term plan is taken up,” Sonowal said.

Majuli, one of the worst erosion-affected places in Assam, has seen its area shrink from 1,256 sq km in 1891 to 421 sq km today.

About 450 km away, the Aie river that comes down from Bhutan changed course four weeks ago, in the process taking away the entire Chota Nilibari village and about half of Dababeel in Sidli constituency, rendering at least five families homeless. Mahesh Basumatary lost 14 bighas with 700 betelnut trees and 40 mango and jackfruit trees apart from his house.

The authorities, under the leadership of Sidli MLA Chandan Brahma, have managed to divert the river temporarily by engaging half-a-dozen excavators and bulldozers for about a week. Landless people are still out in a relief camp about 4 km from the village that has disappeared.

Since 1954, erosion caused by the Brahmaputra and its tributaries has destroyed and removed more than 4,270 sq km productive farmland, leaving over 50,000 families landless and homeless. This would be about 7.5 per cent of the state’s area. The Brahmaputra has at places swollen to more than 15 km wide.

Experts from the water resources department, Brahmaputra Board, IIT Guwahati, Asian Development Bank and World Bank took part in a two-day brainstorming session in Guwahati recently but could not come up with any concrete solution. While some experts suggested “alternative technologies” and structural and non-structural measures in optimal combination, others called for building stable river-banks by using appropriate technology like porcupine screens and corrective dredging of the river.

Till then, people living along the river-banks will continue to live an uncertain life.","Tue, 23 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/majuli-assam-480.jpg,"['majuli', 'water', 'brahmaputra', 'families', 'problem', 'erosion', 'floods', 'assam', 'das', 'sq', 'river', 'grapples', 'km', 'familiar', 'village']", ,flood
58,58,FL-2016-000094-IND,Popular Front of India involved in antinational activities: Police - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/popular-front-of-india-involved-in-antinational-activities-police/articleshow/53480305.cms,"

Patna: The Bihar police have now received reports from field officers that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Students Democratic Party of India (SDPI) are involved in fuelling antinational activities in the state.

The Special branch of Bihar police have now names of at least five persons working with these two groups, who are covertly receiving hawala money to carry out their activities and rope in youths to spread their support base.

The Special branch have lately sprung into action to gather intelligence from several districts of the state where the supporters of these two groups were living.

The spreading tentacles of PFI and SDPI came to light only when a procession was taken out on July 15 in the state capital to extend support to televangelist Zakir Naik and MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi by at least 50 youths in which pro-Pakistan slogan was allegedly raised by one Mohammad Tausif Ahmed (28) and a few others. Tausif, a native of Makya village under Benipatti police station in Madhubani district, is presently lodged in Beur jail.

Police have also traced transaction of hawala money into the bank account of Tausif, which is being investigated.

""We had no idea when these groups entered Bihar and got involved in antinational activities,"" said a top official of Bihar police.""We have names and photographs of at least five persons, who are the main figures of these groups in the state. Among them is one Usman Gani from Katihar , who is the head of PFI in Bihar. We are tracing all of them,"" the officer said.

He added that in Kerala, National Investigation Agency (NIA) had conducted raids at their (PFI and SDPI offices) for conducting arms training camp on the pretext of health and yoga camp. On January 29, 2014, the NIA had arrested four SDPI supporters, who had brutally murdered two CPM members in Kerala.

Meanwhile, an Intelligence Bureau officer said SDPI was the brainchild behind Patna's rally and it is the political front of PFI. ""SDPI leaders are involved in delivering hates speeches in state,"" he added.

IG (Patna zone) Naiyar Husnain Khan is yet to review the matter. ""Most likely, I would review the matter on Monday and take a decision on if police requires taking Tausif on remand,"" the IG said and added he hasn't yet received any input from the Special branch on PFI and SDPI.

He also said police are yet to trace the whereabouts of at least four people who participated in the July 15 Patna procession, but went missing after that.

59,59,FL-2016-000094-IND,Ganga sets new record of water level at 50.52m - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/ganga-sets-new-record-of-water-level-at-50-52m/articleshow/53801092.cms,"Patna: The Ganga on Sunday morning set up a new record of flood level with water rising up to 50.52 metres at 5am at Gandhi Ghat in Patna, affecting around two lakh people living alongside the river bank.

This new level shatters the 22-year-old record of the highest flood level of 50.27 metres recorded on August 14, 1994.

Central Water Commission (CWC) engineers monitoring the water flow of the river in Patna said the water discharge recorded at Gandhi Ghat on Sunday at 5am was 92,900 cusecs, much higher than the 81,838 cusecs recorded on August 14, 1994.

“The Ganga broke the 1994 record at 6pm on Saturday with water level recorded at 50.28 metres and rising till 5am on Sunday,” said a CWC engineer, adding the water level started decreasing from 11am at the rate of four cms per hour. At 1pm on Sunday, the level was recorded at 50.40 metres. At this level, the river was still flowing 1.8 metres above the danger mark.

However, the river was rising at Allahabad at the rate of four cms per hour at 7am on Sunday, which could have implications for the Ganga’s level in Patna at a later stage.

CWC sources said the Ganga had crossed the danger level of 48.60 metres at 11am on August 11 after which all drainage outlets of the city were shut down to prevent flood water entering the town.

According to CWC records, the Ganga started swelling from 6pm on August 8 and reached the level of 49.53 metres at 11am on August 15, but after that the level started decreasing and reached 49.29 metres at 7pm on August 17.

60,60,FL-2016-000094-IND,Modern India Can Learn a Lot from These 20 Traditional Water Conservation Systems - The Better India,https://www.thebetterindia.com/61757/traditional-water-conservation-systems-india/,"We all know water is essential, but too many of us think it’s unlimited. In reality, fresh water is a finite resource that is rapidly becoming scarce. In India, a warming climate is drying up lakes and rivers, while rapid urbanisation and water pollution are putting enormous pressure on the quantity and quality of surface and ground water. The country’s fragile agricultural system still depends primarily on rainfall and a bad monsoon season can wreck havoc on the national economy.

Water conservation is a key element of any strategy that aims to alleviate the water scarcity crisis in India. With rainfall patterns changing almost every year, the Indian government has started looking at means to revive the traditional systems of water harvesting in the country. Given that these methods are simple and eco-friendly for the most part, they are not just highly effective for the people who rely on them but they are also good for the environment.

History tells us that both floods and droughts were regular occurrence in ancient India. Perhaps this is why every region in the country has its own traditional water harvesting techniques that reflect the geographical peculiarities and cultural uniqueness of the regions. The basic concept underlying all these techniques is that rain should be harvested whenever and wherever it falls.

Archaeological evidence shows that the practice of water conservation is deep rooted in the science of ancient India. Excavations show that the cities of the Indus Valley Civilisation had excellent systems of water harvesting and drainage. The settlement of Dholavira, laid out on a slope between two storm water channels, is a great example of water engineering. Chanakya’s Arthashashtra mentions irrigation using water harvesting systems. Sringaverapura, near Allahabad, had a sophisticated water harvesting system that used the natural slope of the land to store the floodwaters of the river Ganga. Chola King Karikala built the Grand Anicut or Kallanai across the river Cauvery to divert water for irrigation (it is still functional) while King Bhoja of Bhopal built the largest artificial lake in India.

Drawing upon centuries of experience, Indians continued to build structures to catch, hold and store monsoon rainwater for the dry seasons to come. These traditional techniques, though less popular today, are still in use and efficient. Here is a brief account of the unique water conservation systems prevalent in India and the communities who have practised them for decades before the debate on climate change even existed.

1. Jhalara

Jhalaras are typically rectangular-shaped stepwells that have tiered steps on three or four sides. These stepwells collect the subterranean seepage of an upstream reservoir or a lake. Jhalaras were built to ensure easy and regular supply of water for religious rites, royal ceremonies and community use. The city of Jodhpur has eight jhalaras, the oldest being the Mahamandir Jhalara that dates back to 1660 AD.

2. Talab /Bandhi

Talabs are reservoirs that store water for household consumption and drinking purposes. They may be natural, such as the pokhariyan ponds at Tikamgarh in the Bundelkhand region or man made, such as the lakes of Udaipur. A reservoir with an area less than five bighas is called a talai, a medium sized lake is called a bandhi and bigger lakes are called sagar or samand.

3. Bawari

Bawaris are unique stepwells that were once a part of the ancient networks of water storage in the cities of Rajasthan. The little rain that the region received would be diverted to man-made tanks through canals built on the hilly outskirts of cities. The water would then percolate into the ground, raising the water table and recharging a deep and intricate network of aquifers. To minimise water loss through evaporation, a series of layered steps were built around the reservoirs to narrow and deepen the wells.

4. Taanka

Taanka is a traditional rainwater harvesting technique indigenous to the Thar desert region of Rajasthan. A Taanka is a cylindrical paved underground pit into which rainwater from rooftops, courtyards or artificially prepared catchments flows. Once completely filled, the water stored in a taanka can last throughout the dry season and is sufficient for a family of 5-6 members. An important element of water security in these arid regions, taankas can save families from the everyday drudgery of fetching water from distant sources.

5. Ahar Pynes

Ahar Pynes are traditional floodwater harvesting systems indigenous to South Bihar. Ahars are reservoirs with embankments on three sides that are built at the end of diversion channels like pynes. Pynes are artificial rivulets led off from rivers to collect water in the ahars for irrigation in the dry months. Paddy cultivation in this relatively low rainfall area depends mostly on ahar pynes.

6. Johads

Johads, one of the oldest systems used to conserve and recharge ground water, are small earthen check dams that capture and store rainwater. Constructed in an area with naturally high elevation on three sides, a storage pit is made by excavating the area, and excavated soil is used to create a wall on the fourth side. Sometimes, several johads are interconnected through deep channels, with a single outlet opening into a river or stream nearby. This prevents structural damage to the water pits that are also called madakas in Karnataka and pemghara in Odisha.

7. Panam Keni

The Kuruma tribe (a native tribe of Wayanad) uses a special type of well, called the panam keni, to store water. Wooden cylinders are made by soaking the stems of toddy palms in water for a long time so that the core rots away until only the hard outer layer remains. These cylinders, four feet in diameter as well as depth, are then immersed in groundwater springs located in fields and forests. This is the secret behind how these wells have abundant water even in the hottest summer months.

8. Khadin

Khadins are ingenious constructions designed to harvest surface runoff water for agriculture. The main feature of a khadin, also called dhora, is a long earthen embankment that is built across the hill slopes of gravelly uplands. Sluices and spillways allow the excess water to drain off and the water-saturated land is then used for crop production. First designed by the Paliwal Brahmins of Jaisalmer in the 15th century, this system is very similar to the irrigation methods of the people of ancient Ur (present Iraq).

9. Kund

A kund is a saucer-shaped catchment area that gently slope towards the central circular underground well. Its main purpose is to harvest rainwater for drinking. Kunds dot the sandier tracts of western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Traditionally, these well-pits were covered in disinfectant lime and ash, though many modern kunds have been constructed simply with cement. Raja Sur Singh is said to have built the earliest known kunds in the village of Vadi Ka Melan in the year 1607 AD.

10. Baoli

Promotion

Built by the nobility for civic, strategic or philanthropic reasons, baolis were secular structures from which everyone could draw water. These beautiful stepwells typically have beautiful arches, carved motifs and sometimes, rooms on their sides. The locations of baolis often suggest the way in which they were used. Baolis within villages were mainly used for utilitarian purposes and social gatherings. Baolis on trade routes were often frequented as resting places. Stepwells used exclusively for agriculture had drainage systems that channelled water into the fields.

11. Nadi

Found near Jodhpur in Rajasthan, nadis are village ponds that store rainwater collected from adjoining natural catchment areas. The location of a nadi has a strong bearing on its storage capacity and hence the site of a nadi is chosen after careful deliberation of its catchment and runoff characteristics. Since nadis received their water supply from erratic, torrential rainfall, large amounts of sandy sediments were regularly deposited in them, resulting in quick siltation. A local voluntary organisation, the Mewar Krishak Vikas Samiti (MKVS) has been adding systems like spillways and silt traps to old nadis and promoting afforestation of their drainage basin to prevent siltation.

12. Bhandara Phad

Phad, a community-managed irrigation system, probably came into existence a few centuries ago. The system starts with a bhandhara (check dam) built across a river, from which kalvas (canals) branch out to carry water into the fields in the phad (agricultural block). Sandams (escapes outlets) ensure that the excess water is removed from the canals by charis (distributaries) and sarangs (field channels). The Phad system is operated on three rivers in the Tapi basin – Panjhra, Mosam and Aram – in the Dhule and Nasik districts of Maharashtra.

13. Zing

Zings, found in Ladakh, are small tanks that collect melting glacier water. A network of guiding channels brings water from the glacier to the tank. A trickle in the morning, the melting waters of the glacier turn into a flowing stream by the afternoon. The water, collected by evening, is used in the fields on the following day. A water official called a Chirpun is responsible for the equitable distribution of water in this dry region that relies on melting glacial water to meet its farming needs.

14. Kuhls

Kuhls are surface water channels found in the mountainous regions of Himachal Pradesh. The channels carry glacial waters from rivers and streams into the fields. The Kangra Valley system has an estimated 715 major kuhls and 2,500 minor kuhls that irrigate more than 30,000 hectares in the valley. An important cultural tradition, the kuhls were built either through public donations or by royal rulers. A kohli would be designated as the master of the kuhl and he would be responsible for the maintenance of the kuhl.

15. Zabo

The Zabo (meaning ‘impounding run-off’) system combines water conservation with forestry, agriculture and animal care. Practised in Nagaland, Zabo is also known as the Ruza system. Rainwater that falls on forested hilltops is collected by channels that deposit the run-off water in pond-like structures created on the terraced hillsides. The channels also pass through cattle yards, collecting the dung and urine of animals, before ultimately meandering into paddy fields at the foot of the hill. Ponds created in the paddy field are then used to rear fish and foster the growth of medicinal plants.

16. Bamboo Drip Irrigation

Bamboo Drip irrigation System is an ingenious system of efficient water management that has been practised for over two centuries in northeast India. The tribal farmers of the region have developed a system for irrigation in which water from perennial springs is diverted to the terrace fields using varying sizes and shapes of bamboo pipes. Best suited for crops requiring less water, the system ensures that small drops of water are delivered directly to the roots of the plants. This ancient system is used by the farmers of Khasi and Jaintia hills to drip-irrigate their black pepper cultivation.

17. Jackwells

The Shompen tribe of the Great Nicobar Islands lives in a region of rugged topography that they make full use of to harvest water. In this system, the low-lying region of the island is covered with jackwells (pits encircled by bunds made from logs of hard wood). A full-length bamboo is cut longitudinally and placed on a gentle slope with the lower end leading the water into the jackwell. Often, these split bamboos are placed under trees to collect the runoff water from leaves. Big jackwells are interconnected with more bamboos so that the overflow from one jackwell leads to the other, ultimately leading to the biggest jackwell.

18. Ramtek Model

The Ramtek model has been named after the water harvesting structures in the town of Ramtek in Maharashtra. An intricate network of groundwater and surface water bodies, this system was constructed and maintained mostly by the malguzars (landowners) of the region. In this system, tanks connected by underground and surface canals form a chain that extends from the foothills to the plains. Once tanks located in the hills are filled to capacity, the water flows down to fill successive tanks, generally ending in a small waterhole. This system conserves about 60 to 70 % of the total runoff in the region!

19. Pat System

The Pat system, in which the peculiarities of the terrain are used to divert water from hill streams into irrigation channels, was developed in the Bhitada village in Jhabua district of Madhya Pradesh. Diversion bunds are made across a stream near the village by piling up stones and then lining them with teak leaves and mud to make them leak-proof. The Pat channel then passes through deep ditches and stone aqueducts that are skilfully cut info stone cliffs to create an irrigation system that the villagers use in turn.

20. Eri

The Eri (tank) system of Tamil Nadu is one of the oldest water management systems in India. Still widely used in the state, eris act as flood-control systems, prevent soil erosion and wastage of runoff during periods of heavy rainfall, and also recharge the groundwater. Eris can either be a system eri, which is fed by channels that divert river water, or a non-system eri, that is fed solely by rain. The tanks are interconnected in order to enable access to the farthest village and to balance the water level in case of excess supply. The eri system enables the complete use of river water for irrigation and without them, paddy cultivation would have been impossible in Tamil Nadu.

There are several other hyperlocal versions of the traditional method of tank irrigation in India. From keres in Central Karnataka and cheruvus in Andhra Pradesh to dongs in Assam, tanks are among the most common traditional irrigation systems in our country.

These ecologically safe traditional systems are viable and cost-effective alternatives to rejuvenate India’s depleted water resources. Productively combining these structures with modern rainwater-saving techniques, such as percolation tanks, injection wells and subsurface barriers, could be the answer to India’s perennial water woes.

62,62,FL-2016-000094-IND,Well done: how a rhino calf was saved from flood-ravaged Kaziranga - Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/environment-news/well-done-how-a-rhino-calf-was-saved-from-flood-ravaged-kaziranga-1469806503.html,"The animal nursery at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation near Kaziranga National Park in Assam is witnessing something unprecedented. In the last four days, eight rhino calves, rescued from the rampaging floods, have been admitted to the nursery, where five elephant calves were being hand-raised at one-of-its-kind wildlife rehabilitation centre. The young pachyderms have now been shifted to an outdoor stockade, where a makeshift shelter is being built for them.

Run by the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Wildlife Trust of India, CWRC has, for the last 14 years, been engaged in stabilising displaced wild animals and releasing them back into the wild. The rhino calves would also be hand-raised until they are fit to survive in the wild.

With 90% of its area inundated, Kaziranga is witnessing one of the worst floods in the last decade. Brahmaputra has wrecked havoc in this pristine ecological hotspot, which is home to Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian Elephant, Great One-horned Rhino, Eastern Swamp Deer and several other species.

Floods, an annual occurrence in Assam, force animals to move towards the higher ground of Karbi Anglong Hills and adjoining areas for safety. While the adults can brave the rising waters, the vulnerable young ones often end up abandoned to face the mighty Brahmaputra\'s wrath.

On 27 July 2016, a villager from Diphalu Pathar, Navgaon, spotted a rhino calf desperately trying to reach higher ground. With its mother nowhere in sight, he alerted Pramod Gogoi, chief general secretary of the Kaziranga Natural Environment Education and Cultural Association, and fellow villagers.

Immediately, they laid out a plan to rescue the calf with the help of boats used by local people during the annual floods that inundate most parts of Kaziranga. The villagers dragged the calf to safety and tied it outside a house that had not been fully submerged. They then rang up the deputy forest officer, who in turn alerted the CWRC, which specialises in rescue and rehab of wild animals in distress. A CWRC team reached the spot only to find the entire village inundated, making it almost impossible to rescue the calf. After desperate deliberations, two boats were lashed together; the sedated calf was put in one while the team sat in the other to balance the weight.

According to Dr Shamshul Ali, the CWRC veterinarian, who was hurt during the rescue operation, the ride was choppy but they managed to get the animal to a vehicle.

At the CWRC, a team of veterinarians and animal keepers examined the calf and found it to be a six-month male under severe distress. It was administered medicines and milk formula. The same day, three other rhino calves were rescued from Kaziranga and shifted to CWRC. All four calves are together now and are responding well to treatment.","Sat, 30 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2016/07/29/kaziranga-homepagerhino-rescue-19_25745_730x419.jpg,"['team', 'floodravaged', 'wildlife', 'calves', 'saved', 'kaziranga', 'cwrc', 'rescue', 'calf', 'rhino', 'animal', 'wild']", ,flood

64,64,FL-2016-000094-IND,"Why Not Chief Ministers' Names Also For Schemes, Asks Nitish Kumar - NDTV",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-suggests-credit-share-if-states-pay-for-pms-schemes-1440420,"When states pay a share, scheme could include chief minister's name too, says Nitish Kumar.

Why would states pay a share for schemes named after the Prime Minister? Bihar chief minister NItish Kumar suggested a solution to his own aggressive question that has put several central schemes in the state on freeze.If a state is making part payment for such a scheme, Mr Kumar suggested, it could be named after both Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of the state concerned.The division of payment for centrally sponsored schemes has long been a source of friction between the centre and the states. But while many governments - usually a non-NDA party -- has claimed credit for such schemes, Mr Kumar, an arch-rival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has questioned why states will have to pay for schemes named after the Prime Minister.Today's suggestion came when Mr Kumar was responding to a question on why the Prime Minister's Crop Insurance Scheme was not being implemented in Bihar.Although the centre has extended the deadline till August 10, Bihar has stuck to its refusal to endorse the scheme and pay the insurance agencies mandated by central government for the purpose.The Chief Minister said the premium rate of 14 .5 per cent is too high, as it will cost the state's exchequer a whopping Rs 650 crore. He has further insisted that for any scheme named after the Prime Minister, the centre should bear all the expenses.Earlier, the Bihar government wrote to Union agriculture ministry, pointing out that several states - including neighbouring Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh -- the premium is low. The ministry, however, clarified that due to huge tracts of agricultural land being flood-prone in Bihar the premium has gone up.In some BJP-ruled states like Maharashtra and Gujarat, the premium is equally high, the ministry has further pointed out.Mr Kumar, whose demand for special status for his state has been turned down, has asked for a change in Centre's funding pattern. Last year, ahead of the crucial assembly elections in Bihar, he had alleged that the state received far less funds from the Centre than it should following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations.","Fri, 05 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2016-07/nitish-kumar_650x400_81468838264.jpg,"['asks', 'states', 'ministers', 'state', 'schemes', 'names', 'scheme', 'nitish', 'bihar', 'chief', 'premium', 'minister', 'pay', 'prime', 'kumar']", ,none
65,65,FL-2016-000094-IND,NGO deluged with query 'How can I sell my kidney?' - Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ngo-deluged-with-query-how-can-i-sell-my-kidney/articleshow/53835682.cms,"MUMBAI: How can I sell my kidney ? This question has been posed so often to Mohan Foundation, an NGO that works towards creating awareness about cadaveric donation of organs since 1997, that it has an official dedicated to tackle this “menace”.

“Be it our Facebook page, our email or toll free numbers, quite a few people ask about selling their kidney,” said Mohan Foundation’s Dr Sunil Shroff. “One person has to actively delete this question posted regularly on our social sites,” he said. Shroff believes that Indians joke so often about “having to sell their kidney” to buy some things that they actually believe it is a commodity to be sold.

“It is sad that people don’t seem to realise selling kidneys or any organ is illegal,” he said. Few seem to know that the government amended the Transplant of Human Organs Act (THOA) in 2014 to punish anyone selling or buying organs with a fine of up to Rs 1 crore and imprisonment of up to 10 years. A simple internet search throws up hundreds of such queries from people. On one site, a person posted, “I am pratap from India. passport holder. I selling my kidney AB+, 50 years, male, no smoking, no drinking needed person can cal 919********* (stet)”. The message had three responses.

People quote “financial need” for seeking sums ranging from Rs 9 lakh to Rs 45 lakh for their kidney. There also is widespread poverty that forces people like Anand resident Shobha Thakur to agree to sell their kidneys.

The LH Hiranandani Hospital case in Mumbai, in which five doctors and nine others were arrested since July 14, has set a record. “It is for the first time in India that a recipient and donor were arrested apart from middlemen and doctors,” said Shroff. Thakur continues to languish in prison despite getting conditional bail because no one has come forward to pay her bail sum.

As per the 2014 amendment, the recipient-donor pair has to sign forms 1A, 1B or 1C depending on their relationship. “The donor and the recipient thus sign a legal document stating their relationship and give an undertaking. If this is false, they can both be behind bars,” he said. The amendment was brought about to protect the medical fraternity and take away the complete onus from them of establishing relationship between the two.

In fact, the state health department’s inquiry committee that looked into the Hiranandani case found that even doctors and administrators were not well versed with THOA. “How can hospitals not have a copy of the law?

Patna: Bihar's Mithila paintings recently got recognition in a US art show. ""Dheeya"" (girl child), a painting by Madhubani-born young artist Nupur Nishith, won Certificate of Recognition at the nationwide juried art show, COLOR, organised by Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition in New York. The show that began on July 23 will continue till August 14.

This painting shows a girl child with all the divinity and grace peeping from the womb, ready to be welcomed in the world.

Red colour symbolizes warning on one hand while festivity on the other. On one hand, she is expecting a colourful and exciting world as a future with festivities and happiness while on the other, there is a warning that she might not be welcomed.

""Proud to share that my painting 'Dheeya' won Certificate of Recognition at juried show. I got a chance to meet some really talented artists from various parts of the country. Feels great to see my art inspired from the folk art of a small region in a faraway country getting recognition in US,"" Nupur told TOI.

The juror for the show is Lilian Tone, assistant curator at The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), New York, Nupur said, adding that they had asked for an open call for all artists across United States to submit paintings based on the theme colour. Around 1,780 entries were submitted, out of which 105 entries were selected for the main exhibition. On the opening day, the top 13 entries were announced and 10 got Certificate of Recognition, including Nupur's art.

Since moving to US in 2011, Nupur has worked to evolve the art form with new avenues and various bases such as paper, cloth, wood, ceramic, terracotta, glass and everyday products apart from the traditional paintings on walls and floors.

Her interest in technology helped her take the art form to digital route in a way that the paintings can be printed in various modes for widespread reach. ""My digital paintings have featured in an award winning film,"" she said.

""Since I moved to New York, it was a challenge to bring an ancient Mithila art form in the world driven by modern abstract art. People would appreciate the details and colours of traditional art, but could not relate much to the mythological themes,"" she said.

The accident occurred when the conveyor-belt of CHP developed a snag during late night maintenance work and moved reversed leading to huge piles of coal falling on the workers, NTPC sources said on Tuesday.

The deceased have been identified as Dilip Kumar Gupta, 32, a resident of Lagma village in Kahalgaon sub-division, and 22-year-old Rajiv Bhowmik, a resident of Midnapur in West Bengal. Both the workers were on the payroll of Chanda Construction Company. KhSTPP sources said they are initiating a probe into the incident.

General manager (operations and maintenance) T Gopal Krishna of KhSTPP while confirming the incident said, “The deceased workers kin would be given compensation as per statutory provisions. We will probe into the incident and also seek explanation from the outsourced company which was awarded the contract for maintenance work,” he added.

According to sources, workers might have fallen asleep on the conveyor belt late night . A proper probe would also be able to find the exact cause of the accident said the source apprehending it could be due to lack of attention in the maintenance works undertaken by the contractors.

NTPC police station SHO Manoj Kumar at Kahalgaon said that a probe has been initiated and an FIR would be lodged against the outsourced Chanda Construction Company after their negligence is established. The outsourced company officials have announced to provide a compensation of Rs 5lakh to the kin of the deceased families, said the SHO adding, “The bodies have been sent for postmortem at JNMCH.”

Searches continued for other missing persons three days after the Mahad-Poladpur bridge on the Mumbai-Goa Highway was washed away following heavy rains in the Mahabaleshwar area.





vis on Thursday night had said that 42 persons were involved in the accident, including 26 persons travelling in two state transport buses and rest in cars and SUVs. Till Thursday evening, 13 bodies were recovered. On Friday, joint teams of the Indian Navy and NDRF recovered nine more bodies.



Because of strong winds, the helicopter operations were not conducted, but rescuers continued to search the area on river rafts and gemini boats. They also used magnets and grapnels to lift metal pieces.



Meanwhile, some vehicle remains were found which appeared to be that of a SUV and a small mangled piece that could be of a bus.



However, officials refused to confirm whether it is of the ill-fated vehicles that they were looking at.

The search and rescue operation would continue on Saturday, officials said, adding that they would widen the circle of search once again. The fishermen community also joined the operation and put up nets along some of the bridges on the river so that bodies do not get carried towards the Arabian Sea.

75,75,FL-2016-000094-IND,New Planet Thought to Exist Around Sun's Closest Star - The Wire,https://science.thewire.in/spaceflight/proxima-centauri-habitable-exoplanet/,"The planet’s existence hasn’t been confirmed yet – but if it exists, the Pale Blue Dot could be joined by a Pale Red Dot around the star Proxima Centauri as another home for life in the universe.

Astronomers say there could be a potentially habitable exoplanet close enough for us to explore with probes in the near future.

They reported in this week’s issue of the journal Nature that our closest stellar neighbour, Proxima Centauri, harbours a rocky planet that’s squarely in the star’s habitable zone. And at 4.3 light years away from Earth, not only is this the closest planet beyond the Solar System but it is also the closest potentially habitable planet. In the coming years, a lot of attention will be directed on this planet.

Its name is Proxima b. It is estimated to weigh at least 1.3-times as Earth does, and orbits its host star Proxima Centauri at a distance of 7.5 million km. That’s barely 5% of the distance between Earth and the Sun. However, Proxima Centauri is a ‘red dwarf’ star – it weighs a tenth as much as the Sun does and emits one-sixteen-thousandth as much light. From Proxima b, Proxima Centauri would be just as bright as our Sun would seem to be from Saturn. On the brighter side, this allows Proxima b to have temperatures on its surface suitable for liquid water to exist. This is a big deal because wherever we’ve found water on Earth, we’ve also found life.

This planet and its star are a part of the Alpha Centauri star system. The core of this system consists of two stars, Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B. These two orbit each other and form a binary star. The distance between them as they move in their orbits stretches out to as much as the distance between the Sun and Pluto. They are located nearly 4.4 lightyears away from us, and appear to be one star to the naked eye. Together, they are called Alpha Centauri AB. They’re hard to miss in the night sky, being the third brightest stellar object after Sirius and Canopus.

Proxima Centauri is the third star in this system. It is a red dwarf and orbits Alpha Centauri AB at a distance of 2.2 trillion km (0.24 light years). Its orbit around the binary star lasts between 100,000 and 500,000 years. It is not visible to the naked eye, but it is the star that comes closest to the Solar System in its orbit. Hence the ‘Proxima’ in its name.

Stars are named in a fixed format: the biggest central star is given a name and other stars in the system are designated by subsequent capitalised letters. Planets around these stars (called extrasolar, or exo-, planets) are indicated by lower case letters. Alpha Centauri B was once thought to have a planet around it and it was christened Alpha Centauri Bb. This theoretical planet turned out to be an error in calculations and never existed. But Proxima Centauri b most likely does.

Proxima Centauri (often simply called Proxima) is one of the most studied stars in the universe. We have paid especial attention to it since the early 1990s. The team that published the paper about the new planet belongs to a project called Pale Red Dot, which was formed with the express intent of discovering Earth-like planets around Proxima. The project is a collaboration between eight countries and over thirty astronomers and astrophysicists.

Guillem Anglada-Escudé, an astronomy lecturer at the Queen Mary University of London, and his team at Pale Red Dot studied Doppler data collected over sixteen years by two European Southern Observatory telescopes: the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph, in Chile. This includes 54 individual observations logged earlier this year.

Just as with the famous example of a siren passing by, the Doppler effect can be observed with light as well. As a star moves closer to us, there is more blue in its spectrum and it appears blue-shifted. As it moves away, its light emission shows more red and thus appears red-shifted. A star’s spectrum can show signs of this effect in the presence of a planet because even small bodies exert a small, non-negligible gravitational effect on large masses, especially if they are close by. This method of detecting exoplanets is called the radial velocity method.

To Anglada-Escudé & co., Proxima’s spectrum showed both blue-shifting and red-shifting in short, periodic bursts. This indicated that the star was being tugged a teeny bit by what could only be a rocky planet. Working backward, the team was able to deduce that a terrestrial planet orbited Proxima every 11.2 days at a distance of 7.5 million km.

The distance puts Proxima b within the star’s habitable zone. Scientists guess that the surface temperature would be approximately -40 ºC. However, this number is assuming there isn’t an atmosphere on the planet. “The presence of an atmosphere could warm the planet considerably, taking the temperatures to the range of -30 deg C to 30 deg C,” said Anglada-Escudé in a press conference on August 23. This is almost the average temperature on Earth’s surface.

If there is an atmosphere on the planet, the odds of there being life on its surface are hiked significantly, with clouds to regulate the temperature. Proxima b is also likely tidally locked with synchronous rotation to its star. This means that the same side of the planet always faces the star – getting baked by starlight and excess radiation – while the other side would be cold and dark. Given the planet’s distance from the star, the radiation would include a lot of X-rays and other high-energy radiation considered harmful to the sustenance of life. An atmosphere could save the day, though. Clouds would redistribute the heat throughout the planet and preserve an average temperature between both sides. The additional presence of a magnetic field would mean a definitive protection against radiation bursts from Proxima.

At the same time, we can’t be all that hopeful about a healthy atmosphere. It’s possible that Proxima b might have a really thin one or none at all. Its closeness to its host star would have had several effects on the planet. The most obvious of these concerns how hot the planet got when it formed. If Proxima b had actually formed closer to Proxima and then moved further away, it would’ve been subjected to intense heat. This in turn would’ve caused gas molecules to expand, thin out and escape the planet’s gravity. Another problem is the stellar wind – a stream of energetic particles emitted by a star, known to strip away atmospheres and do to planets what our Sun is thought to have done to Mars. It is possible that even today, the star’s winds, flares and radiation could be attacking Proxima b to leave only a frayed blanket of gases in their wake.

Astronomers hope for a thick, protective atmosphere because it would enable an active water cycle like the one on Earth. However, the fact that water could exist on the planet doesn’t necessarily imply that it does. The only way to deduce the presence (or absence) of water at the moment is to study the planet’s history and formation. “Where and when the planet formed offers large clues to whether it holds water, and if it does, how much,” said Pedro Armado from the Institute of Astrophysics, Andalusia, at the press conference. “If the planet formed at a considerable distance from Proxima and then migrated inwards, it would be full of water still. If it formed very close to the star, near where it is now, there probably wouldn’t be any water.”

It’s heartening that when our own planet formed, there was no water on it. It is commonly believed that water was brought to Earth by the asteroids peppering its surface during its early years; Proxima b could have availed the same treatment. Moreover, we can’t entirely rule out Alpha Centauri AB’s disrupting the stellar system, either, using its gravity to fling water-laden bodies toward Proxima b. “There is a non-zero probability of atmosphere – and therefore water – existing on the planet,” added Anglada-Escudé. So there’s a high chance the planet does indeed hold liquid water.

The Pale Red Dot team agrees that more research is needed before drawing any solid conclusions on the habitability of this new planet. It also thinks a detailed investigation of Proxima b is easier than of a system similar to our own Solar System because the planet is so much closer to its star. In the future, telescopes like the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, the ASH2 at San Pedro, Chile (used by Pale Red Dot), the SALT, South Africa, and Mission Centaur’s projected 2019 space telescope could make it easier for the planet to be observed for months at a time.

One important goal is to find the planet transiting its star – i.e., passing against the face of the star as viewed from Earth. This would offer compelling evidence of the planet’s existence. Finding Proxima b would also offer hope for affirming the existence of hundreds of thousands of habitable planets, since red dwarfs like Proxima Centauri make up over 80% of stars in the universe today. The Pale Red Dot team’s paper also mentions a possible, unconfirmed reading of a second planet around Proxima. If this were to be confirmed as well, the odds of finding habitable planets all around us would improve exponentially.

The Proxima b announcement could not have come at a more opportune time for the Breakthrough Starshot initiative – the $100 million research grant Russian billionaire Yuri Miller announced earlier this year under his Breakthrough portfolio. Starshot would have hundreds of tiny probes called nanocrafts fly to the Alpha Centauri system at a third of the speed of light in 20 years. Once there, they’d rapidly study the stars and any planets around them. It is the largest grant ever announced for research in space exploration and requires intensive research in multiple domains, as The Wire reported at the time of the announcement. Proxima b’s presence provides a great incentive for not just this project but also for competitive research and development in astrophysics, specifically in the fields of telescopes and interstellar travel.

In the coming decades, such and other missions to Proxima will start taking shape. And in the next couple centuries, robotic exploration of Proxima b may even become common and easy. “Proxima Centauri will exist for several hundreds or thousands of times longer than the Sun,” wore Artie Hatzes, director of the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory, Germany, in an article accompanying the announcement. “Any life on the planet could still be evolving long after our Sun has died.”

Skymet Weather Team

Since the onset of Monsoon, Bihar has not received much rainfall. In fact, June cannot be considered as a good month for the state in terms of rains. However, rain intensity is likely to pick up pace now.

Good rains are likely to commence over Bihar that is predicted to last for another 48 hours. Thereafter, rain intensity may reduce but on and off good showers will continue particularly over central region and foothills of Bihar.

Districts like Kishanganj, Araria, Purnea, Supaul, Madhubani, Sitamarhi, and Champaran are likely to witness moderate to heavy showers. The low-pressure area that was present around Gangetic West Bengal till yesterday is expected to move eastwards and give heavy rain over Bihar and Jharkhand during next 2 days.

During last 24 hours from 08:30 am on Sunday, rainfall observed by a few districts of Bihar are included in the table given below:

Heavy rains in Nepal and foothills of Bihar may also give rise to flood like situation in the northern districts of Bihar. Yet, a few districts of the state may suffer from water-logging conditions. At present, rain deficiency of Bihar is 30 percent and due to the prediction of good rains during next 4 to 5 days, the rain deficiency might curtail as well.

Pimpri Chinchwad: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has forwarded a proposal to the state irrigation department to conduct a reconduct a survey of the Pavana river in order to demarcate the for re-demarcating the blue flood line on the development plan.

The blue flood line indicates the highest point that a river water has reached over the where the waters of the highest floodwater had reached in the past 25 years. Senior civic officials say

As of now, there are restrictions on building constructions near the blue flood line. According to a section of real estate developers, Pimpri Chinchwad is the only city in the state where such a flood line still exists.

Besides Pavana river, Indrayani and Mula rivers also pass through Pimpri Chinchwad. However, many residential areas are affected due to the blue flood line of Pavana river.

Deputy director of the civic body's town planning department Prakash Thakur said, "" PCMC has given around Rs11 lakh to the irrigation department to reconduct the survey and of Pavana river for redraw the blue flood line.""

The ownership of the rivers in the state lies with the irrigation department.

Pavana river's flood line was not demarcated on the city's development plan (DP) therefore several houses have been constructed along its banks. So many people have constructed their houses along rivers andMoreover, several village gaothan areas and many slums are also located along the river.

After the revised development plan came into effect, which had blue flood line marked on the Pavana river, in 2012 the building permission department stopped giving consent for new constructions in the affected areas. This caused resentment among residents and developers alike.

A classic example is the case of Chinchwadgaon gaothan where the blue flood line reaches Chapekar chowk that is located nearly a kilometre away from Pavana river. In fact, there are several constructions that lie between Chapekar chowk and Pavana river. However, they cannot be redeveloped because of restrictions in place due to the blue flood line.

Corporator Shamim Pathan from Chinchwad said, ""No one has seen the river rise to the highest flood line in the past 100 years. The flood line has been demarcated improperly. I have been staying in Chinchwad since 1970 and I have never seen the entire Chinchwadgaon flood in so many years. Therefore, a proper study must be conducted before marking the flood line.""

Another corporator Prashant Shitole from Sangvi said there is no need to ban constructions entirely along the river. Constructions must be banned within a 30-meter-wide area on both sides of the river, he pointed out.

President of the Nagari Hakka Suraksha Samiti, Manav Kamble said, ""The flood line must be demarcated in such a manner that the rising water does not cause damage to the lives of the common man as well as his property. It should not be changed only due to the demand of the corporators, political leaders and other influential people.""

Vikas Patil, president of the Environment Conservation Association, added, ""The flood line restrictions must be strictly enforced by the PCMC. No new constructions must be allowed inside the flood line.""

In his ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio programme, the PM also talked about the initiatives taken by the Centre to help flood-hit states.

He spoke of India’s participation in the Rio Olympics, the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, his recent visit to South Africa, and the passage of a Bill by Parliament that will provide over Rs 40,000 crore to states to plant trees.

In his Mann ki Baat, Modi spoke about the initiatives taken by the Centre to help flood-hit states. Pictured: The flooded Thane Railway Station after heavy rains in Mumbai.

During the 35-minute broadcast, he spoke about the need to curb deaths during childbirth and said government hospitals will offer free checkups on the ninth of every month for pregnant women.

He urged gynaecologists who do not work in government hospitals to devote one day for this purpose.

PM Modi promised the government would do everything possible to help flood victims

Speaking about the floods that have hit parts of the country, Modi said: “Some time back, we were concerned about the drought, and now there are reports about floods. The state governments and the Centre are working closely, making all efforts to help the flood-affected people.”

A number of states, including Assam and Bihar, are reeling under floods, which have killed scores of people and caused widespread damage to property.

“India is going through many problems. We encounter problems everyday. Now, we will have to look for technological solutions,” Modi said.

Urging young people to pursue research to find technological solutions to such problems, Modi referred to the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) through which the government intends to create an ecosystem of innovation, experiment, and entrepreneurship - and generate jobs.

“If we have to prepare next generation innovators, we will have to connect our children with the AIM. That is why, the central government has taken the initiative of Atal Tinkering Labs,” he said.

He also said that under the Atal Incubation Centre programme, the government plans to earmark an amount of Rs 10 crore.

Speaking of the Rio Olympics, he asked people to start a campaign to encourage India’s participants.

Turning to the upcoming 70th Independence Day celebrations, Modi said the country should also celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Quit India Movement on August 8.

Modi, who will be addressing the nation from the historic Red Fort for the third time this Independence Day, has also invited suggestions from people for his speech.","Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/07/31/23/36C16EC500000578-0-image-a-9_1470003227400.jpg,"['urges', 'weekly', 'mann', 'problems', 'technological', 'states', 'ki', 'day', 'solutions', 'indians', 'spoke', 'help', 'modi', 'centre', 'taken', 'radio', 'tech']", ,none

According to the local Met department, due to a low pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, Ranchi and several other districts have received heavy to very heavy rainfall in the last 48 hours till Friday morning. The Met department said that similar conditions are likely to prevail over the next 24 hours.

In wake of the heavy rainfall in the state, the disaster management department has already issued an alert as in several districts a flood-like situation has been prevailing.

""Rainfall will be witnessed again August 22 onwards,"" the local Met office said, adding that due to the low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal rainfall is occurring in a wide sweep in Jharkhand, East Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Kerala.

In several districts including Latehar, Gumla and Chatra, major rivers were flowing above the danger mark. In Chatra alone three bridges were washed away, while heavy rainfall and strong winds have adversely impacted electricity supplies.

In Lohardaga, the main canal from the Nandini river was breached, damaging crops over thousands of acres.

In Ramgrah district, where the Maa Chinmastika Temple -- known for its tantrik style of architecture -- is situated, at least 70 shops have been washed away while water was flowing over the Chilka bridge due to which the road leading to the temple from Gola has been blocked.

The district administration has erected signboards at various locations cautioning the people to remain away from the water.

Even in the steel city of Jamshedpur, the water levels of Swarnarekha and Kharkahi rivers were flowing above the danger mark and due to opening of the gates of Vyangbil Dam of Odisha various colonies in the low lying areas including Bagbera, Kadma and Manngo were flooded.

In state capital Ranchi, several areas including Islam Nagar, Azad Basti, Nala Road, Madhukam and Krishnapuri were flooded, making life difficult for the people.

In case of any emergency, the state government has no option but to rely on the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams as Jharkhand still does not have a state disaster authority to look into such situations.

Initially 333 personnel had been provided training to be deployed in State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), which, officials say, is still to be constituted. At present 61 members of a NDRF team have been deployed in Deoghar, 43 in Garhwa and 39 in Ranchi.

A week ago, the floods in Chatra and Garhwa districts badly impacted life. The flood left many dead, several thousands displaced and cattle was washed away.

Officials said the villages of the border town were hit by flash floods as it submerged several villages on the intervening night of July 26-27 and an NDRF team was rushed from the nearest location at Varanasi on Tuesday night.

“The operation has ended now and the affected people have been brought to safer places,” National Disaster Response Force chief OP Singh told PTI.

A senior official said flash floods were caused due to release of large amount of water from Nepal leading to water levels rising dangerously in Banganga river up to 6-7 feet, which submerged several villages under Shoratgarh tehsil of the said district.

The flood waters entered houses in the areas of Jagdiva, Ghannore, Jharwa, Arri, Kepsewa, Dablawa, Charigawa, Dhanora and locals were marooned in no time, they said.

Forty-four flood rescue teams of the NDRF have been positioned in various flood prone areas of the country such as Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and West Bengal to assist state administrations in rescue and relief work.

BSP, CPI and NCP were facing the prospect of losing their national party status after their dismal performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The EC had served them notices in 2014 on the issue. With the latest amendment to the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, these three parties are assured of retaining their ‘national party status’ until after 2019.

Amending the Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968, the EC in an order issued on Monday said: “If a political party recognised as a state party or national party fails to fulfil the conditions at the next general election to the House of the People or...to the assembly of the state-...following the general election to the House/assembly concerned on the basis of which it got recognition, it shall continue to be treated as recognised state party or national party.”

The amended order further states, “If a recognised political party continues to be treated as recognised national party or state party after the next election to the House of the People or..to the legislative assembly of the state,...the question whether it shall further continue to be so recognised after any subsequent general election to the House of the People...or to the legislative assembly of the state concerned, shall be subject to the fulfilment by the party of the conditions specified in Paragraph-6A or 68 (of the Symbols order).”

TOI had on July 31 broken the EC’s plans to change the norms for recognition and de-recognition of a political party to allow for a review every 10 years or after two consecutive polls, which would directly benefit BSP, CPI and NCP.

EC brass feels it is but fair to review recognition of a party as national or state party on the basis of two consecutive polls, given the revolving door electoral politics in many states.

“Rather than reviewing recognition of a political party every five years, it is better to give them time covering the entire cycle of 10 years to adjust for anti-incumbency. If they fail to fulfil the criteria over two consecutive polls, a status downgrade would be in order,” said an EC official.

BSP can now go into UP polls due, next year, with its national status intact. Put simply, it can avail of privileges such as free airtime on state media for campaigning and exemption of travel expenditure of up to 40 VVIP campaigners from being billed to the candidate.

(Source: Google Maps) Teesta Barrage along Indo-Bhutan border. (Source: Google Maps)

North Bengal Development Minister in the West Bengal government, Rabindranath, Ghosh on Saturday said that the state government was pushing for the formation of an “Indo-Bhutan Joint River Commission” with the Centre to be able to address the issue of frequent flooding in the northern areas of the state. Bengal shares it northern border with Bhutan, and most of the Bhutan rivers flow through this region before entering Bangladesh. Speaking with The Indian Express, Ghosh said that initial estimates show that Bengal has incurred loss of at least Rs 1,000 crores in the recent floods.

India and Bangladesh have a Joint River Commission where issues pertaining to the Teesta and the Brahmaputra are discussed.

While the flood situation stabilized in the Dooars, excessive rainfall from last night has led to the overflowing of the Farakka Barrage in Malda district. After completing his meeting on mitigating measures for flooding in Siliguri on Friday, Ghosh rushed to Malda. “There is a 500 metre bandh near the Farakka which has broken due to excessive rainfall, which started at 8.30 pm last night. As many as 110 homes have been swept away,” said Ghosh adding that the residents had escaped and were being kept in relief camps at Binnagar. A BDO has been kept on standby near the area. The incident took place approximately two kilometers from the Farakka barrage.

“We have been pushing for the river commission. We had appraised our Chief Minister of the matter before her visit to Bhutan and she had raised it with the officials there. The problem is that we neighbor Nepal, Bihar and Bhutan. And whenever there is flooding there, they let out the excess water to Bengal. And the seven districts in North Bengal, as in this year as well, are always the worst hit. Bhutan is especially a problem. There are 72 rivers in Bhutan that flow through these seven districts before entering Bangladesh. And they don’t really have a system of dams or bandhs by which to control excess water,” said the Minister.

Ghosh added that broke in Budhin area of Bhutan has led to fresh flooding in North Bengal. Irrigation Minister Rajib Bannerjee has reiterated Ghosh’s demand for a river commission between the two countries at Friday’s meeting in Siliguri.

Last year the matter had been taken up with the Union Minister for Water Resources but the Bengal Ministers say that no headway has been made on the matter. The Bengal government plans to pitch proposals for the construction of barrages and water reservoirs in Bhutan and in some places in north Bengal to regulate the flow of water. Deposition of dolomite dust and pebbles, boulders and trees flowing down from Bhutan in Bengal’s river beds is another issue that needs to be taken up, said officials in the government. Bhutan carries out Dolomite mining near its rivers. Because of the deposition from the Bhutan rovers, the riverbeds in Bengal become higher and banks are breached often, creating flood like situations. Dolomite deposit further reduces the fertility of the land and therefore large tracts of land in north Bengal, which is a prime tea growing area in the country, become non-cultivable.

The Jaldhaka, Diana, Kaljani, Torsha, Leesh, Geesh and Raidak are some of the major rivers from Bhutan that flow through Bengal.

Saying that at least 66,000 people in Bengal have been affected by the floods this year, Ghosh added that the state government was constructing temporary barrages in most rivers. “Some rivers are so large that it is not possible to construct the temporary barrages under such circumstances. But we hope that the barrages being constructed will help control and mitigate the flooding,” he told The Indian Express.

Ghosh said that at least 100 tea gardens across North Bengal have been inundated. “But it’ll be at least a week before we have initial estimates as to the losses from the tea gardens. The Rs 1000 crore loss estimate is based on the infrastructure destroyed in this year floods. Bridges across North Begal have been swept away and crops have been ruined,” he said.","Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/07/teesta-barrage-480.jpg,"['mitigate', 'water', 'bhutan', 'wants', 'west', 'flooding', 'commission', 'rivers', 'bengal', 'indobhutan', 'help', 'floods', 'north', 'flow', 'set', 'minister', 'ghosh', 'river']", ,none
88,88,FL-2016-000094-IND,Last of the rickshaws - Christian Science Monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Full-Frame/2016/0711/Last-of-the-rickshaws,"After encountering hand-pulled rickshaws as a child, Ahmer Khan, a photographer based in Kashmir, never expected to photograph this dying mode of transportation in India. I asked him about access and his interactions with the rickshaw pullers in Kolkata.

Ahmer Khan Mohammad Sajad has been a rickshaw puller in Kolkata for half a century. He moved here from Bihar, one of India’s poorest states, as a young man. He says he’s proud that he was able to get his daughter married, thanks to his rickshaw job. In order to afford to send money back to his family, which is still living in Bihar, he is homeless and sleeps on a footpath.

Ann Hermes: What initially drew you to this story and how did you go about gaining access?

Ahmer Khan: When I was a kid, I have lived in Kolkata for a brief period and I remember going on to these rickshaws. That time I never knew that I would be a photographer and one day I’ll do a story on them. For the past few years, I have traveled to Kolkata several times and I saw them again and again. I did a little research on them through my friends in Kolkata and later on the Internet and I found more info and interested me a lot. Regarding access I met my friends in Kolkata and they gave me addresses where these rickshaws are mostly found. Initially, it was difficult to talk to them because they thought I was a government official who wants to seize their rickshaws or something but slowly when I told them I’m just a photographer and have nothing to do. Also, as I speak Hindi so it was easy to communicate with them. But it took a lot of time.

Ahmer Khan Most rickshaw pullers live in a ‘dera,' a rickshaw garage. The drivers are mostly poor migrants who rent their rickshaws from ‘dera’ owners. Remarkably, for India, Hindu and Muslim pullers often share the same quarters.

Hermes: It’s interesting that out of necessity Hindu and Muslim pullers share living space despite religious tension throughout India. Can you tell me more about what you saw in the ‘Deras’?

Khan: It’s a complete necessity for both the religious groups. But mainly in Kolkata, there aren't many religious tensions though it exists throughout India. At Dera’s both Hindus and Muslims live together though at most of the Dera’s they cook separately and at some of the dear’s they have divided the sleeping space. They live in harmony, though. In some Dera’s they watch movies together with a common television.

Hermes: Do you find most pullers to be like Mohammad Latif and Mohammad Sajad who are supporting families that they live apart from? What were some commonalities among the rickshaw pullers?

Khan: Yes, most of the pullers are away from their families and home. Whatever amount of money they earn, they send it to their families back home. One of the most common things about these pullers is that they usually come to Kolkata from poor and neighboring states of India. Most of them are Muslims and live in Dera’s by which they are able to send more money back home. Since Dera is sharing place usually in a garage where they share their bed and food.

Ahmer Khan Pullers make about 125 rupees a day ($1.90). Out of that, 20 rupees goes to rent the rickshaw. A brush with police might mean a 75-rupee payoff.

Hermes: Overall, what are some of the biggest difficulties you face working as a photojournalist in India?

Khan: Honestly, I haven’t faced many problems working as a photojournalist in India. But I’m based in Kashmir which is a conflict zone and working as a photojournalist in Kashmir is a lot difficult than in any other part of India. In Kashmir, you can get killed or beaten anytime during the protests or encounter between the militants and Indian forces. We need to be really safe in Kashmir and in past many have been beaten by the forces or even few were killed.","Mon, 11 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2016/07/991415_1_RickshawPuller_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,"['pullers', 'rickshaw', 'live', 'kolkata', 'rickshaws', 'kashmir', 'deras', 'khan', 'india', 'working']", ,none

More damage is feared from a typhoon expected to land this week. Floods have ensured some 1.3 million people to evacuate vast areas near China's longest river, the official Xinhua news agency cited the Civil Affairs Ministry as saying. Millions more are threatened by the continuing downpour, which began at the end of June and has already destroyed at least 41,000 homes, according to Xinhua.

Water levels in Taihu Lake near Shanghai are at their highest level in decades which said the area faces a serious risk of flooding if a typhoon hits on Friday as forecast.

Horrific pictures have emerged from China over social media. In one, a farmer in eastern China cries as the waters rose drastically around his pigs.

Another showed a sports stadium in the central province of Hubei turned into a ""giant bathtub"".

Damage estimated at the moment is more than $7.7 billion and 42 people are missing, according to Xinhua.

China's Vice Premier Wang Yang has also warned last month that a strong El Nino effect this year would increase the risk of flooding in the Yangtze and Huai river basins.

The El Nino effect was linked to China's worst floods of recent years when more than 4,000 people died in 1998, mostly around the Yangtze.

NEW DELHI: Overstaying in government accommodation will now cost much more than just shelling out market rent, which is 40 to 55 times of what occupants pay every month.

As per the new rules which have come into force, such occupants will have to shell out 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and so on of the rent for every subsequent month in addition to the market rent until they vacate. There will also be similar hefty charges for those, including MPs, found subletting their accommodation.

In a recent order, the directorate of estates (DoE) has introduced the additional charges in telescopic method from second month onwards in addition to the market rent (damage charges) to discourage government employees from overstaying in official accommodation.

For example, a secretary rank officer, who pays less than Rs 4,000 a month as government rent will end up paying at least Rs 2.10 lakh in the first month of overstaying. By the fifth month he/she would have to pay at least Rs 3 lakh a month. UD ministry officials said the new clause will hurt all, starting from class-IV employees to those at the highest level.

The damage charges is higher in case of subletting. In such cases, the damage charges is two times of the market rent and there will be 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% extra charges every subsequent month. One of the officials said till now MPs are not covered under these norms as they are not “government servants”. He said, “We are changing this norm since anyone allotted a government accommodation must not sublet any portion of the house. Subletting by anyone will be treated as unauthorised act and so the damage charge norms will be applicable.”

The UD ministry is also coming out with compilation of all the nearly 300 guidelines that have been issued since 1997 for allotment of government accommodation.

95,95,FL-2016-000094-IND,Ganga floods Uttarakhand as ministries bicker over dams - India Climate Dialogue,https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/2016/07/20/ganga-floods-uttarakhand-ministries-bicker-dams/,"Ganga floods Uttarakhand as ministries bicker over dams

The Himalayan rivers that join to form the Ganga are in spate this monsoon, flash floods are being worsened by abandoned dams, but some ministries still want them to be built

After only six weeks of India’s annual 17-18 week summer monsoon, Uttarakhand is reeling under a series of flash floods that experts blame at least partly on the hydroelectric projects that had been started in the Himalayan state and then abandoned under a Supreme Court directive following the huge flash floods of 2013.

The other big cause is climate change, which has led to fewer rainy days this monsoon, but more intense rainfall on those days. Glaciers are also melting faster as the average temperature in the Himalayas has gone up thrice as much as the global average since 1990.

Faced with this double whammy of climate change impacts and abandoned partially-built dams that have channelled rivers in new directions, residents of many Uttarakhand villages are now stuck behind multiple landslides, with food running out and their homes in danger of being washed away or buried under yet another landslide.

Here is a glimpse of the situation in mid-July in this cradle of the Ganga basin:

Due to flash floods and landslides, the highway to the popular pilgrim spot Badrinath was closed;

The road to Nand Prayag had been closed for a fortnight – residents were running out of food and their homes were under constant threat because boulders on hillsides had come loose, while road construction material had not been removed either;

Heavy rain was keeping everyone indoors in the famous hill station Mussorie, while the road from state capital Dehradun had been badly hit by landslides;

A bus had been swept off the road by flash floods between Haldwani and Chorgalia – local residents risked their lives to pull out 24 passengers;

Landslides at Gulab Ghati were slowing down traffic between Kathgodam and the other famous hill station Nainital;

Eight houses were swept away by flash floods at Thailisain village, near the popular Dhari Devi temple; there were cracks on the road to the temple, while the bridge to it was at risk from an Alaknanda river in spate (Alaknanda is one of the principal tributaries of the Ganga in the Himalayas) – large trees had been uprooted and were rushing down the flooded river, battering the foundations of the bridge repeatedly;

Landslides had made the roads to Gangotri and Yamunotri very risky – a group of visitors from Delhi had got out of their car to move some stones from a landslide-hit patch in Bhatwari on the way to Gangotri, when a boulder fell on their car and took it down the ravine; on the way to Yamunotri the weakened road collapsed under a fully-laden truck and all traffic was stuck for hours; on these roads, there have been two reported cases of landslides missing passing vehicles by a matter of a few metres;

In almost all Uttarakhand towns including Dehradun, drains have not been desilted before the monsoon, so rainwater keeps flowing down the roads.

People suffer, ministries bicker

In such a situation, different ministries of the Government of India are quarrelling over the resumption of the stalled dams. The ministries of power and of environment, forests and climate change have told the Supreme Court that they want five of the hydroelectric projects resumed, while the ministry of water resources and Ganga rejuvenation has opposed any resumption.

The water resources ministry told the Supreme Court, “The three rivers, namely Alaknanda, Mandakini and Bhagirathi, and Ganga river from Dev Prayag downwards till Ganga Sagar should remain in their current condition without any further disruptions/interruptions or diversion.” Alaknanda, Mandakini and Bhagirathi together make up the Ganga before it descends from the Himalayas to the plains. Ganga Sagar is at the mouth of the Ganga, where it flows into the Bay of Bengal.

Officials in the water resources ministry told indiaclimatedialogue.net that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was keen to ensure “sufficient” water flow in the Ganga to dilute at least the worst of the pollution it suffers from further downstream.

But the power ministry is finalising a fresh hydropower policy to give a push to the sector that has been virtually halted due to opposition on the ground from people likely to be displaced by the projects. Environmentalists have also been opposing the projects, and the situation in Uttarakhand gives strength to their arguments.

There were 24 hydropower projects under construction in Uttarakhand when the 2013 floods hit the state, out of the 70 that have been planned for many years. Together, these 70 projects are supposed to generate 9,000 MW, but the water resources ministry has now pointed out to the Supreme Court that this potential has been bandied about without any consideration given to the carrying capacity of the rivers, the minimum water flow required to keep the rivers alive (the so-called environmental flow or e-flow) or the needs of local residents. The ministry now wants a cumulative impact study, taking all the proposed projects into account.

The five dams that the other ministries want to resurrect are the 300 MW Alaknanda project, 24.3 MW Bhyunder Ganga project, 4 MW Khirao Ganga project, 171 MW Lata Tapovan project and 195 MW Kotlibhel 1A project. The government has recommended “considerable design modifications” on the Alaknanda and Kotlibhel 1A projects.

Opposing this and pointing out that rejuvenating the Ganga was one of its mandates, the water resources ministry has told the Supreme Court, “If the origin of the Ganga is compromised, then the rejuvenation of the river will be impossible.”

The environment ministry had told the Supreme Court something similar in 2014 but has now changed tack. There are media reports that the change came after a meeting convened by the Prime Minister’s Office.

New law for Ganga

While the Supreme Court has to deal with the conflicting stances of various arms of the government, the water resources ministry is going ahead with a bill meant to help clean the Ganga. Minister Uma Bharti has said she has obtained support for the bill from the states through which the Ganga flows: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. This is essential because various aspects of water resources are central subjects, state subjects and concurrent subjects under the Indian Constitution.

Retired judge Girdhar Malviya, now member of the National Ganga River Basin Authority, will head a team to draft the bill.

The ministry needs to show results under the Prime Minister’s flagship National Mission for Clean Ganga, better known as Namami Gange – which is meant to clean the river, improve water flow and enable navigation by bigger vessels. The mission has an outlay of INR 20,000 crore (USD 2.98 billion) over five years, starting May 2015.

Bharti has been launching schemes in haste. She recently announced the simultaneous launch of 231 projects along the Ganga and its tributaries for modernisation and redevelopment of ghats (steps leading to and from the river) and crematoriums; development of sewage infrastructure and treatment; tree plantation; pilot and interceptor drains; trash skimmers; and conservation of biodiversity.

There are many more schemes, including:

Four hundred villages along the Ganga to be developed as model villages, with 13 Indian Institutes of Technology adopting five villages each;

Eight biodiversity centres to be developed at Rishikesh, Dehradun, Narora, Allahabad, Varanasi, Bhagalpur, Sahibganj and Barrackpore;Wildlife Institute of India has been asked to make a plan to conserve Gangetic dolphins, crocodiles and other species; the Central Inlands Fisheries Research Institute has been asked to improve fish stocks and variety;

Of the 118 towns along the river, 59 have been surveyed and 27 reports prepared, mostly to improve sewage treatment;

To control erosion, trees will be planted in 2,700 hectares along the river in the current financial year;

Five automatic water quality monitoring stations have started functioning, in addition to 57 manual stations; the minister has promised 113 more automatic stations will be set up by next March;

In Varanasi, the Prime Minister’s constituency, water quality data from automatic real-time sensors will be displayed at various ghats;

As for industrial effluents flowing into the Ganga, the Central Pollution Control Board has set up monitoring stations in 508 factories, and has ordered 150 factories to shut down.

While this list may be impressive, its impacts remain to be seen, while the problem is of a different magnitude altogether.","Wed, 20 Jul 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://indiaclimatedialogue.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Flash-floods-causes-massive-damage-every-year-in-Uttarakhand.-Photo-by-AFP.jpg,"['bicker', 'water', 'projects', 'ministries', 'court', 'resources', 'floods', 'supreme', 'dams', 'uttarakhand', 'ministry', 'ganga', 'river']", ,flood

Bhopal: Residents of Eco Green Park colony near Ayodhya Bypass hit the streets on Sunday, as their complaints regarding flooding to administration, civic body and even the CM helpline went unheard.

Bearing the brunt of the nature's fury, they said they are left with no option but to stage a protest. Some 60 houses of the colony were flooded due to heavy downpour in July. Since then, residents reached out to elected officials, SDM, BMC and CM helpline to force the builder to provide a viable solution to the problem. ""There are some 300 houses in the colony while more new constructions are underway. The nullah overflows causing flooding in our houses. The builder has breached building permission norms, but officials are looking the other way,"" said Dr Nisha Pandey, a resident. She reached out to the CM helpline (complaint number 2332519) on July 10. ""There have been many visits by officials, but no solution has come about. We want the builder to stop illegal construction and let us live in peace. Is it too much to ask for, for an average citizen?"" wondered Dr Pandey who has been living in the colony for five years.

When contacted, BMC zone officer Kamal Singh Thakur said, ""The drain has been dismantled. It was narrowed by the builder."" He did not comment why the BMC refused to take any action against the private contractor for alleged violations. Earlier, residents also met the SDM and presented their case. Following the meeting, residents alleged the builder has tried to lure the residents by providing additional facilities. ""There is a multi-storey coming up within 30 metres of the drain. He refuses to stop the construction,"" said Dr Pandey.

The Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) has lashed out at the BJP-led government in Assam alleging it has failed to deal with the devastating problems of flood, erosion and encephalitis in the state. In a statement here today, AJYCP president Biraj Kumar Sarma said, “The current flood wave has, in fact, exposed the utter inefficiency of the government where nearly 50 people died, not to speak of the lakhs of affected people in the state.”

“The government failed to demand even a single paise to counter the ravaging situation and the Centre dispatched Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh only to wash its hands off,” Sarma asserted. He came down heavily on the Sarbananda Sonowal government for alleged failure to rein in the outbreak of encephalitis, which has claimed 218 lives. “We have yet to see any stepped up initiative from the government,” he said.

Sarma accused the BJP leaders of maintaining a studied silence on the rhino poaching incidents in Kaziranga reminding they had launched a statewide protest against rhino poaching cases when the Congress was in power. “A rhino poaching incident in Kaziranga drew a knee-jerk reaction across the state thanks to them. But, 25 rhinos died in poaching and floods since the BJP-led government took oath,” he said.

Targeting Himanta Biswa Sarma, the AJYCP leader said the minister has been exposed during the last three months. “BJP drew applause in the nook and corner of the state when he called the Assembly polls the last battle of Saraighat to save Assam. Now, it has proved beyond doubt that really it is last battle to end up Assam, its people and resources,” Sarma claimed.

The 1671 Battle of Saraighat was the last battle fought between the Mughals and the Ahom Kingdom in the state at Saraighat in Guwahati to halt the expansion of the Mughal empire in Assam.","Wed, 03 Aug 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://images.indianexpress.com/2016/08/asaam-small.jpg,"['poaching', 'govt', 'failed', 'water', 'battle', 'flood', 'sarma', 'state', 'erosion', 'floods', 'assam', 'dealing', 'saraighat', 'rhino', 'ajycp']", ,flood
