Oversaturated earth also means that pockets where oxygen can filter through to help the roots breathe will instead be filled with water. Ideally, the moisture should be in the soil directly below the seed.

With rain falling day after day, farmers have been hard pressed to find windows of time when they have dry topsoil to get into their fields to plant. The task has been made harder by lower temperatures and cloudy skies that prevent the land from drying even when it is not raining. Many farmers find themselves more than a month behind in their planting, and some have even given up on planting all their seeds. Late planting could stunt the growth of crops, decreasing production once harvest rolls around.

On May 12, 28 percent of the nation’s corn crop had been planted, compared with 85 percent on the same day last year. As of the United States Department of Agriculture’s latest report, released last week, 91 percent of corn had been planted by June 2, compared with 100 percent a year earlier.

This year, the Agriculture Department had estimated that 97.3 million acres of corn, the most since 1936, would be planted, and that a record 14.14 billion bushels would result from them.

Now, there is concern that “not as much corn was planted as had been indicated,” Joseph W. Glauber, the department’s chief economist, wrote in an e-mail, and “that yields will be adversely affected because plantings were less.”","Sun, 09 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/10/us/JP-FARMER/JP-FARMER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=399&w=600&s=0e6d8bbc6e1d7cb7926cae67335acab715e14019c94c3c08d674c7eac067be47&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"['farmers', 'plaguing', 'dry', 'oxygen', 'corn', 'planted', 'midwest', 'drought', 'planting', 'farms', 'day', 'rains', 'soil', 'ideally', 'roots']", ,flood_and_drought
1,1,Drought Sri Lanka,"The Sri Lankan Monsoon, Better Prepared Than Sorry - Inter Press Service",http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/05/the-sri-lankan-monsoon-better-prepared-than-sorry/,"The Sri Lankan Monsoon, Better Prepared Than Sorry

COLOMBO, May 28 2013 (IPS) - The monsoon in Sri Lanka is always a much-awaited event. There is something about the sight of the gathered clouds, the washed trees and the drenched landscape that stirs romance even in the most hardened of souls.

The monsoon rain now comes to Sri Lanka mostly in short bursts, lasting some 15 minutes, accompanied by thunder. One minute it could be calm and sunny, the very next, winds could pick up, the delicate coconut palms sway dangerously and the heavens descend.

The short bursts of rain are a common scenario in the western plains. It is only when the rains decide to stay longer that their beauty recedes and the beast takes over.

Cities and villages get flooded, roads are jammed and thousands are left stranded, sometimes for days.

The island nation has had a brush with this scenario already this year, when Cyclone Mahasen swept past its eastern cost, leaving eight people dead, over 100,000 stranded and over 2,000 structures damaged.

There are also few who can erase the memory of the Dec. 2004 tsunami that left 35,000 people dead and close to a million displaced.

That disaster struck Sri Lanka hard, because there was no warning system in place.

The tragedy left the nation wiser, and one of the first things it did in the aftermath was to spruce up its early warning system and disaster mitigation effort.

“We are used to the monsoon and cyclones now and, more importantly, we are better prepared than ever before,” Sarath Lal Kumara, deputy director at the Disaster Management Centre (DMC), told IPS.

The DMC came into being in August 2005 as the nodal agency for disaster risk management in the country under the National Council for Disaster Management (NCDM), which later became the ministry of disaster management and human rights.

Each of Sri Lanka’s over 300 divisional secretariats further has a regional disaster management committee, the lowest administrative body in the government’s disaster management system. Every unit has a separate budget allocation for emergencies; funds are also allocated on a case-by-case basis by capital Colombo.

The DMC too has its own disaster management units in each of Sri Lanka’s 25 districts that make up the country’s nine provinces. Colombo once again coordinates their activities, but every unit has a senior manager of its own as head.

“They are stationed in the regions so that we can take quick decisions without having to go back and forth,” said Kumara. The units have also been provided with the resources to disseminate early warnings and coordinate initial rescue and relief work, he added.

Other non-governmental organisations too have upgraded their disaster monitoring and assistance capacities. The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, for instance, has district-level disaster management units and routinely mobilises thousands of its volunteers in early warning and relief work.

Staffers and volunteers also go through regular refresher courses on disaster preparedness. All of which came in handy, most recently when Cyclone Mahasen struck Sri Lanka.

“I think we are in a better position than we ever were to meet natural disasters,” Bob McKerrow, head of a delegation for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), told IPS.

It is just as well that Sri Lanka is investing some resources in early warning and preparedness, say experts. South Asia, they warn, will be subjected to a barrage of extreme weather events, and will have to deal with them on a long-term priority basis.

Over 25 million people have been displaced in the region between 2011 and 2012 due to natural disasters, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre in Geneva.

Millions are at risk in South Asia due to extreme weather events, Bart Édes, director of the poverty reduction, gender and social development division in the Asian Development Bank (ADB), told IPS.

“All around South Asia,” he said, “in addition to the current vulnerability to cyclones, flooding and drought, those living along South Asian coastlines confront the slowly rising seas.”

With millions affected by disasters, already stretched resources like water, healthcare, schools and other infrastructure can collapse under renewed pressure, Édes added.

“Environmental migration is exacerbating the urbanisation trend being witnessed across South Asia,” the ADB official told IPS. “The physical and social infrastructure of many cities is already stretched to capacity.” As a result, climate-related migration was becoming a serious issue in the region, he added.

A recent study by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Sri Lankan ministries of disaster management and economic development on the impact of the December 2012-January 2013 flooding offered a glimpse into the scale of damage that natural disasters can inflict.

Titled the ‘Rapid Flood Assessment Report’, it noted that over half a million people in Sri Lanka’s northern, north central, eastern, southern and northwestern regions were affected in early January by the flooding.

They have, in fact, been hit by a double whammy, as 67 per cent of the flood victims surveyed said they were also impacted by the 10-month drought preceding the floods.

An earlier assessment by the IFRC in November 2012 had put the number of drought-affected in Sri Lanka at over 1.2 million.

The WFP report also found 37 per cent of the households surveyed were severely ‘food insecure’ and 44 per cent were ‘borderline food insecure’. And the bulk of those who bore the brunt of the twin disasters were employed either in agriculture or in casual jobs.

“Loss of livelihoods, extreme poverty and losses to cultivation are the key drivers of food insecurity, among the flood-affected households,” the report noted. It also pointed to the fact that over 67 per cent of the flood-affected lived below the poverty line.

DMC’s Kumara cited anecdotal evidence to suggest that these victims of disasters were moving into cities, especially when harvests failed, looking for an income.

“We cannot stop natural events, we cannot alter them,” Kumara said. “What we can do is to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. God willing, we are on that track.”

Ask Kusumlatha Tammitta, who lives in the remote village of Mamaduwa in the Vavuniya district of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province, if this is enough, and she tells you that what they really need is better, accurate forecasting that will indicate how the monsoon will be.

Till that is available, people like her are condemned to live at the very edge of existence.","Tue, 28 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://www.ipsnews.net/Library/2013/05/Monsoon-small.jpg,"['warning', 'told', 'lankan', 'prepared', 'monsoon', 'lanka', 'sri', 'sorry', 'early', 'south', 'management', 'disasters', 'disaster', 'better']", ,flood_and_drought

3,3,Drought Sri Lanka,Extreme Weather Hits the Poor First – and Hardest - Inter Press Service,http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/extreme-weather-hits-the-poor-first-and-hardest/,"Extreme Weather Hits the Poor First – and Hardest

PANSALGOLLA, Sri Lanka, Oct 28 2012 (IPS) - The old adage ‘nature is the great equaliser’ no longer holds true in countries like Sri Lanka, where the poor bear the brunt of extreme weather events.

Gamhevage Dayananda, a farmer from the remote village of Pansalgolla in Sri Lanka’s north-central Polonnaruwa district, can attest to this reality, as he and his fellow farmers struggle to survive alternating periods of drought and flooding.

Unexpectedly heavy rains in February 2011 forced engineers to open the sluice gates of large irrigation tanks in the area, flooding hectare upon hectare of farmland, including Dayananda’s modest plot.

He lost his entire rice harvest, no small setback for his family of four who depend on this crop for their very survival.

This year, Dayananda found himself facing another crisis when drought destroyed his crop and put him at risk of falling deeper into debt.

“One season it’s all rain, next it’s all sun,” Dayananda told IPS. “There is nothing in moderation, it is all in extremes.”

The trend of extreme weather events alternating year after year is unlikely to change, according to W L Sumathipala, former head of the climate change unit at the Ministry of Environment, adding that Sri Lanka is at the receiving end of changing climate patterns.

Last year’s annual report for the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) noted, “Climate-related emergencies, such as those linked to drought, floods, and storms, expose the poor and most vulnerable to hazards that have lasting consequences for the health, livelihoods, and well-being of people who have the least capacity to cope with and mitigate the effects of natural disasters.”

Widespread poverty

Currently about 8.9 percent of this South Asian island nation’s 21 million people live below the poverty line.

Of these, according to Abha Joshi-Ghani, head of the World Bank’s Urban Development and Local Government Unit, “the poor in urban areas are likely to be affected more by the changing climate patterns. They are the most vulnerable because they live in sensitive areas, on precarious land where no one else will settle.”

The British-based charity Homeless International estimates that 12 percent of Sri Lanka’s urban population of about three million can be found in slums.

Defence and Urban Development Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was recently quoted as saying that shanty dwellers in the capital Colombo can be found “mostly on government lands”.

“Many of them are on the reservations set aside around the lakes, canals, roadways, and railway tracks,” he added.

The biggest threat to this population is the flash flood. Since 2007, the nation’s capital – along with other parts of the western region – has already been submerged more than two dozen times.

Some areas end up under water after just 30 minutes of heavy rain, as was experienced during the third week of October.

This situation can be traced in part to the capital’s compromised drainage capacity. But increasingly heavy downpours over the years have made matters worse, particularly since there are no signs this trend will let up anytime soon.

In its Second National Communication on Climate Change 2012, the environment ministry says that Colombo and the rest of the western plains can only expect more wet days ahead, with “intense” periods of rain.

By contrast, rice farmers are probably going to have to deal with long dry spells for some time to come. According to the environment ministry, the agrarian areas in parts of the east and northern provinces, including Polonnaruwa, will not only get less rain than they need, they will also experience higher temperatures.

The Central Bank estimates that a 0.5-degree Celsius rise in temperatures could reduce rice yields by around five percent.

Thus it should come as no surprise that an Asian Development Bank report last year identified climate change as the “greatest threat to food security”.

Local sustainable development expert Riza Yehiya also warned, “Food security fluctuations due to climate change will be accompanied by unsteady energy security, modern society’s greatest prerequisite (next to food and water).”

“The combined effects of this triumvirate – water, food, and energy insecurity – will render poorer sections of society extremely vulnerable unless social security for this sector is beefed up as part of the climate change mitigation programme.”

Last April, farmers in Polonnaruwa took to the streets after irrigation engineers stopped providing water because of the drought. At the time, the farmers said more than 16,000 hectares of paddy fields feeding off the Parakarama Samudarya irrigation tank were already in danger of going completely dry.

After being hit by floods in the early part of 2011, which destroyed over 16,000 hectares of paddy fields and roughly ten percent of the early harvest, rice farmers in the north and north-central regions are now facing the opposite end of that spectrum.

Severe drought during the first nine months of 2012 affected 1.3 million people, a rapid assessment by the World Food Programme (WFP) found.

Experts have estimated that close to 29 percent of an estimated harvest of 1.1 million metric tones will be lost, while 76,000 hectares, or 19 percent of the planted crop has already been destroyed.

“Preliminary findings indicate substantial livelihood impact on a broad spectrum of the population and a deterioration of food security,” according to the WFP Global Food Security Update for October.

Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, a prominent economist, believes that unemployment could be as high as 20 percent in some parts of the Northern Province, though no government data exists to support this view.

This year has seen some of the worst damages caused by climatic changes. Storms, floods droughts and extreme weather all around the world has wrought havoc to human lives and damaged crops in vastly different areas of the world.

These occurrences are attributed to global climate changes. �Despite massive international conferences for the last 20 years-the last being RIO+20 this year– little has been accomplished by way of changing lifestyles and technology to reduce global warming. There have been some improvements in technology that reduce emissions and an increased popular awareness in greening the economy. Yet meaningful actions by governments have been minimal and global warming continues.

World food prices

Global food production has been adversely affected by global warming and climate change that have aggravated the world food supply. In 2007 and 2008, climatic changes resulted in parts of China, Australia, Canada and New Zealand experiencing droughts. Large areas of China, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka faced floods. Weather conditions reduced the wheat crop in Canada by 20 to 25 percent. Milk production in New Zealand fell drastically owing to drought and rice production in Australia fell significantly. This year, too, the North American wheat crop was affected by drought and current international wheat prices have risen. Prices of milk and dairy products have also increased.

The world food equation that had been in balance for some time after the Green Revolution of the 1960s changed imperceptibly at first and then sharply in the last few years owing to both supply and demand factors. The declining trend in food production was accentuated by climate changes and increased demand resulted in an unprecedented rise in food prices. In 2005 alone food prices rose by 75 per cent. While climatic and other supply factors diminished the supply of food, the demand for food has been increasing.

The two large emerging countries of Asia– China and India — are increasing their demand for food due to increases in their population and increases in per capita incomes. Although both these countries had reduced their rates of population growth, the annual increase in population is huge — above one million more mouths to feed each year. In China the increase in incomes led to a phenomenal increase in demand for meat and dairy products. There have also been increases in demand for food from oil exporting countries in the Middle East and from Russia and Eastern Europe. These increases in demand for food have been fundamental reasons for increases in food prices.

Important Implications for Sri Lanka�

We would have to accept climate changes as inevitable and adjust and adapt to mitigate their adverse impacts on the economy and agriculture. The impacts of climate change on the Sri Lankan economy are twofold. First climate changes in tandem with increased demand for food globally are increasing international prices of food.

As a food importing country, the cost of food imports would rise sharply and increase import expenditure. Any increase in food import expenditure is a strain on the trade balance, as the country is already importing twice as much as it exports and having a massive trade deficit. Second, climatic changes in the country could affect food and other crop production adversely as witnessed this year when drought affected a large extent of paddy cultivation and the tea crop dipped about 13 percent in the first nine months of the year. This shortfall in rice production could lead to rice imports at high prices and affect the trade balance adversely.

Needed responses

Since international food prices are likely to continue to be high there is a need for a national response to cope with this reality. Food self-sufficiency is not an attainable goal for Sri Lanka as there are items of food that we cannot grow in the country such as wheat and dhal. It is also unrealistic to expect huge increases in production of items that we produce very little. We produce only 15 per cent of our requirements of sugar and 20 per cent of our current requirements of milk and the demand for these will increase with increasing incomes. There are limitations in land availability and other resource constrains and the high costs of production may make it economically better to import these commodities rather than produce them locally.

On the other hand, there are commodities where we could increase production to satisfy our needs. In the case of paddy production, we are near self-sufficiency in a good year and there is a possibility of increasing paddy production by increasing yields as the current average yield of around 4.4 metric tons per hectare is below the potential yields. An increase in rice production is needed to have an adequate stock to meet short-falls in production, increases in population by about 200,000 persons per year and to substitute rice for wheat. There should also be efforts to increase the production of other grains such as finger millet (kurakan), cowpea, Soya, and local varieties of lentils. In spite of all these strategies there would be a need to import several items of food.

The cost of all food imports is fully met by the export earnings from tea alone and earnings from industrial exports finance food imports several fold. Therefore the country’s food needs, even at these high prices, could be met by a diversified and robust export sector. However exports have been declining. Since the food needs of the country cannot be met by local production alone but supplemented by imports an increase in export earnings are vital: agricultural production alone cannot meet the food needs of the country.

Climate change in Sri Lanka

There has been climate in Sri Lanka. In the last century temperatures have increased by 0.3 degrees centigrade and in the more recent 30 years from 1961 to 1990, the temperature has risen by 0.16 degrees centigrade. The mean temperature in the country is expected to rise by 1.2 to 1.6 degrees centigrade by 2050.The rainfall pattern too appears to have changed with more rain in the wet zone and less rain in the dry zone. The expectation is that there would be more rainfall in the dry zone from the South East monsoon and that the dry zone would get less rainfall from the North East monsoon. The rainfall and climatic changes are difficult to predict and this unpredictability of climate changes makes the adaption to them more difficult and challenging.

The recent destruction of crops by floods after a severe drought exemplifies these changes. Our main crops of paddy, coconut and tea are susceptible to rainfall and temperature and agricultural production will be affected by these climate changes.

Response�

How does Sri Lanka respond to these unpredictable climate changes that will have important ramifications for agronomic conditions and farming systems? The research capacities in agriculture have to be strengthened to find ways and means of coping with changes and adapting crops to changing climatic conditions. The effectiveness of research depends on the efficacy of the extension system that has to convey the new findings and methods to farmers.

Unfortunately the research capacity of the Department of Agriculture has been weakened by underfunding, aging profile of researchers, improper utilisation of research staff and their deployment in administrative functions. The extension system that is now mainly a responsibility of the provinces is virtually ineffective.

How can the country face the emerging new challenges of climatic change with a weakened research and extension network?

Scorecard and ball-by-ball details

Tillakaratne Dilshan hit his fourth ODI century of the year AFP

Early in the evening, BJ Watling missed his century by four runs but returned to the pavilion with a spring in his step after propelling New Zealand to a competitive total in difficult circumstances, with rain curtailing the game to 33 overs a side. Tillakaratne Dilshan not only passed three figures, but also ensured Sri Lanka passed the finish line without panic in a controlled chase.

The two innings were statistically similar - in terms of strike-rate and number of boundaries hit - but the difference lay in the way they were paced. Watling came alive after he passed fifty, while Dilshan built his innings steadily and pushed on once his partnership with Angelo Mathews had all but ensured Sri Lanka to safety.

New Zealand had scored 188, but the target was revised to 197. The chase began positively with Dilshan finding the gaps early on, but New Zealand hit back in the fifth over. After being caressed for two boundaries through the off side, Tim Southee bowled a bouncer and Upul Tharanga ducked and the ball deflected off his helmet for four. Southee exchanged words with the batsman but Tharanga barely had time to gather himself when he hooked the following ball - dug in short again - awkwardly to fine leg.

The challenge for the New Zealand bowlers was the heavy dew and their seamers did well to keep it tight and not let the likes of Kumar Sangakkara to get away. In the urge to find the boundary, Sangakkara chipped down the track to Kyle Mills and pulled straight to midwicket. It wasn't Mahela Jayawardene's night either, as his reverse sweep off Nathan McCullum found short third man, giving New Zealand an opening in the 15th over with Sri Lanka needing 124.

The boundaries had dried up for the hosts and the drought lasted eight overs before Mathews charged Southee and swatted him over mid-on. The required rate crept up to seven and beyond but Dilshan and Mathews ensured things didn't get out of hand, perhaps gaining a psychological edge watching the bowlers furiously wipe the ball trying to get rid of the dew. The fielders showed good commitment, sliding and diving with purpose but the bowlers couldn't sustain the pressure, giving away regular boundaries.

Dilshan crashed one on the up and nearly cleaned up the bowler Trent Boult, before Mathews slapped two ordinary deliveries from Mills wide of point in a three-over period that produced a vital 30 runs. It was a matter of time before Dilshan produced his trademark lap shot, sending one off Jacob Oram to fine leg. Sri Lanka took their last Powerplay block of three overs in the end, when Dilshan muscled his way towards his century, reaching the landmark with a six over deep square leg.

Sri Lanka were fortunate their innings wasn't constantly interrupted by the weather. Two lengthy rain interruptions - both exceeding 100 minutes each - couldn't have been easy for New Zealand as they looked to build after being put in to bat. After the second break, they had 19 remaining overs to get as many as they could, with the threat of rain at the back of their heads.

The stand of 56 between James Franklin and Watling gave New Zealand the push they needed. Watling had nothing to lose in attacking. His first fifty came of 70 balls - his next 46 came off just 18. It included slogs to midwicket off the spinners, powerful drives to the deep square on the off side off the seamers and three boundaries in an over off Lasith Malinga. That over - the penultimate - yielded 15, as Malinga dished out low full tosses. It was one of those nights when he couldn't land his yorkers. Nathan McCullum gave him good support at the other end with clean hits.

A century for Watling seemed a possibility but he lost strike after the third ball in the final over. New Zealand had made enough to set Sri Lanka a required rate of just under a run-a-ball, but Dilshan and Mathews settled the issue with nearly two overs to spare and give Sri Lanka an unassailable 2-0 lead.","Tue, 06 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/151500/151509.3.jpg,"['zealand', 'watling', 'ball', 'ton', 'overs', 'lanka', 'sri', '20', 'mathews', 'century', 'boundaries', 'dilshan', 'lead', 'gives']", ,none

Subramaniam Sivathai alias Thamalini was handed over to her parents at the Poonthottam Rehabilitation Centre in Vavuniya yesterday, said Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Brigadier Dharshana Hettiarachchi.

Thamalini from Kilinochchi had joined the LTTE in 1991 and became the head of LTTE women's Wing.

She was arrested by Sri Lankan army in May 2009 at an Army welfare centre for refugees and taken to Colombo for investigations.

Thereafter, she was held in the main Welikada prison and was charged with training LTTE cadres and establishing connections with Tamil Tigers overseas.

She was later transferred to the Vavuniya Rehabilitation centre to undergo the rehabilitation programme in order to re-integrate her into the society.

Thamalini received vocational training at the camp and had followed a training course in bridal dressing.

Opposition political sources said she may opt to become a ruling party candidate in the upcoming northern provincial council election in September.

10,10,Drought Sri Lanka,Seeraga samba in the clutch of drought - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/seeraga-samba-in-the-clutch-of-drought/article4372258.ece,"Variety exclusive to Uppiliyapuram panchayat union in State

Even a special paddy variety such as seeraga samba has not escaped the clutches of drought this year.

Just as basmati, this is a costly variety used exclusively for “biriyani”. Except the Uppiliyapuram panchayat union of Thuraiyur taluk of Tiruchi district, the variety is not raised in any other place in the State. V.C.Natarajan, a fertilizer dealer and agriculturist of Vairichettipalayam, who raises the variety, says that a few farmers of Lalgudi and Kumbakonam too raise this crop once in a while. But they have not been successful. Similarly, almost the entire farming community in the half-a-dozen villages in the block go in only for this variety and rarely for PBT or any other variety.

M.Radhakrishnan, who has raised seeraga samba in about five acres, says this variety has been in existence in Uppiliyapuram region for more than half a century.

They point out that this variety is raised in about 5,000 acres in the area adjoining Kolli Hills. “Our fields are hardly four kilometres from Namakkal district border.”

Apart from Vairichettipalayam, the variety is also raised in Kottapalayam, B.Mettur, and Thanganagar.

The major reason for the fertility of this region is the water from the hills.

“There are fountains and also a few tanks which are fed by the bigger tank called Jamberi”.

“As it is not used for normal food, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation does not procure this variety. This year, seeraga samba rice is selling around Rs.60 a kg. While the new seeraga samba paddy is sold at Rs.2, 500 a bag (80 kg), old paddy is quoting around Rs.3,000 a bag. Last year, it was ruling around Rs.1, 500 a bag and in 2011 it was Rs.1,900.

They also point out that the entire yield from these 5,000 acres is bought by about 60-70 merchants at the local level who hull it locally in about half a dozen units and sell it in Tiruchi, Salem, Tirupur, Coimbatore, and Pollachi markets.

The farmers who raise seeraga samba used to have three crops a year – first is seeraga samba (150 day crop that is planted during the first week of September for harvest by the end of January or the first half of February) followed by short-term variety ADT 43 (85-105 days) and finally they go in for ADT 43 again.

“Normally we used to get at least 25 bags of paddy (80 kilograms each). This year the harvest is yet to start and we are not sure whether we would be able to get even 10-12 bags because we also had to face drought conditions in certain parts of the region, especially the northern portion of Vairichettipalayam.”

“Even the water from the Ahayagangai fountain of the Kolli Hills could not help us much and there has been hardly any monsoon rain .”

If the same conditions were to persist, they are not certain whether they could go in for short-term crop now.

“Of course, we are not concerned over Cauvery and Karnataka’s recalcitrance to release water to Tamil Nadu as we are far away from the river,” they added.","Sat, 02 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12243140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY31SEERAGA_SAMBA2,"['raised', 'seeraga', 'uppiliyapuram', 'water', 'region', 'drought', 'half', 'used', 'variety', 'clutch', 'samba', 'paddy']", ,drought

Captain Suzie Bates says her White Ferns are in ""a good place"" ahead of their women's 50-over cricket World Cup opener against South Africa in Cuttack, India, tomorrow.

New Zealand brushed aside Monday's surprise hammering by India to topple world champions England by 13 runs in yesterday's final warmup match and confirm themselves as contenders for a first cup triumph since 2000.

They headed for India buoyed by a 2-1 Twenty20 series win over Australia in Melbourne, their first series victory on Australian soil for 26 years, and are confident of breaking up the England-Australia dominance during the past eight years.

Though India showed on Monday that they will be a handful on their home turf, and the West Indies are also now a major threat in the women's game, that confidence will remain intact following a rare win over England.

New Zealand posted 223 all out in 50 overs, with Sara McGlashan scoring 88 from 90 balls and Lucy Doolan 57 from 77, and held their nerve to dismiss the tournament favourites for 210 in the 49th over.

""To beat England, who are a very strong side, was really impressive and it puts us in a good place heading into the World Cup,"" Bates said, describing the tune-up win as ""massive"".

""If we'd had two losses, we would've been a bit more nervous, but with our batters scoring runs and bowlers executing, we are really confident going into our first pool game.""

With the 9am starts, Bates said the first 10 overs were tricky for the team batting first, while the wickets had taken plenty of turn later in the day, so playing late and negotiating spin would be crucial for the batsmen.

New Zealand have been something of a third wheel in women's cricket when it comes to major tournaments during the past eight years, with England winning the last 50-over World Cup, in 2009, as well as the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in the same year, while Australia won the previous 50-over World Cup, in 2005, and have won the last two T20 World Cups, in 2010 and 2012.

New Zealand have become accustomed to the bridesmaid's tag, having lost three finals (one 50-over and two T20s) in the space of two years in 2009 and 2010.

But there is genuine belief among the New Zealand team that they can win for the first time since 2000.

""There's very little separating the top teams at this level, so it's very much going to be about sticking to our game plan and our strengths and how people cope with the pressure. We believe we can win at the World Cup,"" said coach Katrina Keenan.

Runs from the experienced Bates and left-hander Amy Satterthwaite at the top of the order will be vital for New Zealand, as will Sophie Devine's hitting power in the middle order. There are few better strikers in the world.

As well, all-rounder Nicola Browne, who also has few problems finding the boundary, looms as influential.

The slower bowlers are expected to be prominent in India and New Zealand have a few handy ones, most notably Morna Nielsen who bowled well in Australia.

New Zealand will also face Pakistan and Australia in group B before the Super Sixes playoff stage.

Group A is headed by England and includes India, the West Indies and Sri Lanka.

The final will be played in Mumbai on February 17.","Thu, 31 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1355376810/888/8076888.jpg,"['zealand', 'india', 'ferns', 'world', 'white', 'womens', 'cup', 'drought', 'team', 'england', 'break', '50over', 'win', 'bates', 'poised']", ,none

36 dead, more than 340,000 displaced by floods, tanks overflowing; while Met Dept says more rains expected

By Nadia Fazlulhaq

Floods and landslides have claimed 36 lives and affected more than 340,000 people countrywide as adverse weather conditions continued for the second week wreaking havoc

This week, the Northern Province was the most battered as the north-east monsoon rains lashed the districts of Mullaitivu, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi and Jaffna. Around 16,000 sought shelter in relief centres as homes went under water.

Heavy rains in Nanattan, Manthai west, Mannar, Musali and Madhu DS divisions in the Mannar district, saw more than 5,000 families affected.

In Vavuniya about 15,000 people were hit by flood waters with Vavuniya South, Vavuniya and Cheddikulum being the worst affected. In Mullaitivu the areas of Oddusudan and Thunukkai bore the brunt of the bad weather.

Heavy rainfall was also reported in the districts of Anuradhapura, Ampara, Badulla, Batticaloa, Hambantota, Kandy, Kegalle, Kurunegala, Moneragala, Matale, Nuwara Eliya, Puttalam, Polonnaruwa, Ratnapura and Trincomalee while other districts received intermittent showers.

Matale district reported the highest number of deaths, nine, followed by eight in Batticaloa and six in Puttalam.

Meanwhile Irrigation Department director, Janaki Meegastenna told the Sunday Times that of the 71 tanks, that came under the purview of the department 39 were above spill level and seven at spill level.

She said ten of them were 90 percent full while sluice gates of 21 tanks have been opened.

“Heavy rains this week has resulted in tanks spilling over in the Mannar district with the Giant tank (yodha wewa) reaching above spill level,” Ms. Meegastenna said.

In Anuradhapura main tanks including Kalawewa, Rajanganaya, Nachchaduwa and Mahakandarawa were overflowing while 54 small tanks were also spilling. About 104 small and medium tanks have been damaged out of which 36 were completely destroyed. Navy boats have been deployed to rescue families stranded in the vicinity of these tanks, Ms. Meegastenna said.

In Polonnaruwa the Parakrama Samudraya, Kawudulla and Minneriya tanks were overflowing. �The Puttlam Disaster Management office has requested people living close to Deduru Oya and Kala Oya to be vigilant as water levels were rising due to the relentless rain.

Meanwhile last week’s flash floods in Puttalam damaged 4,800 houses with 1500 of them completely destroyed. Similarly, in Batticaloa, 5, 600 houses were damaged due to gale force winds and floods. Of them, 2,100 were completely destroyed.

Meanwhile, the National Building Research Organisation has warned that 7,000 houses were at the risk of sinking in Matale district. Areas including Matale, Rattota, Ukuwela, Ambaganga Korale and Laggala have been identified as vulnerable to subsidence and landslides.

Agrarian Services and Wildlife Deputy Minister S.M. Chandrasena said 180,000 acres of paddy fields have been destroyed with Batticaloa, Kurunegala and Polonnaruwa being the most affected. Seed paddy and fertiliser would be distributed free of charge to farmers in these areas Mr. Chandrasena assured.

Disaster Management Centre spokesman Pradeep Kodipilli said funds have been allocated to the District Secretaries of the affected areas to provide immediate relief to the displaced. The districts of Mannar, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura and Hambantota have reported the highest number of displaced.

In Mannar, 2700 displaced families were living with families and another 3000 have sought shelter while those displaced in Mullaitivu and Vavuniya sought temporary shelter in community centres, the spokesman said.

Painting a bleak picture the Meteorology Department has forecast heavy showers in the coming week and requested the public to be vigilant.

Meteorology Department Director Genertal S.H. Kariyawasam said the Northern, Eastern, North Central, Uva and Central provinces will experience heavy showers while evening thunder showers were expected to develop in the Western and Sabaragamuwa provinces and in the districts of Galle and Kurunegala.

He said the North East monsoon would continue till February with rains lasting till mid January.

Warning that strong winds would accompany thundershowers, Mr. Kariyawasam has requested the public to take precautions to minimise damage caused by lightning.

Parakrama Samudra: Then it was dry, now it’s at spill level

Sand mining during the drought has damaged tank bund leading to fears of breaching

By Indumathi Jayasena

After a prolonged period of drought that dried up the mighty Parakrama Samudra, the heavy rains in the past two weeks have seen the giant tank reach spill level. But along with it has come fears that the heavy sand mining that took place in its dried up bed may lead to excessive erosion of its bund.

Residents in the area said the bund of the Parakrama Samudra has started eroding as a result of the tippers that were frequently removing sand from the tank bed during the drought. The tank bund was badly damaged due to the frequent trips made by tippers loaded with sand removed from the dried up bed.

Th sand was transported and said to be sold at Rs. 5,000 a tipper load.

Residents said a great deal of damage was done to the tank during the drought by the frequent digging, especially close to the bund.

Officials make temporary repairs which do not stand the impact of floods. G Jayathilleke (52) said that the so-called development by the government only damaged the bank. Such projects in the name of economic development made our villages targets of the so-called progress, he said.

There were other villagers who made their comments on the present pitiful state of the banks of the Parakrama Samudra.

Meanwhile, incessant rains experienced during the past few days have caused floods with the Mahaweli Ganga overflowing its banks in the Manampitiya Polonnaruwa area making the road to Batticaloa impassable.

Gallella in the Somawathie Chaithya area was also flooded forcing devotees to keep away as the authorities declared it a disaster area.

NEW DELHI– The Congress Party faced a new crisis on Tuesday after a southern political party threatened to withdraw from the governing coalition if India did not join an international push to investigate alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka.

The possible pullout would leave the beleaguered United Progressive Alliance still in control of the Indian government, but it marks the latest case of arm-twisting by fractious government allies ahead of national elections scheduled for next year.

The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, or D.M.K., the opposition party in the state of Tamil Nadu, withdrew five ministers from the governing coalition in order to pressure the government to adopt a resolution in Parliament declaring that genocide and war crimes have been committed against Tamils by the Sri Lankan army and administration. But the party has yet to make the withdrawal official by sending a letter to the president announcing the party’s resignation.

This week, the United Nations Human Rights Council, which includes India, is expected to vote on a United States-backed resolution that urges Sri Lanka to deliver on promises to investigate allegations of a mass slaughter of Tamil civilians as the country’s civil war ended in 2009 and also cites reports about possible continued atrocities. The D.M.K. has called for the United Nations resolution to explicitly accuse Sri Lanka of genocide.

Political parties in Tamil Nadu have often voiced their concerns about the welfare of the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka, the island nation off the south Indian coast, where Tamil rebels, known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, or L.T.T.E, fought to gain autonomy for the Tamil regions of the country.

The D.M.K. said it wanted an independent international body to investigate what it describes as a genocide committed by the Sri Lankan government during the country’s bloody 26-year civil war, The Hindu newspaper reported, citing a statement in Tamil by the party’s chief, Muthuvel Karunanidhi. Human rights activists say that more than 40,000 Tamils died during the war.

Palaniappan Chidambaram, India’s finance minister and a senior leader of the Congress-ruled governing coalition, said the D.M.K.’s absence would not cause the government to collapse.

“The government is absolutely stable and enjoys a majority in the Lok Sabha,” he said, referring to the lower house of Parliament. Mr. Chidambaram, who is from Tamil Nadu, was also one of three senior Congress leaders who visited the D.M.K. chief on Monday, hoping to resolve the issue.

“This is not a crisis,” he emphasized as he addressed reporters Tuesday morning.

The D.M.K. said it was withdrawing 18 legislators from the coalition in the Lower House of Parliament, but the Congress Party, which leads the United Progressive Alliance, looks unlikely to be toppled. That’s because in order for the government to fall, a “no-confidence” vote would need to pass the lower house with a simple majority. Of the lower house’s 540 seats, the Congress Party controls the lion’s share with 203 seats and has enough additional support from outside parties, including 43 seats from two political parties in the state of Uttar Pradesh alone, to defeat any such vote.

Mr. Chidambaram said that the president of the Congress Party, Sonia Gandhi, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have been briefed about the D.M.K.’s demands and that all political parties are already being consulted on a possible Parliament resolution on the issue.

“We’re examining the text of the final draft that came up before us last night,” Mr. Chidambaram said, but he added that he was not aware of what stand each political party would take on the issue.

“We are fully committed to the cause of the Lankan Tamils and an impartial inquiry should happen into the allegations of atrocities against them,” Mrs. Gandhi said Tuesday, according to the Press Trust of India. Mrs. Gandhi’s husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was killed in 1991 by a female suicide bomber believed to be associated with the L.T.T.E. in Sri Lanka.

Mr. Karunanidhi said the D.M.K. would reconsider the pullout if its demands are met, a position Mr. Chidambaram said Congress members have noted.

The D.M.K. is the second major political ally to threaten to yank its support from the governing coalition. In September, the All India Trinamool Congress, which governs the state of West Bengal, pulled out of the alliance, protesting a package of fuel price increases and pro-business economic changes.

Analysts say that the current standoff maybe just politics as usual as the D.M.K. struggles to draw attention to the plight of Tamils in Sri Lanka, a deeply emotional issue in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Over the past week, thousands of students across Tamil Nadu, including in Coimbatore, Tirunelveli and Salem, have fasted , picketed and boycotted classes as they demand an independent investigation into the Sri Lankan government’s treatment of Tamils.

Indian police has issued arrest warrants for hundreds of university students in Chennai who were demonstrating against the Sri Lankan treatment of Tamils.

The recent upheaval in Tamil Nadu has been sparked by the recent release of disturbing photographs of the body of the former Tamil rebel leader’s 12-year old son, who appeared to have been shot at close range in the chest, and a report on the continued abuse of Tamils in Sri Lanka. Many of the 72 million citizens of Tamil Nadu relate to and support Sri Lankan Tamils, with whom they share a common language.

On Tuesday, Parliament was disrupted over the issue, which has drawn heated debate on the House floor in recent days.","Tue, 19 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/19/world/asia/19-Karunanidhi-IndiaInk/19-Karunanidhi-IndiaInk-superJumbo.jpg,"['tamil', 'lankan', 'united', 'crimes', 'lanka', 'shake', 'sri', 'allegations', 'dmk', 'political', 'party', 'nadu', 'war', 'tamils', 'congress', 'indian']", ,none
18,18,Drought Sri Lanka,"U.S., Global Natural Disasters Exact Heavy Toll in May: Aon Benfield - Insurance Journal",https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2013/06/06/294577.htm,"Severe weather in May caused an estimated $4 billion in insured damage in the U.S. alone and billions more in economic losses around the globe, according to an Aon Benfield report.

The Global Catastrophe Recap by Aon Benfield’s catastrophe modeling center, Impact Forecasting, reviews the natural disaster perils that occurred worldwide during May 2013 including tornadoes in Oklahoma, Italy and Russia; flooding in the Midwest and central Europe; and drought conditions in Brazil.

Several regions of the U.S. were hit with severe windstorm events during the month, including Moore, Oklahoma, where a catastrophic EF-5 tornado killed 24 people, injured 387 others, and damaged or destroyed up to 13,000 homes and structures.

Total economic losses from the event, which comprised at least 61 confirmed tornado touchdowns, were preliminarily estimated at $5.0 billion, amid insured losses of at least $2.5 billion.

In a second prolonged severe weather event at least 76 tornadoes touched down, including an EF-5 tornado with 295 mph (475 kph) winds and a U.S.-record 2.6-mile (4.2-kilometer) path width that struck El Reno, Oklahoma.

Large hail (including a major hailstorm in Amarillo, Texas that resulted in a $400 million insured loss), flash flooding in the Plains and Midwest, and damaging winds in the Northeast were also recorded.

Total economic losses are expected to exceed $2.0 billion, with insured losses above $1.0 billion.

Two additional stretches of severe weather also affected parts of the Plains and the Southeast, causing a combined economic loss of $700 million and insured losses of $375 million.

“The month of May is historically the peak of tornado season in the U.S., and after a relatively benign start to the month, tornado activity became much more prevalent during the last two weeks,” said Steve Jakubowski, president of Impact Forecasting. “Images from the aftermath of the EF-5 tornado in Moore, Oklahoma show the destructive power of the peril and how devastating impacts can be when tornadoes of such magnitude track through densely populated areas. High insurance penetration will help to alleviate the pressure on those affected, and the recovery is already well underway.”

Europe Storms

Severe weather was also noted in parts of Europe during May, where three tornadoes struck northern Italy’s Emilia Romagna region, injuring at least 20 people, and damaging hundreds of homes were damaged in the Bologna and Modena regions. Total economic losses were estimated at EUR10 million (U.S. $3.1 million).

In Russia, an F2 tornado struck the town of Yefremov injuring at least 20 people and resulting in a total economic loss of RUB100 million (U.S. $3.2 million).

Extensive flooding killed at least 11 people in Central Europe, with the most significant damage occurring in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Switzerland. Several major rivers and their tributaries burst their banks, including the Danube, Vltava, and Rhine, as thousands of homes, structures and vehicles were damaged. The event remains ongoing during the first week of June. Total economic losses were anticipated to reach billions of dollars.

Meanwhile, heavy rainfall and strong thunderstorms swept across much of central and southern China during the month, with at least four separate periods of inclement weather were noted. According to data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA), 98 people were killed, 171,000 homes damaged or destroyed, as well as 600,000 hectares (1.48 million acres) of crops. Total economic losses were listed at CNY12.3 billion (U.S. $2.0 billion).

Flood events were also recorded in the United States, Canada, Maldives and Uganda.

Significant drought conditions persisted in Brazil, resulting in the country’s worst drought since 1963, affecting the northeastern states of Minas Gerias, Pernambuco and Bahia. According to Ministry of National Integration, more than 50 percent of the region’s cattle died and agricultural crops were devastated. The Brazilian government allocated BRL16.6 billion (U.S. $.3 billion) in aid and recovery.

Drought conditions were also recorded in New Zealand and Panama.

Elsewhere, Tropical Cyclone Mahasen made landfall in Bangladesh, killing 52 people, after causing flooding in parts of Sri Lanka, India, and Myanmar. In Bangladesh, at least 136,132 poorly constructed homes were destroyed by the storm, resulting in economic losses to crops and fisheries listed at BDT15.61 billion (U.S. $200 million).

Hurricane Barbara made landfall in southern Mexico’s state of Chiapas, killing at least four people. More than 5,000 homes and other structures were damaged by floodwaters up to 6.0 feet (1.8 meters) in height.

19,19,Drought Sri Lanka,Fr. Tissa Balasuriya: a loving and gentle rebel - National Catholic Reporter,https://www.ncronline.org/news/people/fr-tissa-balasuriya-loving-and-gentle-rebel,"Colombo, Sri Lanka — Oblate Fr. Tissa Balasuriya, a noted theologian, economist and human rights activist, died Jan. 17 in Sri Lanka. He was 89.



He founded the Centre for Society and Religion in Colombo in 1971 with the aim of fostering interreligious and interracial action for justice and peace. He was also instrumental in founding the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians in the mid-1970s.



The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith began a doctrinal investigation of Balasuriya because of statements he made about Mary, original sin, Christ's redemptive role, revelation, and papal authority in his book Mary and Human Liberation, published in English in 1990. He was excommunicated in January 1997, accused of propagating ideas contrary to the Catholic faith.



A year later, Balasuriya signed a ""Statement of Reconciliation"" and the excommunication was lifted.



Balasuriya was a frequent contributor to NCR. His last article, a critique of Pope Benedict XVI's third encyclical Caritas in Veritate (""Charity in Truth""), appeared in August 2009. He found it a ""valuable document, but has some missing dimensions. It does not analyze the way the modern world has been set up as an association of Christians with governments and colonial powers, especially from 1492 to 1945. The pope seems to overlook the inadequacies of the church in the course of history.""



Balasuriya has been called a radical and rebel within the Catholic church and society. He, like Jesus, never flinched from challenging the powerful -- in the government, multinational corporations or the church.



But what I remember most about Father Tissa is his love and his gentleness.



Though I had begun reading his works years before, I got to know Father Tissa personally in the 1990s. He took me to slums in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital, and got me involved in conducting discussions on human rights in area schools. He invited me to a training course on organic farming in Kandy and made me part of theological discussions with leading Sri Lankan and other liberation theologians from across the world. He lived a simple life, with few personal belongings, and mostly traveled by bus and train.



In 2009, I was asked to present a paper on the Eucharist and armed conflict at a conference held in preparation for the plenary assembly of Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. My thesis, that ""the Eucharist has to be related positively to human liberation if it is to be faithful to its origins,"" was drawn from Father Tissa's 1977 book Eucharist and Human Liberation.



Even when the Vatican, with active collaboration of local church leaders in Colombo, excommunicated him, he didn't speak angrily of those responsible. ""I feel more in communion with the real church and those oppressed"" was the sentiment I remember most in my conversations with him from that time.



As a teenager, I was a regular visitor to the Centre for Society and Religion. There I found critical material on church and society. From the center, we in the Young Christian Students Movement could borrow slides, videos, overhead projectors and other material and equipment. On one occasion, Father Tissa recommended a film on Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador, who was killed because he condemned the military dictatorship in his country. I had never heard of Romero or the film, but took Father Tissa's advice and showed it. It remains one of the most challenging and inspiring films I have ever watched. I have used it many times since in presentations to various groups.



A woman activist has told me that Father Tissa was among the few churchmen in the 1980s and 1990s who welcomed her and her young child. Long before Father Tissa wrote the book Mary and Human Liberation, he had been an advocate for women's rights in society and especially within the church.



In recent years, when my work as a human rights activist in Sri Lanka put me in certain danger, Father Tissa reached out, concerned for my safety. He invited me to stay with him for protection, saying, ""I have a very short time to live, but you have more years ahead of you, so be careful."" He never failed to reply to an email or return a phone call.



Some people close to Father Tissa found it difficult to work with him, and indeed had disagreements with some of his thinking. He was, after all, only human. But I also think that his vision and commitment were so idealistic and challenging that some found it difficult to keep up with him.



Father Tissa was and will remain one of my gurus -- someone who helped me to connect my faith to realities of oppression and injustices around me -- in Sri Lanka and beyond. I am among the many fortunate people Father Tissa mentored and inspired through his writings, his conferences and workshops, and personal conversations, but most importantly, in the simple way he lived and the love he radiated.

The 25-year-old Sri Lankan refugee has been waiting in Thailand for five years to be resettled in a safe country. He spent four years of that time locked in an overcrowded, windowless cell in the immigration detention centre in Bangkok.

His three sisters and mother spent two years in detention before they were released on bail last fall at 50,000 baht apiece, or about $1,600 – a large sum refugees don't get back if they leave the country.

article continues below

His sisters and mother have resettled in the United States, but Chandru is still waiting for a country to accept him. Although he's on bail and checks in with immigration officials every two weeks, he constantly fears being arrested and thrown in the centre again.

He lives with his father, who is recognized as a refugee but also hasn't been resettled, in a musty one-room apartment in Bangkok. ""The situation is really bad for refugees here,"" said Chandru, who only gave his first name for fear of reprisals by Thai immigration officials.

That's the difficult situation facing most urban refugees who flee their homes for transit countries such as Thailand, hoping to be resettled in Canada, Australia or the United States.

Because Thailand is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, asylum-seekers and refugees are treated like illegal immigrants and not allowed to work, go to school or receive social welfare.

Many have to wait years while their cases wind their way through the refugee system.

""Life is tough for them,"" said Vivian Tan, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok. ""Most refugees have little access to public services. They can't work. They find work in the grey economy doing dirty, dangerous, difficult jobs that no one else wants to do. Their children can't go to school.

They are subject to arbitrary arrest and detention and they're not guaranteed a solution.

""They know they can't continue living like this for a long time.""

It's these dire circumstances that often push asylum-seekers in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to pay human smugglers to get on dangerous boats heading for Australia, and, on two occasions in the past three years, to Canada.

Chandru said his family never considered paying a smuggler. But 492 Tamils did choose that option, leaving the port city of Songkhla and arriving off B.C.'s west coast on Aug. 13, 2010. Ten months earlier, 76 Tamil asylum-seekers turned up on the Ocean Lady.

The Canadian government calls them queue-jumpers and has taken dramatic steps to stop future boat migrants from reaching Canadian shores. Passed last summer, Bill C-31 imposes mandatory detention and a five-year ban on family reunification, permanent resident status and travel for any asylum seekers who arrive by boat.

But Michael Timmins of the non-profit refugee advocacy group Asylum Access in Bangkok says when you're a refugee, there is no queue. Canada and other Western countries have such strict visa policies that someone from Sri Lanka, for example, cannot get a visa to travel there, Timmins said. So people head to countries such as Thailand, where they can easily get in on a tourist visa. But Timmins said the constant fear of being arrested means they can't build a life there.

""They've been thrust into a situation where they have to leave their country for their life and then come to another country where their life is intolerable,"" Timmins said. ""When people start talking about other options, to maybe take a boat, then you start to look at it.""

While Timmins says he's not defending human smugglers, such operations have long been a way for desperate people to escape persecution. ""Think of classic movies, the Kite Runner, how did they get out? They got out of Afghanistan illegally. Think of Schindler's List, what was that? That was a people-smuggling operation. We're talking about different contexts here. The networks out of Thailand, they are criminal for sure, but they are responding to a need, in that there's a complete lack of protection in the region.""

After the arrival of the MV Sun Sea, the RCMP thwarted four more human-smuggling ships they believe were destined for Canada. The government quietly put pressure on Thai officials to stop more asylum-seekers from getting on boats. The result was a massive roundup of Tamils, with immigration police storming several apartment blocks known to house Sri Lankans on Oct. 11, 2010.

A total of 136 Sri Lankans registered with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees were detained, including three pregnant women and 30 children.

Just over two weeks later, 61 Sri Lankans were arrested in Songklha and Hat Yai and transferred to the Suan Phlu immigration detention in Bangkok.

Twenty-eight more Sri Lankans were arrested by the end of that year.

While Chandru and his family were already facing deplorable conditions inside the detention centre, it became even more crowded with the new arrivals.

""Sometimes, like, 400 people will be stuffed in a room where only 100 can stay,"" said Divia, 20, over Skype from her new home in California.

The Immigration Detention Centre is in the Suan Phlu area of Bangkok, amid traffic-choked streets, lined with merchants selling chicken satays and fried dumplings.

Chandru, who now makes a little money working as a Tamil translator for the Bangkok Refugee Centre, walks past the row of big, black caged-in trucks that transported him and other asylum seekers to the centre. The building could pass for a government office if it wasn't for the gates that encase the reception area. The reception door is open, but the detention centre itself is behind a solid steel door about an inch think.

A nurse with the Jesuit Refugee Service who works at the centre five days a week calls conditions ""very difficult.""

Chandru said when he was in detention, the nurse would often translate between detainees and security guards to make sure people got the help they needed. Children in detention can't go to Thai schools, but are allowed to attend a makeshift classroom that also serves as a daycare in a building next door.

For the adults, the only respite from staring at the dark walls are monthly family days, when all detainees are released into a central compound.

Fathers have a chance to hug their wives or kiss their children.

After they were released, Chandru's family was told if they were willing to split up, they would be resettled faster. ""My mom said yes because she was concerned about our studies,"" said Divia, who is finishing her high school diploma and hopes to go to university. Now the family's only connection is through grainy images on Skype.

Though Chandru is a designated refugee, the United States won't accept him because of his alleged ties to the Liberation Tamil Tigers Eelam, which many countries consider a terrorist organization.

Chandru, however, insists he never fought with the Tamil Tigers. In fact, the military group caused problems for his family, he said, coming to their home to look for his father, who was a member of the Democratic People's Liberation Front. Repeated threats forced Chandru's father out of the country in 2005. The rest of the family followed in 2007.

Oliver White, spokesman for the Jesuit Refugee Service, said of the 263 Sri Lankan refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok, 15 per cent have links to the Tamil Tigers. Some of those links, however, are very tenuous. ""During the war, if you were Tamil, the LTTE was like a de facto government, so everyone was working [for them] to some various degrees.""

For one refugee, that involved printing banners. ""He never saw active combat, never committed any human-rights violations,"" White said. Yet the man is not eligible for resettlement. It's this group of people who are most likely to get on a boat, he said.

In January, the Canadian government announced it would spend $12 million on anti-human-smuggling operations in Southeast Asia, including $7 million on projects in Thailand. The funds include money to train police, immigration and border patrol officers in Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos.

Refugee advocates say law enforcement and border patrol are not the only answer, however. White said if Canada is going to push governments in Southeast Asia to crack down on human smugglers, it should also pressure those countries to give refugees legal status so they can work and their children can go to school.

Big Picture

""We can do a CSK"" is the line coming out of the Kolkata Knight Riders' camp. However, in contrast to the consistent performances from more than one player that took Chennai Super Kings to consecutive titles in 2010 and 2011, Knight Riders have their shortcomings, evident during their dismal run during last year's Champions League Twenty20 in South Africa, where they earned a solitary (and irrelevant) victory before making an exit.

Annoyingly for Knight Riders, the difficult questions continue to persist. Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, the top two run-makers for Knight Riders, are fighting their individual battles to stay fit and find form. Gambhir, who is also the Knight Riders' captain, remains unsettled after a prolonged drought of runs that forced the Indian selectors to drop him for the home Test series against Australia last month. This tournament will be a litmus test for a cricketer well-known for his determination and character.

The IPL would be the first time Kallis plays active cricket since pulling a hamstring before the final match of the home Test series against Pakistan in February. Kallis who has had several niggles in the past year, failed to excel even in home conditions during the Champions League, compiling just 18 runs. He then failed during the World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka, managing 24 runs in three innings across five matches.

The concerns only heighten with Brendon McCullum yet to join the squad as he is recovering from a hamstring injury. In any case McCullum's stint this season is a short one, since he is scheduled to depart after first week of May to lead New Zealand on their tour of England. Also missing till May 12 would be the Bangladesh allrounder, Shakib Al Hasan, who is set to tour Zimbabwe.

One big reason Knight Riders finished second to the Delhi Daredevils on the points table at the end of the league phase last year was due to their skewed win-loss records home and away. Though they had a fantastic away record with just one defeat in eight matches, they lost four times in seven completed home matches.

So, do Knight Riders reinvent themselves or follow the same path that led them to their maiden crown last season? Finding stability and a balanced team, two main attributes of Super Kings, will be the key for Knight Riders.

Key players

: The main catalyst behind Knight Riders' triumph last season, Narine will be itching to bounce back after being dropped from the home Test series against Zimbabwe owing to an ineffective performance in the away series in Bangladesh. Narine, who bowled an important spell of 3.4-0-9-3 in the World Twenty20 final , could once again be the confounding spinner who proved to be the best bowler of the 2012 season.

L Balaji: Gambhir dedicated the final victory in 2012 to the India and Tamil Nadu seamer, who was forced to sit out the summit clash. Balaji had an economy rate of 5.40 (against T20I career ER of 7.98) as he used his knowledge of bowling on Indian pitches to good effect, cramping the opposition batsmen for width while teasing them with his variations.

Trevor Penney: Not one of the most athletic fielding sides in the IPL, the team management identified that a successful fielding coach, in Penney, who serves in the same role with the Indian team, was necessary.

Big players in

: He was an unknown as recently as two months ago when Knight Riders bought him for an eye-popping $625,000. The idea, the team management said, was to pair him with Narine as the second part of the 'mystery twins'. Senanayanke, a tall Sri Lanka offspinner, is known for his bag of tricks including a good arm ball to which he recently added a lethal doosra.

Big players out

: The young South African fast bowler suffered a stress fracture last June immediately after the IPL and was released by the franchise, who had bought him for $50,000 at the previous year's auction.

Below the radar

: Probably the costliest player on the bench in the history of IPL. Morgan entered the IPL for the first time in 2010 after the Royal Challengers Bangalore bought him for $220,000. Last year the Knight Riders paid $350,000 to buy the England batsman, known for his dynamic batting and match-turning knocks.

The almost 1,000-year-old mela is historically used by farmers and breeders to display and trade pure Kangayam cattle.

The event coincides with the annual temple car festival of the 11th century Vikramacholeesvara temple and the three-century-old Arulmigu Mariamman temple near Kangayam.

K.S.M. Karthikeya, managing trustee of Senaapathy Kangayam Cattle Research Foundation, which is involved in ‘in-situ conservation and breeding’ of genetically pure Kangayam cattle breed for almost six decades, told The Hindu that it was indeed heart-warming that around 60 per cent of the cattle brought by the farmers/breeders to the mela found buyers even in the midst of drought-dominated farming season and got attractive prices.

This year, a single Kangayam bull fetched Rs. 1.18 lakh while a pair of oxen was sold for Rs. 1.63 lakh, he said.

“It has been noticed that most of the buyers are farmers from other region who try hard to promote organic methods of cultivation. Apart from the capability to pull heavy loads, the Kangayam cattle produce urine and dung which are proven alternatives to nitrogenous fertilizers and hence, been preferred,” Mr. Karthikeya said.

The foundation had put up an exhibition ‘Wealth of Yoke’ (extracted from Tamil for ‘Meli sinnam kolai padadhu’) to disseminate the techniques for conserving native species of cattle in the country like Kangayam cattle, Vechur cow, and Bargur cattle, and their grazing areas.","Thu, 25 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12174050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB25--TIRUPURKANGAYAM,"['bull', 'rs', 'kangayam', 'mela', 'cattle', 'lakh', 'genetically', 'karthikeya', 'temple', 'pure', 'fetches', '118', 'oxen']", ,none

Just days after World Water Day, the Canadian government quietly acknowledged last week that it had dropped out of the United Nations anti-drought convention. The move reportedly makes Canada the only nation in the world not party to United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, or Unccd.

The transcript of the exchange can be read here.

Despite the ruling Conservative government’s claim that it had opted out because too little of its contribution was going toward actual anti-drought programming — branding the U.N. convention a “talkfest” in the process — many critics were quick to say the move fits a patten of a conservative party that has opposed environmental regulation.

“It’s just another step Canada moves away from protecting the environment and towards the oil industry,” said John Bennett, executive director of Sierra Club Canada.

The pullout became public during the official question period in Parliament on Thursday, just before the long Easter weekend break.

“The Conservatives are doing tremendous damage to our international reputation,” said Paul Dewar, an M.P. from the New Democratic Party, the official opposition, during the question period.

The reaction to the news in Canada, where many fear the government of Prime Minster Stephen J. Harper is undoing Canada’s reputation for both environmentalism and international cooperation, was as swift as it was damming.

Elizabeth May, leader of Canada’s federal Green Party, compared Canada to North Korea when it comes to environmental law:

So upset Harper pulled us out of another global env treaty. He’s making us a rogue nation. The North Korea of environmental law.#cdnpoIi — Elizabeth May MP (@ElizabethMay) March 28, 2013

“Canada pulling out of the UN Convention on drought is part of a worrisome trend,” wrote Josh Laughren, director of the Climate and Energy Program at WWF-Canada in an email.

But the withdrawal from the Kyoto agreement, muzzling of federal scientists, the funding cuts to the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and a focus on oil and gas exploration are more hotly debated among environmentalists.

“Under the government of Prime Minister Harper there has been a steady erosion of Canada’s contribution to solving global environmental issues like climate change, coupled with sweeping changes that have weakened domestic environmental legislation,” wrote Mr. Laughren.

As we reported on Rendezvous last year, Canada was awarded the Fossil of the Year award by climate activists at the Doha summit meeting.

Canada’s current government is seen as industry-friendly and a strong advocate of oil exploration. While it says it recognizes environmental problems, it has taken the position that industry will find ways to innovate to become greener and that government regulations and new international agreements will replace existing treaties.

Prime Minster Harpercalled the Kyoto Protocol a thing of the past and suggested that as long as China and the United States — the word’s biggest polluters — were not limited by the treaty, Canada’s competitiveness would be hurt by being a part of that framework.

While some Canadians see environmental carelessness in the decision to opt out of the global anti-drought convention, others suspect the government has more sinister motives. The Unccd itself says that 60 percent of Canadian crops are grown in dry areas.

And Maude Barlow, the national chairperson of the Council of Canadians, a social justice organization, asked in a statement, “Is Harper pulling out of this treaty in the hope that doing so removes a key international legal instrument at a time when First Nations are increasingly challenging the legal legitimacy of his government’s legislation, especially in relation to tar sands, mining, and omnibus legislation?”

Canada had supported the Unccd since 1995, and was once seen as one of its strong supporters. Canada’s yearly contribution of roughly 290,000 Canadian dollars (roughly the same in U.S. currency) represents a little more than three percent of the convention’s annual budget.

A statement on the Unccd Web site read, “The Convention is stronger than ever before, which makes Canada’s decision to withdraw from the Convention all the more regrettable.”","Mon, 01 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/01/blogs/01rdv-canada-drought/01rdv-canada-drought-superJumbo.jpg,"['treaty', 'international', 'canadas', 'canada', 'environmental', 'latest', 'unccd', 'change', 'climate', 'convention', 'party', 'harper', 'united']", ,none

27,27,Drought Sri Lanka,Cargo exports from Tiruchi Airport soar - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/cargo-exports-from-tiruchi-airport-soar/article4784252.ece,"AAI officials expect over 50 p.c. growth during current fiscal

Cargo exports from Tiruchi Airport continue to climb up steadily and the Airports Authority of India is expecting over 50 per cent growth during the current financial year. The air cargo terminal here has registered a high of 410 tonnes of cargo during May.

Vegetables and fruits account for a major portion of the volumes, despite the slump in production owing to the drought conditions and the spurt in the price of various vegetables. But for this, the volume would have been much higher, airport sources said.

In March this year, the air cargo terminal had handled 395 tonnes and the figure has touched 410 tonnes in May. The previous high was 313 tonnes handled in January early this year. Cargo exports from the airport had registered 44 per cent growth in 2012-13 and this year the growth is expected to be more than 50 per cent. The cargo terminal handled 2,920 tonnes of cargo in 2012-13 against 2,022 tonnes recorded in the previous financial year. “We expect to handle a minimum of 4,500 tonnes during the current fiscal,” S. Dharmaraj, Airport Director, told The Hindu.

Airport officials attribute the steady growth to increase in uplift capacity, especially after Tiger Airways started lifting cargo from here to Singapore in September last year. Sri Lankan Airlines, Air Asia, and Mihin Lanka, were the other carriers lifting cargo from here. With Air Asia expected to introduce a third daily frequency on the Tiruchi-Kuala Lumpur sector from July, the uplift capacity would increase further, Mr. Dharmaraj said.

Consignments were mainly sent to Kuwait, Dubai, Colombo, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, and Colombo. The export market to Europe was still untapped for want of connectivity, said A. Moorthy, Branch Manager, Skyfield India Pvt. Ltd., a major clearing and forwarding agency in Tiruchi.

“There is much more demand for vegetables and fruits even from Gulf countries. But given the capacity constraints, we could not cater to the demand. If more airlines introduce services to the city, we can export more,” Mr. Moorthy said. The AAI was extending full support with consignments being handled even on Sundays at the cargo terminal, he added. The composition of the cargo exported from Tiruchi was expanding gradually to include readymade garments, fabrics, leather goods, pharma products, fish, and crabs.

However, assorted vegetables and fruits constitute more than 85 per cent of the volumes.

The slump in production caused by drought in the region was impacting on the exports, say some of the exporters. “Even though we don’t mind the price rise, we could not meet the orders fully as we face problems in procurement as production has come down of late,” says a representative of another export agency.","Wed, 05 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['exports', 'tonnes', 'vegetables', 'airport', 'handled', 'cent', 'tiruchi', 'air', 'cargo', 'production', 'growth', 'terminal', 'soar']", ,drought

29,29,Drought Sri Lanka,England looking to end 38-year trophy drought - Stabroek News,https://www.stabroeknews.com/2013/06/23/sports/england-looking-to-end-38-year-trophy-drought/,"(BBC) Captain Alastair Cook hopes England can end a 38-year wait for a major 50-over trophy when they play India in today’s Champions Trophy final at Edgbaston.

England have never won a World Cup or Champions Trophy and will face an unbeaten India.

“It’s very important for us, one of our major goals this summer was to try and win the Champions Trophy,” Cook said.

“Not only will it break that duck of 38 years but prepare us well for the World Cup [in 2015], looking long-term.”

England have won only one ICC global event but that was in the Twenty20 format in 2010.

They have lost three World Cup finals, the last of which was in 1992, and also lost the 2004 Champions Trophy final to West Indies

.

England swing bowler James Anderson is second in the leading wicket-taker table with 10 scalps, only one behind New Zealand’s Mitchell McClenaghan.

Spinner James Tredwell has four wickets in three matches at a cost of 24.25 each and an economy rate of 4.61 per over deputising for Graeme Swann, who took 1-50 from 10 overs in his one match against the Sri Lankans. Cook gave no indication as to who would play in the final but said: “We’re very lucky to have two off-spinners who are outstanding, when one doesn’t play the other one does well and puts pressure on the other guy so Tredders has been given an opportunity and he has taken it just like we knew he would.” Tim Bresnan, who has taken four wickets in three matches, is available for selection having missed the semi-final following the birth of his son, Max Geoffrey.

Bad weather is expected at Edgbaston today and Cook is prepared for a shortened contest. “They’ve got a wealth of Twenty20 experience, they play a lot more than we do but I wouldn’t doubt anyone in our team – we’ve had these shortened games before and adjusted well so if it happens in the final there will be no reason why we can’t adjust,” added Cook.

“We’ve got an opportunity to win a major global trophy, which as a squad doesn’t come around often, so we’re desperate to take it.”

Thirty years ago this month India won their first World Cup and they won the competition again when it was last held in 2011. They are yet to win the Champions Trophy outright, having shared the trophy with Sri Lanka in 2002, and have lost in the first round in each of the last three events but beat England 3-2 when the teams last met in a one-day series in India in January.

Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said: “It’s a very important game, but in this tournament you only face the best of teams, so I think it will be a very good contest. England are a very good side, they know the conditions quite well so I think it will be very good for the spectators – that’s what we want to do, entertain the crowd.”

Asked about the measured style of batting favoured by England’s top three, he said: “They play proper cricket and often you need to see how athings are progressing.

With no reserve day scheduled for the final the tie must be decided on today, meaning an abandonment would result in the teams sharing the trophy.

30,30,Drought Sri Lanka,Feature: Climate Change Report Warns of Dramatically Warmer World This Century - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/11/18/Climate-change-report-warns-dramatically-warmer-world-this-century,"The report, reviewed by some of the world’s top scientists, is being released ahead of the next comprehensive studies by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013/14, and follows the Bank’s own Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change in 2008 (Check out: Development and Climate Change - A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group for FY09-11) and the World Development Report on climate change in 2010. ""Turn Down the Heat"" combines a synthesis of recent scientific literature with new analysis of likely impacts and risks, focusing on developing countries. It chronicles already observed climate change and impacts, such as heat waves and other extreme events, and offers projections for the 21st century for droughts, heat waves, sea level rise, food, water, ecosystems and human health.

The report says today’s climate could warm from the current global mean temperature of 0.8°C above pre-industrial levels, to as high as 4°C by 2100, even if countries fulfill current emissions-reduction pledges.

""This report reinforces the reality that today’s climate volatility affects everything we do,"" said Rachel Kyte, the Bank’s Vice President for Sustainable Development. ""We will redouble our efforts to build adaptive capacity and resilience, as well as find solutions to the climate challenge.""

The World Bank doubled lending for climate change adaptation last year and plans to step up efforts to support countries’ initiatives to mitigate carbon emissions and promote inclusive green growth and climate-smart development. Among other measures, the Bank administers the $7.2 billion Climate Investment Funds now operating in 48 countries and leveraging an additional $43 billion in clean investment and climate resilience.

Rising Sea Levels

The report says sea levels have been rising faster in the last two decades than previously, and this rise is being seen in many tropical regions of the world. This phenomenon is partly due to melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets; the rapid growth in melt area observed since the 1970s in Greenland’s ice sheet is a clear illustration of its increasing vulnerability. Arctic sea ice also reached a record minimum in September 2012. ""There are indications that the greatest melt extent in the past 225 years has occurred in the last decade,"" says the report.

""It’s early yet but clearly some of the small island states and coastal communities are beginning to take a hard look at their options,"" said Erick Fernandes, co-lead of the Bank’s Global Expert Team on Climate Change Adaptation. ""The need to adapt to climate change will increase as global population reaches 9 billion in 2050,"" he added.

Ocean Acidification

Coral reefs are acutely sensitive to changes in water temperature and acidity levels. The report warns that by the time the warming levels reach 1.4° C in 2030s, coral reefs may stop growing. This would be a result of oceans becoming more acidic as a result of higher CO2 concentrations. And with 2.4° C, coral reefs in several areas may actually start to dissolve. This is likely to have profound consequences for people who depend on them for food, income, tourism and shoreline protection.

Heat Extremes

A 4°C warmer world would also suffer more extreme heat waves, and these events will not be evenly distributed across the world, according to the report.

Sub-tropical Mediterranean, northern Africa, the Middle East, and the contiguous United States are likely to see monthly summer temperatures rise by more than 6°C. Temperatures of the warmest July between 2080-2100 in the Mediterranean are expected to approach 35°C – about 9°C warmer than the warmest July estimated for the present day. The warmest July month in the Sahara and the Middle East will see temperatures as high as 45°C, or 6-7°C above the warmest July simulated for the present day.

Lower agricultural yields

Hotter weather could in turn lower crop yields in a 4°C world—raising concerns about future food security. Field experiments have shown that crops are highly sensitive to temperatures above certain thresholds. One study cited in the report found that each “growing degree day” spent at a temperature of 30 degrees decreases yields by 1% under drought-free rain-fed conditions.

The report also says drought-affected areas would increase from 15.4% of global cropland today, to around 44% by 2100. The most severely affected regions in the next 30 to 90 years will likely be in southern Africa, the United States, southern Europe and Southeast Asia, says the report. In Africa, the report predicts 35% of cropland will become unsuitable for cultivation in a 5°C world.

Risks to Human Support Systems

The report identifies severe risks related to adverse impacts on water availability, particularly in northern and eastern Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. River basins like the Ganges and the Nile are particularly vulnerable. In Amazonia, forest fires could as much double by 2050. The world could lose several habitats and species with a 4°C warming.

Non-linear impacts

As global warming approaches and exceeds 2°C, there is a risk of triggering nonlinear tipping elements. Examples include the disintegration of the West Antarctic ice sheet leading to more rapid sea-level rise, or large-scale Amazon dieback drastically affecting ecosystems, rivers, agriculture, energy production, and livelihoods. This would further add to 21st-century global warming and impact entire continents.

The projected 4°C warming simply must not be allowed to occur—the heat must be turned down. Only early, cooperative, international actions can make that happen.","Sun, 18 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['4c', 'world', 'warns', 'report', 'heat', 'century', 'change', 'climate', 'dramatically', 'global', 'warming', 'warmest', 'warmer', 'development']", ,drought

Their informal settlements cling to riverbanks and cluster in low-lying areas with poor drainage, few public services, and no protection from storm surges, sea-level rise, and flooding.

These communities – the poor in coastal cities and on low-lying islands – are among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change and the least able to marshal the resources to adapt, a new report finds. They face a world where climate change will increasingly threaten the food supplies of Sub-Saharan Africa and the farm fields and water resources of South Asia and South East Asia within the next three decades, while extreme weather puts their homes and lives at risk.

A new scientific report commissioned by the World Bank and released on June 19 explores the risks to lives and livelihoods in these three highly vulnerable regions. Turn Down the Heat: Climate Extremes, Regional Impacts, and the Case for Resilience (Read it in Issuu, Scribd, Open Knowledge Repository) takes the climate discussion to the next level, building on a 2012 World Bank report that concluded from a global perspective that without a clear mitigation strategy and effort, the world is headed for average temperatures 4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times by the end of this century.

Small number, big problem

Communities around the world are already feeling the impacts of climate change today, with the planet only 0.8 ºC warmer than in pre-industrial times. Many of us could experience the harsher impacts of a 2ºC warmer world within our lifetimes – 20 to 30 years from now – and 4ºC is likely by the end of the century without global action.

The report lays out what these temperature increases will look like, degree-by-degree, in each targeted region and the damage anticipated for agricultural production, coastal cities, and water resources.

“The scientists tell us that if the world warms by 2°C – warming which may be reached in 20 to 30 years – that will cause widespread food shortages, unprecedented heat-waves, and more intense cyclones,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. ""In the near-term, climate change, which is already unfolding, could batter the slums even more and greatly harm the lives and the hopes of individuals and families who have had little hand in raising the Earth's temperature.”

The report, based on scientific analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics, uses advanced computer simulations to paint the clearest picture of each region’s vulnerabilities. It describes the risks to agriculture and livelihood security in Sub-Saharan Africa; the rise in sea-level, loss of coral reefs and devastation to coastal areas likely in South East Asia; and the fluctuating water resources in South Asia that can lead to flooding in some areas and water scarcity in others, as well as affecting power supply.

“The second phase of this report truly reiterates our need to bring global attention to the tasks necessary to hold warming to 2ºC,” said Rachel Kyte, the Bank’s vice president for sustainable development. “Our ideas at the World Bank have already been put into practice as we move forward to assist those whose lives are particularly affected by extreme weather events.”","Wed, 19 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['coastal', 'world', 'report', 'water', 'change', 'climate', 'south', 'means', 'lives', 'bank', 'poor', 'asia', 'africa']", ,flood_and_drought

Power-hungry. Unsophisticated. And now - two additions: Crass and Heartless.Water. That's all that Bhaiyya Deshmukh, a poor farmer from Solapur - one of the worst drought-hit districts in Maharashtra - was demanding, sitting on his nearly two-month long protest at Azad Maidan in Mumbai. But Mr Pawar thought it was fine to ridicule and mock a demand that not only Mr Deshmukh but millions of Maharashtrians are making.

( Watch So where does this ""I-am-King-you-are-Slave"" attitude spring from?

Those close to him claim, his ""no-nonsense"" temperament and frankness are misinterpreted as ""arrogance"".

His speeches were laced with the choicest of Marathi-abuses.)Others insist, intoxicated by power, the 53-year-old, no longer enjoys an easy relationship with his uncle, the super-shrewd Sharad Pawar. No wonder he also doesn't get along with Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan or even many of the senior members of his own party, the NCP.As Ajit Pawar nurses his political dreams, what he fears most is the 'shame' of failure. It was largely under his leadership that Rs 70,000 crores were spent on irrigation projects which yielded little relief from the acute water scarcity. The media, activists and the opposition all screamed of a scam and he resigned from his post only to be re-instated after a farcical white paper ""cleared"" him. He also holds the Finance portfolio and the state today is reeling under a staggering debt which is nearing Rs 3 lakh crores.This ugly new ""crude"" tag will stick to the man, but despite this current outrage and his failures, Mr Pawar will get re-elected in 2014. And he knows that. We chose the man we really deserve.But just a reminder: to have some finesse in speech, to be able to converse also in English, to have a genuine interest in arts and culture and a mind refined enough for intellectual debates, are not qualities the electorate are hoping to see in our politicians.

With the ground water table depleting rapidly in view of the drought like conditions, Tiruchi Corporation has just begun to dig additional borewells on the river bed. Next summer, it will most likely be spared of the trouble. Just a few metres downstream the place where the borewells are being dug up, men and machines are working at a feverish pace building a check dam that is expected to put an end to the worries of the city water managers caused by the drying of the borewells.

The city’s water sources on the river bed are mostly likely to be surrounded by water retained by the check dam once water is released from Mettur reservoir for the next irrigation season.

Though it dealt a blow to the farmers in the delta, the early end to the irrigation season last year owing to insufficient storage at Mettur dam provided an extended window to the public works authority to expedite the construction of the check dam near Kambarasampettai, just a few metres away from the city’s main water sources.

Work has been in full swing since December after the water dried up in the river. Although the work is scheduled for completion only in February next year, as per the contract, nearly 75 per cent of the work has already been completed.

PWD sources told The Hindu that they were hoping to complete all the works on the river bed by the end of June, before release of water from Mettur the next irrigation season, barring unusual heavy rain during the summer. “We are working towards completing 95 per cent of the project works by the end of June. Effectively, all works on check dam structure on the river bed will have been completed by then, though strengthening of the river bunds on both sides will take a couple of more months,” said a PWD officer.

The check dam was sanctioned at a cost of Rs.32 crore following a public outcry over the heavy exploitation of the river bed for a slew of drinking water schemes catering to the needs of various cities and towns as far as Ramanathapuram. Farmers of the region have been left worried over the drastic fall in water table during the summer months.

The structure will run for a length of 550 metres and stand about 1.5 metres in height from the bed level. It will head up water for a stretch of 1.50 km upstream and provide a continuous wetting of the river bed so as to keep the drinking water collector wells sufficiently recharged, especially in the summer. The check dam will also help recharge ground water table for a radius of about four to five km. Construction of the apron, the cut-off and toe walls has been completed. The body and retaining walls are being built currently. Once this is completed, six sand vents will be built.","Fri, 05 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12159397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY03CHECK_DAM5,"['river', 'bed', 'dam', 'works', 'end', 'check', 'summer', 'metres', 'ready', 'cauvery', 'water', 'irrigation']", ,drought

(Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress.)

The Dust Bowl, which crippled the American plains during the 1930s, is considered one of the worst man-made environmental catastrophes in American history.

In his latest film, director Ken Burns tells the story of the migrant farmers who in the early 20th century moved to an area of Oklahoma once called “No Man’s Land.""

With infrequent rain, this part of the country was a risky place to eke out a living, but in the 1920s the southern plains experienced an unusual wet spell and a boom in wheat production followed. Millions of acres of soil were plowed for the first time and virgin grasslands were converted to wheat fields.

But as booms are wont to do, the boom eventually went bust and those who remained in the region struggled to survive through a decade of drought and a series of devastating dust storms.

Historian Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, in Burn’s film following the ""Great Plow-Up,"" called the steps that led to those dust storms one of ""the worst sustained environmental disasters in American history.""

“It’s not something that happens in just one year, it’s not something that just lasts for three or four years, it’s a decade,"" she said. ""Because of the combination of extreme drought and extreme high temperatures, this is the worst 10-year period in recorded history on the plains.”

Burns' new film, ""The Dust Bowl,"" airs on PBS on today and Monday. Burns is renowned for his prowess in documentary film-making, including The Civil War, Baseball, The War and Prohibition.

""This film is filled with folks in their late 80s and early 90s, and it is our habit, particularly in our media culture to see them as some sort of fading dinosaurs,"" Burns said. ""But in fact if you look through that, you realize you're looking at children, and teenagers, who are the last living witnesses, the last living survivors, to the worst man-made ecological disaster in American history — the dust bowl.""

The story of the dust bowl has a lot of resonance today, about the consequences of human actions on the climate, and the tragedy that it can cause, he said.

""You realize, as Faulkner said, that history is not was, but is,"" Burns said.","Fri, 16 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/open_graph/public/migration/PriMigrationsVivvoFilesImagesMigration/pri.org/files/620372Florentine_Films_S7737_long_image_610099218.jpeg?itok=YMs9vpYZ,"['disaster', 'looks', 'environmental', 'worst', 'film', 'ken', 'living', 'sustained', 'dust', 'american', 'history', 'burns', 'war', 'documentary', 'bowl', 'wheat']", ,drought

= Gotabaya goes to New Delhi as govt. partners move to repeal 13th Amendment View(s): View(s):

World attention will be on Sri Lanka again on Thursday November 1. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva will review the country’s record during a three and half hour session beginning 2.30 p.m.

Like for all other 193 member countries of the UN, the event is routine. Every four or five years, the human rights record of members is reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a mechanism which the UN believes improves the situation on the ground. However, for Sri Lanka the event is significant for many other reasons.

Three months after this event, in March next year, the UNHRC is set to review matters related to the US-backed resolution on Sri Lanka. This was adopted in March this year at the 19th sessions. Issues there extended from alleged human rights violations to probing “extrajudicial killings”. How the government responded to them is due to come up for scrutiny in March next year. In the light of this, several western nations are watching the UPR sessions closely. Their interest has been heightened by what they believe are newer developments in Sri Lanka including ‘alleged state interference in the judiciary,’ ‘no forward movement’ in the government’s reconciliation efforts and media freedom issues among other matters.

It comes as the cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary showed clear signs of heating up. This was after Pradeepa Gamini Suraj Kariyawasam of 170 Lake Drive, Colombo 8, was indicted before the Colombo Magistrate’s Court for causing a loss of more than Rs. 391 million to the government and for alleged corruption. The former chairman of the National Savings Bank (NSB) is the husband of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. He had earlier served as chairman of the Insurance Corporation of Sri Lanka.

The UPR itself has also sent ripples in government circles. These are over questions on the possible role of India, which is heading a troika that will prepare the report of the Working Group once the discussion on Thursday is over. It may be recalled that India voted for the US-backed resolution in March this year.

As revealed in the political commentary last week, relations between Colombo and New Delhi have hit a new low, largely due to that vote. The measures government leaders contemplated in the past weeks including the repeal of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution caused serious concerns in India. Under such circumstances, New Delhi’s role at UNHRC’s 22nd sessions in March next year is cause for study by the government. Though belatedly, some measures to rectify the situation have got under way as tensions continue to remain.

The current sessions of the UNHRC began on October 22 and will continue till November 5. Until last Thursday, the human rights records of eight countries have been reviewed. They were the Czech Republic, Argentina, Gabon, Ghana, Ukraine, Guatemala, Benin and the Republic of Korea.

Tomorrow (Monday) the case of Switzerland will come up followed by Pakistan and Zambia. Japan will follow on Wednesday. Besides Sri Lanka, the case of Peru will also be taken up on Thursday. Of significant interest during the current sessions is the fact that the largest number of speakers, 99 of them, want to address the Council on Sri Lanka’s case.

As a result, each speaker has been allotted only a minute and 22 seconds. This is the lowest among the time limits allotted. In the case of Peru where 55 speakers have registered so far with the Palais des Nationes, two minutes are allowed per speaker. Among the four countries on which NGOs, including those based in Colombo, are conducting meetings in Geneva on the sidelines of the UPR process, is Sri Lanka. Others are Guatemala, Japan and Pakistan.

A total of 42 UN member countries are reviewed each year during three Working Group sessions dedicated to 14 countries each. Already presented to the UNHRC is Sri Lanka’s national report which recalls the assurances given by the government during sessions in 2008, the action taken so far and the newer developments. India which heads a troika together with Spain and Benin will prepare the report of the Working Group.

Before the review, they will receive the written questions and/or representations on an issue raised by UNHRC members and relay it to the Sri Lanka delegation. Their report will contain a full account of the proceedings, and will be formulated with the involvement of Sri Lanka delegation and Secretariat staff. India will introduce the report on November 5 between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. The troika usually consists of three countries’ delegates assisting the review. They are picked by the drawing of lots from among UNHRC members and different troikas function for different countries.

Overshadowing the government’s concerns over UPR, are domestic issues. On Thursday, detectives of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) filed plaint against Kariyawasam before the Colombo Chief Magistrate, Rashmi Singappulli. The complainant in this case is Lakshmi Jayawickrema, Director General of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption. Upon a detailed statement she had made to the CID, detectives said Kariyawasam has been charged with “causing a loss of Rs 391,137,554.33 to the state due to the transaction of purchasing 7,863,362 shares of The Finance Company during the period March 14, 2012 to May 3, 2012.”

This was whilst Kariyawasam was serving as chairman of the National Savings Bank. He is also accused of corruption for allegedly recommending his own name and that of Shan Chandrasekeran Shanmuganathan to be appointed as members of the Board of Directors of The Finance Company. According to the plaint, the offence had allegedly been committed on April 27, 2012 or on a date close to it. The Court has directed Kariyawasam to appear before it on February 28 next year — four months away.

In May, President Mahinda Rajapaksa ordered the cancellation of a stock exchange deal where the NSB had purchased 7,863,362 shares of The Finance Company. It was at a price of Rs 49.74 per share when it was claimed that the price of shares was as low as Rs 30. The NSB had paid Rs 391 million, though the transfer of the funds was reportedly halted. Compounding the situation was a full page advertisement the NSB directors inserted in the national media thereafter. In that, they declared they had decided not to pay NSB money and that the decision has been conveyed to the Treasury. Despite a public outcry then for a full-fledged investigation to expose all those involved, a probe by CID detectives came amidst growing tensions between the Executive and the Judiciary. In a front page report in the Sunday Times of September 23 the Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption, retired Supreme Court Justice Jagath Balapatabendi, declined to comment on why this particular inquiry was being fast tracked.

The plaint has listed 51 documents and 26 witnesses. Among these are:

Documents submitted by Taprobane Securities (Pvt) Ltd to the National Savings Bank (NSB) to purchase shares of The Finance Company.

A letter addressed to Shan Shanmuganathan by the NSB Chairman on 21.03.2012.

The news of Kariyawasam’s indictment was the talking point in Hulftsdorp, the nerve centre of the country’s legal profession and the judiciary. It came in the backdrop of persistent speculation that plans were under way by the government to impeach the Chief Justice, a claim which was denied by some government ministers.

However, the matter did come up for discussion when a team of ministers and legal advisors to the government met at ‘Temple Trees’ late last month to determine a course of action. This is in the aftermath of a three-page statement issued by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). In that, the JSC, referring to their Chairman and two members (Chief Justice and two Supreme Court Judges) said they were invited for a meeting with the President. It alleged that there was “interference in the judiciary” and said there was “proof” of such instances. However, the charge was strongly refuted by the Presidential Secretariat which said the invitation was to discuss “budgetary allocations” and matters relating to “scholarships for judges”.

Several leading lawyers in Hulftsdorp were speculating whether the indictment of Kariyawasam, either by design or otherwise, was intended to trigger any resignations in the higher echelons of the judiciary. However, legal sources close to the judiciary discounted such a possibility on the grounds that “those in the highest levels of the judiciary have no cause to resort to such a course of action.

They will continue in office.” One highly placed source said, “Any such move would only endorse” what he called “allegations even before they are proved in a court of law.” In the light of this, even moves by some influential sections to force the resignation of the JSC Secretary Manjula Tilakaratna have not been successful. An informal plea had been made by a member of the judiciary, an official source said.

External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris, who was given a telling off last month by the President for his advice on the sharp differences between the Executive and the Judiciary, told Parliament that Tilakaratna’s appointment was “unconstitutional” but did not explain why the government had allowed him to remain in that office for more than a year. Tilakaratna was previously Assistant Secretary and later Deputy Secretary of the JSC, both for a cumulative period of three years. The Sunday Times learnt that much before Tilakaratna, who is said to be 29th on the list of succession, another candidate, the brother of a former Chief Justice who was also 29th, served as Secretary to the JSC.

The bone of contention that brought tensions between the Executive and the Judiciary to the fore, it is now confirmed, is the Divineguma Bill. The Supreme Court ruled last month that “we make a determination in terms of Article 120 read with Article 123 of the Constitution that the Bill in question is in respect of matters set out in the Provincial Council List and shall not become law unless it has been referred by His Excellency the President to every Provincial Council as required by Article 154 (G) (3) of the Constitution.” The Bill was introduced in Parliament on September 18. The Sunday Times has learnt that an initiative for the Attorney General to move for a revision on that (September 18) morning, before the SC determination was read out by the Speaker, Chamal Rajapaksa, later that afternoon, did not materialise. Hence, the government heeded the SC ruling and sought the approval of all Provincial Councils for the Bill. A controversy arose over Northern Province Governor G.A. Chandrasiri, approving it in the absence of an elected Northern Provincial Council.

That the timing of the indictment of Kariyawasam came in a week when the Supreme Court was hearing the cases of eleven petitioners and around ten intervenient petitioners over the Divineguma Bill has also given rise to many opinions in legal circles. One of the points discussed was a Sunday Times news item in its front page on October 7 quoting an unnamed member of the Bribery and Corruption Commission saying that after recording Kariyawasam’s statement the investigations had revealed that there was no case to file. The story remained un-contradicted.

The fundamental rights cases before the Supreme Court sitting as the country’s Constitutional Court were heard by a bench comprising Chief Justice Bandaranayake, Justice Nimal Gamini Ameratunga and Justice K. Sripavan. Six petitioners challenged the Divineguma Bill saying it was inconsistent with the Constitution. They wanted the court to determine whether it needed to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament and approved by the people at a referendum to become law.

There were petitioners who supported the Bill as well. They intervened to argue that the Bill is consistent with the Constitution; therefore, only it needed to be passed by a simple majority in Parliament.

The court directed the counsel to file comprehensive written submissions as early as possible on Wednesday (October 24) morning.

Thereafter, the Court declared it would send its determination to the President and the Speaker within the time period stipulated in the Constitution.

On Monday (October 22) the Supreme Court also put off for November 12 the reference made to it by the Court of Appeal regarding the questions of law that arose consequent to the hearing of a case in the Court of Appeal filed by Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Mavai Senathirajah.

When sittings resume, the Court would consider appointing a five-judge Bench to determine and interpret these questions of law; whether the governor of a province could include in his expression of opinion, the views of the Provincial Council, when the Council stands dissolved and also whether such interpretation and determination of the constitutionality comes within Article 125 of the Constitution which empowers the Supreme Court to interpret and determine such references. M. A. Sumanthiran, a TNA MP and Counsel for Senathirajah, requested the Supreme Court to refer this to a five-Judge Bench.

The cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary also drew the attention of the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI). A statement issued by it on Friday night from London said:

“In a confidential letter to the President of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Mr Mahinda Rajapaksa, and to the Sri Lankan authorities, the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute (IBAHRI) expressed grave concern about recent threats to the independence of the judiciary and called for the rule of law to be adhered to, and promoted, in Sri Lanka.

“The letter follows disturbing reports of a physical attack on the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), Manjula Tilakaratne, on 7 October 2012 at a time of reported heightened tension between the JSC – an independent body made up of members of the judiciary that deal with all judicial promotions and appointments – and the Sri Lankan Government. The attack is widely perceived as an attempt to intimidate the judiciary and interfere with the independence of the profession.

“Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, Co-Chair of the IBAHRI said: ‘We consider the recently reported attack on the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission in Sri Lanka to be extremely serious, requiring prompt and proper investigation by the appropriate authorities.’ Elaborating, Baroness Kennedy QC added, ‘An independent judiciary functions as a critical institutional mechanism providing a check and balance on the executive and legislative branches of a democratic society. The independence of this organ is vital, not only to ensure that the judiciary is able to discharge its functions without fear or favour, but also to uphold public confidence in the legal system as a whole and the due administration of justice���..’

“Sternford Moyo Co-Chair of the IBAHRI said, ‘We appeal to the Sri Lankan authorities to prevent the harassment and intimidation of judges and magistrates in accordance with Article 111 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which provides that judges will be protected in the exercise of their judicial powers and functions’. He added,’The need to develop and preserve an independent judiciary free from political influence and with adequate guarantees to maintain its impartiality is of prime importance to the protection of the rule of law. As a member state of the United Nations Sri Lanka is a signatory to the Basic principles on the Independence of the Judiciary which states that “the independence of the judiciary shall be guaranteed by the State”and that “it is the duty of all governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary.”

Meanwhile, on Friday, the government hurriedly disassociated itself from calls by some ministers for the repeal of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Most vociferous among them were Jathika Hela Urumaya frontliner and Minister Champika Ranawaka, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna leader and Minister Dinesh Gunawardene and National Freedom Front leader and Minister Wimal Weerawansa. Their parties launched campaigns after remarks supporting the repeal were first made by Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. He left for New Delhi on Tuesday and returned to Colombo on Thursday. His visit was in connection with annual consultations in the field of defence, security and other bilateral matters for which arrangements have been going on for many weeks now. The event, however, coincided within the week he made the call for the repeal of the 13th Amendment, a by-product of the controversial Indo-Lanka Agreement of 1987.

The move to repeal the 13th Amendment caused serious concerns in New Delhi. According to diplomatic sources, both in Colombo and in New Delhi, the Indian government considered any action to repeal the amendment as “unilateral” and held the view that such steps could force similar responses from them. They could cover issues where India has already ceded to Sri Lanka’s requests. Such a development, one need hardly say, would have escalated the cold war and the shadow boxing that is now going on between Colombo and New Delhi. The Sunday Times learns that Indian authorities raised the matter with Defence Secretary Rajapaksa but no details of what transpired were available.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa who returned to Colombo after a visit to Dubai on Wednesday night asked official government spokesperson and Minister Keheliya Rambukwella to make clear that there was no government decision to go ahead with the repeal of the 13th Amendment. First, parts of the transcript of what he said:

“Q: There are conflicting reports on the Government’s position on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution with the Defence Secretary saying that it should be abolished. What is the Government’s position?

“A: The Thirteenth Amendment is a part of our Constitution and those of us in Parliament and the government are bound by the Constitution. But Constitutions can get amended. Sometimes we are mocked at saying we have amended the Constitution 18 times but the Indian Constitution has been amended more than 200 times and India is the world’s largest democracy. It is not a question that affects democracy. A Constitution can be amended from time to time to suit the requirements of that country. The Thirteenth Amendment is clearly a part of the Constitution but people’s representatives in Parliament are entitled to air their views on it. I think the Defence Secretary has spoken in his capacity as a public official and more as the Secretary to the Ministry of Urban Development. It has been said several times that there have been some issues in that area.

“Q: What is the final decision on the 13th Amendment?

“A: There is no move by anyone to bring it before the Cabinet or bring about a policy change. They have expressed an opinion. There is nothing official.

“Q: That means as at present the government supports the 13th Amendment?

“A: It is not a question of support. It is part of the Constitution and we are all bound by it.

“Q: The Government, in the past has spoken of 13 plus? Where does it stand on that?

“A: The government has said we are looking at 13 plus. The plus was related to the establishment of a Senate or the Upper House. Even I was present with his Excellency the President when he announced it to the Hon. Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh. I was present personally there. My President said that 13 plus �.what we are looking at is the Upper House. The idea is to bring the minorities from various provinces to the centre.

“Q: What happens if the TNA does not come to the PSC, the national issue will not be solved, how does the government hope to proceed from there?

“A: As a main opposition party the TNA will be given the opportunity and thereafter if they do not come the government will have to take its own decisions. The government will have to decide on the most suitable way of resolving the problem.”

Spokesperson Rambukwella admits that he was a witness when President Rajapaksa assured Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2010 that the 13th Amendment would be implemented and there would be a “Plus” or more in the form of a Senate. He is now categorical, at least for the moment, that the 13th Amendment would remain notwithstanding all the pressures to repeal it.

It was only in January this year Indian External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna, who submitted his resignation on Friday ahead of an impending cabinet reshuffle this weekend in New Delhi, told a news conference in Colombo that during talks with President Rajapaksa, he had agreed to enforce the 13th Amendment and go beyond it. Minister G.L. Peiris had been asked for confirmation of the President’s promise to go beyond the 13th Amendment before Krishna made that announcement in Colombo, and Peiris had confirmed the statement. However, Rajapaksa, during a meeting with national newspaper editors soon after the Krishna visit while confirming that he had said so, added the rider that the ‘plus’ to the 13th Amendment needs to be decided by Parliament.

If some partners of the UPFA are in favour of repealing the 13th Amendment, there are others who are opposed to it. One is the Communist Party of Sri Lanka (CPSL). Its leader and Senior Minister D.E.W. Gunasekera told the Sunday Times, “The 13th Amendment came as a result of the interest shown by India to disarm the militant groups including the LTTE. One of aspects of the 13th Amendment was the expansion of democracy. The objective of this was to devolve powers to the north and east. Eventually this system was introduced to the entire country’.

“In fact I asked the former President J.R. Jayewardene as to why he introduced this to the entire country. His response was that he did not want to see the same thing that happened to S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike happening to him. I am the only member who was in the opposition who voted in favour of this amendment. But due to the conflict, the people in the North and East did not benefit from this amendment. It is only now the people in the East have started benefiting from the powers. The President has promised that elections will be held in the north and similar powers will be given to them.

“I cannot understand why some of the members in the Government are campaigning to abolish the 13th Amendment after the President gave an assurance that elections will be held in the Northern Province. It is very important that we suggest an alternative, if we want to abolish the 13thAmendment. I do not see any benefit in scrapping the 13th Amendment. I think it is a disadvantage to abolish this now. Abolishing this would only justify the struggle carried out by the armed groups during the conflict’.

However, Vijitha Herath, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian for Gampaha District, held a different view. He told the Sunday Times, “The call for abolishing the 13th Amendment is similar to a tele-drama. It is directed by the same director with the old actors. Some people in the Government including Cabinet spokesperson Keheliya Rambukwella are saying they have no plans to abolish the 13th Amendment while the others in the government are campaigning to do so.

“One of the reasons is the issue in getting the Divineguma Bill passed in the Northern Provincial Council which has not been constituted. This is a direct message to the Judiciary. That is to say that the Provincial Councils are something which is not necessary, though the Supreme Court wanted the approval of all Provincial Councils for the Bill.

“Also the Budget is coming up on November 8. Our understanding is that it only has the details of the debts and the loans. There is nothing beneficial to the people. Therefore they have started a new debate on the need to abolish the 13th Amendment. The Northern Provincial Council elections are due. It is obvious that the elections will be unfavourable to the Government. Bringing up this campaign would lead to a delay in conducting the elections as the government will now claim there is a debate whether the Provincial Council system is needed. Our opinion is that the 13th Amendment is not a solution to the ethnic problem and therefore a solution which offers equality and grants the rights of all communities should be offered”.

With only two months to go for a new year, the government is burdened with several issues. Even if the budget offers relief in some form, the public have to cope with a number of price increases announced in the past weeks. It takes away from one hand what is given by the other. On the international front, human rights issues remain a scourge.

Momentarily at least, efforts are being made to revert to the status quo ante where Sri Lanka-India relations are concerned. Now, the cold war between the Executive and the Judiciary has heightened. With all this, the Mahinda Rajapaksa administration seems completely undeterred. Why not, when a lame duck opposition’s silence has become deafening on most issues thus negating the checks and balances needed in a healthy democracy.

38,38,Drought Sri Lanka,Vincent's hits from voices of four generations | The Sundaytimes Sri Lanka - The Sunday Times Sri Lanka,http://www.sundaytimes.lk/121028/magazine/vincents-hits-from-voices-of-four-generations-18069.html,"Vincent’s hits from voices of four generations View(s):

Vincent de Paul Peiris, a gifted singer who rendered his voice to some of the evergreen hits like ‘Siripade Samanala Kanda Pene’ and ‘Bicycale Bicycale’ will return to perform a musical evening at 6.30 pm on Sunday, November 4 at the British School Auditorium, Colombo 8.

The most significant feature of this show is that Vincent will entertain his fans together with his children, grand children and great grand children on the same stage.

‘Siripade’, the musical evening will be performed by Vincent’s son and daughter Illonka, Anil, grand children Peshani, Amalika, Duwaine, Anarkalie, Lakindu, Shenal, Shion and Shioni and great grandchildren Ayani, Senuja, Deandra and Devorah.

The show will be compeered by Vijaya Corea while talented musician Dinesh Subasinghe is to handle the music.

Vincent a singing legend made his first appearance on stage singing in all three languages at a concert organized in aid of the war effort on December 15, 1940. There he had entertained Lord Louis Mountbatten and soldiers with his voice and a solo rendition on the Hawaiian guitar. He then joined then Radio Ceylon in 1949, Vincent was the only person to host two programmes, western and oriental. Vincent’s ability to yodel and sing western classics earned him the moniker ‘The Gay Yodeler’.

With the aim to render original Sri Lankan songs at a time when the identity of Sri Lankan music was being experimented, Vincent opted to become an oriental singer when Radio Ceylon granted him the option of hosting either western or oriental musical programmes.

Finance minister O Panneerselvam in his Budget speech said despite all the pressures, no new tax would be imposed nor would there be any hike in the existing taxes.

Despite agriculture, manufacturing and services sectors facing a crisis in the wake of a drought situation, economic slowdown and other issues, the government had decided not to burden the public, he said.

The recent fuel price increase had put pressure on public transportation, which is suffering a huge loss. For 2013-14, Rs 500 crore has been allocated in the Budget.

Food subsidy has also been increased to Rs 4,900 crore and it has been decided to double the price stabilisation fund to Rs 100 crore. The fund has been constituted to extend interest-free financial support to cooperative societies for market intervention. The finance minister said this would enable the cooperatives to procure select commodities during abnormal price rise and sell them through cooperative outlets at cost price to the public.

While attributing the rise in essential commodities price to diesel price hike, the minister said the corpus would be increased to Rs 100 crore.

Industries

The state government has set a target to attract investments worth Rs 1.90 lakh crore over the next 10 years in southern districts and would introduce new incentives.

Besides, State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (Sipcot) will set up a land bank with 25,000 acres for industrialisation purpose. A new ship building project and manufacturing zones are also on the cards.

The government is also planning to join hands with industries to train youths.

Infrastructure

Panneerselvam said power projects worth Rs 21,000 crore would be taken up to address the demand.

These include 1,980 Mw power projects at Ennore and a 2X660 Mw project at Udangudi. Work on these would be taken up in 2013-14. At present, the state is facing a power shortage of 4,000 Mw. Besides, he said MoUs were signed to buy 226 MW of power from solar farms.

The state government has also given approval for restructuring loans. Of the Rs 12,213 crore short-term loan of the state electricity board, 50 per cent will be absorbed by the state. The board had a debt of Rs 45,000 crore, towards which Rs 7,913.35 crore was allotted in 2011-12 and in 2012-13 Rs 11,242 crore was allotted to pay back the debt. It has also given guarantee for the board to raise Rs 10,000 crore from REC and Power Finance Corporation.

The state has allotted Rs 2,000 crore for infrastructure development and said 60 per cent of the other infrastructure development planned would be taken up by private participants. A sum of Rs 750 crore has been allotted for the metro rail project.

Taxes



The state has already started feeling the pinch of the economic slowdown as seen in a lower growth in gross state domestic product (GSDP). The GSDP, according to the Advance Estimates for 2012-2013, is only 4.61 per cent at constant prices.

“The severe drought and crop failure have hit us badly in the primary sector, which has ultimately affected the service sector growth as well. The general economic slowdown in the national economy and shortage of power have hampered growth in the manufacturing sector,” said the minister.

It put forward a medium-term fiscal plan for the period between 2013 and 2016, expecting the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio at 2.71 in 2015-16.

The government has set an overall target for the state’s own taxes at Rs 86,065.4 crore, with a projected growth rate of 17 per cent over the revised estimates for 2012-13. The estimates for commercial taxes, excise duty and motor vehicles taxes are Rs 56,025.24 crore, Rs 14,469.87 crore and Rs 4,881.15 crore respectively. Public debt was restricted to Rs 15,675 crore in 2012-13, even thought the state had an eligibility to raise net public borrowing to Rs 20,716 crore in 2012-13.

“The net borrowing is lower than the projected capital expenditure, showing that this entire borrowing is going to finance capital expenditure alone,” said the minister. The government proposes a net borrowing of Rs 21,142 crore to finance its

capital works during 2013-14 as against the approved limit of Rs 24,263 crore.

Projects revenue surplus of Rs 664 cr

During 2013-14, the government is projecting a revenue surplus of Rs 664.06 crore and a fiscal deficit of Rs 22,938.57 crore. The fiscal deficit will be 2.84 per cent of the GSDP, even as the stipulated norm for fiscal deficit to GSDP is three per cent. For the fiscal 2012-13, the revenue surplus was projected at Rs 2,376 crore. However, owing to increased expenditure commitments, especially to revive Tangedco and the substantial reduction in receipts from the Government of India, the revised estimate now stands at Rs 451.52 crore. The fiscal deficit has been restricted to Rs 19,889.31 crore, around 2.88 per cent of the GSDP, he said. Principal Secretary - finance, K Shanmugam, later told reporters the interest portion alone was Rs 10,754 crore in 2012-13 of the total Rs 1.21 lakh crore and in 2013-14 the interest payment will be Rs 13,584 crore, an increase of around 27 per cent. This was mainly due to state government’s decision to absorb TNEB’s Rs 6,000 crore. The total revenue receipts of the state government are estimated at Rs 118,579.87 crore in 2013-2014. The revenue expenditure in 2013-2014 is estimated at Rs 1,17,915.81 crore, which shows a growth of 15 per cent over revised estimates 2012-2013.

The size of Tamil Nadu Plan during the 12th Plan period has been pegged at Rs 2.11 lakh crore. The outcome of the entire planning process will be eradication of poverty, creation of more and better job opportunities and overall improvement in the quality of life, Panneerselvam said.

The state will exceed the annual Plan target of Rs 28,000 crore in 2012-13 and the allocation has been increased to Rs 37,000 crore in 2013-14.

Around Rs 17,220.89 crore has been kept as overall allocation for the primary sector, an increase of 20.12 per cent, in the Budget estimates for 2013-14. Agriculture has got the highest-ever allocation of Rs 5,189.15 crore during 2013-14, over the current year's Rs 4,829.93 crore.

The crop loan target under the co-operative sector would be stepped up from the present Rs 4,000 crore to Rs 4,500 crore in the next fiscal. During 2013-14, the government has allocated Rs 250 crore to distribute around 12,000 milch cows and 600,000 sheep and goats to 150,000 poor women.

Other allocations

A sum of Rs 16,965.30 crore has been provided for the School Education department, which is the highest among all departments, Rs 6,511.76 crore for the health sector and Rs 4,887.69 crore for rural local bodies.

In the Budget Estimates 2013-14, Rs 500 crore has been provided for the Chennai Mega City Development and Rs 750 crore for the Urban Development Mission.","Thu, 21 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/default/1130321/full-113032100237.jpg,"['rs', 'sector', 'state', '201314', 'surplus', 'fiscal', 'presents', 'cent', 'gsdp', 'revenue', 'taxfree', 'tn', 'budget', 'price', 'power', 'crore']", ,none

The technology described in the March issue of the International Journal of Environmental Engineering uses parts of the plant Tridax procumbens as a biocarbon filter for the ion.

Drinking water can contain natural fluoride or fluoride might be added as a protective agent for teeth by water companies. However, its presence is not without controversy while in some natural drinking water levels may be above those considered safe by the World Health Organisation. Chemist Malairajan Singanan of the Presidency College (Autonomous), in Chennai, points out that the WHO guidelines suggest that a safe level of fluoride is 1.5 milligrams per liter. He adds that various techniques to reduce fluoride content have been tried including coagulation, adsorption, precipitation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis, and electrodialysis. However, metal ions with an affinity for fluoride in a biocarbon matrix represent a promising new approach.

Singanan has investigated Tridax procumbens, which is commonly used as a medicinal herb in India, as a biocarbon absorbent for fluoride. Previously, the plant has been tested in the extraction of toxic heavy metals from water. He explains that by loading up plant tissue with aluminum ions it is possible create a safe biocarbon filter that will readily absorb fluoride ions from water warmed to around 27 Celsius passing through the filter. His trials show that it takes just three hours to remove 98% of fluoride with just 2 grams of the biocarbon filter.

The biocarbon filter might provide an inexpensive way to defluoridate water in regions where the natural level of this mineral is high in ground water, including India, China, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Spain, Holland, Italy, Mexico, North and South America. It might also be adapted for those consumers who wish to reduce their exposure to fluoride, despite its dental health benefits, in parts of the world where it is added to the water supply for public health reasons.","Tue, 05 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/scidaily-icon.png,"['safe', 'india', 'filter', 'natural', 'drinking', 'water', 'plant', 'health', 'fluoride', 'herbal', 'defluoridation', 'ions', 'biocarbon']", ,none

The Colombo Race Course Mini Pavilion, refurbished at a cost of Rs.125 million, was declared opened to the public yesterday by the Minister of Economic Development, Basil Rajapaksa, the Defence and Urban Development Ministry Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and the Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council, M. J. M. Muzammil.

Special guests included politicians, members of the diplomatic community, high-profile cricketers, and heads of the armed forces. Others included prominent Cinnamon Gardens residents.

Under the Colombo City beautification project, the 119-year-old race course pavilions in Cinnamon Gardens are being restored in stages to their former grandeur, preserving the original colonial architecture. The Urban Development Authority provided architectural consultancy and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau acted as engineering consultant.

During the glory days of the races, the mini-pavilion housed the jockeys’ room, the stewards’ rooms, inquiry rooms and betting offices. The pavilion now houses a set of boutique stores and fast-food restaurant McDonald’s.

Formerly maintained by the Ceylon Turf Club, the renovated race course buildings will be maintained by the Defence and Urban Development Ministry.

The restoration work was done by the Sri Lanka Army’s Sixth Engineers Service Regiment. About 300 military personnel were involved. The mini pavilion is part of a Rs. 450 million project that includes the completion of the grand stand, a rugby field and a Sports Ministry building.

The race course project is expected to be completed by December 2013.�Land that was once green racing turf is being developed as Sri Lankas first international rugby grounds.

Haiti: Older people now have a voice, but there's still a long way to go

2012 was another challenging year for Haiti. The country never fully recovers from an emergency before another one strikes.

More than 400,000 people are still living in temporary camps three years after the January 2010 earthquake and thousands more are living in precarious accommodation in rural areas affected by the earthquake.

The 2012 rainy season did not bring enough rain and the threat of food insecurity was quite real even before tropical storm Isaac and hurricane Sandy destroyed crops all over the country.

Haiti is also still struggling to eradicate the cholera epidemics that broke out in 2010, just ten months after the earthquake. The government has been unable to hold local elections and donors are reluctant to invest funding to rebuild Haiti.

Older people easily marginalised

In this gloomy context, older people are easily marginalised, forgotten and deprioritised. We see many organisations that prioritise mothers and children ignoring the fact that grandmothers serve as advisors to mothers during pregnancy and assist in raising grandchildren.

We see thousands of Haitian farmers, mostly older men and women, abandoned in Haiti's rural areas struggling to produce food as they constantly face the threat of drought, floods and hurricanes.

HelpAge has helped to set up older people's associations in 12 communes affected by the 2010 earthquake. These associations received HelpAge assistance in the emergency response. Now the emergency response has come to an end, the challenge for these associations is to continue advocating for older people's issues.

Older people demand their rights

In 2012, it was encouraging to see hundreds of older people sitting around a literacy teacher to learn how to read and count thanks to a HelpAge programme. It was even more encouraging to see one association in Leogane continue this important work without outside support. Last year, hundreds of older people also staged demonstrations for their rights to healthcare, housing and food.

HelpAge is working hard to support older people still living in camps. We are implementing a resettlement programme which provides an allocation for rent and cash grants for education and livelihood activities for older people resettled by community workers for up to nine months. The funds for this project are provided by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).

HelpAge will also start work this year with 500 older people living in rural areas of five communes, providing them technical and material support so that they can rebuild their houses that were destroyed by the earthquake.

People who work in the community will mobilise other members of their neighbourhoods so they can gather materials and help each other. Engineers will train key community members on how to make their homes more resistant to hurricanes. The funds for this project are provided by the UK Department for International Development.

A study on older people's issues

For the fist time in more than a decade, a study on the situation of older people in Haiti will be published. This study will describe the deteriorating situation of older people after years of damage caused by hurricanes, floods and the earthquake.

It will also show that only a tiny percentage of older Haitians have access to some kind of pension. The results of the study will help expand HelpAge's work in Haiti, including advocacy work.

As a citizen of Haiti, I am happy to see my organisation's commitment to older people here. We have come a long way since HelpAge opened an office in Haiti in 2009. Older people now have a voice and are striving for a better life. But for this to continue, so much more remains to be done!

Hindus can hardly catch their breath this spring. Just a few weeks ago India wrapped up its Maha Kumbh Mela, a Hindu mega-event held every 12 years that lasts almost eight weeks and is the largest gathering on the planet. Yet today another massive Hindu occasion is underway and is sweeping the entire nation and Indian diaspora: Holi.

Compared with the Kumbh, what Holi lacks in magnitude it makes up for in fun. It is a celebration of spring’s arrival, in which people take to the streets from Mumbai to Delhi and across the vast countryside to douse each another with colored powder and launch water balloons. Packs of youths can be seen cavorting in India’s streets, completely soaked and coated in red, purple, blue and yellow. Some great photos of the action can be seen here and here.

Time notes that there are regional variations, such as the traditions found in the villages of Nandgaon and Barsana (71 miles from New Delhi), in which men sing to woo women, who return the gesture by good-humoredly beating them with bamboo sticks.

Aside from local spins on the festival, the core element remains the same: color. The use of color was inspired by the legend of Radha and Krishna. As the story goes, Krishna was envious of Radha’s complexion. Yashod, Krishna’s mother, suggested he color Radha’s face.

Water is an addition that gives revelers some relief from the oppressive heat that hits much of India at this time. While celebrants are still sure to get wet (or drenched), this year the Indian government is encouraging the public to forego (or at least tone down) the splashing. The reason being that drought is hitting some parts of India particularly hard this year.

Mumbai, battling its most severe draught since 1972, is one example, according to an article published by the Financial Times. The article notes that estimates in the city’s economic survey for 2012-2013 suggest the agricultural industry in Mumbai’s home state of Maharashtra could shrink 1.4 percent during this fiscal year.

According to an article published by the Times of India, on average participants use about two 15-liter buckets of water during the celebration. The Financial Times also notes that in the past tankers were dispatched to apartment blocks around Mumbai to give access to those celebrating in public spaces – a practice that will not be followed this year.

“There is massive wastage of water during the Holi festival in the metropolis,” The Indian Express quoted BJP general secretary Sanjay Upadhyay as saying. He went on to suggest that a “50 percent water cut should be imposed in Mumbai during the Holi celebrations and there should not be any water supply through tankers.”

Alongside the issue of water – used to mix in with the colored powder – the powder itself is also a growing concern. An article in the Hindustani Times notes that the colors of Holi were originally derived from season flowers and herbs. Over time, says the article, this tradition devolved and now many of the powders sold on the streets are made of toxic chemical mixtures, inspiring calls for a return to the festival’s organic roots.

In a show of support for a healthier, drier Holi, even Bollywood – known for its wild Holi parties – is curtailing the festivities this year. A number of stars have spread the word via Twitter.

“I appeal to the people of Maharashtra to play dry Holi with chandan (sandalwood paste) and flowers and save water,” spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar tweeted.

Bollywood acting legend Amitabh Bachchan further drove the point home, tweeting: ""Water shortage in Maharashtra… and it’s only March. What will happen in Summer? Save water!

44,44,Drought Sri Lanka,Report: UN Proposes a Common Definition for Water Security on World Water Day 2013 - Circle of Blue WaterNews,https://www.circleofblue.org/2013/world/un-agency-proposes-a-common-definition-for-water-security/,"Water security should have a common language, and it should be a priority for global sustainable development goals, according to a new report by UN-Water.

By Brett Walton

Circle of Blue

In a report released today to mark World Water Day and 2013 as the International Year of Water Cooperation, UN-Water is proposing a common definition of water security. UN-Water, which coordinates water programs within the United Nations system, claims that a single description of the problem will help global collaboration around water, one of the world’s most vital needs.

Image courtesy of UN-Water ‘Water Security and the Global Agenda’ is the title of an analytical brief published by the United Nations for World Water Day 2013. Click image to enlarge.

The authors define water security as: “The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development; for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters; and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.”

At least 17 organizations affiliated with UN-Water contributed to the paper. Most contributors are United Nations agencies, but others include the International Association for Water Law, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Stockholm International Water Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

“Common understanding has central importance in international discussions, and water security can’t continue to have a variety of meanings,” said Zafar Adeel in a statement. Adeel, who contributed to the report, is the co-chair of the UN-Water Task Force on Water Security and director of the Ontario-based Institute for Water, Environment, and Health.

“A shared and working definition is needed to get everyone on the same page,” Adeel said. “Only then can we collectively start to write a coherent response to the challenges.”

Words Into Action

In recent years, water has attracted some prominent advocates who want the world’s leaders to take notice. Last September, the InterAction Council, a public-policy group of 40 former heads of state and government, encouraged the UN Security Council to address water scarcity.

The report was followed later that month by a roundtable discussion of water security during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. The General Assembly declared water and sanitation a human right after a vote in 2010.

A few months earlier, former U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton ordered the first cabinet-level assessment of global water security.

“Every definition results in more debate on the definition instead of focusing on the problem, which is access to water.” –John Hartley, CEO

Future Directions International

“You can’t work on water as a health concern independently from water as an agricultural concern,” Clinton said a year ago, during a World Water Day event in Washington, D.C. “And water that is needed for agriculture may also be water that is needed for energy production. So we need to be looking for interventions that work on multiple levels simultaneously and help us focus on systemic responses.”

Some water advocates are hoping that the water security definition newly proposed by UN-Water leads to action, rather than introspection.

“Every definition results in more debate on the definition instead of focusing on the problem, which is access to water,” said John Hartley, CEO of Future Directions International, a nonprofit institute in Western Australia that does research on food and water. Hartley told Circle of Blue that the definition is important and nearly all encompassing, but that food security needs to be considered alongside water.

Patricia Wouters agreed that results matter more than the particular definition, especially if that definition is in a policy document, rather than a legal agreement. Wouters, who reviewed a draft copy of the report, is a professor of international law at the UNESCO Center for Water Law, Policy, and Science at the University of Dundee, Scotland.

“I’m not bothered by the breadth or the multitude of issues. I’m happy that the UN is grappling with this.” –Patricia Wouters, international law professor

UNESCO Center for Water Law, Policy, & Science

“I’m not bothered by the breadth or the multitude of issues,” Wouters told Circle of Blue. “I’m happy that the UN is grappling with this.”

Precision will come into play in the next few years. Food and water, as well as sanitation, are drawing attention as the United Nations prepares to write a new agenda for social and economic well-being. The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which came into effect at the turn of the century, expire in 2015. The United Nations announced last year that the MDG for water was attained, but the sanitation target will not be met.

Today’s UN-Water report calls for the still-evolving sustainable development goals to include a numerical target for water security. The report argues that water security — because of the broad definition — is something of an umbrella goal. In other words, if water is adequately addressed, success will cover other areas such as health, nutrition, environmental protection, and employment.

“It is safe to state that investment in water security is a long-term pay-off for human development and economic growth, with immediate visible short-term gains,” the report states.","Fri, 22 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://i1.wp.com/www.circleofblue.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/un.jpg?fit=391%2C539&ssl=1,"['common', 'international', 'world', 'unwater', 'report', 'nations', 'water', 'security', 'day', 'proposes', 'united', 'definition', 'development', 'law']", ,none
45,45,Drought Sri Lanka,How Organic Farming Contributes to a Sustainable Food System - EcoWatch,https://www.ecowatch.com/how-organic-farming-contributes-to-a-sustainable-food-system-1881683536.html,"Despite a slight decline between 2009 and 2010, since 1999 the global land area farmed organically has expanded more than threefold to 37 million hectares, according to new research conducted by the Worldwatch Institute for its Vital Signs Online service. Regions with the largest certified organic agricultural land in 2010 were Oceania, including Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island nations (12.1 million hectares); Europe (10 million hectares); and Latin America (8.4 million hectares), write report authors Catherine Ward and Laura Reynolds.

Organic farming is now established in international standards, and 84 countries had implemented organic regulations by 2010, up from 74 countries in 2009. Definitions vary, but according to the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements, organic agriculture is a production system that relies on ecological processes, such as waste recycling, rather than the use of synthetic inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

“Although organic agriculture often produces lower yields on land that has recently been farmed conventionally, it can outperform conventional practices—especially in times of drought—when the land has been farmed organically for a longer time,” said Reynolds, a researcher with Worldwatch’s Food and Agriculture Program. “Conventional agricultural practices often degrade the environment over both the long and short term through soil erosion, excessive water extraction, and biodiversity loss.”

Organic farming has the potential to contribute to sustainable food security by improving nutrition intake and sustaining livelihoods in rural areas, while simultaneously reducing vulnerability to climate change and enhancing biodiversity. Sustainable practices associated with organic farming are relatively labor intensive. Organic agriculture uses up to 50 percent less fossil fuel energy than conventional farming, and common organic practices—including rotating crops, applying mulch to empty fields, and maintaining perennial shrubs and trees on farms—also stabilize soils and improve water retention, thus reducing vulnerability to harsh weather patterns. On average, organic farms have 30 percent higher biodiversity, including birds, insects and plants, than conventional farms do.

Certifications for organic agriculture are increasingly concentrated in wealthier countries. From 2009 to 2010, Europe increased its organic farmland by 9 percent to 10 million hectares, the largest growth in any region. The U.S. has lagged behind other countries in adopting sustainable farming methods. When national sales rather than production are considered, however, the U.S. organic industry is one of the fastest-growing industries in the nation, expanding by 9.5 percent in 2011 to reach $31.5 billion in sales.

Sustainable food production will become increasingly important in developing countries, as the majority of population growth is concentrated in the world’s poorest countries. Agriculture in developing countries is often far more labor intensive than in industrial countries, so it is not surprising that approximately 80 percent of the 1.6 million global certified organic farmers live in the developing world. The countries with the most certified organic producers in 2010 were India (400,551 farmers), Uganda (188,625) and Mexico (128,826). Non-certified organic agriculture in developing countries is practiced by millions of indigenous people, peasants and small family farms involved in subsistence and local market-oriented production.

Further highlights from the report:

In 2010, the most recent year for which data are available, certified organic farming accounted for approximately 0.9 percent of the world’s agricultural land.

Africa is home to 3 percent of the world’s certified organic agricultural land, with just over 1 million hectares certified. Asia has 7 percent, with a total of 2.8 million hectares.

Despite a decline in organically farmed land in China and India between 2009 and 2010, India’s export volume of organic produce increased by 20 percent.

Vettai Villan (50), who originally hails from Ponnali at Satharasankottai in Sivaganga district, was allegedly evicted from his village by members belonging to the dominant castes in 2004 following an incident of caste discrimination.

Since then Vettai villan and his family were living in Vavval Thottam near Uthangudi in Madurai. His son V. Murugan, a former member of Tamil Nadu Pudhirai Vannar Welfare Board in Madurai, has moved the Madras High Court demanding retrieval of their house and land.

The Dalit family on Thursday staged a novel protest in Madurai — the family carrying a head load of firewood, earthen pots and stove marched towards the office of Inspector General of Police, symbolically suggesting that they were evicted forcefully.

Murugan said that on the day of incidence, Vettai Villan had gone to Satharasankottai to claim drought relief for his land (Patta No: 673) (Survey No: 219/9A).

He was allegedly attacked and abused in his caste name stating that “you are not in the village; how could we give relief money.”

The aggrieved Dalit had met the Village Administrative Officer but was again abused there as the latter was facing a High Court case filed by the former’s son. The land which belonged to Murugan’s family had been allegedly usurped by an intermediate caste family in Ponnali.

While they were marching to the IGP’s office, police intercepted them near Matuthavani Integrated Bus Stand and took them to the office. The family members submitted a petition demanding the police to arrest the persons who had abused them under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989.","Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12040492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MA-CITY-PROTEST,"['allegedly', 'abused', 'attack', 'village', 'dalit', 'office', 'man', 'villan', 'alleges', 'satharasankottai', 'relief', 'sivaganga', 'caste', 'family', 'scheduled']", ,none

The Fuso range belongs to Japan-based Mitsubishi FUSO Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC).

Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt Ltd (DICV), the Indian subsidiary of German automobile maker Daimler AG, on Thursday rolled out FUSO range of trucks from its plant. The company is planning to export to Asia and Africa.

“The FUSO range of trucks made in India is only for exports. Sri Lanka will be first export market for the trucks. This year we will export around 1,000 vehicles out of India. The Indian plant has enough capacity to cater to the Indian market for DIVC's BharatBenz as well as the export markets for FUSO,” Albert Kirchmann, head-Daimler Trucks Asia and president and CEO, MFTBC.

He added, the integrated Asia business model draws on the synergies of two Daimler outfits, DICV and MFTBC.

The new business model for Asia will enable Daimler AG to unlock full potential among MFTBC and DICV, said Kirchmann.

The trucks rolled out of DICV’s plant– BharatBenz and FUSO -- have local content upto 90%, said Marc Llistosella, Managing Director, DICV.

“Daimler’s Asia strategy is not to counter balance the excess capacity in India. We are leveraging existing production network for global market,” he said.

Kirchmann said the combined target of MFTBC and DICV is to double annual sales to 290,000 units by 2020 while declining to give any breakup of figures between the two entities.

Besides, Fuso and Bharat Benz, the company has set a target to sell 500,000 vehicles by 2015.

The FUSO trucks range manufactured at DICV’s plant here consist of five models spanning medium/heavy duty (25-49 tonne) and light/medium duty (9-16 tonne).

After Sri Lanka the FUSO trucks will be exported to Bangladesh, Zambia, Kenya and Brunei this year.

Apart from rolling of FUSO trucks out DICV’s plant, Daimler has chalked out an integrated Asia research and development (R&D) plan leveraging DICV and Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) operations.

The plant in Oragadam, Chennai produces BharatBenz range of trucks for the domestic market. Now, these will be rebadged and exported under the Fuso umbrella to over 15 markets.

(Knopf; 228 pages; $24)

In December 2004, when some of the places I had visited and loved in Sri Lanka were hit by the Indian Ocean tsunami, I watched from afar in horror. Hundreds of thousands of people died. Among the casualties: Sonali Deraniyagala's two children, her husband and her parents.

Deraniyagala's new book, ""Wave,"" is, most profoundly, an answer to the question of how one can hold on to the knowledge of a world that preceded disaster. Deraniyagala has to get to that world by remembering, but in the immediate aftermath of her loss, she can hardly bear to think of her spirited Sri Lankan-English sons, Vikram and Malli, or her fun-loving English husband, Stephen Lissenburgh.

In the book' opening scenes, Deraniyagala is vacationing with her family in Yala, a national park in her native Sri Lanka, when the sea approaches, foaming suspiciously. She flees her hotel, running with one child on either side of her, her husband just behind, passing her parents' room with no time to warn them. When the four of them leap into a jeep with some others, the vehicle speeds away from the sea, but not fast enough. It overturns. Deraniyagala survives by clinging to a branch. She emerges from the water, but the rest of her family vanishes.

Before her is an apocalyptic version of her family's beloved Yala. ""I saw then the toppled trees everywhere,"" she writes. ""I could make those out, trees on the ground with their roots sticking up. What is this, a swamp? I was in an immense bog-land. Everything was one color, brown, reaching far. This didn't look like Yala, where the ground is dry and cracked and covered in green shrub. What is this knocked-down world? The end of time?""

In the water's wake, she sits in shock, avoiding the evidence that her family might be permanently gone. As time passes, she drinks, pops pills and researches ways to kill herself. She fights not to re-enter a world in which the absence of her family will be obvious; then she battles to keep their home unchanged. Their faces alternatively blur and sharpen as she strategizes. How best to hold them? At a distance? Or as close as she can? Which will make things more tolerable?

The book shifts between Colombo and London, and then Colombo, London and New York (where Deraniyagala is now a research scholar at Columbia), and ultimately to other destinations as she travels through pain with friends and family at her side. While most sections are marked with the years of their present action - Deraniyagala's temporal distance from the wave - most of the time that action takes the form of remembrance. She narrates how spaces, people and objects trigger her memory, and investigates through what devices she can contend with her new consciousness - a consciousness in which she feels not only responsible for the deaths of her family, but also surrounded by their irrepressible spirit.

One of the simple beauties of Deraniyagala's prose is her drift between tenses. She remembers her remembering, and then gives us her mind moving, in the present tense, to an image of one of her loved ones. They are with her still: her costume-wearing youngest, Malli; her food-loving husband, Stephen; her bird-watching oldest, Vikram. Each springs to vivid life through the particular window of her mourning.

Sometimes these images knock her to the ground, but in other moments, she cannot help but return to their family's shared appreciation of the beautiful world around them. She lets them rejoin her. ""Maybe it is not so overwhelming after all, to dissolve the divide between now and then,"" she writes.

As the book progresses, both Deraniyagala and the prose itself begin to re-engage with the natural world, and with the sensory pleasures in which her boys had reveled: rare and beautiful birds, forbidden sweets, prawn curry, hot bagels, landscapes, cricket. The story opens up, and the narrative travels from the interior of her mourning to its exterior.

Many of the most moving passages find her traveling through time and space: the family's untouched London home, years later; whale-watching; sub-arctic Sweden. Descriptions of place are often stunning in their beauty. She imagines how they would have loved a certain elaborate spiderweb, and in that sub-Arctic's ""deserted shores,"" offers us a glimpse of ""a lake of ice, surrounded by naked birches sheathed in frozen fog, each branch glowing like a stag's antlers in velvet in that mellow light.""

The beauty they would have loved burns the truth of her life to its simplest vision, something beyond pain: ""Immersed in that endless white, I knew I was their mother, my horror dormant, or not that relevant even.""

Although for much of the book, we are privileged to be with her as she conjures and re-conjures her joyous family, what emerges from this wizardry most clearly is, of course, Deraniyagala herself - carrying within her present life another gorgeously remembered one.","Fri, 15 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://s.hdnux.com/photos/20/34/54/4311852/3/rawImage.jpg,"['loved', 'deraniyagala', 'husband', 'world', 'book', 'wave', 'sri', 'present', 'london', 'yala', 'sonali', 'family']", ,none

52,52,Drought Sri Lanka,Rainy season threatens transitional housing in Sri Lanka - Woman News Network (WNN) - WNN - Women News Network,https://womennewsnetwork.net/2012/11/02/transitional-housing-sri-lanka/,"WNN Improve It

(WNN/IRIN) Kilinochchi, SRI LANKA: Standing outside her battle-scarred home in northern Sri Lanka, Thangeswary Karuppaiyah dreams of one day rebuilding it. “I hope it’s soon. That’s what we are waiting for,” said the 55-year-old grandmother.

She has been living in a “transitional shelter” a few metres from her old home for the past three years.

Made of tin sheeting, coconut leaves and tarpaulins, it was put up by her family (thanks to government and international aid) following her return in 2009, and was designed to last two years – time enough to rebuild her old house, say aid workers.

“People have been in transitional shelter for a long time, in many cases three years… With the rainy season starting, things are going to become tough for those people,” Fontini Rantsiou, head of the northern sub-office of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.

Thousands of former IDPs are even less fortunate than Thangeswary, have never received any assistance, and live in makeshift shacks made of plastic sheeting and anything else they can get hold of.

“This is probably the most pressing issue of all. Under Sphere standards, transitional shelter in good condition offers some semblance of protection,” an international aid worker who asked not to be identified, explained. “Unfortunately, many people still don’t even have that.”

More than three years after Sri Lanka’s decades-long war came to an end and the return of nearly 470,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) to the north, thousands of people remain in flimsy shelters, say UN sources.

There is insufficient data to illustrate the severity of the problem, as the government has never endorsed a comprehensive needs assessment suggested by aid organizations in mid-2012, said a report by the International Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) published on 31 October.

As a result, humanitarian organizations have only managed to collect limited information.

Transitional shelter assistance

Across Sri Lanka’s former northern war zone (locally known as the Vanni), only 26 percent of IDP returnee families have received transitional shelter assistance, the report said, citing inputs from shelter agencies, including the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).

Of the more than 100,000 families in need of transitional shelter assistance in four northern districts (Vavuniya, Mullaitvu, Kilinochchi, and Manner), just 26,000 received assistance, leaving an estimated theoretical gap of around 74,000, according to UNHCR October figures.

Moreover, in at least three of the villages in Mullaitivu District which opened up for returns between July and September 2012, no commitments have been made to provide any transitional shelters at all, the IDMC report said, with only half the requirement for transitional shelters being met in Kilinochchi District.

Many of those affected have no choice but to live in makeshift shelters they have constructed themselves – well below internationally accepted Sphere standards.

Meanwhile, international funding for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka is drying up, largely because the World Bank now classifies the island nation as a middle-income country at peace, though government restrictions on assessments are preventing an adequate response, the IDMC report said.

A further obstacle is that many agencies and donors are reluctant to fund additional transitional shelter work given the high expectation of a commitment by donors to construct more than 75,000 permanent houses in the north – a project which could take years to complete.

According to OCHA, donors and the government are currently committed to supporting the building and repair of more than 35,000 houses (excluding Indian government plans to build 49,000 houses) against total needs in excess of 100,000.

TO: President Obama

FROM: Elizabeth Ferris

Global warming is occurring at a faster pace than predicted by scientists. Temperatures are rising, icecaps and glaciers are melting, and extreme weather events are becoming both more frequent and more intense. Last fall, the National Snow and Ice Data Center documented a record low of the level of Arctic sea ice – a figure 49 percent lower than the 1979-2000 average. If these trends continue, the results will be far-reaching for life on this planet. But if the warming accelerates dramatically and if polar ice melts even faster, the results could be catastrophic. This could occur if the Greenland ice sheet or the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) collapses, triggering a significant rise in sea levels throughout the world with particularly devastating impacts on populations living in low-lying coastal areas. Although the effects of climate change are likely to be long-term and the worst effects will probably neither be experienced in your presidency nor even in your lifetime, the future is inherently unpredictable. Climate change is already affecting communities around the world. It is likely to produce devastating consequences whether in the near or distant future. Taking bold steps now to address climate change offers an opportunity for you not only to leave a legacy that will impact future generations but also an opportunity to address current problems resulting from the effects of climate change.

Recommendations:

Elizabeth Ferris Former Brookings Expert Research Professor, Institute of Study of International Migration - Georgetown University

• Raise the priority of climate change on your foreign policy agenda, in particular by re-vitalizing negotiations over a post-Kyoto treaty. The Doha round of negotiations, which ended last month, was disappointing. Countries are further away today than they were a year ago on reducing emissions. U.S. leadership can reverse current trends of inadequate global commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.

• Support measures that will enable communities and countries to adapt to the most egregious effects of climate change. On the international level this means supporting and leading the difficult discussions around climate finance and using U.S. aid to support government planning to respond to the effects of climate change, including financial assistance to encourage communities to stay where they are as well as to plan for the relocation of communities whose homes will no longer be habitable.

• Support effective multilateral action to increase both mitigation and adaptation measures. Use your influence with the multilateral development banks to encourage more attention to disaster riskreduction measures in development planning. Work with international agencies and legal experts to devise an international legal regime for dealing with the expected increase in trans-border migration. It is easier to put a system in place before a crisis is at hand.

• Strengthen domestic efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions and enhancing domestic capacity to prepare for, respond, and recover from sudden-onset natural disasters.

Background:

Since the first report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990, the projections about the impact of global warming have become direr. From projecting the widespread consequences of a global rise in temperature of 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, current projections are that the rise in temperature will double to 4 degrees Celsius. The seas are rising 60 percent faster than predicted by the IPCC. The Greenland ice sheet is shrinking twice as fast as estimated by the IPCC and is losing mass at about five times the rate it was in the early 1990s. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt completely, global sea rise could reach seven meters. And the consequences of global warming go far beyond sea-level rise. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warns that the conditions that led to the 2011 Texas drought are 20 times more likely to occur now than in the 1960s as a result of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations.

Although climate change will have many negative effects in different parts of the world, including prolonged droughts, reduction in arable land, declining agricultural productivity, and increased flooding due to more extreme weather events, the impact of sea level rise perhaps best illustrates the potential dangers. Throughout the world, more people are living in coastal areas as the result of population growth, urbanization and government policies. Presently 10 percent of the world’s population — 600 million people — live in low-elevation coastal zones and the percentage is growing. Sixty-five percent of the world’s megacities (those over 5 million) are located in these coastal areas. A rise in sea level of even a meter would have major implications for coastal populations; if sea levels were to rise by several meters, the consequences would be catastrophic. Most obviously, sea level rise will submerge land, causing countries to lose physical territory. The areas expected to experience the largest land loss by 2030 are the Arctic Ocean coasts of Canada, Alaska, Siberia and Greenland as well as coastal areas of Pakistan, Sri Lanka, southeast Indonesia, and eastern Africa. In the United States, particularly vulnerable areas include the coastal areas of the east and west coasts and the Gulf of Mexico.

Rising sea levels will affect economics, politics, community life and security. For example, the mega-deltas of Asia are the food baskets of the region, and the impact of a sea level rise on food security will be considerable. But perhaps the most significant impact of climate change in general and rising sea levels in particular will be the displacement of people. Migration is a complex process driven by a range of economic, social and political factors but it is becoming clear that environmental factors will increasingly influence migration. In Bangladesh, for example, moving to cities has become a common coping strategy in the face of flooding. One of the IPCC background studies posits that a 40-centimeter rise in sea levels will affect 100 million people. As hundreds of millions of people in Africa and Asia are at risk of flooding by 2060, it is likely that many will move to cities such as Dhaka and Lagos that are located in coastal flood plain areas. In other words, the trend is for people to migrate to areas of greater — not lesser — environmental vulnerability. At the same time, as the UK’s authoritative Foresight study concludes, those who are able to migrate may well be the lucky ones; those who are unable to move may be the most vulnerable.

Large-scale migration has many consequences. If sea level rise renders small island states uninhabitable (which is likely to occur long before the islands are actually submerged by the seas), issues of sovereignty, legal status, and responsibility will present the world with huge challenges. Most climate change-induced migration or displacement will be internal, placing strain on infrastructure and pressure on governments to deliver services. Political instability, conflict and poor governance exacerbate these problems. Climate change is a threat multiplier, often affecting those countries least able to respond appropriately. How will governments cope with the movement of large numbers of people from coasts toward inland areas? There is also a possibility that some, perhaps many, will seek to move to other countries because of the effects of climate change. The international legal system is unprepared to deal with trans-border movements triggered by environmental factors or disasters, since the displaced do not fall under the 1951 Refugee Convention (unless they leave because of political turmoil exacerbated by climate change.)

Projecting possible massive displacement from climate change is complicated by the difficulty of comprehending the interrelationships between the different effects of climate change, for example, changes in fish stocks and coral reefs brought about by the acidification of the world’s oceans; changing patterns of disease; changing habitats for animals and plants; the intersection of deforestation and increasingly arid climates in some parts of the world. Delicate ecological balances are changing in ways that are as yet poorly understood. Similarly, there is much we do not know about the dynamic nature of the effects of climate change. For example, some scientists are reporting that the melting of Arctic ice itself is releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, increasing global warming which will in turn increase the rate of Arctic ice melt.

Most scientists have observed that the climate is becoming warmer and that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. While it is impossible to attribute any single weather event, such as Hurricane Sandy, to climate change, the global trends clearly demonstrate an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. These trends are likely to intensify. The interaction between increasing extreme weather events and other effects of climate change – such as increased erosion, acidification of the seas, desertification, sea-level rise – is also likely to lead to large-scale movement of people.

Conclusion:

There are certainly obstacles and pitfalls to making climate change a centerpiece of your foreign policy. Perhaps the projections of scientists are too pessimistic and the effects of global warming will not be as serious as now thought. Perhaps you will be unable to marshal the necessary political support to enact necessary legislation. Perhaps other governments will fail to rally to your leadership and perhaps the negotiations over climate change mitigation and adaptation will widen, not narrow the North- South divide. It is certainly understandable that you would want to put aside these longer-term challenges and focus on more immediate economic issues. But a climate catastrophe could be lurking around the corner.

Unless urgent action is taken now, the effects of climate change on life on this planet and on life in the United States will increase. Climate change is a domestic, foreign policy, security, development, human rights, and intergenerational justice issue. Preparing better for climate change disasters at home and abroad is a good short-term prophylactic. But making serious and sustained efforts to reduce global warming can solidify America’s present leadership in the world. It can lay the foundation for the country’s sustainable future development. It can address the causes of future humanitarian crises and alleviate future human suffering. It can be a legacy issue for the Obama administration that will impact the world for generations.","Thu, 17 Jan 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sandy_newyork001.jpg,"['effects', 'coastal', 'big', 'sea', 'world', 'thaw', 'change', 'climate', 'rise', 'ice', 'global', 'areas']", ,flood_and_drought

City Council’s proposed ban on elephants performing in traveling shows such as circuses paints a romantic picture of elephants as gentle giants. The editorial board seems to buy into the animal extremists’ idealistic scenario of happy, fat pachyderms lazily wandering the open plains of Africa or the jungles of Asia, free of disease and conflict with humans.

The reality is far grimmer. The “wild” left for these magnificent animals is rapidly disappearing. Instead, these endangered and threatened animals are often contained within park ranges by fences, or, when no fences exist, villages and fields block historic migration routes, often leading to human-elephant conflict. In Sri Lanka, an island country with the highest elephant-to-human ratio, elephants regularly raid farmers’ fields, and human-elephant conflict sometimes leads to deaths -- of both elephants and humans.

In Africa, elephants may walk for miles during the drought months to find water and food -- a harsh reality that elephants in captivity don’t have to endure. Captive elephants don’t face the threat of being killed by humans from gunshot, electrocution or poisoning as they compete for resources or because their ivory is a valuable commodity. While park rangers do what they can to protect elephants from poachers, too many are being slaughtered. Calves are orphaned and often die without human intervention.

The imaginary Eden created by animal extremists has elephants and humans coexisting without interacting and ignores the reality of thousands of years of history. In fact, Asian elephants have been working in their native lands with their native peoples for thousands of years, just as horses have in lands where horses and people are found together. The Times has not called for an end to bridles on horses, but instead has demonized the traditional tool for working with elephants.

Commands are taught first and foremost to permit personal interaction between humans and elephants, which in turn allows for the provision of better husbandry and veterinary care. These movements are not taught through force or coercion, just as you would not beat your dog at home to make him sit. Elephants at zoos and circuses are taught primarily through a series of repetition and reward. Click here for a good discussion on training elephants as well as a better explanation of the Assn. of Zoos and Aquariums’ policy referenced in the editorial.

It is a good thing that people can see elephants at the L.A. Zoo or up close through traveling circuses. The elephants act as ambassadors for their species living in their range countries. While it may seem pleasant for extremists to imagine a perfect scenario in which elephants are set free to roam the hills of California to their hearts’ content, that isn’t the world in which we live. Elephants need people to care for them in captivity and to protect and conserve them in their range lands.

A court in the tiny island of Feydhoo last week sentenced the 15-year-old to 100 lashes after she admitted to having consensual sex, a court official said.

The official said details of the consensual sex emerged when police investigated her complaint against her stepfather and another man of sexually abusing her.

Government spokesman Masood Imad said the government considered her a victim of sexual abuse and wants the sentence revoked.

“The government fully understands she is a victim. Since this is an Islamic affair we don’t want to unilaterally say things,” Mr. Imad said.

The practice of flogging for sex outside marriage has been widely condemned and it is often the woman who is singled out for punishment.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay in 2011 urged Maldives to end the “degrading” practice.

“This practice constitutes one of the most inhumane and degrading forms of violence against women, and should have no place in the legal framework of a democratic country,” she said speaking at the Maldives Parliament.

She urged the authorities to change the law that allows flogging.","Fri, 01 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,"['urged', 'flogging', 'premarital', 'sex', 'outside', 'marriage', 'victim', 'saidthe', 'faces', 'practice', 'maldives', 'girl', 'official']", ,none

'I am not afraid to speak out' � Meet Mr Samuel Bailey, one of Jamaica's top older activists

Last week I had the honour of meeting one of our Age Demands Action (ADA) champions, Mr Samuel Bailey from Jamaica.

The 69-year-old father-of-six is a retired supermarket worker and was a trade union officer. Now he is a president of a secondary school and an advocate for orphaned children and older people.

He has been an active campaigner for Age Demands Action for several years and this year on 1 October, the UN International Day of Older Persons, he was among a delegation of older people that met Jamaica's Minister of Health and Minister of Labour and Social Security.

The group asked the politicians about the possibility of establishing health clinics for older people so that they can have easier access to health care services, access to micro-credit for older people and the possibility of a universal pension.

Samuel kindly let me interview him about being a people's champion.

When did you first take part in the Age Demands Action campaign?

About four years ago. I was introduced to the campaign through Hope for Children charity in Jamaica. Mr Jeffrey James, the regional director for HelpAge Caribbean, saw me and asked me whether I would consider being an advocate for older people.

How does it feel to meet governments and represent the voices of older people?

You see, I am not afraid to speak, I am not shy and I am not nervous. I met the Ministry of Labour and Social Security and I also spoke to the Minister of National Security about violence against older people and the discrimination they face.

For example when you go to the bank to borrow money to raise chickens, the bank is reluctant to give you a loan because if you are 70 or older they think you will die soon.

You have a lot of verbal and physical abuse in Jamaica. Older people want respect and recognition. We have built the government, and we need people to recognise this. The Minister was very impressed and he said he will see what he can do.

Do you think governments are making improvements to older people thanks to ADA?

We do get good things from governments. For example thanks to advocacy, older people get bus pass discounts. We also have hospital cards which gives you half price off medicines. However we need a special day for older people to see doctors and we need a special window for older people to get medication. In rural areas we want mobile medication services, where older people can get free medication so senior citizens can access medicines.

Why do you think older people's rights are important?

Older people contributed to the country as civil servants, lawyers and doctors. Even those who were not academics, even if people were garbage collectors, they helped to build this country. Because of their contribution, they are entitled to enjoy their later lives.

Do you think young people should be involved in the campaign? Why?

Yes! We involve young people in our work. I speak to young people and tell them that anything we achieve for older people will make life easier for them later when they get old. So they must be with us. Young people volunteer with us, for example they will cook Christmas dinner and soup for us. They also play sports with us. We welcome them so we have to get them involved in our activities. Some school children join our activities and learn about their grandparents concerns.

What message do you have for older people like you?

Keep on doing what you are doing and you will continue to be blessed. I am praying that God will give the strength to advocate for older people's rights.

58,58,Drought Sri Lanka,Fluctuating ginger price may stabilise by harvest time - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fluctuating-ginger-price-may-stabilise-by-harvest-time/article4763564.ece,"The price of ginger, which is presently very high owing to shortfall in production, is expected to firm up around Rs. 4,000 a quintal by the harvest season, according to a price-forecast study.

To help farmers decide whether to opt for ginger cultivation this season or not, the Market Intelligence Cell of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, took up an early survey of traders and collected the modal prices of ginger in Bangalore market in the last 11 years besides conducting an econometric analysis to forecast the price of ginger when the crop comes up for harvesting in November-December.

The survey indicates that the kharif season ginger may fetch a modal price of about Rs. 4,000 a quintal during the harvest season against the present price which is fluctuating upwards of Rs. 11,000 a quintal.

C.P. Gracy, who headed a three-member price research team that included Jyoti Naik and Nagashree N., told The Hindu that the normal price of ginger was around Rs. 2,000 a quintal before the price fluctuation.

“The present price level is only temporary and mainly due to the high demand triggered by shortfall in production,” she said while indicating that it may not be appropriate to consider the present range of price for any comparison with future price.

60 p.c. fall

Wayanad and surrounding areas in Kerala, which account for the highest ginger production in the country, reported nearly 60 per cent fall in production in 2012-13, the survey notes.

In Karnataka, ginger is grown in about 29,000 hectares, spread over mainly in Hassan, Kodagu, Shimoga, Chickmagalur, Bidar and Mysore districts. It is cultivated both as the main crop as well as an intercrop in plantations.

India is the largest producer of ginger in the world, with an estimated production of 7,56,000 tonnes in 2012-13 against the global production of about 1.6 million tonnes. About 1,55,000 hectares of land is under ginger cultivation in India with an average productivity of 1,514 kg per hectare.

India accounts for about 21 per cent of the global share of ginger production, followed by China (20.5 per cent), Indonesia (12.7 per cent), Nepal (11.5 per cent) and Thailand (10 per cent). India is also the largest exporter of ginger. India exported about 35,616.4 tonnes of ginger to the United States, the UAE, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Morocco, the United Kingdom, Nepal, Spain, Egypt and other countries during 2011-12.

In India, ginger is cultivated mainly in Kerala, Odisha, Karnataka, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal and Sikkim.","Thu, 30 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12116701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGGINGER,"['rs', 'india', 'tonnes', 'cent', 'quintal', 'survey', 'production', 'fluctuating', 'price', 'season', 'stabilise', 'ginger', 'harvest']", ,none
59,59,Drought Sri Lanka,Maharashtra to have new water policy - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-to-have-new-water-policy/article4820066.ece,"The water policy is being revised in accordance with the National Water Policy.

Against the backdrop of the severe drought in several parts of the state prior to this monsoon, Maharashtra Government is preparing a water policy on the lines of the National Water Policy.

The National Water Policy (NWP) stipulates that state policies should be drafted/revised in accordance with it, a senior official said. NWP was first framed in 1987 and modified in April 2002. It requires that every state formulate its own water policy backed by an action plan.

The government has invited comments and suggestions from various societies working in different sectors, NGOs and other water users for the modification of the present State Water Policy which has been in existence since 2003, he said.

The Departments involved in revision of the state water policy include the Water Resources Department, Water Supply and Sanitation Department, Environmental Department and Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA).

In the 2003 State Water Policy, the priority of water use was: drinking, industrial and irrigation. However, in May 2011, there was a revision of priority: drinking, irrigation and industrial use.

As part of the revision of the state water policy, the government has invited comments from all departments concerned to be submitted by September 30, 2013. The preparation of draft policy will be completed by November 30, and cabinet note on it is expected by April 30 next year.

The new NWP emphasises the need for a national water framework law, comprehensive legislation for optimum development of inter-state rivers and river valleys, amendment of Irrigation and other Acts, the official said.

It states that water, after meeting needs for safe drinking water and sanitation, achieving food security, supporting poor people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and high priority allocation for minimum eco-system needs, be treated as economic good so as to promote its conservation and efficient use.

The policy says “ecological needs” of the river should be determined recognising that river flows are characterised by low or no flows, small floods, large floods and flow variability and should accommodate development needs.

The national policy also dwells on adaptation strategies in view of climate change for designing and management of water resources structures.

The suggestions can be sent to Deputy Secretary (Irrigation Management), Water Resources Department, in Mantralaya and emailed to wrd_cad_do_imp@maharashtra.gov.in, the official said.","Sun, 16 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12042020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/drought,"['river', 'state', 'national', 'water', 'resources', 'irrigation', 'priority', 'department', 'revision', 'policy', 'maharashtra']", ,none
60,60,Drought Sri Lanka,Go-ahead for sourcing quarry water to slake growing thirst - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/goahead-for-sourcing-quarry-water-to-slake-growing-thirst/article4224954.ece,"Initially, 15,000 litres will be treated a day for which a cost effective technology has been developed.

The State government has on Wednesday given in-principle approval to the district administration’s proposal to treat the water accumulated in abandoned stone quarries and distribute it as drinking water using the reverse osmosis technology.

A meeting to discuss the proposal in detail will be held towards the end of this month, District Collector P.I. Sheikh Pareed told The Hindu after meeting Revenue Minister Adoor Prakash. Fund for the project has been sought from the drought relief fund.

The district administration has drawn up a proposal worth Rs. 33 lakh for launching the project on a pilot basis at a quarry at Ambalappara near Kakkanad. Initially, 15,000 litres will be treated a day for which a cost effective technology has been developed. The project will be expanded to cover more abandoned stone quarries if found successful.

Mr. Pareed said he had got the water sample from the Ambalappara quarry tested by a private agency entrusted with developing the technology, and the Water Authority. He said the idea was to construct a small retaining wall around the quarry to conserve it like a rainwater harvesting centre. The agency selected will install the machinery for the treatment process. “There is also an idea to develop a compact mobile treatment unit,” Mr. Pareed said.

However, V.N. Sivasankara Pillai, former director at the School of Environment Studies, Cochin University of Science and Technology, feels that the proposal is “not as simple as it looks.”

He said while the water collected in such quarries could be used for construction and similar purposes, its treatment for drinking water could prove expensive. “Water in abandoned quarries may have got collected over a period of time, leading to gradual growth of algae. Separating algae calls for an advanced and expensive treatment process different from the treatment methods adopted by agencies like the Water Authority to purify river water,” he said.

Mr. Pillai said water collected in quarries needs to be recharged to maintain the water balance. Recharging through rain is inadequate as a good portion of water is lost to evaporation. In such circumstances, water will have to be pumped in from surrounding areas. “Since there is thick population around these quarries, pumping in water from outside would not be safe,” he said.

Mr. Pillai recollected that a similar proposal to treat water from an abandoned quarry in Vennala by the corporation was dropped after the rehabilitation of families in the nearby areas became a problem.

District officer at the Groundwater Department V. Prasannan said there were two ways in which abandoned quarries can be utilized to meet the water needs. “The already collected water should be pumped out and the quarries should be completely cleaned after which a retaining wall should be constructed around them to prevent the inflow of polluted water from adjoining areas. In that way, quarries can be used as rainwater storage tanks,” he said.

If the inflow of water from surrounding areas is facilitated then the water should be purified before usage. Since the water is free of salinity its treatment should be cost effective,” Mr. Prasannan said. Either way he doubts whether there will be enough water for round-the-clock pumping due to three factors – indiscriminate usage of water, the usual 100-day period without rain in the State annually, and loss of water to evaporation.

K.K. Sajeevan, district officer at the Mining and Geology Department felt that proposal was feasible considering the abundance of unused quarries in the district.

“Once a quarry is fully explored and turns waterlogged, a contact is established with groundwater. Naturally, the water level rises sustaining enough water even during the summer,” he said.","Fri, 21 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12422128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STONE_QUARRIES,"['collected', 'goahead', 'growing', 'thirst', 'water', 'areas', 'quarries', 'treatment', 'abandoned', 'technology', 'quarry', 'sourcing', 'district', 'slake', 'proposal']", ,none

The lobby firm, Patton Boggs LLP, has submitted its registration with the US Senate for lobbying on behalf of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), shows the Congressional records of lobbying disclosure reports.

The current and anticipated 'specific lobbying issues' on which Patton Boggs would work for OVL are ""issues related to ONGC Videsh oil and gas operations in India and future focus on US oil and gas market"", says its registration filing submitted to the Senate's lobbying database on April 4.

The firm has named two persons, Anurag Varma and Daniel Waltz, who would work as lobbyists for its client, OVL.

Late last year, another energy major from India, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) terminated its registration for lobbying activities in the US. Prior to that, Mukesh Ambani-led RIL had lobbied for years in the US through its then lobby firm, BGR.

BGR also lobbies on behalf of the Indian government in the US, but it has not yet made its disclosure for the first quarter of 2013.

OVL's lobby firm Patton Boggs has worked for clients like Lloyd's of London, Halliburton, AO Smith Corp, Air France - KLM, Amazon.Com, Bristol Myers Squibb, EADS North America and Facebook.

For ONGC Videsh, the primary business is to prospect for oil and gas acreages abroad, which includes acquisition of oil and gas fields in foreign countries as well as exploration, production, transportation and sale of oil and gas.

OVL earlier used to operate on a small scale to carry out limited exploration activities in few countries like Iraq, Yemen, Sri Lanka and Tanzania, but it started expanding in a major way from late 1990s with overseas acquisitions and exploration activities.

Currently, it has presence in 27 projects in 14 countries of which 9 projects are operated by OVL, 7 projects are jointly operated and 12 projects are non-operated.

Earlier this year, another Indian firm, Devas Multimedia, also filed its lobbying registration with the Senate and it intends to lobby on ""trade and investment issues related to India"".

Among others, Sterling Biotech has disclosed having spent $20,000 on its lobbying in the US during the first quarter of 2013, while software industry body Nasscom has incurred lobbying expenses of $30,000 for the same period.

World Refugee Day: Older Syrians without hope

HelpAge International and Handicap International have recently begun work assisting Syrian refugees in Lebanon.

Claire Catherinet, Inclusion Adviser for HelpAge and Handicap International, writes about her experiences working with older refugees and refugees with disabilities.

There is no hope

For me, a crying child is distressing but manageable. But an older person crying is unbearable; it means there is no hope left. Half the women I interviewed cry, particularly when asked if they have been in contact with their relatives in Syria and Lebanon.

When you're 55, 70 or 80, it's very hard to leave your family in a war-torn country, not knowing if they are still alive or not. As Iman, an older refugee, told a colleague of mine: ""We are old, nobody can help us. We would like to take a boat, go to sea and sink"".

NGOs in Lebanon are doing their best, but for older people and people living with disabilities there is room for improvement. NGOs prioritise children and pregnant women and there are specific programmes for these groups. There is nothing for older people.

Not only are older people being overlooked, there is also no data on people over 60, according to some 15 NGOs. Overall, older refugees are very thankful to the Lebanese for finding them land to live on, even though some are taking advantage of the situation by charging exorbitant rents and food prices.

Bridging the gap

Detachment, or some form of distance, is a necessary part of working with refugees. If you want to keep doing it, you have always to bear in mind that - as my father once said to me - you can't be responsible for other people's misery.

But being involved is also important. When I am doing assessments, I am always clear that I am simply putting things in place and can't offer immediate relief. Some people react angrily, fed up with repeatedly being asked questions and not always having their needs attended to. Some people, however, are very appreciative - particularly women.

During these assessments, a translator is required but I always make an effort to speak to people directly. When I ask questions, women are always very affectionate and tactile, touching and hugging warmly without embarrassment. One of the most memorable instances was when my colleague (pictured) and I met a Syrian lady who was 80 and had leg paralysis. Her gratitude and natural sweetness was so strong that, despite her disability, she held on to Amandine's hand and wouldn't let go.

This could be because of the lack of attention paid to them, making the gratitude for simply being listened to overwhelming. Despite the language barrier, this involvement helps. But the line between being involved as a person and actually taking on another's problems is a fine one.

The sense of unending

In Lebanon's windswept Bekaa valley lies one of the tented settlements that hosts the daily influx of refugees from Syria. Many of the refugees know they won't be going back home for a long time, perhaps even a few years. Some returned to Syria to check their houses but many have been destroyed.

In Lebanon, they face several hardships, mostly financial. The biggest difficulties are to do with integration into society: with jobs, healthcare, schools, shelter. Job opportunities are very limited and many people worry about being able to afford their rent, medication and healthcare. Back home in Syria, healthcare was low-cost or free but in Lebanon it's hard to get any information about health services. When people get ill they go directly to a pharmacy and it's expensive.

Aimal, 52, shares an unfinished building in Bekaa with her daughter and another family. She told me about her husband. He is paralysed down one side of his body and cannot afford the medication he needs to improve his blood circulation.

Food prices are increasing for refugees with some local businesses raising prices for desperate refugees. The World Food Programme say they are aware of the issue but because items do not have price tags, they cannot verify or monitor this.

Security is an increasing concern for refugees in Lebanon, as in Jordan. Resentment is growing, with attacks on residents in two of the tented settlements. However, this is thought to have been a dispute between gangs rather than specifically aimed at refugees.

There are problems with issues of prostitution and child marriage too. Although it's unclear how widespread this is, there is a strong possibility that increasing financial strain could lead to ever more desperate measures.

I would eat sand

In the tented settlements, older refugees and people with disabilities are marginalised. Life is doubly hard for someone like Samira, a 60-year-old woman with two daughters, 25 and 43, who are living with disabilities. Aside from Handicap International and HelpAge very few agencies are considering the specific needs of older people and people with disabilities in their humanitarian response.

Another older refugee, Khaled, left Syria with his family during a bombing in Damascus. His leg was trapped for hours under rubble and had to be amputated. When I met him he had just rejoined his family, but had lost everything including his leg and didn't know how he would be able to support his family.

""I would eat sand if that could give me my leg back,"" he said. He was referred to Handicap International and given a bed and crutches. They also measured his leg so they could provide him with a prosthetic limb. I will always remember his tears and then the smile on his face which was so heartening.

Kyrgyzstan: Building advocacy strategies...and team spirit!

In Central Asia, a place not known by many, a fantastic meeting was organised by HelpAge International. This was the first time HelpAge had hosted a meeting with its network partners and offices that work in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) and included participants from Ukraine all the way to Tajikistan.

The meeting took place at Lake Issyk-Kul, the tenth largest lake in the world. The location was perfect for what we wanted to achieve, which was to focus, share and bond. Some of us took the bonding to another level and courageously jumped in the lake which could not have been warmer than 7 degrees Celsius!

As we approached the lake from the capital Bishkek, I could not stop wondering how the beauty of the country and its people is overshadowed by the side effects of what the Soviet era has left behind.

Stronger advocacy

We spent four days learning about each other's work and building stronger advocacy and project plans. We also did a lot of team work and learned about our various needs and interests. We came out of it energised, enthusiastic and most importantly, we became friends.

With Aisuluu, the EECA Regional Communications Officer, I hosted a one day session on advocacy. We learned a great deal about the challenges of doing advocacy work in a post-Soviet region. We were impressed to hear about our partners' achievements, for example the Resource Centre for Elderly in Kyrgyzstan. Since 2002, they have been pushing forward the adoption of a law for older people. Through political turmoil, frequent changes in government and a revolution, their persistence has led to concrete success.

Our partners' key achievements

In Ukraine, our partner TLU has worked to ensure older people are safe from abuse on public transport. They developed yellow cards and distributed them to bus drivers who were rude to them. And in Armenia, Mission Armenia has built a great relationship with the government which has resulted in a massive 20% of their funding coming from them.

In the next three years, we will grow and focus our advocacy work on improving older people's access to health services, increased social protection and stopping discrimination and violence against older people.

We spent the rest of the time reflecting on our internal strengths and planning our three year approach to advocacy. Our discussions and debates got quite heated, but by the end of the day, we reach common objectives. We agreed that the EECA network has strong experience in the field of ageing and, over the course of 30 years, we have established ourselves as ageing experts. This is also recognised by governments, donors and institutions.

Hopefully this meeting has helped us to improve our understanding and will boost communications and allow for more cooperation.

Get involved with our campaigns and advocacy work!","Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.helpage.org/favicon.ico,"['kyrgyzstan', 'partners', 'took', 'meeting', 'advocacy', 'strategiesand', 'older', 'building', 'team', 'spirit', 'work', 'ukraine', 'lake', 'eeca']", ,none
65,65,Drought Sri Lanka,Inundated colonial bungalow resurfaces after thirty years - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/inundated-colonial-bungalow-resurfaces-after-thirty-years/article4756301.ece,"The bungalow was built during 1886-87 by British industrialist T.J. Cameroon with permission from then Travancore Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma to start a paper mill at Punalur.

A colonial bungalow that “drowned” thirty years ago has surfaced from its watery grave in the reservoir of the Thenmala Dam in Kollam district.

The spot is about 3 km from the dam top and can be reached after a 45-minute trek through the forest. The resurfaced bungalow looks eerie from a distance. Yet, one is overwhelmed on entering it after squelching across knee-deep silt.

The water in the reservoir has receded to an unprecedented low in the wake of the drought in Kollam district.

Shortly before the structure was inundated in 1983 by the waters of the Kallada Irrigation Project (KIP), its teak doors, windows and rafters had been auctioned.

The bungalow was built in 1886-87 by the British industrialist T.J. Cameroon who was given permission by the then Travancore Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma (1885 to 1924) to start a paper mill at Punalur, using the abundantly growing reeds in the surrounding dense forest as raw material.

Commissioned in 1888, the paper mill was initially christened the Travancore Paper Mills. The name changed to Lakshmi Paper Mills, then to Meenakshi Paper Mills and finally Punalur Paper Mills in 1931 as managements changed. It boasted the India Security Press at Nasik among its clientele at that time.

The bungalow, with 15 rooms, had glass pane windows. Natives called it the “kannadi (glass) bungalow.” The majestic structure stood on the side of the erstwhile Shengottai-Thiruvananthapuram road. Shengottai, now in Tamil Nadu, was then part of the Travancore kingdom. The bungalow was the office complex of superintendents monitoring the reed harvest and its transportation in bullock carts to the paper mill, some 20 km away.

Following the declaration of the Wildlife Protection Act in 1972, the bungalow was taken over by the Forest Department and it later served as the survey office of the KIP when the dam was sanctioned. The dam was commissioned in 1984, but the bungalow had gone under water some time before that.

66,66,Drought Sri Lanka,Paul Collingwood: First England captain to win a global championship - Cricket Country,https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/paul-collingwood-first-england-captain-to-win-a-global-championship-26990,"Paul Collingwood: First England captain to win a global championship

Paul Collingwood, born May 26, 1976, was England’s leading ODI run-scorer and captain of the 2010 T20 World Cup-winning team. Jaideep Vaidya goes through the career of the happy-go-lucky all-rounder who was regarded one of the best fielders in the world in his prime.

Paul Collingwood isn’t a remarkable player by a long shot. An all-rounder by trade, he isn’t an awe-inspiring batsman, and neither is he the best of medium-pace bowlers. To be fair to him, he is one of the best fielders in the world, but all these qualities still do not warrant him as many accolades as some of his other mates and compatriots, right? Perhaps not. But Collingwood has a knack of getting the job done by chipping in innocuously here and there and was regarded an inspiring captain. He is the first England skipper to win a World Cup — even if it was the Twenty20 version.

As a batsman, Collingwood isn’t the most flamboyant and stylish strokers around, but he has this delicate way of swishing his blade around that still makes it look graceful. The way he carefully cuts the ball, you feel it’s a surgeon at work with his knife, vigilantly manoeuvring himself around with exquisite dabs and touches. He’s done decently well to score 4,259 runs in 68 Tests at 40.56, including 10 centuries. In One-Day Internationals (ODIs), he’s scored 5,092 runs in 197 matches at 35.36, including 5 hundreds and 26 half-centuries. Not bad for a so-so middle-order batsman, right?

As a bowler, Collingwood was used as filler in the middle overs to give the strike bowlers a breather. However, that didn’t stop him from taking 6 for 31 in an ODI once. While we’re on that, Collingwood had scored a hundred in that game too, against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge, making him the first player in the world to score a century and take 6 wickets in one match. Collingwood beat the previous record of a century and 5 wickets in a match, set by a certain Viv Richards.

Around that time in mid-2005, Collingwood took this catch to show his fielding abilities (do not miss Matthew Hayden‘s expression):

Collingwood started playing professionally for the Durham county in the mid-90s and made his First-Class debut in 1996. In four years, he was voted Player of the Year for the county, and in 2001, his efforts eventually won him an England call-up for the triangular series at home featuring Pakistan and Australia.

Collingwood had an inauspicious start to his England career, managing scores of 2, 9, 0 and 9 in the series and not doing so well with the ball either. It took a tour of Zimbabwe to finally show his true colours as he went on to score two half-centuries and helped England secure a whitewash. This was followed by a longer drought as Collingwood struggled to find his bearings in tours to India and New Zealand, before eventually scoring his first century against Sri Lanka Down Under in 2002-03.

Collingwood’s actual Test debut came in 2003 in Galle against the Lankans, but he would like to tell his grandchildren that it was during the 2005 Ashes. He had struggled to keep a regular spot in the side until the Aussies visited England for what would turn out to be a memorable series.

Even here, Collingwood did not get a chance to feature right until the last Test at The Oval, and that too because Simon Jones was out injured. England just needed a draw to secure a historic 2-1 win and Collingwood helped out with a frustrating 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Kevin Pietersen on the final day as he must have made the Australians want to tear their hair out with his continuous, relentless blocking.

As England successfully drew the match and clinched The Ashes, Collingwood, along with the rest of the team, was awarded an MBE, after scoring 7 and 10 in the game — a highlight which caught the fancy of Shane Warne who ridiculed him during the next Ashes series Down Under in 2006-07. While bowling to Collingwood, Warne was caught on the stump mic saying, “You got an MBE, right? For scoring 7 at The Oval?”

In the 2006 tour of India, Collingwood became the first player from Durham to score a Test century. This prompted The Times, who had teamed up with Warne in its assessment of Collingwood’s MBE, to print the headline: “MBE? Give this man a knighthood!”

However, the defining tour of Collingwood’s career came during England’s Ashes trip in the Australian summer of 2006-07. Even though the Test series turned out to be a miserable outing for England, who were humiliated 0-5, the only bright spot in their report card was Collingwood, who scored a career-best 206 at Adelaide and shared a 310-run fourth-wicket partnership with Pietersen again. Collingwood thus became only the eighth English double-centurion against Australia and the first since Wally Hammond in 1928-29. In the second innings at Adelaide, Collingwood gave Australia another dose of his blocking and persisted with 22 from 119 balls, but could not prevent England from collapsing to 129, thereby giving the Aussies a 2-0 lead.

In the triangular one-day series that followed, Collingwood was again the rock as England took revenge of their Test series defeat by beating Australia twice in the best-of-three finals. Collingwood, who was coming into the first final at MCG on the back of a match-winning century against New Zealand in the last league match, walked in to bat with England reeling at 15 for 3, chasing 253.

Along with Ian Bell (65) and captain Andrew Flintoff (35) later, Collingwood helped England recover and remained unbeaten on 120 as they crossed the line with 3 balls to spare. In the second final at SCG, Collingwood again top-scored with 70 as England went on to win the match and series by 34 runs via the Duckworth-Lewis method.

Collingwood was rewarded for his heroics by being chosen as Wisden Cricketer of the Year. Wisden described him as having become the embodiment of “the sort of cricketer who not only made the most of his ability but was also determined to keep getting better.”

He was further to be rewarded with the England ODI and T20 captaincy after Michael Vaughan‘s resignation from the two formats following the team’s dismal showing at the 2007 World Cup. The then 31-year-old Collingwood told the BBC: “It is an amazing feeling for me, a great honour. I’ll have to learn the ropes as I go along but one thing is for sure, I want the players to express themselves and to be positive and aggressive.”

However, he relinquished the ODI captaincy after only a year in charge, as he felt it affected his form. Even though England recorded impressive series victories at home against India and in Sri Lanka, they lost both home and away to New Zealand. Collingwood failed to score a single ODI century in 2008, describing it as “the worst year in my career”, before eventually deciding to give up captaincy in the format. “I’ve found the extra workload to be very difficult,” he said. “I feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for England across all forms of the game.”

Collingwood continued to lead the T20 side — a stint which reached its pinnacle when England clinched the World Cup in 2010, which was the first time they had ever won a global ICC event. Even though Collingwood failed to impress with bat and ball, he hit the winning runs in the final against Australia and his captaincy was praised by the media and pundits all over.

Mediocre form in the longer format throughout 2009 and 2010 led him to announce his retirement from Tests after the 2010-11 Ashes, which England won 3-1 Down Under. “I’m very satisfied with the contributions over my Test career,” said Collingwood, as quoted by the Herald Sun. “It must not have been easy for people to watch at times, but I fought hard and gave my all.” Even old foe Warne had words of praise for Collingwood’s selfless Test exit: “Paul Collingwood has been a wonderful contributor to English cricket. I wish him well for the future. I still think making 17 runs in one Test doesn’t warrant an MBE, but I suppose I should let it go.”

Collingwood still continues to be available for England in the two shorter formats, although he last played for the national team back in 2011. If he does decide to end his international career, he will go out as England’s leading run-scorer in ODIs with 5,092.

Two debt-ridden cotton farmers staring at drought-induced crop loss — Sanjay Mohurle, 42, of Dorli village and Ramu Shende, 34, of Manoli village in the Ghatanji tehsil of Yavatmal district — committed suicide on Monday.

With four of the other five suicides also from Yavatmal (one is from Akola), it has underlined yet again how Vidarbha continues to be the epicentre of the agrarian crisis which has forced nearly 8,500 dryland farmers to end their lives across the district due to debt since 2005. On an average, three farmers kill themselves every 24 hours in the region, which has been reeling under its worst agrarian crisis.

The crisis in Vidarbha is due to truant rainfall leading to massive crop failure in cotton, paddy,

69,69,Drought Sri Lanka,A lifeline under siege - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/a-lifeline-under-siege/article4397277.ece,"Though they play a vital role in sustaining the eco-system, the country’s natural wetlands are falling prey to rising pollution and urbanisation

The World Wetlands Day (WWD) was observed sporadically across India on February 2 and yet many of us are not aware about the richness and necessity of wetlands in our lives. While wetlands are nature’s water storage and water purification zones, they are also a paradise for wildlife, fishing, angling and bird-watching, water sports, relaxation and rejuvenation. Scientists believe that wetlands are the kidneys of nature. Unfortunately, wetlands today have become mere dumping grounds for garbage, rapidly throttling the water bodies.

Over the centuries, India had a number of sustainable natural wetlands and these were the lifeline of local communities who depended on these water bodies for staple food, livestock grazing, fodder, fuel-wood transport and irrigation. In addition to the natural wetlands were a number of man-made traditional reservoirs constructed virtually in every town and village — supplying water for everyday needs. However, with booming population and burgeoning urbanisation, these self-sustaining water bodies have become increasingly filthy and unfit for human utilisation. Even the beautiful lotus and water lilies, which were part and parcel of wetlands, have disappeared in many regions.

The country’s rivers have turned into giant gutters carrying waste released by thousands of towns and cities. Although considerable money has been spent to cleanse these waterways, the government’s indifference and citizens’ ignorance have resulted in the continuation of debris being dumped into the rivers. It is estimated that three billion litres of sewage flows into the Ganga alone daily with industries also contributing their effluents.

Over the years, wetlands have been neglected and have not gained importance as other areas of nature and wildlife conservation. It is imperative that wetlands occupy the heart of conservation efforts as water management is at the core of sustainable uses of wetlands. Water scarcity today is becoming an urgent problem for mankind that needs effective remediation.

For the WWD this year, the theme set by UNESCO’s Hydrological Programme was ‘Wetlands Take Care of Water’. It reflected the interdependence between water and wetlands. “Making the link between wetlands and water is essential because without water there will be no wetlands — and without wetlands there will be no water! Wetlands such as mangroves, bogs, freshwater swamps are home to a wealth of biodiversity. Wetlands fulfil vital roles in carbon storage, pollution control and protection from natural hazards such as floods and storms. Millions of people around the world relay on wetlands as it provide ecosystem services such as food, fresh water and fuel,” says Mark Smith, director of IUCN’s Global Water Programme.

By the virtue of its geographical location, varied terrain and climatic zones, India supports a rich diversity of inland and coastal wetlands; but they are in distress currently. The Wular Lake in Kashmir or Kolleru Lake in Andhra Pradesh, two of the largest lakes in the country, are depleting as they are losing their vitality to regenerate. The story is similar for other lakes and rivers across the subcontinent.

The National Wetland Atlas, prepared by Space Applications Centre (SAC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has classified 67,429 wetlands in India occupying 60 million hectares, including paddy cultivation. The majority of these inland wetlands are dependent on major rivers like the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Narmada, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery. However, with rising water pollution, drought and water battles between various States, conservation of wetlands needs to be taken up on a war footing.

Fortunately, some of the wetlands are receiving their due importance for their contribution to the natural wealth. For instance, the Chilika Lake in Odisha is about to become the first lake from Asia to adopt the “Ecosystem Health Report Card” — an effective means of tracking and reporting the health of a wetland. The Chilika will join the elite club of iconic wetlands like Chesapeake Bay (U.S.A) and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia).

“Increased human population around wetlands adds to ecological degradation due to unsustainable practices like agriculture expansion and over-exploitation. Due to this both wildlife and people suffer, particularly water birds like the cormorants. The condition of the existing wetlands needs to be conserved as our natural assets. With judicious use of numerous useful aquatic bacteria, plants and animals associated with wetlands, harmful impurities can be removed and water can be purified,” says Emeritus Professor C.R. Babuin, in-charge of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi.","Sun, 10 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12248862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10PERISCOPELILY,"['india', 'natural', 'lifeline', 'rivers', 'water', 'wetlands', 'pollution', 'ecosystem', 'wildlife', 'siege', 'lake', 'needs']", ,none

71,71,Drought Sri Lanka,Banking on lies - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/banking-on-lies-113042600846_1.html,"Businessmen love their pictures next to their message on brochures and websites. The message of Sudipta Sen, the disgraced chairman & managing director of the Saradha group, on his website comes from an empty chair. ""Saradha Group has brought a new renaissance,"" the thought bubble says. Sen despised being photographed, so that he couldn't be easily identified when the going got rough. That explains why West Bengal's most-wanted is also its least known. There are numerous stories around him; there is a touch of Bollywood in all of them. One goes that in the 1970s, Sen had a brush with the Naxal movement and spent long years in prison. He got plastic surgery done and emerged as a land shark two decades later. His passport gives an address (Survey Park in Kolkata) where he is known as Shankar. Residents say they haven't seen him since he fled the neighbourhood 18 years ago ""after a scandal"".

Some say he has three wives, others say he has six. If you believe in the official word, you'll go with three because that's what Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said. Another account says his family lives in Noida, near Delhi. Sen has made a plea to the authorities that ""his family members should not be harassed in any manner till the last day of their lives"" and has acknowledged that he has left his ""family and children in a helpless condition"". It is possible that one of the wives, peeved at Sen's dalliance with 20-something Debjani Mukherjee, who had joined Saradha Tours & Travels as a receptionist and telephone operator in 2008 but became the executive director in no time, tipped off the police after he went absconding. Sen was nabbed at Sonmarg in Kashmir in the company of Mukherjee and Arvind Chauhan, his driver who also ran his business in Jharkhand.

He may have been a ladies' man but there aren't many who can claim to know him well. An 18-page note, written by Sen on April 6 when he was on the run, is the only document that gives an insight into his fuzzy mind. Though his passport says that he was born to Ranu Kana and Nripendra Narayan Sen, the note, which he sent to the Central Bureau of Investigation, says he is the only son of Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna Paramhamsa, the 19th-century mystic. ""I have started my business not to become a rich man,"" the letter typed on white paper bearing Sen's name, Kolkata address, three cellphone numbers and email says, ""but to establish the ideas and ideologies of Maa Saradha (sic), to help poor and needy people, and to give better life to the people of rural and semi-urban areas of India."" At least we know how the 165 companies of his Saradha group got their name.



* * *

Till recently, Sen, who, in the letter, traces his roots to a ""very lower middle-class family"", owned a business that claimed to build residential projects, operate tours, own a motorcycle factory and run a clutch of television channels (Channel 10, Tara Muzic and Tara News) and newspapers (in Bengali,andin English andin Urdu). The cash came from public deposits. Sen offered fixed deposits, recurring deposits and monthly income schemes. The returns promised were handsome. In fixed deposits, for instance, Sen promised to multiply the principal 1.5 times in two-and-a-half years, 2.5 times in 5 years and 4 times in 7 years. High-value depositors were told they would get a free trip to ""Singapur"".

Saradha Realty was the company most active in collecting money from depositors. Agents as well as depositors found Saradha's growth blinding. The company's website claims it has nine ongoing projects and says, somewhat ironically, ""Base of business - land which doesn't cheat anyone (sic)."" Sen had even told agents that he was building a township in Sri Lanka, and its advertisement would frequently pop up on his television channels. His 18-page note lists properties in the Northeast, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa.

Did these properties really exist? Some agents of Saradha admit they were taken for site visits to Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district and Jaguli in Nadia district, where two high-end residential projects were being built. In hindsight, they say something was amiss. ""We were bemused to see that only three or four people were working at the site which was being developed as a township. Sen said it would take 20 years to develop the projects as the company had so many businesses and it was not possible for him to oversee all of them,"" says Abradeep, a Saradha agent. Another site where agents were taken frequently was the factory of Sen's Global Motors in Hooghly. As many as 150 people would be made to pose as workers in an operational motorcycle factory, though it had stopped production in 2011. If that wasn't convincing enough, politicians and film stars added a heady blend of power and glitz that made Saradha look infallible. Mithun Chakraborty, Sen said in his letter to CBI, was appointed the brand ambassador for one of his television channels for a fee of Rs 20 lakh per month, though the actor ""did not participate in any function of the channel except one talk show"".

Then there were the politicians. ""We believed this group would never fail so long as Trinamool Congress was in power,"" Abradeep says. In the past few days, footage of Transport Minister Madan Mitra has been flashing across television channels in which he tells a gathering of Saradha agents at Netaji Indoor Stadium that he wishes the ""Saradha Parivar"" grows rapidly so that the next gathering can be held at Salt Lake Stadium which can seat 120,000 people. Some agents who are now protesting against Sen on the streets of Kolkata have brochures with Chief Minister Banerjee's pictures! In the brochures Banerjee can be seen inaugurating Sen's Kalom newspaper. When Sen launched Sakalbela, Banerjee sent a message that said: ""We will have to pass the dark night to begin our journey in the light of dawn."" Incidentally, when Banerjee issued a diktat on the newspapers public libraries should stock, Saradha's Sakalbela found a place on the list. Sen, reportedly, spent Rs 1.86 crore to buy paintings done by Banerjee, contributed handsomely to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund, and provided the six ambulances Banerjee donated to Kolkata Police in 2011. On her part, Banerjee has said that she didn't know Sen or Saradha - the two came to her notice only after the scandal broke out.

Still, Sen blames politicians for his misfortunes. His note is a long list of allegations against people like Trinamool Congress MPs Kunal Ghosh and Srinjay Bose, Matang Singh of Congress and Nalini Chidambaram, Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram's lawyer wife. The allegation against Nalini Chidambaram is that she forced him to invest large sums of money in a television channel owned by Manoranjana Singh, Matang Singh's estranged wife. Sources close to the lawyer have been quoted in news reports as saying that it was Sen who was interested in investing in the venture and she advised her client against it.





* * *Investigators suspect this could be Sen's ploy to divert attention from his misdemeanours. Sen's note tries to paint himself as a helpless victim of manipulative business associates (""I shall be committing suicide any moment not because I am physically or mentally sick but because I am feeling helpless because of unscrupulous persons and cheats in the society.""), though at times it admits that he indulged in fraudulent practices (""All the shareholders and directors appearing in the articles and memorandum of my companies are dummy (sic). Even my cook Hemant Pradhan is also included in the names of the directors, though he doesn't even know the meaning of director.""), and had a strange way of doing business (""In June 2008, my two drivers, Ratan and Dipu, came to my Shakespeare Sarani office and brought one man…."").

Depositors say Sen's companies were prompt with payments in the first year. Trouble started in January when his employees didn't get their salaries on time. Then agents were told to make payments for maturities with fresh collections or make adjustment against renewals. ""Sen asked us, why can't you keep running the show for a month? He promised he was trying to sell his cement business to arrange for the money. We too decided to help him in bad times,"" says Abradeep. But what caused the bubble to burst? Sen has said in his note that the foray into media and the huge payouts to Trinamool Congress MPs, who he says had assured him protection from the state government if there was trouble, did him in. According to Sen, the payout to politician and others worked out to Rs 33 crore every month.

To his agents, Sen had said he has lost a great deal of money in a real-estate project. To some other agents, Sen had said he was forced to give Rs 1,200 crore to Reserve Bank of India and Rs 600 crore to Securities Exchange Board of India to keep his business afloat, which had eroded all his wealth. Said-ul-Islam was one of the few agents to have spoken to Sen last on April 15, after which his cell phone was switched off. ""Sen sought time from us to arrange the money needed to meet redemption as one of his projects where he had invested all the money had run into trouble. I was convinced and even sympathetic to Sen. It was all a farce,"" recalls Islam. Sen says that he has returned Rs 2,000 crore and his dues till 2026 are about Rs 2,206 crore. However, he has said in his note that his net liabilities would not be more than Rs 400 crore. Banerjee has set aside Rs 500 crore for the depositors; a part of this money will come from a higher duty on cigarettes.

While Sen is in prison, it is left for his agents to face the ire of the depositors. Kalipada Naskar, 60, looks disturbed as he stands facing Saradha's registered office in Salt Lake's Sector V. He became a Saradha agent a year ago after he was told that he could earn up to Rs 15,000 a month in commissions and also get retirement benefits. Ever since Sen's business went belly up, depositors have hounded Naskar and 300,000 other Saradha agents. Some call him names, others threaten him with dire consequences. ""I am helpless, I am sick,"" says Naskar. A few blocks away, about 15 people have assembled outside another office of Saradha. These are the depositors who have come to inquire about the fate of their investments. The crowd includes old and young people, mostly poor.

It's a heart-wrenching scene. These are the people who had voted Banerjee to power two years ago. She owes it to them. Just asking people to smoke more won't help.","Sat, 27 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2013-04/23/full/1366723080-5218.jpg,"['rs', 'banerjee', 'note', 'saradha', 'sens', 'sen', 'agents', 'business', 'lies', 'crore', 'money', 'banking']", ,none

The beverage major, which has the title rights for the sixth season of IPL 20-20 tournament, is close to sewing up the pouring rights with eight of the nine teams in the fray, other than Mumbai Indians. This gives PepsiCo right to sell and promote their portfolio of products in the home stadium of each team.

Cola Cola India has a multiple-year contract with Mumbai Indians, with Sachin Tendulkar being one of the celeb brand ambassadors.

Last year, Coca Cola had pouring rights with five teams – Mumbai Indians, Delhi Daredevils, Kolkata Knight Riders, Hyderabad Deccan Chargers, Kings XI Punjab - while rival PepsiCo had the pouring rights for Rajasthan Royals, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sahara Pune Warrior, Chennai Super Kings.

When contacted, a PepsiCo India spokesperson said: “Our activation plans and other partnership including pouring rights are under discussion.” Some of the IPL team managers said on condition of anonymity that they were close to signing on the dotted line.

Teams typically charge anywhere between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1.5 crore for pouring rights, depending on the level of engagement with the sponsor. Apart from pouring rights, PepsiCo is likely to enter into separate sponsorship deals with each of the teams that would entail them use of brand logo in players’ dress, or right to use players for promotion of events, etc. “Each deal is different depending on the package they mutually agree on,” said a commercial manager of one of the teams.

PepsiCo own the IPL title rights for five years for Rs 397 crore in November last year, adding fizz to the Cola battle. The sixth season of IPL tournament – scheduled for April-May - falls right at the start of the peak summer season, a period that accounts for 40-45 per cent of soft drink sales in the country.

This year the battle among the cola players started early on in January. PepsiCo rolled out its “Oh Yes Abhi” campaign starring Ranbir Kapoor, MS Dhoni and Priyanka Chopra. Coca-Cola India ushered in the New Year with its 'Crazy for Happiness' brand campaign in January. Last month, PepsiCo roped in Hrithik as the new brand ambassador for Mountain Dew, in place of Salman Khan, who moved on to be the face of Cola Cola’s Thums Up. “We want to further enhance visibility of the brand and are looking forward to a blockbuster summer,” a Pepsico spokesperson said without giving details of the campaign starring Hrithik Roshan.

In an unlikely move, Coca Cola rolled out a campaign for its mango drink, Maaza, in the winter months with Bollywood stars Imran Khan and Parineeta Chopra, with the tag line “Har Mausam Love, Har Mausam Aam”. However, the advertising fraternity expects the firework to lighten up in the battle among the cola majors when Salman Khan hits the screen this summer as the new face of Thums Up.

As a run-up to the Salman Khan campaign, early last week Coca Cola launched a road show – Thums Up Jalsa – that would hit 400 towns and cities across the country. “This is one of our largest consumer connect initiative for rural India,” a company spokesperson said. The soft drink major plans to roll out a nationwide campaign with Salman Khan and with South superhero Mahesh Babu in Andhra Pradesh, in the summer of 2013.

The battle between the two cola majors for larger share of consumer mind space and the spending pie, typically reaches a crescendo in the summer months from March-end to early July. Each year the two cola majors cumulatively spend around Rs 350-400 crore on advertising, and promotion, around 55 per cent of which is earmarked for the summer months.

“They are make-or-break months for both the players,” said Sridhar Ramanujam, founder-CEO, Brand-Comm, a Bangalore-based brand consulting firm. He expects overall advertising spend this summer to be more than that of summer of 2012.

The $8billion (Rs 45,000-Rs 50,000 crore) liquid refrigerated beverage market in India – around half of which is carbonated soft drinks - is marked by low per capita consumption. According to Ministry of Food Processing and Industry, per capita consumption level in India is 5-6 bottles compared to 17 bottles in Pakistan, 21 bottles in Sri Lanka, 73 bottles in Thailand, 173 bottles in Phillipines and 605 bottles in Mexico. “The summers are best time to grow the market and deepen the penetration,” said a senior executive from one of the cola companies. IPL6 will only add fizz to that battle.","Tue, 19 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2013-02/19/full/1361290062-9988.jpg,"['pepsico', 'india', 'summer', 'rs', 'campaign', 'brand', 'bottles', 'hots', 'cola', 'early', 'rights', 'pouring', 'war']", ,none

World Diabetes Day: The effect on older people in Africa

14 November is World Diabetes Day, a disease which according to the World Health Organization (WHO), affects more than 180 million people worldwide. WHO also estimates that the prevalence of diabetes in Africa varies between one and 20%. The global spread of diabetes has given it all the characteristics of a pandemic.

WHO projects that the number of people with diabetes is likely to more than double by 2030. In 2005, an estimated 1.1 million people died from diabetes, almost 80% of them occurring in low and middle-income countries. Diabetes is no longer a disease of affluent countries; it is affecting people all over the world.

Global health problem

Diabetes is particularly serious due to its complications: cardiovascular ailments, cerebral vascular accidents, renal insufficiency, blindness, sexual impotence and gangrene of the feet which can lead to amputation. Diabetes and associated chronic conditions are rapidly emerging as major and global health problems.

Research also shows that diabetes affects older people disproportionately. For example, in developing countries, the majority of those with the disease are aged between 45 and 64.

My parents are both diabetic. Most of their friends and relatives the same age have diabetes. I have watched relatives succumb to diabetes-related complications. The increase in the number of cases of people living with diabetes in Africa is truly shocking.

In fact, I almost expect most of the older people I meet to be diabetic and am often surprised when I find out they are not! In the past, it was rare to find older people suffering from diabetes. My paternal grandparents are the only people I knew of their age at the time who were diabetic.

The costs of diabetes

Due to the hereditary factor, I expect that I will become diabetic. This scares me tremendously. I have watched my parents work their day-to-day schedules around doctors' appointments, buying expensive medication and visiting their friends who are ill and even attending funerals. The financial costs of living with diabetes is daunting, especially in Africa where older people do not have a steady income and medical insurance.

My parents are the luckier ones. In fact, they and most of their friends are lucky to have some income and family support during their illness. I dread to think of older people, the urban and rural poor, who cannot afford the medication, who do not have money to visit medical facilities and who die because they did not know enough about their condition or were not even diagnosed.

I need to work hard to reduce the risk of developing diabetes. That is the challenge that younger people and governments need to embrace. While diabetes may not be reversed, it can be contained. The need to focus on non-communicable diseases is now, more than ever before, important for the African continent. The cost of illnesses such as diabetes is high. Just ask my parents.

74,74,Drought Sri Lanka,TransConflict » More new writing from Serbia – post-modern excavations of the common life - TransConflict,http://www.transconflict.com/2012/11/more-new-writing-from-serbia-post-modern-excavations-of-the-common-life-271/,"Three new pieces of writing from Serbia take up and engage significant omissions in official history and public discourse – among them the homegrown democracy of the prosaic, the local and the pastoral interrupted by conflict, and death under uncompromising centralization and endless transition to nowhere.

By Norman Wacker

“Next Friday,” I say, “and for your homework, write out a conversation with your best friend in Cyrillic.” “My best friend is in Osijek,” – “Learning Cyrillic”, David Albahari.

Clearly they make now no distinction, where a life is concerned between a provincial merchant and his wife, between a village priest (which is what my great grandfather was) and a village bell ringer called Ćuk, whose name also figures in the book. The only condition – something I grasped at once, it seems to have come to me even before I could confirm it – for inclusion in the Encyclopedia of the Dead is that no one whose name is recorded here may appear in any other encyclopedia – “Encyclopedia of the Dead,” Danilo Kiš.

You can only recognize a gift by its effects, by what it leaves behind – Farewell Gift, Vladimir Tasić.

We (and this “we” I take to be universal – the club of victims and perpetrators is far from exclusive, or for that matter mutually exclusive) who have endured divorce, defeat, loss of a sibling, child or parent, suffered the earthquakes enfolded in the euphemism “regime change,” who have fouled precious goods or had them befouled, know how dogged are the intrusions of past losses and indiscretions ignored, concealed or gone otherwise unacknowledged. Formidable barricades of plausible and implausible denial, self-censorship and official silence, even seemingly vast stretches of successful forgetting, are breached during our dreams, our interludes of intoxication, and our bouts of homesickness. Our soiled pasts can be resurrected against our wishes by incidental references or lapses of vigilance, opening unsolicited floods of memory and heightening the guilty impulse to doctor, deny or erase again the loss, humiliation or guilt. Denial and forgetting defend against loss that acknowledged would unravel the fabric of who we once hoped to be and the place we hoped to secure in family, community, or the grandiose future legacies and riches, those treasured effects we would leave to posterity.

Three new releases in the Belgrade publishing house Geo Poetika’s Serbian Prose in Translation series, as varied as they are stylistically and with respect to setting, take-up a common thread, narratives of personal and collective loss that require active recall and reconstruction, which excavate the collective waste of humanity and community that accompanied the destruction of common life during the age of the Yugoslav conflict and since in its successor state, Serbia. That interruption of the families, educations, careers, places and countries of residence of those who lived in the region, serves as a kind of muted wall paper against which these narratives – whether monologue, meta-fictional collage, melodrama or cheeky documentary – narrate lives and times unravelled. Against this background, these writers construct truncated and fragmented narratives of recall and return against the grain of forgetting and erasure. They depict a kind of stasis and stagnation that holds up the mirror to life in a post-conflict society in which heady infusions of global marketing, high-end retail destinations, kafana culture escapism and bouts of ultranationalist muscle flexing, poorly conceal that the post-conflict “transformation” has proven protracted, disappointing or, with respect to its fondest and maddest hopes, gone altogether unrealized. Pensioners, unhappily expatriated mid-lifers at their teaching, sky cap and IT development posts abroad, cardiac patients and lives otherwise conducted at the very tip of the furthest branches of family trees uprooted, act as the protagonists of this post-Yugoslav archipelago, that seem to be interesting varieties of Penelope (and/or Ulysses) embattled whether in their over-run homes or while at sea. Ulysses it seems may have never survived, as rumour insisted, his conscription and deployment to battle at Vukovar, or escaped his drug-addled becalming in New York or Belgrade’s crisis era all-night party scene to realize his long entertained return. He may have only inwardly migrated to New Belgrade or crossed the seas to Manitoba, or never left home at all (like the Serbian Leopold and Molly) or long since established a new home and hearth elsewhere without a forwarding address. The suitors remain largely off-stage here, their hegemony less obstructed by the witty un-designs of Penelope or the dreamlike promiscuity of Molly than their own truly Homeric bickering, contention and squandered chances without end.

The phantom limbs of former lifelines – the disappearance and the presumed, but un-consecrated deaths of identical twins, hero-worshipped siblings, first-born mail children, neighbours and childhood friends, the retreat of parents into dysfunction and silence – beset our narrator’s and their protagonists. Their resulting fictions amount to a narrative reconstruction of the most immediate intimate of personal and domestic ties, their destruction. The resulting narratives evoke collateral losses of community, vocation and personal integration once enjoyed by those phantom-like approximations of former selves who have survived into the post-conflict present. Together these fictions engage the persistent legacy of two decades of ruined reputation, economic stagnation, perceived victimization and betrayal that accompanied the Yugoslav conflict. They are voiced in various ways. They include an unbroken monologue saturated with rescued texts and episodes of the narrator’s missing sibling (Vladimir Tasić’s, Farewell Gift), composed of the discontinuous and interrupted coming of age of a speaker at once under construction and simultaneously deconstructing received ideas (Mića Vujičić’s, Tackling Foul) or in a darkly inconclusive post-modern script etched on official and elite discourse of convenience (Radivoj Šajtinac’s, Victims of Biedermeier). Together these works write in obverse on the ideological constructions that distanced Serbs in the homeland from events just beyond their borders, alienated them in the abroad-to-be from their neighbours and contributed to their expulsion from the republics and entities to come and their unsettling on foreign shores in large numbers. These fictions allow virtual reconstruction at a spatial and temporal distance of the continuity of past and present lives, one no longer conceivable in actuality – though discount air fares, Skype and Cyrillic lessons in Calgary and California sustain a parallel universe in which families and communities that live on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond pick up lost threads and tend to their mending. Grandiose official memorializing of course abounds throughout the new republics, while leaving the small scale work of invention, recovery and reclamation undone. These works navigate the complex hybrid of destruction and grandiose new orders and begin to assemble a textual and reflective record from pieces that remain of everyday lives and trajectories of history interrupted – an impetus to taking them up and examining to what extent we have known them well at all.

I recently visited the graves of relations in the municipality of Bor. We formed a small party and completed a midsummer cleaning and repair, brushing away drought-browned cypress needles, removing floral arrangements from a Spring visit, as our cousin-in-law renewed the gilt lettering on the black headstone and we left are usual mementoes of travels during our absence. A simple ritual of care, remembrance and small gifts, taking up the multi-generational conversation and web of memory which connects the lives of those born into and joined by marriage into a common constellation of being human for a time on earth. Adjoining graves of several generations were in varied states of neglect and maintenance. The most recent plots awaited a monument; other monuments memorialized a small nuclear family passed in its entirety; some listed the names of family members yet to join those already among the dead. Some were buried under the sign of the Yugoslav star, more recent deaths under the sign of the Orthodox cross, a few with the Roman cross, some under the signs of their vocations or under individual expressions of cherished regard expressed in Roman or Cyrillic letters. Most contained an inordinately evocative and unassuming oval photograph – a portrait of newly-weds, a silver anniversary, a child, a teen or a solitary portrait of advanced age, evoking questions of what it means to live a time too brief or of extraordinary duration and event. In towns of the region likenesses across a surprising generational spectrum can also be seen in markets, schools and work in mourning clothes in honour of other family members recently passed, a traditional form of common observance recently revived. Like residents of Joyce’s Dublin they seem at once to live at once among and converse with the living as they pay homage in dress and likeness to the dead. This assemblage of former residents, many still receiving the care of their local relations reminded me of the large and increasingly neglected graveyard above the ruins of a once imposing Orthodox church at the foot of steep slope in Eastern Mostar, record of a once large Serbian population spanning two centuries. The graves are not mentioned in day tours of Stari Most, and perhaps it is this very slope that has been erased from the geography lessons of Western Mostar school texts. However, these graves do evoke the symbolic power and resonance for the living who possess such tangible sites for visitation, stock-taking and expression of pent-up gratitude, appreciation care and loss can fuel humanizing identifications quite different from their use as regalia of vendetta and settling scores. And how ominous in context is any neglected single grave, let alone a collection of a whole former community’s graves, remnants of a once living fabric of habitation divided even today only by a steep foot path run between the separate sites for Serb and Croat memorials.

This was a somewhat different perspective on the infamy of recent conflict, often fought in the name of ancient graves, monasteries and the lingering grievances of medieval days remote in every way from the present. How unlike the official graves and monuments of post-conflict commemoration of exclusively male greater Serbia or Homeland Warriors, a continuation of the pre-conflict rehabilitation of royalists, paramilitaries and those pressed into service along-side wartime collaborators with foreign invaders. In Mostar and in Bor graveyards remain microcosms of whole and plural communities past in which the great grandparents, grandparents and the parents of the living and the missing are preserved. Sorrowfully, patches (or whole hillsides) of graves unattended, do in fact signify familial and communal dying off, and the flight, forced migration and generational ties sundered – ill things each for the hopes of the dead and the sense of identity and legacy of the living. While links between the space of literary invention and the realities of the social present are not by any means a given, I find myself wondering if meditations on loss which abandon “official” touchstones of heritage, faith and nation in these fictions are just such an engagement, particularly of the humble and small-scale losses that seem to reverberate with such a common darkness. They are among the most inconsolable sort of loss, unaccompanied by a record of the circumstances whereby family members became missing and presumed dead or ended lives of inestimable value to the living by their own hands. These works, taken together, render intimate and effaced losses through personal voice, the prism of narrative and writerly experiment, literary media sanctioned neither by faith or nation, and as they do they may articulate an alternative to the limits and dysfunctions imposed by impersonal and largely narratives that originate in a mythic and dictatorial above.

Tackling Foul is set in the village in the village of Mokrin, one of a chain of hamlets and small towns that compose the “Grassroots Soccer League,” a collective from which no club can perform so dismally as to earn demotion. Mokrin is connected by local soccer matches, open-air markets, summer travel to Kotor and by conflict to Vukovar and its place in the events that swept across Serbia in the age of Milosevic. It is during the siege of Vukovar that the steps of the novel’s missing protagonist Sima, the narrator’s uncle and his father’s identical twin, disappear. The narrator morns three unresolved losses, that are of some consequence for the household whose sole male heir is our young narrator. Grandfather Duša has receded into dementia, carrying with him the secret of how to distinguish the narrator’s father from his twin Sima by appearance. Sima, conscripted to fight in the JNA actions on the Croatian front, contributes to a third loss with his disappearance, the disorientation of the father’s life- long dialogue with his fraternal twin – a loss marked each time the father announces upon returning home “it’s me!” to distinguish his arrival from the longed-for return of Sima. Biologically identical (Duša as his powers fail settles on addressing them in the plural), they have shared a common and incessant dialogue and been decorated by identical scars of their parallel passage through experience. Sima has a missing front tooth dislodged by a cavorting dolphin; father (known throughout the narrative present as the “Twin” or the “Referee”) referees soccer matches and among his many injuries inflicted by irate players and fans is the identical tooth knocked out in post-match protest. His loss of a kind of double paternity animates the narrator’s preoccupation with the body of the very different documents authored by the twins. The circle of those losses subtly expands as the documents are collected. Memories of the impulse to tackle cleanly acted out by Sima after a night of binge drinking and to referee, by the Twin who interrupts Sima’s display and call’s time, suggests the forces for abandon and art barely contained in the churning open-ended contests waged between forefathers and sons, among siblings and across the grass-roots soccer league on the Twin’s watch and now in Sima’s absence. There is also, the last effigy of a teenage neighbour who unlike our narrator is a brilliant soccer prospect. Shortly before the lad disappeared into the Vukovar inferno, the Twin video-taped a display of the boy’s mastery of footwork and ball control. The video-cassette remains locked in a suitcase, a legacy too freighted with belonging to add to the pyre of all else the conflict has destroyed, but too charged with parental loss and the Twin’s survivor’s guilt to be given to the boy’s parents who have remained alive. The family home is full of similar eccentric archives. Uncle Sima a left behind a single work of prose fiction, Tito in Mika’s Espadrilles the story of Tito’s mis-identification of a local poet and journalist for a bus driver by Marshal Tito during a formal banquet honoring municipal achievement in Novi Sad. Mika is later able to use a photo of his photo with the Marshal to cut through the red-tape required for the purchase of a car. The Referee enters each match he officiates in an archive of graph paper ledgers, authors a commentary the narrator entitles “My Father’s Rules of the Game” recounting the rules of the game perfected, analogies between soccer and the well-lived life and a Homeric catalogue of all the names, obscenities and injuries received officiating – he has been pummelled equally by irate players and fans – having like Woody Allen and Danilo Kis received beatings by a kind of United Nations of neighbours, aspiring toughs and schoolmates on the playfields of his youth. The obscenities, catalogued and taken in stride, are part of the equanimity and unprejudiced judgement the Referee extols. The numbers (particularly those on the player’s jerseys) feature in the colour blind Referee’s ability to keep order among the indistinguishable identifying colours of the two sides, an absurdly ingenious compensation for disability that lends mock-heroic scale to this and the other comic eccentricities and preoccupations of the Twin. The exact place of Sima’s last known appearance is never determined. The gap resonates as the older generation fades, fails and the younger generation seeks, through an accounting of the eccentric genre of the archive, to recover in the traumatized reticence of the present adult generation principals of continuity. A lower-case archaeology of heritage and identity results rooted in matters that straddle the public and domestic, supplemented by conjecture and invention. Examined through the apertures of privacy and eccentricity, our narrator crafts an account of shared manners of being in and imparting order to a chaotic and ephemeral common encounter with the shaping destructions of the actual world.

Our narrator’s rummaging of the familial archive, describes the selective, partial and discontinuous insights to be glimpsed and the medium in which they are conveyed. Having examined the most unpromising remnants of the lost and un-memorialized, (including randomly catalogued personal libraries, personal journals, receipts inserted as book marks in the texts of others, the minutes of soccer league steering committee meetings, supplemented by oral stories, the logs full of the numeric calculations of his father, his catalogue of personal beatings at the hands of players and fans), the narrator assembles something of a world view, one equal parts noise and elegy, omission and insight:

My overview of the game, now it turned out my overview of life, well, it would be hard for me to say that it was perfect. I watched life through the slats of the window blinds. Attempted to piece together, expressed in my father’s jargon- to capture the positions of my team-mates on the pitch – I composed a mosaic, using scenes I gathered peering through the slats of the window blinds, moving from one to another; now squatting, then standing on my tiptoes, leaning against the windowpane (41).

The Referee’s archive is a particularly fitting metaphor for the resulting narrative practice. A valid command of and perspective upon events in an enterprise contested over decades, producing outcomes equal parts intimidation and art, comes into view. Its medium is a pitch that can be by turns shrouded in falling darkness, scorched by the lucidity and fire of high afternoon sun, beset by thermal mirages and trod into quagmire or hard pan and its bleachers and sidelines embroiled by the partisan loyalties of multi-generational fandom while leaving unscathed a Platonic memory of the field as the ideal green sward of one’s youth and community. Our narrator assembles from his archive an account of the deftly arbitrated and artful war for supremacy-within-continuity that is football, the role of record keepers and memorialists to assure the game is practiced consistently on this side of ruin, corruption and crippling injury. This pattern of order and craft articulated at the intersection of contending sides in matches that are organized by the league which stages them, is valorized as a kind of open-ended and critical double of the narrator’s narrative practice, preserving pattern, meaning making and accomplishment among the flows of potential disorder and contention.

Tackling Foul like a comic lost and implausibly extended entry from Kiš’s Encylopedia of the Dead depicts a humble and resourceful cottage industry of abiding ingenuity and survival with storm clouds of former conflicts and conflicts in the making looming overhead. Set during the early days of the troubles, the narrator’s family home houses his mother Mila’s anti-Milosevic pirate radio broadcasts during the height of the Yogurt Revolution that consolidated the Milosevic dictatorship. The resulting multi-media encyclopaedia of minor league competition across an archipelago of small-scale communities, the multi-generational threads of family and the incremental and decentralized maintenance of lower case culture and working accommodation grown up around them, is recovered from the obliterating shadow of Milosevic era ultra-modern violence, dictatorship and its ersatz regalia of ancient heritage, faith and the vilification of difference.

The narrator and the protagonist of Victims of Biedemeir share two never-to-converge poles that lend speculative depth-of-field and deconstructive power to fiction making, the contribution of language itself to the shaping and articulation of reality and the role of imagined action in representing meaning, character and value. Together, artful design and the unintended meanings and influences it sets in motion, map the fallibility of human life, which can never anticipate or conceptualize by iteration the omniscient perspective in the imagined eye of God to which it aspires. The imaginative writer given the self-existing nature of his medium can generate, but cannot both invent and defer to orthodoxy and realism. He occupies a void that is neither history or reality, something more like a netherworld between self-inferring patterns of words and the meaning readers come to find in them. The writer’s constructions, gratefully, are not bound by the limits of our understanding and, at the same time any instance of composition is in fact a foray beyond what we can exhaustively know or uses others make of it. A novel is a kind of range-finding via the obliqueness of word in relation to word. Its overshooting and undershooting of objects the writer wishes to render, opens up a space never to be closed between representing and knowing. Šajtinac marks just this space as the terrain of his novel. Language hovers above the muted and inchoate nature of reality prior to or independent of language. To write is by nature to (over) state, and meaningful imagined action is an equally fictive tableau, but one that can be scrutinized for all the resulting contingencies the actor cannot know at its inception. The writer evokes a character who does little more than occupy the point of composition that produces a smudge of writerly self-reference to sound, soundings or surroundings. The dawn composed of vaporous degrees of greyness solidifies as a bank of the Danube that situates both writer and character, equally and in parallel quandaries, beset by chronic pain and failing health, “Plucking at images and sentences, building embankments and the locks around them, the acceptance of the first growth along the shoreline, of being colour and sound. “ As the writer writes, the actor Vukašin Pomorišac reads the Tuesday, April 2, 1991 New York Times for any documentation direct or oblique of his son’s death a decade prior by suicide in a plunge from a prominent Manhattan high rise during rush hour. The return to the text is provoked by Vukašin finding a cryptic reference to death trips and liberation in a borrowed occult encyclopaedia found in the apartment of Ratislav’s surviving brother Slaviša, setting in motion fears that his other son is at risk of some kind of cult-like exploration of death as liberation, a possible contagion inherited from his dead brother. There is neither the hoped for direct reference by news item, nor the obituary of his son’s death by suicide in a foreign land at peace, while oblique references to the mounting “troubles” in the former Yugoslavia are mentioned in passing. The organ of imagined metropolitan and global community, the NY Times makes space on the front page for an obituary and homage to the founder of modern dance Martha Graham, the signing of pitcher Doc Gooden to a three year contract with the New York baseball Mets and an article by Chuck Sudetic depicting trouble brewing between “Serbian rebels” and quotation mark-free Croatian police next to a drawing of the Plitivice lakes, “That text is controversial, imposing, almost prophetic; it hints perhaps at war, here where he is now, or here where he came from” (12). If Ratislav’s death escaped coverage in the Times, his steps prior to his death can be reconstructed from his effects returned by the New York authorities. Photographs in Battery Park with the Statue of Liberty in the background, the “CBGB” marquee Mecca of punk rock, the Book Tower from which Ratislav will leap. However, the copious documentary evidence does not reveal elements of an impending personal crisis. In fact, we will learn that the suicide is launched during what seems to be a realization of dreams, first-hand experience of the New York music scene Ratislav admires and a desire-at-first-sight affair set against the backdrop of books, visual art and the location scenes from a vault full of admired American films. The photos suggest personal pleasure of a long anticipated kind could somehow coexist with or even incubate the choice to destroy the self. The discontinuity between pleasure and desperation evident among the denial-ridden sound-tracks of American life comes into view only when a letter (the original misrouted by chance -written communication is it seems always hit and miss) comes to Vukašin providing a behind-the-scenes narrative of Ratislav’s photo album. This structure, in which visual documentation and the expressed values, beliefs and preferences of Vukašin’s offspring do not of their own yield explanation, has its parallel as the writer-arranger of the novel launches Vukašin upon a study of the life and work of Konstantin Danil.

The master of the Biedermeier school of painting is commissioned to decorate numerous Orthodox churches with icons central to the definition of the Church as an interval of sacred space in a fallen world. In actuality they prove as ambiguous as they are iconic. They are products of lucrative commissions by wealthy bourgeois benefactors that make Danil one of the wealthiest painters of his age. They are also an attempt to express by formal and worldly means (line, shadow, light, pigment, precious metal and decoration) uncompromised figurative renderings of the spiritual, as etheric and unalloyed as prayers elevated above impulse and self-interest. The most sacred stations in the life of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Fathers of the Eastern church seem opulent, yet consecrated by the authority of the Holy Church whose earthly buildings thereby merge with the realm of the timeless, a heavenly continuity that overarches the practice of human faith and frailty on earth. However, the pictures are also, chalk lines laid on by Danil’s assistants, too linear approximations of the painterly line that will flow from Danil’s esthetic and temperamental impulses that impel movement of the painter’s brush. Luminous, decorative, ornate, even luxurious, they seem a reality apart from and even an imperious contrast to the pallet of the landscapes and communities in which they are installed. The patrons are bourgeois and self-aggrandizing, the painter aspires to esthetic perfection, the religious dispensation under which he labours cannot be realized on earth, but is given iconic and decorative expression on which prayers, the social status of the patrons and the esthetic ambitions of the painter ascend.

Vukashin becomes fascinated by a subset of Danil’s work, the contested, unsigned and missing works attributable to Danil and their undecideable status – can they be authenticated and their value established on the art market, in the annals of faith and of the lands whose fruitfulness provided the material wealth extracted from them? Would only these unsigned works transcend the worldly calculation of fame, profit and orthodoxy of gesture and message that informs the work signed, commissioned and lavishly rewarded? The painter ends a commission with a visit to the completed main icon of the Holy Virgin a rendering of Sofia von Deli and of the Lord Jesus Christ. He composes a prayer while kneeling at the intersection of patron, savior and examples of his mastery of earthly representations of the unrealized unity towards which religion aspires without ever necessarily arriving:

The one who dared to look in this direction from that side of the holy doors into the eyes of the Master, the edified Konstantin Daniel, the creator of beauty, can see incomparably better than the human eyes can see. Look, Lord Jesus Christ, just this moment when Your human sight only lasts a moment, a blink, how from the work it is separated and with Your Holy Church is wed, for ever and ever, Your servant, the creator and painter Konstantin Daniel, the year of our lord eighteen fifty-five, here, in Zlobica, in Serbian Banat. And forgive him, this servant of God, all his pride and free him of all his human weaknesses, Your child, and let him gain from You and believing in You, Lord faithfully serving, for ever and ever Amen. (93)

Situated between the double gaze of the worldly beauty of Sofia von Deli in Danil’s effigy of the Holy Virgin Mary and the all-seeing gaze of his representation of the penetrating vision of the human Christ at the threshold of his transfiguration from man to God, Danil dedicates the work conceived as art and executed in human frailty. In a shutter-click of discontinuous vision (gaze of neither god or man) it is merges the Church an earthly institution that transcends time and which by its authority memorializes the lives and works of its founders and saints. But, what of works of art and artists, “living beings, who rot in heaven?” Their lives are terminated like those of all other humans, while their notoriety remains in circulation long after their passing – neither it seems, truly God or solely man. The distance that opens up between work and time, a trick designed in part to evade the wages of time, seems nonetheless moribund under its own weight, ironic approximations in pigment, gaslight and mannerism of the spirituality it hoped to render and perpetuate. The ultimate disparity between the figuration on which communication of God’s timeless and omniscient rides and the humble wonders of the prosaic world outside the Holy Doors are juxtaposed – an apotheosis of separations. The ponderous display of accumulated artistic striving and worldly pride recedes and alacrity returns, the prosaic replaces solemnity and prayer, the meaning and the limits of the master’s work sketched through the eye of one of Danil’s assistants, newly alive it seems to the ironies of esthetic mastery:

And then if there was a foggy or icy veil in the air, before our eyes, crossing ourselves, we stood up and when we turned toward the other door through which we had entered the church and there we came upon the sunshine, the courtyard scattered with brightness of day, blooming fruit trees and bees busily gathering honey and not one of them trying to be the first or even the best among them.

There is a natural world – immediate, self-authoring and luminous – in which line, brush stroke, shadow, light and colour represent by figurative approximation and ornament. Similarly, the writer’s syntactical articulations both gesture toward and displace the events that flow behind and beyond the acuity rendered by verbal representations of worldly and otherworldly realities. The post-modern delineation of the double self-presences of language, the world’s self-offering and their irreconcilable distance, graphs the unarticulated, the amorphous and the activity of nearly inexhaustible form making and its invariable remoteness from the destination desired.

The theme of The Farewell Gift has a nearly apocalyptic doubleness that builds on the sibling themes of twin-ship and sibling bonds destroyed in each of these fictions. Here a brilliant sibling grown more anomic and erratic as he comes of age, establishes an acerbic and dismissive attitude towards his hero-worshipping brother and close companion as well as toward the intelligence and design of the world around him. Near-identity, overlapping intellectual interests and small increments of difference produce catastrophic and humiliating disparity for the narrator. He is left with only the unexplained disappearance and death of the elder brother and a non-descript tin of funeral ashes to identify the endpoint and significance of the elder brother’s descent into madness. What explains small differences ramifying in to disfiguring qualitative differences that dwarf and denigrate? The device of the double is used to examines the mirror-like family resemblance of two male siblings to explore the gestation of a disparity so inordinate. Closeness it seems can produce semblance, cooperation or rivalry, but not necessarily a vantage point that amounts to true knowledge or dispassionate insight:

Had I been able to observe the two of us at play, I would have realized that those subtle differences were big enough to account for one of the most pathetic Ping-Pong matches in the history of the Table Tennis Club on Anton Chekhov Street in Novi Sad. I lost fifty-six sets in a row playing my brother. Thus the expression “crushing defeat” acquired an entirely new, quantitative meaning for me.

The brother’s memory of arcane and technical matter is photographic, though not invariably tied to appreciation or engagement with the material mastered. His powers of retention like his command of esoteric knowledge across a broad range of disciplines is wide-ranging, yet utterly transient, abandoned whenever knowing comes to seem indistinguishable from social one-ups-man ship, feeding a sense of domination and superiority. His mastery of chess, table tennis, verbal put-down, the technique of classical painters, comparative mythology are each jettisoned in turn, in a kind of ruthless pursuit of knowledge to deflate, denigrate and discredit, a caustic epistemology that borders on descent into mania or schizophrenia on the eve of his exit from the sibling’s and parents’ lives forever and without notification. The disappearance of the elder brother is shadowed in short order by the expatriation of the younger to Manitoba for work and to evade conscription. The digression that follows juxtaposes two narrative modes, an open-ended catalogue of the madness merged with genius of the brother’s pursuits, and the digressive, discontinuous monologue of his virtual double in which these elements are floated. The two narratives threaten to merge and destroy, though the monologue recalls, circles back, perhaps presenting in narrative time, perspective unavailable in real time. Memory it seems is knowing; forgetting feeds pathology and blindness. The narrator indeed seems to have found a kind of haven and vantage-point in exile from which to view the housing estate and university bad-boy act of his charismatic other. Domesticity and rebellion, the colloquial and the elite, the prosaic and the arcane filter the other. The nearly merged perspectives together form a kaleidoscopic and fragmenting hybrid of bookishness, artistic pretensions, fringe hooliganism and contempt for poseurs, snobs and any form of celebrity. A carnival of intelligence, punkish attitude and dissolution in the name of authenticity makes an oddly nostalgic, yet acerbic period piece, brightness become inexplicable, a vaunted independent streak melting down as the inferno breaks out in Yugoslavia. The narrator’s unbroken digression upon the single subject of his brother’s exploits threatens to disappear into the compulsions that may have destroyed him. However, digression, evasion and denial, build layer upon incongruous layer of hard-fired recall of a brilliance that flamed-out before reaching its coming-of-age. The narrator produces an oddly unhappy and candid memorial. He clearly mourns deeply, but the portrait is far short of endearing; the brilliance depicted proves more incendiary than illuminating.

If the reader would prefer progressives and populists, draft-evasion and emigration belonging and dispossession sharply distinguished, or a chronological analysis of where promising lives and times went wrong, the Farewell Gift withholds just this kind of conclusive summation. The action begins with a pronouncement “My brother is dead. One could say a box of ashes is all that is left of him, but even the box is empty now.” It ends with an equally bleak instance on apparent if non-discursive closure, the inadvertent firing of the ashes into the glaze of the equivalent of funeral urn by the narrator’s wife in her pottery studio. The insistence with which the narrative has expanded upon, without ever leaving behind, the pronouncement in which the digression is anchored, becomes lapidary, glaze-like, without concealing a single flaw or anomaly of its subject. “Brother” and “dead” become terms equally fixed, inalterable, profound and fatal. The stoneware jar glazed by, but void of the consumed ashes, is a highly-finished conundrum. The hold of kinship and fraternity upon us, the ridiculousness of the evasions of the ultimate at the centre of familial legacies are equally on display. Around them, obliquely referenced, a sobering recent episode of European history in which the demons and drives that subvert self-consistency and mutual ties were given learned as well as primal impetus to destruction. Much of the memory of the mid-century events it mimicked had actually faded and fed North Atlantic by-standing. The fraying of ties to create personal or national independence, did little to replace brutal pursuit of self-interest and self-display with concerted reform and affirmation, or to install common over self-interests and the will to power. Centrifugal forces, without centripetal order, strong impulses without equally enduring ties. The narrator depicts attachments frayed in an anomic, technically and intellectually accomplished multi-cultural New City on the edge of the conflagration-to-come. The fictive funeral vessel produced by the rapid succession of biographical non-sequiturs and the sustaining pressure of the narrator’s pre-occupation with its digressive reiteration, suggest what can and can’t be made of the loss of the nucleus of common life in a troubled time. The flow of loss may ultimately evade the discursive, preoccupation. Perhaps the digressive impulse makes only a memorial object that grows in compactness and finish without edification, hard, Zen-like in its reserve and imperviousness to interrogation or forgetting. Loss can be hermetically sealed, opaque, pregnant yet inarticulate with the suppressed force for order and distortion. The funeral vessel seems at once frozen, furiously self-constrained, stranded far from the borders of its origins, yet saturated with the effigy of the heart and humanity it conceals. Our narrator seems to both engage and articulate a place outside the forces that produced the implosion of his brother’s life, and renders them as the still centre of disconcerting mayhem and loss. He also may complete the narrative miracle of re-entering the madness without imposing on it a false order, or using the material as a self-elevating settling of scores. There is a sense that “enough” is made of the long monologue. An end that will simply abide has been crafted; a thing of permanence memorializes a life and its brush with the forces that made of all bright things detritus.

I recently sent e-mail to my son after a silence and separation of some duration, motivated by my unremarkable recognition that my love for this thirty-something as child and adult, busy lives on opposite sides of the ocean notwithstanding, endures. The expression took two odd forms: a rant against the sources of the torrid crop-destroying weather of the Western Balkans and a nostalgic revisiting of our affection for American baseball, a small ember of regard for our shared home team fanned by ace pitcher King Felix Hernandez, who has authored a winning streak (one perfect game, four one-run victories) for the baseball ages during August. Added to my weather “update” (a three month stay untouched by rain), I ranted about the interest groups, the media empires and the carnal house capitalism that has obstructed and dithered as climate change smouldered and grew in its capacity to savage our globe as we have known and been sustained by it. My son would have to find buried in the odd preoccupations and excesses of my e-mail, evidence of a father’s desire to protect, nurture and share in references to childish things (sport) and a Jeremiad about tabloid culture and environmental Armageddon. How I love this child, and how unlikely he might know it from the medium I employed to express it. Happily he responded, recovering in the opacity of words his own need to connect and reciprocate.

What we write seems to both displace and yet become what we see, the medium of what we can know and the shape we can impart to it. It shapes whether and how we connect, sometimes in ways that serve and sometimes subvert what we intended. Never transparent, never neutral, but much more complicated than the truism that saying more or less makes it so. This space where our acts of writing make of our worlds what they will, is to a great extent at odds with the interaction between writing and memory that organizes Victims of Bierdemeier, Tackling Foul and The Farewell Gift and a vein of Serbian post-modern writing that makes visible a floating world of unexamined and unarticulated loss. These works are contributions to an at once fictive, yet encyclopaedic examination of the still-born lives of survivors and their lasting contribution to opportunities and burdens of life in Serbia during our time.

A dear relation recently mentioned for the first time the context of her divorce during the troubles that accompanied the end of Yugoslavia, the epical rhetoric and incendiary agents that promised momentous goods to be mined and historic evils to be rectified amid atrocity and destruction. All would hope the precipitous change and the grandiose narratives of mission and redressed historical wrongs would produce change for the better, and many incongruities and much degrading of personal and public conduct seemed understandable, a feature of the turbulence of transition. Only in retrospect, has she come to see that the hope widely invested in a change she had not wished for was used to install the abuses of transition as “new normal” one that has proven repressive, dysfunctional, yet formidably resilient. Two post-conflict decades of impasse, ubiquitous corruption and missed opportunity, carry the weight of belated and unacknowledged grief and dis-figuration. The past epoch, which harboured the common life whether in hamlets, cities or towns, whether destroyed by design, intervention or the collateral damage inflicted by both, have consigned no small numbers among the living and the lost to limbo. The young have inherited a sense of place truncated and embattled, a landscape where heritage edifices mushroom among shuttered factories to mark the new borders.

History moves on, but the missing loom above and around, inhabiting the ruins of a half-century of accomplishment effaced. Cultural, political and personal wrong-turns go un-examined as well. This drama has been so contested by force and obscured by ersatz traditionalism as to assure it will make likely be obscured indefinitely in public forums and official culture. Waves of democratic revolution in the face of dictatorship and repression, localized resistance to the ideologies of partition are consigned to forgotten micro-histories of the 90’s troubles and the post-conflict present. These three works – and I would argue much of the Serbian Prose in Translation catalogue – take up and engage significant omissions in official history and public discourse – among them the home-grown democracy of the prosaic, the local and the pastoral interrupted by conflict, and death under uncompromising centralization and endless transition to nowhere. As a species we have relied according to Aleksander Hemon in the wrenching account of the death of his daughter Isabel, on narrative when destruction threatens obliteration and extinction, “We processed the world by telling stories, produced human knowledge through our engagement of imagined selves.” I would insist only on the addition of “remembered” selves, selves memorialized in writing and telling. It is not hard to imagine readers upon engaging the imagined selves of these three novels will be provoked to archive the remnants of their own uprooted selves, relations and offspring. It won’t be easy – I know, but it is equally hard to imagine that it wouldn’t be a restorative and humanizing experience of great value.

75,75,Drought Sri Lanka,New U.S.-Mexico agreement promises to restore water to Colorado River delta - Public Radio International PRI,https://www.pri.org/stories/2012-11-27/new-us-mexico-agreement-promises-restore-water-colorado-river-delta,"The Colorado River is just a dry mud bed where it once met the Gulf of California, in Mexico. (Photo by Peter McBride.)

The Colorado River runs 1,450 miles. It starts in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, then winds its way through Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California.

It crosses the border into Mexico and ends at the Sea of Cortez. Or more accurately, that’s where the riverbed ends.

The water stops flowing about 75 miles shy of its natural conclusion.

As urban areas and agricultural demands have increased up river, both in the United States and Mexico, the area down river, a vast expanse called the Colorado River Delta, has paid the price.

“The delta at one time was enormous. If it were in existence today I would speculate that it would be one of the eight wonders of the world, it was that massive and impressive a place,” said Patrick Graham with The Nature Conservancy in Arizona. “Today, it’s basically a dried mudflat.”

It’s been like this for nearly a half century, since the Glen Canyon Dam began holding back water in Arizona in 1960. Since then, only the wettest years have allowed some water to reach all the way to the delta.

Under a new agreement reached last week, the United States will get more water during times of drought. And in times of plenty, Mexico will be able to store excess water north of the border. But the Colorado River Delta also stands to benefit.

That’s welcome news to people like Francisco Zamora, who directs the Sonoran Institute’s Colorado River Delta program. He said when his group planted trees last year on 50 acres in the delta and provided a tiny amount of water for irrigation, the trees quickly bloomed.

“It’s really amazing how fast they grow and how quickly they produce habitat. We’ve seen many species of birds using the habitat, and other wildlife,"" he said. ""Mammals and the bobcat, and there are a few beavers we’ve seen along the river.""

Al from a tiny amount of water. Under the agreement reached this week, more than a thousand times as much water will be added to the delta, over a five-year period.

This water will come from Mexico’s share of the river. Or more specifically, from Mexican farmers who are willing to sell back some water on the open market. Overall, the plan calls for Mexican farmers to give back about three percent of their water allocation.

This loss should be offset by planned improvements to irrigation canals in Mexico.

There’s another source of water that’ll be coming to the Delta. Under the five-year agreement, there will also be a special, one-time only burst of water sent down river. This water is being collected and stored north of the border. And when it is released, all at once, it will mimic a natural springtime flow from a wet year.

Zamora says it’s not hard to predict what will happen.

“It will create a functional ecosystem that will benefit the species. And that’s what we learned, the delta is very resilient,"" he explained. ""You add water and the habitat comes back, the birds come back, the wildlife comes back. And that’s why the delta is a good example of hope.”

Zamora talks optimistically about the regeneration of endangered birds and fish in both Mexico and the southwestern United States. He also talks about the resurgence of commercial fish and recreational opportunities in the Delta.

“The way I describe it is we are kind of reconnecting the people with the river,"" he said.

And while this is undoubtedly good news for the conservation movement in Mexico and the southwestern United States, the amounts of water being restored to the Delta will be far smaller than what would’ve happened naturally 150 years ago.

The magnificent delta of old will likely never be restored, as least as long as people are around.

Graham said the new agreement is just a first step.

“But it’s a good first step, because for the first time the environment has been factored into these water management decisions at this scale,"" he said. ""And it’s not only important ecologically, but I think symbolically to provide the opportunity to restore the river, the delta.”

The new agreement could begin delivering additional water to the delta as early next spring.","Tue, 27 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/open_graph/public/migration/PriMigrationsVivvoFilesImagesMigration/pri.org/files/Colorado_River_at_its_delta_Credit_Peter_McBride_641758981.jpeg?itok=amSbk0bL,"['river', 'times', 'colorado', 'delta', 'water', 'mexico', 'usmexico', 'states', 'way', 'promises', 'restore', 'united', 'agreement']", ,none
76,76,Drought Sri Lanka,5 Ways China Could Become a Democracy – The Diplomat - the Diplomat,https://thediplomat.com/2013/02/5-ways-china-could-become-a-democracy/,"Advertisement

Speculating about China’s possible political futures is an intellectual activity that intrigues some and puzzles many. The conventional wisdom is that the entrenched Chinese Communist Party (CCP), so determined to defend and perpetuate its political monopoly, has the means to survive for an extended period (though not forever). A minority view, however, holds that the CCP’s days are numbered. In fact, a transition to democracy in China in the next 10 to 15 years is a high probability event. What stands behind this optimistic view about China’s democratic future is accumulated international and historical experience in democratic transitions (roughly 80 countries have made the transition from authoritarian rule to varying forms and degrees of democracy in the past 40 years) and decades of social science research that has yielded important insights into the dynamics of democratic transition and authoritarian decay (the two closely linked processes).

To be sure, those believing that China’s one-party regime still has enough resilience to endure decades of rule can point to the CCP’s proven and enormous capacity for repression (the most critical factor in the survival of autocracies), its ability to adapt to socioeconomic changes (although the degree of its adaptability is a subject of scholarly contention), and its track record of delivering economic improvement as a source of legitimacy.

To this list of reasons why the Chinese people should resign themselves to decades of one-party rule will be a set of factors singled out by proponents of the theory of predictable regime change in China. Among many of the causes of the decline and collapse of authoritarian rule, two stand out.

First, there is the logic of authoritarian decay. One-party regimes, however sophisticated, suffer from organizational ageing and decay. Leaders get progressively weaker (in terms of capabilities and ideological commitment); such regimes tend to attract careerists and opportunists who view their role in the regime from the perspective of an investor: they want to maximize their returns from their contribution to the regime’s maintenance and survival. The result is escalating corruption, deteriorating governance, and growing alienation of the masses. Empirically, the organizational decay of one-party regime can be measured by the limited longevity of such regimes. To date, the record longevity of a one-party regime is 74 years (held by the former Communist Party of the Soviet Union). One-party regimes in Mexico and Taiwan remained in power for 71 and 73 years respectively (although in the case of Taiwan, the accounting is complicated by the Kuomintang’s military defeat on the mainland). Moreover, all of the three longest-ruling one-party regimes began to experience system-threatening crisis roughly a decade before they exited political power. If the same historical experience should be repeated in China, where the Communist Party has ruled for 63 years, we may reasonably speculate that the probability of a regime transition is both real and high in the coming 10-15 years, when the CCP will reach the upper-limit of the longevity of one-party regimes.

Second, the effects of socioeconomic change –rising literacy, income, and urbanization rates, along with the improvement of communications technologies — greatly reduce the costs of collective action, de-legitimize autocratic rule, and foster demands for greater democracy. As a result, authoritarian regimes, which have a relatively easy time ruling poor and agrarian societies, find it increasingly difficult and ultimately impossible to maintain their rule once socioeconomic development reaches a certain level. Statistical analysis shows that authoritarian regimes become progressively more unstable (and democratic transitions more likely) once income rises above $1,000 (PPP) per capita. When per capita income goes above $4,000 (PPP), the likelihood of democratic transitions increases more dramatically. Few authoritarian regimes, unless they rule in oil-producing countries, can survive once per capita income hits more than $6,000 (PPP). If we apply this observation and take into account the probable effect of inflation (although the above PPP figures were calculated in constant terms), we will find that China is well into this “zone of democratic transition” because its per capita income is around $9,100 (PPP) today, comparable to the income level of South Korea and Taiwan in the mid-1980s on the eve of their democratic transitions. In another 10-15 years, its per capita income could exceed $15,000 and its urbanization rate will have risen to 60-65 percent. If the CCP has such a tough time today (in terms of deploying its manpower and financial resources) to maintain its rule, just imagine how impossible the task will become in 10-15 years’ time.

If this analysis is convincing enough for us to entertain the strong possibility of a democratic transition in China in the coming 10-15 years, the more interesting follow-up question is definitely “how will such a transition happen?”

Again, based on the rich experience of democratic transitions since the 1970s, there are five ways China could become democratic:

“Happy ending” would be the most preferable mode of democratic transition for China. Typically, a peaceful exit from power managed by the ruling elites of the old regime goes through several stages. It starts with the emergence of a legitimacy crisis, which may be caused by many factors (such as poor economic performance, military defeat, rising popular resistance, unbearable costs of repression, and endemic corruption). Recognition of such a crisis convinces some leaders of the regime that the days of authoritarian rule are numbered and they should start managing a graceful withdrawal from power. If such leaders gain political dominance inside the regime, they start a process of liberalization by freeing the media and loosening control over civil society. Then they negotiate with opposition leaders to set the rules of the post-transition political system. Most critically, such negotiations center on the protection of the ruling elites of the old regime who have committed human rights abuses and the preservation of the privileges of the state institutions that have supported the old regime (such as the military and the secret police). Once such negotiations are concluded, elections are held. In most cases (Taiwan and Spain being the exceptions), parties representing the old regime lose such elections, thus ushering in a new democratic era. At the moment, the transition in Burma is unfolding according to this script.

But for China, the probability of such a happy ending hinges on, among other things, whether the ruling elites start reform before the old regime suffers irreparable loss of legitimacy. The historical record of peaceful transition from post-totalitarian regimes is abysmal mainly because such regimes resist reform until it is too late. Successful cases of “happy ending” transitions, such as those in Taiwan, Mexico, and Brazil, took place because the old regime still maintained sufficient political strength and some degree of support from key social groups. So the sooner the ruling elites start this process, the greater their chances of success. The paradox, however, is that regimes that are strong enough are unwilling to reform and regimes that are weak cannot reform. In the Chinese case, the odds of a soft landing are likely to be determined by what China’s new leadership does in the coming five years because the window of opportunity for a political soft landing will not remain open forever.

“Gorby comes to China” is a variation of the “happy ending” scenario with a nasty twist. In such a scenario, China’s leadership misses the historic opportunity to start the reform now. But in the coming decade, a convergence of unfavorable economic, social, and political trends (such as falling economic growth due to demographic ageing, environmental decay, crony-capitalism, inequality, corruption and rising social unrest) finally forces the regime to face reality. Hardliners are discredited and replaced by reformers who, like Gorbachev, start a Chinese version of glasnost and perestroika. But the regime by that time has lost total credibility and political support from key social groups. Liberalization triggers mass political mobilization and radicalism. Members of the old regime start to defect – either to the opposition or their safe havens in Southern California or Switzerland. Amid political chaos, the regime suffers another internal split, similar to that between Boris Yeltsin and Gorbachev, with the rise of a radical democratizer replacing a moderate reformer. With their enormous popular support, the dominant political opposition, including many defectors from the old regime, refuses to offer concessions to the Communist Party since it is now literally in no position to negotiate. The party’s rule collapses, either as a result of elections that boot its loyalists out of power or spontaneous seizure of power by the opposition.

Should such a scenario occur in China, it would be the most ironic. For the last twenty years, the Communist Party has tried everything to avert a Soviet-style collapse. If the “Gorby scenario” is the one that brings democracy to China, it means the party has obviously learned the wrong lesson from the Soviet collapse.

“Tiananmen redux” is a third possibility. Such a scenario can unfold when the party continues to resist reform even amid signs of political radicalization and polarization in society. The same factors that contribute to the “Gorby scenario” will be at play here, except that the trigger of the collapse is not a belated move toward liberalization by reformers inside the regime, but by an unanticipated mass revolt that mobilizes a wide range of social groups nationwide, as happened during Tiananmen in 1989. The manifestations of such a political revolution will be identical with those seen in the heady days of the pro-democracy Tiananmen protest and the “Jasmine Revolution” in the Middle East. In the Chinese case, “Tiananmen redux” produces a different political outcome mainly because the China military refuses to intervene again to save the party (in most cases of crisis-induced transitions since the 1970s, the military abandoned the autocratic rulers at the most critical moment).

“Financial meltdown” – our fourth scenario – can initiate a democratic transition in China in the same way the East Asian financial crisis in 1997-98 led to the collapse of Suharto in Indonesia. The Chinese bank-based financial system shares many characteristics with the Suharto-era Indonesian banking system: politicization, cronyism, corruption, poor regulation, and weak risk management. It is a well-known fact today that the Chinese financial system has accumulated huge non-performing loans and may be technically insolvent if these loans are recognized. In addition, off-balance sheet activities through the shadow-banking system have mushroomed in recent years, adding more risks to financial stability. As China’s capacity to maintain capital control erodes because of the proliferation of methods to move money in and out of China, the probability of a financial meltdown increases further. To make matters worse, premature capital account liberalization by China could facilitate capital flight in times of a systemic financial crisis. Should China’s financial sector suffer a meltdown, the economy would grind to a halt and social unrest could become uncontrollable. If the security forces fail to restore order and the military refuse to bail out the party, the party could lose power amid chaos. The probability of a collapse induced by a financial meltdown alone is relatively low. But even if the party should survive the immediate aftermath of a financial meltdown, the economic toll exacted on China will most likely damage its economic performance to such an extent as to generate knock-on effects that eventually delegitimize the party’s authority.

“Environmental collapse” is our last regime change scenario. Given the salience of environmental decay in China these days, the probability of a regime change induced by environmental collapse is not trivial. The feed-back loop linking environmental collapse to regime change is complicated but not impossible to conceive. Obviously, the economic costs of environmental collapse will be substantial, in terms of healthcare, lost productivity, water shortage, and physical damages.Growth could stall, undermining the CCP’s legitimacy and control. Environmental collapse in China has already started to alienate the urban middle-class from the regime and triggered growing social protest. Environmental activism can become a political force linking different social groups together in a common cause against a one-party regime seen as insensitive, unresponsive, and incompetent on environmental issues. The severe degradation of the environment in China also means that the probability of a catastrophic environmental disaster – a massive toxic spill, record drought, or extended period of poisonous smog– could trigger a mass protest incident that opens the door for the rapid political mobilization of the opposition.

The take-away from this intellectual exercise should be sobering, both for the CCP and the international community. To date, few have seriously thought about the probability and the various plausible scenarios of a regime transition in China. As we go through the likely causes and scenarios of such a transition, it should become blindingly clear that we need to start thinking about both the unthinkable and the inevitable.","Wed, 13 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://thediplomat.com/ads/magazine/cover/td-mag-s-1/issue_79_cover.jpg,"['democracy', 'political', 'regime', 'democratic', 'collapse', 'party', 'rule', 'transition', 'financial', 'regimes', 'china', 'ways']", ,none

The funds will provide relief for horses impacted by the high cost and low supply of hay in these drought-stricken states.

Soaring temperatures, widespread drought, wildfires, and export to Asian markets have depleted the supply of hay, creating a desperate need among equine caretakers. The cost of hay has been driven upward at an alarming rate, as the supply and quality of hay dwindles, with bales of hay costing up to $25 in some regions.

As shale gas fever sweeps through Beijing, analysts are looking at the costs and benefits of extracting what is increasingly a controversial source of energy. But for China, with its growing middle class, the immediate and long-term demand for energy has the potential to spark a revolution in shale gas before sufficient and safe technological know-how and regulations are developed.

A very vocal debate continues to rage in the U.S. and Europe as to the environmental consequences of shale gas extraction. Meanwhile, China’s National Oil Companies (NOCs) continue to purchase and buy into North American oil and gas companies with specific expertise in shale gas extraction. For better or worse, China’s shale gas revolution looks set to be thrust into the public spotlight, both at home and abroad.

Extracting shale gas is tricky. Shale, a sedimentary rock that is typically highly porous and has low permeability, traps hydrocarbons as it is formed. To remove the gas, shale formations must be stimulated, most commonly using hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.” The technique involves pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into the shale formation, cracking the rock and allowing the gas to be released to the surface. The 1 to 3 million gallons of water that are pumped into the shale formation must then either be recycled or pumped into water disposal wells in subsurface rock formations.

In addition to these skill-intensive practices, the extraction process also demands three-dimensional seismic surveying, which evaluates potential subsurface resources, and horizontal drilling technology. Both demand expertise and experience, yet the capability of most companies outside of North America, including China’s National Oil Companies (NOCs), to safely and effectively perform such high-tech extraction is limited.

The emergence of shale gas is a game changer. Countries that have traditionally relied on hydrocarbon exports for political clout (the Persian Gulf, Russia, Venezuela) will inevitably lose some of their petro power. Europe could become less energy dependent on Russian supply by importing liquid natural gas (LNG) from North America and by exploiting the potentially significant shale gas deposits in Poland and other countries. Australia, which has significant deposits and much of the pre-existing infrastructure to begin extraction, could see its clout in the energy politics of the region increase– forcing a significant redraft of Canberra’s “Australia in the Asian Century” White Paper.

In effect, the “shale revolution” signals the end of the peak oil debate. New technology means new resources, which in turn could mean a new geopolitical map. However the mere presence of the resources doesn’t mean that their extraction in the short-term is viable, a problem China knows all too well.

China’s oil fields are drying up. The International Energy Agency’s (IAE) World Energy Outlook for 2010 predicts China will import 79% of its oil by 2030, a figure that demonstrates the pressing need for China to develop new energy sources. Enter shale gas and the “unconventionals.”

Estimates of China’s shale gas resources differ. China’s Ministry of Land and Resources estimates reserves of 886 trillion cubic feet (tcf), while the U.S. Energy Information Administration puts the country’s resources at 1,275 tcf. The upper estimates would mean China sits atop more shale gas than the U.S. and Canada combined. According to China’s 12th Five-Year Plan, by 2015 China should be extracting 6.5 billion cubic meters of shale gas per year, with a view of producing 100 billion cubic meters by 2020. China’s goal is to meet 10 percent of the country’s energy demands from shale gas the same year. To successfully meet the goal, China’s oil and gas industry needs to bridge its large knowledge deficit. Despite some progress, recent successes in domestic extraction technology have been modest.

Under the Shale Gas Development Plan for 2011-2015, shale gas has been labeled by the Ministry of Land and Resources as a separate mineral from conventional hydrocarbons. This move frees shale resources from the clutches of “the big three;” Chinese state-owned majors – China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) – allowing Beijing to redistribute exploration contracts. Importantly, the move encourages competition among state-owned majors, local enterprises and foreign companies.

China’s NOCs, while not state-run, benefit from state financing. Their capital flows during the global downturn in 2008 gave them the flexibility to expand globally. For China’s NOCs, establishing partnerships with other international oil companies allows them to diversify risks and gain technical know-how through the supply chain.

At home and abroad China is making waves. The opening of a recent tender to foreign companies demonstrates the extent to which the often go-it-alone Chinese Communist Party feels it needs to secure a rapid and successful energy boom. Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and British Petroleum are all jointly surveying the key provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou with local companies. As part of the new tender, other joint ventures are expected to follow.

Flush with state financing, China’s NOCs have in recent years begun buying up stakes in North American energy companies and their subsidiaries. Some of their recent buy-ins have been the purchase of Nexen and a stake in Devon Energy Corp, one of the founders of shale gas extraction. Such purchases allow China’s NOCs to absorb expertise. While this in itself isn’t enough to meet their energy needs, it is a step toward building capacity for China’s NOCs in shale gas exploration and extraction.

China’s NOCs have been known to employ a “market-for-resources strategy,” whereby access to China’s market is granted to a resource holder in exchange for imports of resources from that country. This now looks to be morphing into a “market-for-know-how strategy.” In the early stages of coal bed methane exploration in China, foreign groups contributed 70 percent of the funding. With already significant foreign involvement, the shale gas industry looks set to emulate this model.

However, the all-important extraction process of shale gas, hydraulic fracturing, just as its name suggests, needs water – and large amounts of it. So while shale could provide energy, it will require large volumes of water that will be costly both to consume and to recycle. Water scarcity remains a key concern for the Chinese government, while water pollution is an increasing worry for the Chinese public. One recent report noted that already “up to 40 percent of China’s rivers were seriously polluted” and “20 percent were so polluted their water quality was rated too toxic even to come into contact with.”

Experts warn that China will face growing water shortages in coming years. Water-intensive industries such as mining are competing for increasingly scarce water sources. Low rainfall in the northwest of the country, where much of the shale is believed to be, means these areas will have to rely on limited and finite groundwater. In the face of these shortages, China established a special 25 million USD fund for a cloud seeding program in 2012 to operate in “areas prone to drought and haze.” Water can be transported into China’s northwest via pipeline but that would be costly and require significant new infrastructure, such as desalination plants and pipelines that would likely need to stretch across the country for thousands of kilometers – a similar feat to the 4,200 km Xijiang to Shanghai gas pipeline.

Shale gas has approximately half the carbon content of coal. For China, the replacement of coal for gas in power generation could reduce emissions and pollution. It would kill two birds with one big stone, as criticism grows over the country’s pollution levels both in air and water. However, some warn that shale gas may also reduce investment in renewable energy sources.

In the U.S., environmental concerns dominate the debate. Public concern over water contamination and the release of harmful gases during shale gas extraction are gaining increasing media attention. This has been exacerbated by claims that research commissioned by industry-friendly lobby groups in the U.S., such as the American Petroleum Institute and the American Natural Gas Alliance, have muddied the water on the environmental impact of shale gas extraction. However, according to an IAE report, Golden Rules for a Golden Age of Gas, the environmental risks inherent in the process can be easily mitigated. The report outlines the “golden rules” required to address the environmental and social impact of developments in unconventional gas. It predicts that major risks can be decreased and safety improved if the cost of drilling and completing of a shale gas well is increased by 7 percent.

A dozen or more chemicals may be added to the water and sand pumped into a shale-gas well, including radioactive tracers that help assess the formation and relevant fractures. While these tracers are strictly monitored under guidelines handed down by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the U.S., in China the regulations may be less stringent. In addition, other radioactive material may be dislodged in the fracking process and may have to be disposed of from flowback water.

If strict regulations are not in place to seal the well from leaching, aquifers and ground water may become contaminated by run-off chemicals, methane or radioactive minerals displaced in the process. A 2011 US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report suggests that fracking may have resulted in the contamination of ground water.

Recent and successful protests in China to stop the construction of a chemical plant in Ningbo demonstrate growing public concern about some government-backed developments. The October 2012 protests followed other victories to stop the construction of petrochemical plants in Xiamen and Dalian. In Dalian, some 10,000 protesters took to the streets. With a growing middle-class, increasing internet and social media access, and more public involvement and activism in key local concerns, the government and local authorities will likely have to be accommodating of public displeasure in order to maintain stability as China grows. A Tiananmen-style alternative appears unlikely as it could backfire, both at home and abroad.

If the current hype proves correct and gas prices remain strong, China’s shale gas could be just the energy boom that Beijing seeks. It could allow China to meet its ambitious growth targets. As many commentators have suggested, however, shale gas may prove less of a blessing and more of a “resource curse,” spelling environmental disaster and nationwide instability. Either way, as Sino-American partnerships are forged and shale gas extraction in China ventures into unchartered waters, one thing is certain: The world will be watching.

NEW YORK -- Sixth Man of the Year J.R. Smith has informed the New York Knicks that he will decline the option in his contract for next season and become a free agent.

A team spokesman also says Tuesday the Knicks extended a qualifying offer to forward Chris Copeland, making him a restricted free agent and allowing them to match any offer he receives.

Smith's decision was not a surprise given that he can make much more than the $2.9 million he was scheduled to earn next season.

The New Jersey product is happy in New York and is a longtime teammate of Carmelo Anthony so he would likely want to stay with the right offer.

Smith averaged 18.1 points in 80 regular-season games but his horrendous 29 percent shooting and poor decisions over the final eight postseason games could scare off potential suitors.","Wed, 26 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20130626/f04da2da78cd1334a1aa17.jpg,"['offer', 'nba', 'games', 'man', 'knicks', 'free', 'agent', 'beome', 'jr', 'sixth', 'smith', 'york']", ,none
81,81,Drought Sri Lanka,When the storks came visiting - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/when-the-storks-came-visiting/article4062089.ece,"Asian Openbill Storks have found a safe haven in Bihar’s Danapur, though their numbers continue to dwindle in other parts of South Asia

Danapur in Bihar may be crowded, congested and polluted, but it remains the favourite nesting and breeding ground of the Asian Openbill Stork — thousands of which travel to this safe and secure site on the wetlands of the Ganges, making it the largest heronry in South Asia.

The site, which falls under the Danapur Cantonment, has provided a safe environment to this bird species at a time when it has recorded a drastic fall in numbers in the sub-continent.

According to a report of the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC), conducted by Wetlands International that conducts annual surveys on migratory birds throughout Asia, the number of Asian Openbill Storks in South Asia had fallen from 59,897 in 2002 to 16,771 in 2004. And by 2006-07, India had the largest number of these birds at 13,036.

In contrast, the number of these birds rose significantly in South East Asia during the period, thereby indicating that the birds preferred safer pastures in the east over the highly populated South Asia.

In South East Asia, their numbers registered an exponential growth from 3,395 to 55,336 between 2002 and 2004. And in 2006-07, Thailand alone recorded 244,015 of these birds.

“The reasons for the decline in numbers in South Asia and the rise in Openbill Stork population South East Asia could be many, including poaching and hunting. The work on compilation of data for the last five years is currently on,’’ said ecologist and conservationist T.K. Roy.

But the encouraging part, Mr. Roy said, is that in Danapur Cantonment, the birds continue to find a safe place to live in.

“Just about 300 metres from the Ganga and about 200 metres from a residential area is the breeding and nesting ground of these birds.” Mr. Roy conducted a census of the birds in June, when they come to the area, and then recently in the last week of October.

“These birds stay close together for security reasons. There are just 58 low-rise trees on which they perch and where they nest. For ages, this has been their annual nesting and breeding place. And now the Army has launched efforts to ensure that there is no hunting or poaching of these birds.”

As against the arrival of about 4,000 storks every year, this year only about 3,000 birds arrived in Danapur. However, their numbers have more than doubled since with them giving birth and now there is a total of about 9,000 storks in the heronry.

The Asian Openbill Stork ( Anastomus scitans) is one major species among the 11 stork species in Asia and apart from India it is found in small numbers in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in South Asia.

The storks migrate to north India in June and to the southern part of the country in November every year.","Sun, 04 Nov 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12473510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04PERISCOPESTORK,"['safe', 'east', 'asian', 'asia', 'stork', 'visiting', 'south', 'numbers', 'birds', 'storks', 'came', 'openbill']", ,none
82,82,Drought Sri Lanka,Piaggio to challenge Bajaj in city 3-Wheelers - Business Standard,https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/piaggio-to-challenge-bajaj-in-city-3-wheelers-113031200446_1.html,"Piaggio Vehicles, the Pune-based scooter and light commercial vehicle manufacturer, is entering the city three wheeler market with its new product Ape City, to challenge market leader Bajaj Auto.

The subsidiary of Italian Piaggio & C s.p.a has launched the new class of city-centric passenger three wheelers under the Ape City brand. The company is aiming to upset Bajaj Auto's dominance in the three wheeler segment.

The city three-wheeler market, whose sales are dictated by state governments based on the number of permits issued for most centers, is about 150,000 units per year. Piaggio is aiming to have 15-20% market share in this segment by end of this calendar year.

The Ape City costs Rs 1.10 lakh for petrol, Rs 1.23 lakh for LPG and Rs 1.25 lakh for CNG (ex-Maharashtra). Piaggio presently has a market share of 31% in the passenger three wheeler space while Bajaj Auto leads with a share of 50%.

Other players in the passenger segment includes Mahindra & Mahindra, Atul Auto, TVS Motors and Scooters India. The segment has grown by 9% to 370,868 units during the period April-January this year as against 340,032 units sold same period last year.

Ravi Chopra, chairman and managing director, Piaggio Vehicle said, ""We were not present in the market segment which required alternate fuels like petrol, CNG and LPG. So we developed a compact fuel-efficient three wheeler for urban passenger movement."" Many city regulations require three wheelers to be powered by cleaner fuels like CNG or LPG.

The three-wheelers will be built at the company's manufacturing plant in Baramati, Maharashtra which has an installed capacity of over 250,000 for three-wheelers.

Bajaj Auto sales in this segment rose to 186,420 units, a growth of 15% in the reported period as against 162,062 units sold in the same segment last year. While Piaggio reported a growth of four% at 110,943 units.

The total three wheeler sales (goods and passenger) in the April-January period stood at 450,645 units, an increase of five% as compared to 428,764 units sold in the same period last year.

Bajaj remains the market leader in the total domestic three-wheeler segment with a share of 42% followed by Piaggio with a share of 34%. Mumbai-based M&M remains the third biggest player in the segment with a share of 12%.

Piaggio is also targeting the export market with this new product with at least 50,000 units in the next 18-20 months. The export segment is about 300,000 units per year presently with the company hoping to begin shipments to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Africa and Latin America in the next few months.","Tue, 12 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2013-03/12/full/1363092953-0237.jpg,"['sold', 'city', 'share', 'segment', 'wheeler', 'period', 'market', 'bajaj', '3wheelers', 'challenge', 'passenger', 'units', 'piaggio']", ,none
83,83,Drought Sri Lanka,No way out - Sydney Morning Herald,https://www.smh.com.au/world/no-way-out-20130211-2e796.html,"Fateful night … traffic surveillance footage of Andrei Monov’s group chasing two Gypsies in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, in late 2007. Fast-forward the traffic recording. There are flashing lights, and a crush of people follow as police lead Palfreeman to a police van. Young men surround the vehicle: Palfreeman says they were pounding on it. The driver struggles to drive away. Minutes later an ambulance arrives. A tall young man lies on a stretcher, his right leg and arm dangling over it as the paramedics lift it into the ambulance. It is Andrei Monov. He is bleeding from a single stab wound to the side of his chest. By the time the ambulance gets to the hospital, Monov is dead. His blood-alcohol reading is estimated to be almost six times the legal limit for Australian motorists. Another young man sits on the curb with a flesh wound to his side. Monov was the only child of well-connected parents. His mother is a notary, while his father, a psychologist who works for the government, is the go-to person for journalists seeking commentary on youth violence. Among the politicians at his funeral was Chavdar Georgiev, a former legal advisor to the Bulgarian president, and Mihael Mikov, who would soon be the country's interior minister. Also present was the head of Bulgaria's highest court of appeal. No winners here … Hristo Monov. Credit:Dobrin Kashavelov From the start, Jock Palfreeman said he had run to the assistance of a Gypsy who was being attacked by a group of football fans. He also said he only pulled out the knife when the aggressive youths turned on him, hoping that the sight of it would scare them away. He cannot remember stabbing anyone.

According to his dad, pathologist Simon Palfreeman, Jock has always been impetuous and would rush to help others with little thought about the possible consequences. But to Andrei's father, Hristo Monov, Jock is a sociopath who will kill again if released. In defence … Palfreeman’s father, Simon (at left) with lawyer Dinko Kanchev. Jock Palfreeman is the eldest of three boys. Spencer is studying finance and accountancy, while Angus has just started university. Their mother, Mary Jane, is a dentist who for some time was also a councillor on Sydney's Mosman Council, where she was an outspoken advocate for her constituents' rights. Father Simon is very different; quiet and obedient, he was voted by his primary school class as the student most likely to be Pope because he earned so many points for good behaviour. For him, a fun night while at medical school was to listen to Mahler at home. Simon accepts that he was, and probably still is, a nerd. Palfreeman's parents separated in his last years of primary school, and when he was in year 9 he moved in with Simon and his new wife, Helen. Although bright, he never starred academically. Sitting still in class didn't suit him; he was happier outside rowing and playing rugby. But a passionate involvement in social-justice causes made him stand out at Sydney's St Ignatius' College, Riverview. He helped establish the Riverview Student Peace and Unity Congress and joined protests against the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Behind the wire … Palfreeman says he’s been jailed for a crime he didn’t commit. Credit:Dobrin Kashavelov

In a character reference for the Bulgarian court, Palfreeman's former house master described him as ""a young man with a friendly, open personality and a positive outlook on life ... socially aware and prepared to speak out for what he felt was right. He willingly and unselfishly would go out of his way to help others and to involve and include those who may feel isolated or marginalised."" Palfreeman headed off to Europe at 19, unsure of what he wanted to do in life. After arriving in Bulgaria in May 2006, he met Grayham Saunders, an English carpenter 10 years older than him, who was renovating a dilapidated house near the town of Samokov, 55 kilometres outside the capital. Palfreeman ended up staying in Samokov for five months, making close friends with locals his age and their families, buying a motorbike and travelling across the country in between working on the potato harvest and Saunders' house. He fell in love with a young Bulgarian woman - and the country. Yet he saw many incidents of violence in Bulgaria, including an attack on a Gypsy named Simo, who credits the Australian's intervention with saving his life. Palfreeman himself was assaulted several times. So he started carrying pepper spray when he went anywhere he thought was dodgy. Wrong spot at the wrong time … Andrei Monov. In early August 2007, there was an outbreak of attacks and counter-attacks in Sofia between young Gypsies and Bulgarian skinheads. Then, one oppressively hot night late that month, a 17-year-old Gypsy, Asparuh Asenov, was killed in Samokov during a fight between four young Bulgarians and some Roma youths. An estimated 1000 Roma took to the streets of Samokov in protest. In an opinion piece for a Bulgarian newspaper titled ""Gypsies versus Bulgarians: Two worlds on a knife edge"", Andrei Monov's father, Hristo, argued that tragedies like this were inevitable because young ethnic Bulgarian men working hard to get ahead were understandably sick of seeing Gypsies on welfare, driving their ""stinking horse-drawn carts on the streets of a European capital"", where the ethnic Bulgarians hoped one day to drive ""nice cars"". At this stage, Palfreeman had left Bulgaria and was living in a squat near Grayham Saunders in the English city of Bristol, where he volunteered in a food co-operative and tried to keep the squat clean of drug dealers. He knew his visa would soon run out, and so, too, would his money if he did not secure paid employment. So in late November 2007, he enlisted in the British Army, which welcomes recruits from Commonwealth countries, and began basic infantry training.

Claiming innocence ... Jock Palfreeman. Palfreeman had once tried to join the Australian Defence Force. Life at sea sounded to him like a Boy's Own adventure: lots of demanding physical exercise with a group of mates. But after a mix-up with the application process, Palfreeman decided to explore Europe instead. One of the Samokov residents he had befriended, Tihomir Pashev, was a retired captain in the Bulgarian army, and he describes Palfreeman's ""scatter-gun"" approach to career planning: ""He talked about one day becoming either a union leader or a soldier. He seemed to want to do everything at once.” British military records of his aptitude test show Palfreeman could have done almost anything in the army. They also show that by the time the Christmas break came around, he had studied the theory of war, ethics, weapons safety and personal hygiene, and learnt to march. Palfreeman had learnt how to clean a rifle, but had not yet used one. He had learnt nothing about knives other than that they were banned in the barracks. Instead of spending the festive season with his aunt in Bath, at the last moment Palfreeman decided to return to Bulgaria with Saunders for the Christmas break. When he got to Samokov, he noticed the shops had either sold out or no longer stocked pepper spray, but this did not concern him as he intended to stay in the countryside, where he felt safe. Reunited with Bulgarian friends, he spent Christmas in the snow-covered Rila Mountains. Two days later, Saunders suggested they have a night out in Sofia. Palfreeman was reluctant, but agreed to go. As they were heading off, he realised he had no form of identification on him, and ran back inside the house. His army ID card was on the kitchen table. Next to it was a pocket knife that Saunders had bought in Samokov. Palfreeman said he made a split-second decision to grab it as he took the card. This was no Swiss Army knife, but a butterfly knife with a 12.3 centimetre-long blade. In Bulgaria it is not illegal to carry a knife, and they are sold cheaply in tourist shops across the country. Saunders had bought it because he didn't have a knife in the house and needed one, and because this one caught his eye - flashy, cool, and unlike anything he'd seen in England.

Simon and Helen Palfreeman were holidaying with Angus when Simon got a call to say Jock was in trouble in Bulgaria. Simon thought Jock was in the UK. With confusion about the detainee's name, there was a chance the man arrested was not Jock. Simon describes himself as cautious and conflict-averse, and as more news filtered through, his instinctive reaction was to put off booking the inevitable flight to Europe, feeling he needed to gather more information. The holiday period meant it was hard to get hold of anyone. But events were moving fast in Sofia. Unfounded claims that the victims had been stabbed in the back fuelled a frenzy of damaging publicity. Potentially critical evidence was not secured from the crime scene. Closed-circuit television recordings from outside the government building where Palfreeman was arrested disappeared. Witnesses were not interviewed, among them the Gypsies. On December 31, Hristo Monov described Palfreeman in the press as a ""professional murderer"" and a ""monster"". The judge who heard the bail application that day later told me she believed Palfreeman hated Bulgarians and was ""racist"". She had decided the Australian was ""led by this feeling of superiority"" and dangerous. Several days later, Sydney's Daily Telegraph published an allegation by two young men that Jock Palfreeman had once been involved in a knife fight in Australia. The incident had been investigated by police at the time, but no charges were laid. Indeed, Palfreeman had no criminal record. Yet the article would remain in the case file in the grandly named Sofia Palace of Justice, and would be repeatedly referenced by the prosecution, the civil claimants and the media. Even the trial judge mentioned it in an interview with me. When Simon's flight touched down in Sofia on January 6, 2008, thick snow blanketed much of the city. When he went to see Jock in the remand centre, his son made little sense, jumping from one part of the incident to another, with forays into stories about his life in Bulgaria. Jock Palfreeman was battling to reconstruct what had happened and was horrified by the fact that someone had died. Jock knew he had fallen to the ground at some point but that after that everything was a blur. He wanted Simon to connect the dots, and to believe he had done nothing wrong. But over the coming months, Simon struggled to understand what Jock was telling him and why he had taken out a knife that night. Simon wanted corroboration. He wanted evidence and he wanted clarity, all of which Jock found immensely frustrating.

Simon and Jock's mother had agreed that Simon would look after Jock while she attended to his distressed siblings. Ultimately, she would make several trips to Sofia. In the meantime, Simon found a Bulgarian lawyer to represent his son. Dinko Kanchev advised Simon to become part of the defence team, which at that stage comprised just the lawyer and Jock. Although he knew nothing about law other than what he had seen in repeats of Perry Mason, Simon took on the role, as it gave him access to Jock whenever he wanted during work hours. But the prospect of examining witnesses, experts and Jock himself filled him with dread. What if he failed his son? Throughout the court proceedings in 2009, Simon and Hristo stood metres from each other at the front of the courtroom. Both fathers were middle-class professionals in suits; both were determined to get justice for their sons. In the Bulgarian version of the inquisitorial legal system, a civil case can be heard simultaneously with the criminal trial. This meant Hristo's role went far beyond what would be acceptable in an Australian criminal trial. As a victim demanding monetary compensation, he was able to play a significant role in how the trial unfolded. This included blocking evidence that supported Jock Palfreeman's version of events. The prosecution wanted a life sentence; Andrei Monov's parents wanted life without parole. Palfreeman pleaded with his father to hire a private detective to find the men he had helped and the missing recording, and badgered him to speak to the Bulgarian press. He argued they should be taking defamation action against media outlets. Simon disagreed, worried they might be misled or misquoted, and wanted to focus on the evidence they did have. ""My father can do anything he puts his mind to,"" Jock tells me. ""He is the turtle that won the race. I am more the hare that falls asleep under the tree ... I'd like to be more assertive and say, 'Look, there's a truth, let's get it out there.' And my father would say, 'Yes, there's the truth, but we can't push it in their face because when they don't react to you, then we're going to be in a worse situation than we were before.' "" As the trial progressed, Simon felt compromised at every level. ""All my life I've believed in the system. And I think in Australia you more or less can do that. And here I am for the first time faced with a system that I don't have confidence in."" He wondered how justice could prevail, but he dared not show that to Jock, who was increasingly dispirited.

""It's very hard as a father to ... watch him hurting like that and not be able to do anything about it,"" Simon said at the time. ""Partly because I know he's relying on me so much, I feel inadequate."" Adding to Simon's worries, Jock seemed to be fixated with helping other prisoners in the various battles they faced in prison and with their cases. The arbitrary application of rules enraged him. ""Each time I come, he seems to be more disoriented in time,"" Simon says. ""He is more and more focused on day-to-day things. He acknowledges he has an institutionalised mentality."" ""My father,"" explains Jock Palfreeman, ""has a very high moral standard: he is very principled. He carries the same mentality over here, where the system has no respect for your principles, no respect for morals, no respect for its own laws."" The combination of anxiety, uncertainty about when hearings would be held, and the need to fly back and forth between two countries, meant Simon struggled to appear upbeat and positive. Family members worried that Jock did not appreciate what Simon was doing. Simon sensed that Jock was using him as a punching bag to vent his frustration. But when I ask Jock, his response is heartfelt. ""I love my father. We're a good team.” What Simon did not know was that Jock was also working to set up a prisoners' association, to help inmates understand their rights. It was a high-risk plan that involved secret discussions with prisoners he could trust. If the prison authorities found out, they could come down hard on everyone involved. By the end of the trial, Simon was convinced his son had genuinely feared for his life during the incident. As a pathologist, he also believed the forensic evidence was inconclusive.

When Hristo gave his final statement to court, he turned to Simon. ""Whatever happens, whatever [Jock's] sentence,"" he said, ""you will receive the most horrific verdict - a son a murderer!"" When Simon stood to give his summary, he turned to his son. ""Jock's motive originally was to help [the Gypsy] and then to defend himself. This was an act that I can only describe as heroic. While as a parent I would have preferred that he stayed safe and did not get into trouble, as a human being I am proud that a young man would try to help another person despite the dangerous circumstances.” After five years spent researching this case, I have discovered there is more to it than has come out in court. Soon after the trial began, the forensic doctor who performed the autopsy was arrested. It was alleged he was profiting from the improper extraction of body parts for use by a private company. On his way to give evidence at Jock Palfreeman's trial, he was arrested yet again, this time for drink-driving with a blood-alcohol reading of 0.26 in Australian units. Despite now facing two serious charges, he was allowed to give expert evidence in the trial. His evidence was critical to the prosecution case. When the defence asked for a second opinion, it was refused both at trial and at appeal. In an even more bizarre twist, police raided the prosecutor's apartment and arrested her lover, who was allegedly involved in organised crime. The prosecutor had interfered in the arrest, which raised questions about her suitability for the job. Not long after Judge Georgi Kolev found Palfreeman guilty in December 2009, Kolev was elevated, uncontested, to one of the two highest courts in Bulgaria. The move generated debate about cronyism in a legal system that has attracted considerable criticism from the European Union and non-government organisations such as Transparency International. Then one of the young men who had been with Andrei Monov when he died was arrested in relation to an attack on a group of students protesting against conditions in a detention facility for foreigners.

To top it off, during the appeal in 2011, a Sydney barrister rang the Bulgarian Embassy in Canberra, alleging Jock Palfreeman had brutally attacked him in 2006. Immigration records show that Palfreeman was not in Australia at the time. The barrister was mistaken, but his allegation sat in the file before the judges, along with the one that had been published in The Daily Telegraph. Eventually, I was given access to the traffic surveillance camera recording. The footage was chilling to watch. The figures are hazy; the moment when Andrei Monov is stabbed is blurred. But moments before that, some movements are clear: Palfreeman is hit in the head, falls to the ground, gets up and tries to escape from the large group of youths that quickly surrounds him. He has always said he does not remember what happened after falling to the ground. He does not remember fleeing and being pursued. Last July, Jock Palfreeman had a victory. A Bulgarian court approved the application that he and three other prisoners submitted for the establishment of the obliquely named Bulgarian Prisoners' Rehabilitation Association as a non-government organisation. Bulgarian human-rights advocate Krassimir Kanev says the association is the first of its kind in Bulgaria and describes Palfreeman as a ""courageous and charismatic leader"". The two men are now working closely with each other, taking cases to the European Court of Human Rights. ""I am in prison because I was helping other people,"" Palfreeman says. ""Why am I doing this? Because I still want to help people."" Simon's sense that his son ""walks the talk"" still fills him with pride. But his fears for Jock's well-being have not diminished. On January 13 this year, Palfreeman began a hunger strike after the prison drastically reduced the amount of time he can use a computer. Prisoners are not given access to the internet, but Palfreeman is enrolled in an arts degree at Sydney's Macquarie University and needs to read the resource material that is sent to him on a disk, and to type essays. Neither Jock nor Simon know why his access has been reduced.

Kanev says it is probably payback for Jock Palfreeman's advocacy on behalf of some prisoners who had been bashed by guards. He says Sofia Central is among the worst prisons he has visited in Eastern Europe. ""It's a kind of a living death. It's an inhuman condition of detention essentially."" Australia and Bulgaria are both signatories to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, and the Palfreemans want Jock to serve his sentence in Australia so he can be near his family. Kanev says transfer is essential on human-rights grounds and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs has instigated proceedings with the Bulgarian government, but little progress has been made so far. Simon Palfreeman has booked yet another ticket to Europe. Sofia is now bitterly cold and an icy wind whistles through the broken window in Cell 17. Jock fears the Bulgarian authorities will refuse a transfer out of spite. Simon can only hope that his son is wrong.

84,84,Drought Sri Lanka,"David Miliband, Former UK Foreign Secretary, Appointed President of International Rescue Committee - PR Newswire",https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/david-miliband-former-uk-foreign-secretary-appointed-president-of-international-rescue-committee-200175931.html,"NEW YORK, March 27, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The International Rescue Committee (IRC) today announced the appointment of David Miliband, 47, former Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, as its president and CEO, effective September this year. He will succeed George Rupp, who has led the global humanitarian relief and development organization since stepping down as president of Columbia University in 2002.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130327/DC83911LOGO)

Over the last 15 years, Miliband has had a distinguished political career in the United Kingdom. From 2007 to 2010, he served as the youngest U.K. Foreign Secretary in three decades, driving advancements in human rights and representing the United Kingdom throughout the world. In 2006, as U.K. Secretary of State for the Environment, he spearheaded the groundbreaking Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill, establishing the world's first legally binding framework for reducing carbon emissions.

""I am deeply honored to have been appointed president of the IRC,"" Miliband said. ""Thanks to the leadership of George Rupp, the dedication of its staff and the confidence of its donors, the IRC today is strong, effective and widely respected, and I am committed to helping the IRC team build on their great work. The IRC's mission is personal for me because my own parents were refugees who arrived in Britain in the 1940s. I look forward to honoring the memory of those who helped my parents by leading the IRC as it continues to offer help today to uprooted people around the world. I will bring to the IRC a passionate commitment to social justice and international cooperation. I am eager to listen to the stories of its diverse staff, beneficiaries, partners and funders, and adding ideas of my own, as we chart a confident future for an organization that has an inspirational past.""

""David is an experienced world leader and a man of both action and character,"" Rupp said, ""as his record as Foreign Secretary—including his work for conflict resolution in the former Yugoslavia, his leadership in calling for a political settlement in Afghanistan, and his drive for education reform in Pakistan and human rights in Sri Lanka—attests. His insights, ability and commitment will be tremendous assets. I look forward to witnessing this next exciting chapter of the IRC's incredible journey of helping the most desperate people move from harm to home.""

""The IRC was looking for a proven leader with the ability to project our message, deepen our partnerships and build on our record of innovation on behalf of displaced people around the world,"" said Sarah O'Hagan and Thomas Schick, co-chairs of the IRC's Board of Directors. ""In David Miliband we have found such a leader.""

During the last decade, the IRC has responded to a wide range of humanitarian crises, including those associated with the civil war in Syria, the war in Iraq, the conflict in Darfur, the drought and famine in the Horn and East Africa and more recently the Sahel, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2008 cyclone in Myanmar and earthquakes in Pakistan, Haiti and Japan. The IRC has also carried out major development and assistance programs in Afghanistan, Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. In addition, the agency has helped more than 75,000 refugees begin new lives in the United States over the last decade. Founded in 1933 at the suggestion of Albert Einstein to help victims of the Nazis, the IRC today has operations in more than 40 countries. Its staff includes more than 12,000 men and women around the world, and nearly 1,300 volunteers in its 22 U.S. refugee resettlement offices. The IRC's budget is expected to exceed $440 million during the current fiscal year.

David Miliband is currently Member of Parliament representing South Shields. He is Co-Chair of the Global Ocean Commission. Before serving as Foreign Secretary and Secretary of State for the Environment, he was Minister for Communities and Local Government (2005–2006); Minister for Schools (2002–2004); and Head of Downing Street's Number 10 Policy Unit (1997–2001).

Miliband graduated from Oxford University in 1987 with a first class degree in philosophy, politics and economics, and received his master's degree in political science in 1989 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he attended as a Kennedy Scholar. He is married to the violinist Louise Shackelton and they have two sons. His office will be located at the IRC's global headquarters in New York.

88,88,Drought Sri Lanka,From Brown Growth to Green: the Economic Benefits of Climate Action - World Bank Group,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/06/25/growing-green-europe-and-central-asia,"Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s countries throughout the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) region underwent an economic transition – moving from the planned economies of the past to the market economies of today. In the first decade of the new millennium, these same countries moved from social division toward inclusion by improving public services, education, and social safety nets.

These countries are now poised to undergo another transition over the current decade – moving from brown to green growth, a move that can make production and consumption more sustainable, increase the quality of life, and reduce the impacts of climate change.

But what does it mean to transition from “brown” to “green” growth?

“Brown growth describes economic development that relies heavily on fossil fuels and does not consider the negative side effects that economic production and consumption have on the environment,” says Uwe Deichmann, Senior Environmental Specialist at the World Bank and co-author of the recently published Growing Green: The Economic Benefits of Climate Action.

“Green growth,” continues Deichmann, “implies moving to a far cleaner energy system that uses energy more efficiently and to much better natural resource management especially on agricultural lands and in forests.”

An already shifting climate is contributing to floods, droughts, heat waves, forest fires, and other natural disasters throughout the Europe and Central Asia region - highlighting the need for strategic action across a number of sectors to help mitigate the effects of climate change. Recent floods throughout the Danube River Basin caused catastrophic economic damage and several deaths in many countries in Europe. In 2012 several countries in the Europe and Central Asia region lost between 25 and 50 percent of the region’s grain crops as a result of droughts and floods. The worst drought in five decades decimated Russia’s agriculture sector in 2010 and illustrated the country’s growing vulnerability to drastic forest fires.

By taking climate action today, countries in the region can begin mitigating the negative impacts of climate change while simultaneously increasing their economic efficiency and productivity for tomorrow. By shifting from coal-fired electricity generation to lower-emission natural gas and renewables, for example, countries can not only lower their greenhouse gas emissions but also reduce air pollution that causes respiratory health issues – highlighting the types of economic co-benefits which can contribute to making countries more competitive. Although some mitigation measures continue to have net costs – including transition or adjustment costs – the costs associated with future damages that could result from continuing shifts in climate will likely be much higher.

Most estimates place the cost for climate action at approximately 1 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per year and many predict that these costs will eventually transform into benefits – for example in the form of health improvements, reduced energy expenditures and greater productivity. These associated costs nonetheless require countries to identify priority areas for investment.","Tue, 25 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/wbr/share-logo/social-share.jpg,"['natural', 'economic', 'countries', 'action', 'region', 'europe', 'climate', 'benefits', 'moving', 'green', 'transition', 'growth', 'costs', 'brown']", ,flood_and_drought

Andy Stevenson, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Finance Advisor and Dan Lashof, Director of NRDC's Climate and Clean Air Program contributed this article to LiveScience's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.

There are many, many compelling and urgent reasons to take decisive action to combat climate change. Here's one that's measurable by dollars added to our budget deficit. Actually by tens of billions of dollars.

The soaring cost of private flood insurance is pricing so many coastal homeowners out of the market that the rest of the American taxpayers are having to bail them out – to the tune of $30 billion under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).

With over $139 billion in storm, wildfire, drought, tornado and flood damages taking nearly 1 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012, the insurance industry is referring to last year as the second costliest year on record for U.S. climate-related disasters. And while insurers do include $12 billion worth of flood-related damages in their estimates, they aren't the ones getting stuck with most of the bill. It's us, the taxpayer.

On a global basis, the insurance company Munich Re estimates that flooding represented 16 percent of total climate-related damages over the past decade, or $25 billion, on average, per year. Over that same period, insurers paid out on $3.75 billion per year, on average, or less than 15 percent of total flood-related costs. That percentage seems to be fairly representative as the total losses from floods along the Mississippi in 2011 were estimated at $4.6 billion with only $500 million (11 percent) covered by private insurers.

So if insurers are only paying 10-15 percent of the bill, who actually does pay the cost of flood-related damage? The not-so-surprising answer is you and me, largely through the National Flood Insurance Program, which has nearly $1.3 trillion in policies outstanding. This program includes several state programs, such as the one for Florida (which has over 2 million policy holders and a face value of $475 billion) that had to be created as the rising cost of flooding was not being covered by private insurers.

This massive federal program has nearly doubled in size over the past decade as private insurers have continued to shy away from making bets against Mother Nature when it comes to floods. And while the federal government has picked up the slack in terms of coverage, it has had a tough time balancing the premiums that are paid in with the heavy losses it has sustained from recent climate related events.

In fact, following an estimated $12 billion in payout to 140,000 policy holders from Superstorm Sandy, the program is over $30 billion in debt and has Congress scratching its head about what to do about it since the private insurers have made it very clear this is not a business that they wish to be in. NFIP is insolvent because premiums don't reflect actual risks; and it's hard to make a case that climate-change-charged storms are not a big part of the reason why. [Jersey Shore: Before and After Hurricane Sandy]

In sum, the U.S. taxpayer is currently down $30 billion trying to provide insurance for coastal landowners that no longer have access to affordable private flood insurance. And that figure does not include the costs weathered by the state-based programs that have been set up due to a lack of private alternatives available to their residents. Taken together, these programs constitute a climate disruption tax that the U.S. consumer is being forced to pay to cover risks that the insurance industry, the true score-keepers on climate, won't touch.

As the costs of climate change continue to mount, it is becoming increasingly obvious that we can't afford not to act to rein in the carbon pollution that is supercharging storms and floods. Fortunately President Obama has a big opportunity to reduce emissions from power plants, America's biggest carbon polluters. Under a plan NRDC put forward in December, we could cut these emissions by 26 percent by 2020 and 34 percent by 2025 compared to 2005 levels. The plan provides great flexibility to states and utilities, and offers benefits to every American.

Its benefits—worth between $25 and $60 billion in 2020 — far outweigh the plan's costs — about $4 billion. Implementing it will save tens of thousands of lives through reductions in air pollution. And it will drive investments in energy efficiency and clean energy that will create thousands of new jobs across the nation. Now that's an insurance premium worth paying.

91,91,Drought Sri Lanka,A for Adyar - The Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-for-adyar/article4422191.ece,"Recognising their spiritual link with Adyar, Theosophists have chosen February 17 as Adyar Day. Joining in the celebration, Aparna Karthikeyan and Prince Frederick present some facts about the neighbourhood — some, perhaps, common knowledge, and others, little-known, beyond niche groups, anyway …

Well-known

For millions of people, mention of Adyar instantly brings to mind a banyan tree, frighteningly old and incredibly spread-out. Having sprouted roots around 450 years ago, this banyan, found inside the Theosophical Society, is among the world’s oldest trees. According to >adyarbanyantree.blogspot.in, its sprawl makes it the largest surviving banyan — yes, the largest — on the planet. “Its branches spread across 40,000 sq.ft.,” says the blog site.

Less-known

Within the Theosophical Society are found baobab trees, remarkably unique in look and feature. “Native to Africa, the baobab tree possesses a built-in capacity for withstanding drought-like conditions. It stores water in its huge trunk. It has a large base, which is offset by its small branches. The colour and texture of its bark bear a resemblance to the skin of an elephant,” says naturalist and sea turtle conservationist V. Arun.

In the 1950s, when Gandhi Nagar was being developed, the residents wanted a neighbourhood temple, and the last maharajah of Travancore (Chitra Tirunal Bala Rama Varma) helped in purchasing the land on which the Padmanabhaswamy temple was built. “In the 1990s — when the Travancore Maharaja Park (near Esplanade) became a bus terminus, and the statue reduced to a public convenience — Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer and others, mooted the idea and moved the statue to its present location in the temple,” says Sriram.V, historian and Chennai chronicler.

Less-known

Chitra Tirunal Bala Rama Varma’s statue, that is currently at the Padmanabhaswamy temple, Gandhi Nagar, was originally opposite the Raja Annamalai Manram, says Sriram. “The statue was installed to commemorate his Temple Entry Proclaomation, which allowed all Hindus, irrespective of caste, to enter any temple in Travancore, and the pedestal stone was inscribed with the full text of the proclamation. In the movie En Manaivi, a car goes around George Town, and the statue can be seen in all its glory, in the old location,” he adds.

The conflux of sea and river water at the Adyar Estuary fosters bio-diversity. “The estuarine eco-system holds is an attraction for migratory birds, including godwits, redshanks, greenshanks, common sandpipers, golden plovers and little-ringed plovers,” says T. Murugavel, founder, the Trust for Environment Monitoring and Action Initiating (TEMAI).

“The Adyar Estuary has small islands or land masses that are overrun with Prosopis juliflora (velikaathan). These islands of green serve as nesting grounds for stone curlews, red-wattled lapwings and paddy field pipits. Often, small packs of jackals are also found there,” says Murugavel of TEMAI. “From the Broken Bridge, a clear view of these land masses is possible.”

92,92,Drought Sri Lanka,"India's tea tourism: Gracious living, great brews, echoes of bygone days - Victoria Times Colonist",https://www.timescolonist.com/travel/india-s-tea-tourism-gracious-living-great-brews-echoes-of-bygone-days-1.29634,"JORHAT, India - ""This is your own home now,"" announces our host, welcoming us to Thengal Manor. And we wish it was, this gracious residence of one of India's great tea dynasties, which has opened the family villa, with its idyllic gardens and an impeccable staff of 15, to overnight visitors.

Thengal Manor marked the start of a two-week journey through the world's finest tea growing areas — India's Assam and Darjeeling. We mingled with nimble-fingered women as they plucked a green sea of bushes with astounding speed, we drank pink gins by the fireplace in colonial-era parlours and we were very easily seduced by the pampered lifestyle of tea planters.

article continues below

And of course, we drank many a cup of Assamese — ""bold, sultry, malty"" — and Darjeeling — ""the champagne of teas, the colour of Himalayan sunlight"" — enough to send aficionados into ecstasy.

Let me confess that I am not particularly tea-addicted. Too much tannin does funny things to my tummy. But my wife, a Scot, more than makes up for it. So that, plus our love for northeast India, sparked our interest in a travel niche that is very much a growing trend: tea tourism.

It's not a particularly well-organized pocket of the industry, but more tea estates, also called gardens, are opening their properties to guests interested not only in their product and how it comes to be, but in the unique world of tea planters, the ""burra sahibs,"" and their domain. Most estates are charmers dating back to the British Raj.

Those taking to the tea trails of northeast India, regions of the south and Sri Lanka, include locals and foreigners. Among them are an increasing number of Americans, apparently because of a percolating interest in the United States in the art and taste of quality teas, though my wife insists American tea culture still consists of ""hot water and a tea bag.""

Along with two friends from France, my wife and I had Thengal Manor to ourselves, its five acres (two hectares) of lawns, a chandeliered dining room with elegant silverware, bedrooms with soaring ceilings and four-poster beds and a gallery of portraits of the Barooah family going back to Bisturam Barooah, whose son built the manor in 1929 after becoming the richest Indian tea planter in Assam.

The family began to take in visitors in 2000, but it remains very much their personal place. In a serene enclosure behind the manor stand 19 temple-like tombs, one prepared for the current patriarch.

During our time at Thengal, ringed by rice fields, bamboo groves and neat village homes, we visited the nearby factory of the Gatoonga Tea Estate to observe the five stages of black tea-making and tour two contrasting tea trail options: Gatoonga's Mistry Sahib's bungalow and the Burra Sahib bungalow on the Sangsua Tea Estate.

The century-old Mistry is the ultimate getaway, almost smothered by the surrounding greenery, a classic bungalow with a wrap-around verandah shaded by an immense banyan tree. Burra Sahib has been modernized and features an 18-hole golf course meandering through the tea gardens.

Our second stay in Assam was on the Addabarie Tea Estate near the city of Tezpur, where a tourism enterprise has leased a luxurious onetime residence of the tea estate manager, the three-bedroom 1875 Heritage Bungalow, and five more modest houses.

""The tea planter's lifestyle is this,"" said manager Durrez Ahmed with a wave of his hand. ""Lovely bungalows, sets of servants attending to your every need. So visitors who want to enjoy this kind of lifestyle come.""

It also was and remains a hard-working, lonely lifestyle in a world unto itself. Addabarie and most other larger estates have their own clinics, schools, shops and day care centres. (Almost all tea pluckers are women; far less nimble-fingered males need not apply.)

Ruling over estates is the manager, described as a benevolent despot who like his British antecedents still retains a large staff and observes strict protocol. His bungalow, in the words of one Indian author, ""is to the garden folk what Windsor Castle is to British citizens.""

""And why did tea tourism get started?"" we asked Ahmed.

Smaller, private estates began welcoming guests in the 1990s as a marketing strategy to help pull them out of a worldwide tea glut. Another slump followed in the early 2000s when India opened up its markets to cheaper imports, forcing some growers to seek alternative sources of revenue. There's been no looking back.

From the lowlands of Assam, we ascended 7,000 feet (2,100 metres) to the Olympus of tea: Darjeeling, where altitude, soil, slope and sunlight come together to concoct magic. Among the hill stations the British founded to flee India's blazing summers, Darjeeling's gems include the Windamere, haunt of tea people past and present and often cited as one of India's finest colonial-era hotels.

Originally a hostel for bachelor tea planters dating back to the 1880s, the hotel is owned by the Tenduf-las, a prominent Tibetan family with close ties to the Raj who maintain the aura of those bygone days.

There's afternoon tea with scones, served daily since 1939 in Daisy's Music Room where family albums are stacked atop a piano lighted by candelabras. Hot water bottles are tucked into beds each evening, and real English porridge dispensed by white-gloved waiters at breakfast.

Around Darjeeling are nearly 90 tea estates, including Makaibari, producer of India's first organic tea and a pioneer in tea tourism, offering 21 homestays with estate workers and an upmarket residence. Its factory has changed very little since it was erected in 1859, and barely relies on modern technology to produce high-end tea for export to the United States and Europe.

""We need the human touch — and nose — not a robotic arm or an aromatic sensor,'"" says production manager Sanjoy Mukherjee, inviting us to sample six of his teas, including Silver Tips Imperial which fetched a record $455 a pound ($1,000 per kilogram) at an auction in China.

Back at the Windamere, we dined by candlelight with music of the 1920s and '30s softly in the background. Served is honey-glazed lamb and chocolate soufflé, which our French friends pronounced ""delicieux."" Before dinner, Sherab Tenduf-la, the hotel's owner, offered us pink gins, the quintessential colonial drink, by the fireplace as cold mists veiled the looming Himalayan peaks.

The gentleman, exuding charm of another era, told us that the last of Darjeeling's British tea planters, Teddy Young, died earlier this year. But along the subcontinent's tea routes, much of the style and substance they created remains firmly implanted.

The wine-producing regions of the world are under threat from global warming, suggests a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

But while places familiar to oenophiles — Bordeaux, Tuscany, Napa — face climatic challenges, Slate reports, new wine-producing regions may emerge.

Chateau Montana, anyone?

Wine grapes are notoriously picky plants, sensitive to subtle shifts in rainfall, heat and humidity, the Guardian reports.

As the planet continues to warm and regional climates change in yet-to-be-determined ways, viticulture experts are striving to forecast how grapes will fare under new conditions. [Top 10 Surprising Results of Global Warming]

And while researchers assumed there would be some changes to the climates of wine-growing regions by 2050, even they were surprised by the drastic alterations shown by an array of climate models.

""We expected to see significant shifts, but we didn't expect to see shifts like these,"" Lee Hannah, a senior scientist at Conservation International and co-author of the PNAS study, told the Guardian.

Vast swaths of France, Spain and Italy would become inhospitable to wine grapes by 2050 under the researchers' projections. Likewise, most of Australia's wine regions would be too hot and dry for grapes, and wines from California's famed Napa and Sonoma valleys would disappear from store shelves.

""The fact is that climate change will lead to a huge shake-up in the geographic distribution of wine production,"" said Hannah.

Some existing vineyards in familiar wine regions could continue to operate, but would probably need additional imports of irrigation water — already a vexing issue and not likely to get any easier as the planet gets hotter, the Atlantic reports.

Beyond the agricultural concerns, however, lies an even knottier issue: the development of prime wildlife habitat. Many of the areas projected to be potential wine-producing regions are also the last refuge for endangered animals.

China, for example, now imports most of its wine, but it may decide to plant more of its own domestic vineyards in the future, the Atlantic reports.

However, China's prime wine regions are projected ""to be in the same mountains that are habitat for giant pandas, so wine expansion in China may have repercussions for what is arguably the world's most iconic animal,"" Hannah said in a Conservation International blog post.

The grizzlies, moose, pronghorn antelope and wolves of America's Yellowstone region could also face considerable pressure if new vineyards begin to crowd them out of their ever-shrinking habitat, the New York Times reports.

There are, however, conservation initiatives that could ease the pressure on endangered plants and animals, such as South Africa’s Biodiversity & Wine Initiative (BWI).

The BWI works in collaboration with South Africa's wineries and conservationists to protect the habitat in the Cape Floral Kingdom, a UNESCO World Heritage site and a biodiversity hotspot — as well as a superb area for vineyards.

Thank you. It’s always a pleasure to visit a great academic institution, one engaged in preparing the leaders of the future.

I’m here today to talk to you about the future, about the opportunity to create a world free from the stain of poverty and economic exclusion.

My message to you is that such a world is within our reach. But if we are to succeed, we have to make some hard decisions and change the way we work together.

To understand the historic opportunity in front of us, and what we must do to transform history, let me begin with some observations on the global development landscape today and the outlook for the medium term.

The Global Development Landscape

Let me start by noting that the crisis which has gripped the global economy over the last four and a half years does not yet show clear signs of abatement. So many green shoots have sprouted and withered in the last year or two that we should be cautious in assessing the future. As recent events in Cyprus demonstrate, it is too early to declare victory. At the same time there is growing evidence that we are on the right track, although there are sure to be some bumps in the road ahead.

Market conditions in Europe have improved since the turbulence of last spring and summer. Thanks to the commitment by European leaders to contain financial volatility, many risk indicators are back at levels last seen in early 2010 – before concerns about Euro Area fiscal sustainability emerged. While European policymakers deserve credit for these improvements, it's important for us to recognize that the injection of liquidity only buys us time; it does not solve the problem. Many more difficult decisions pertaining to fiscal and banking policies remain.

In the real economy, there are some weak signals that recovery is underway. In high-income countries, headwinds from fiscal consolidation continue to drag on growth, but we may have turned a corner. Here in the US, both the housing market and labor market are improving – over one million jobs have been added to the American economy in the last six months – though we must note that there remains a lingering uncertainty over the deadlock in fiscal policy. In Europe, GDP is projected to shrink by 0.2 percent this year, and some of the difficulties will continue to persist until late 2014 and early 2015.

When we look at the economic picture ahead for developing countries, the prospects are brighter. The economies of the developing world are expected to expand by 5.5 percent this year, and we forecast growth will further accelerate to 5.7 percent and 5.8 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Dynamic and competitive firms are opening and expanding all over the developing world, from small startups to multinational corporations.

I was recently in Chengdu, China, where I met an entrepreneur named Zhang Yan. A few years back, she had big dreams to build a business but lacked access to finance. She was able to secure a $10,000 loan through a local bank’s initiative to finance female entrepreneurs -- a program supported by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank Group’s private sector lending arm. Zhang used her loan to open a car repair shop, and today, she runs a thriving business that employs more than 150 people. I just received an email from her over the weekend. She plans to open a third repair shop, and will continue to promote social responsibility by hiring and training women who have previously not had access to good jobs. Her story mirrors the experiences of millions of ambitious individuals across the globe. When they are given the chance to succeed in business, they seize it. In turn, they create jobs and opportunities for their neighbors.

This private sector growth is reaping impressive development gains, especially when coupled with more effective pro-poor interventions on the part of governments, international donors, and civil society. Today extreme poverty is in retreat. In 1990, 43 percent of the developing world lived on less than $1.25 a day. In 2010 – 20 years later -- we estimate that the global poverty rate dropped to 21 percent. The first Millennium Development Goal, to halve extreme poverty, was achieved five years ahead of time.

And the advances in the social sector are perhaps even more remarkable. In the last decade, eight million AIDS patients have received antiretroviral therapy. The annual number of malaria deaths has dropped by 75 percent. The total number of out-of-school children has fallen by over 40 percent.

Looking ahead, we believe the conditions are in place for continued strong performance in developing countries. Yet we can’t take high growth rates for granted. Maintaining growth of 6 percent, let alone the 7 or 8 percent many economies achieved during the pre-crisis boom period, will require sustained reform efforts. For example, countries must continue to improve the quality of education, governance, and the business climate; modernize their infrastructure; ensure energy and food security; and enhance financial intermediation.

Moreover, new risks are emerging. In particular, we are concerned that unless the world takes bold action now, a disastrously warming planet threatens to reverse much of the progress we have experienced.

Climate change is not just an environmental challenge. It is a fundamental threat to economic development and the fight against poverty.

According to a recent World Bank report, if we don’t act now to curb dangerous emissions, by the end of this century the average global temperature will increase by 4 degrees Celsius, or more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit.

In a “4-degree world,” sea levels would rise by as much as 1.5 meters, putting more than 360 million city dwellers at risk. Drought-affected areas would increase from 15 percent of global cropland today to around 44 percent, with sub-Saharan Africa especially hard hit. Extreme weather events would occur with devastating frequency, with untold costs in lives and dollars. And it is the poor, those least responsible for climate change and least able to afford adaptation, who would suffer the most.

A second crucial challenge for the medium term is the problem of inequality. Often, the mention of inequality causes embarrassed silence. We have to break the taboo of silence on this difficult but critically important issue. Even if rapid economic expansion in the developing world continues, this doesn’t mean that everyone will automatically benefit from the development process. Assuring that growth is inclusive is both a moral imperative and a crucial condition for sustained economic development.

We know that despite the dramatic successes of the last decade, there are still around 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty, 870 million who go hungry every day, and 6.9 million children under five dying every year.

So, what conclusions can we draw from this overview of today’s global development landscape? I believe there are two key implications for the work of the World Bank Group.

Accelerating the End of Extreme Poverty

The first is that now is the time to commit to ending extreme poverty. We are at an auspicious moment in history, when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance -- for the first time ever -- to end extreme poverty within a generation. Our duty now must be to ensure that these favorable circumstances are matched with clarity of purpose and resolute action to realize this historic opportunity.

We know the end of poverty will not come easily. In the years ahead, as we push toward this goal, the job will become tougher and tougher, because those remaining in poverty will be the hardest to reach.

Some live in densely populated areas in emerging economies, such as the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which I visited last month and which accounts for 8 percent of the people in the world living in extreme poverty. People in Uttar Pradesh need so much, including improved infrastructure, stronger education systems that prepare students for the work force, and greater inclusion of women and other vulnerable groups in labor markets.

Others who remain trapped in poverty live in countries caught in cycles of conflict and fragility. A substantial and growing share of poor people live in fragile or conflict-affected states, where both the need for and the obstacles to development tend to be the greatest. Fragile states must be front and center in any agenda to end extreme poverty.

Development in fragile states is difficult, but with creative approaches real progress is possible, as I saw in Afghanistan three weeks ago. For example, we’re helping train Afghan volunteers to use GPS-enabled smart phones with built-in cameras to monitor irrigation projects in their communities, increasing their sense of ownership. Their photos and reports are now transmitted daily to our main offices in Kabul. The cameras also have a function that James Bond would appreciate: a delete-all-data button, including photos and reports, in case the workers are questioned at a checkpoint. In Afghanistan, despite enduring security challenges and an environment plagued by corruption, many companies today are exploring investment opportunities in mining, energy, and transportation. The international airport is full of commercial aircraft – a striking change from a decade ago. And 27 percent of the country’s members of parliament are women – an even sharper break with the past.

The donor community’s experience in Afghanistan illustrates the high risks of operating in fragile states. But increasingly we’re seeing how coordinated efforts from the international community and local governments can produce transformative results. We’re accumulating lessons on how to achieve security, political stability, and economic development. Next month, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and I will visit the Great Lakes region of eastern Africa together as we cooperate to put these lessons more widely into practice. I want to be clear – I have worked in fragile and conflict-affected states for most of my adult life and continuing to strengthen the World Bank Group’s work in these countries will be one of my very top priorities.

Boosting Shared Prosperity

In addition to accelerating the end of extreme poverty, I believe the second development lesson for our times is that fighting extreme poverty alone is not enough. We must collectively work to help all vulnerable people everywhere lift themselves well above the poverty line. At the World Bank Group this focus on equity is central to our mission of boosting shared prosperity.

What I’ve heard time and again over the past nine months is that forward-looking policymakers around the world are concerned about inequality and exclusion.

They want to create economic opportunities for their vulnerable citizens, and bring growth to the homes of the poor and the relatively disadvantaged, whether they live on $1 a day, $2 a day, or $10 a day. They want to help those who have only recently escaped extreme poverty secure the resources they need to join the middle class. And they want to ensure that the gains they’ve achieved over the past decades are sustainable – socially, fiscally, and environmentally.

In Tunisia last January, I met with civil society leaders who were at the forefront of the movement which launched the Arab Spring. Their message was clear: If prosperity is not widely shared, if it is not built on a development process which involves all members of society, especially women and young people, then tensions may again rise to the breaking point.

I also strongly believe that prosperity must be shared not only among individuals, communities, and nations, but also across generations. If we do not act to curb climate change immediately, we will leave our children and grandchildren with an unrecognizable planet.

The World Bank Group is now working on a revamped strategy to significantly strengthen our climate change interventions and help catalyze urgent action among global partners on the scale required. We are exploring a number of bold ideas, including new mechanisms to support and connect carbon markets; politically feasible plans to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies; increased investments in climate-smart agriculture; and innovative partnerships to build clean cities. We are reviewing our work in every sector to ensure that all our projects reflect the pressing need to tackle climate change. A “4-degree world” can still be avoided if we develop a plan and take concerted action that is equal to the challenge we face. To date, I believe our efforts to combat climate change have been too narrowly focused, small scale and uncoordinated. We can do better.

Two Goals to Guide the World Bank Group

Let me now talk more specifically about how the World Bank Group is mobilizing to seize the opportunity to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.

We’re introducing two goals to guide our strategy. These are not goals which the World Bank Group itself will achieve. They are goals which our partners – our 188 member countries – will achieve, with the support of the entire global development community.

The first goal is to end extreme poverty by 2030. With the end of extreme poverty within our grasp, we want to set an aggressive timeline to focus our efforts and maintain a sense of urgency.

The date of 2030 is highly ambitious. If anyone doubts it, consider that the first Millennium Development Goal was to halve absolute poverty over a period of 25 years. To reach the 2030 goal, we must halve global poverty once, then halve it again, and then nearly halve it a third time—all in less than one generation. If countries can achieve this, then absolute poverty will be brought below 3 percent. Our economists set the goal line here, because below 3 percent the nature of the poverty challenge will change fundamentally in most parts of the world. The focus will shift from broad structural measures to tackling sporadic poverty among specific vulnerable groups.

Our team believes three factors will be necessary to achieve this extraordinary result.

First, to reach our goal will require an acceleration of the growth rates observed over the past 15 years, and in particular sustained high growth in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Second, it will require efforts to enhance inclusiveness and curb inequality, and ensure that growth translates into poverty reduction, most importantly through job creation. And third, it will require that potential shocks – such as climatic disasters or new food, fuel, or financial crises – be averted or mitigated.

Reaching these goals will require additional resources. This year the World Bank Group is discussing with our partners the replenishment of the International Development Association, or IDA, our fund for the 81 poorest countries. With IDA’s help, hundreds of millions of people have escaped extreme poverty. Securing a strong IDA replenishment is one of my highest priorities.

Meeting this 2030 goal will require extraordinary effort. But is there anyone, anywhere, who doubts that the reward will be worth it? Is there anyone who has lived on less than $1.25 a day who would not join me here today in telling you that it is time to end extreme poverty? Is there anyone who has seen the shantytowns of Johannesburg or Addis Ababa or Dhaka or Lima who would not commit to help build a better life for all who live there? Is there anyone here today who would not want to erase this stain from our collective conscience?

But we know that ending extreme poverty is not enough. We must also work to boost the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of the population in each country.

Focusing on the bottom 40 percent captures the twin elements of shared prosperity: the imperative of economic growth matched with a strong concern for equity. It demands that we worry not just about whether developing economies are expanding, but look directly at whether the welfare of the poorest segment of society is improving. It is an important objective for all countries.

Though our efforts are especially focused on the countries with the fewest resources, our work is not just in poor countries. Our work is in any country where there are poor people.

This is hard work, but it can be done. I was just in Brazil, where I saw how carefully crafted public policies can dramatically reduce income inequality. Brazil has expanded access to education and implemented a conditional cash transfer program that raises incomes among the very poor. Other countries can adapt these and other proven strategies to tackle inequality in their own contexts. Success can spread.

The World Bank Group will be there to help countries end poverty and boost shared prosperity in at least four ways.

First, we will use these goals to help us choose among competing priorities, as we identify the projects where we can have the most impact. These goals will significantly inform our Country Partnership Strategies, the detailed policy documents which define our objectives for each of our partner countries.

For example, next week we will send to our Board a new Country Partnership Strategy for India, the first such strategy designed with these two goals in mind. India’s contribution to ending global poverty could be staggering. In the last five years, roughly 50 million people have been lifted out of poverty in India. But in the next generation, we estimate that with a concerted push an additional 300 million people in India could escape extreme poverty.

Second, we will closely monitor and observe progress toward these goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity, and will report annually on what has been achieved and where gaps remain.

Third, we will use our convening and advocacy power to continually remind policymakers and the international community what it will take to realize these goals.

Recently, a number of courageous politicians have committed to ending poverty in their countries, including Dilma Rousseff in Brazil and Joyce Banda in Malawi. Similarly, US President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron endorsed the vision of ending extreme poverty globally. These bold calls demand action. The World Bank Group will be a relentless advocate and a loyal partner in encouraging policymakers to follow through on their promises to the poor.

And fourth, we will work with our partners to share knowledge on solutions to end poverty and promote shared prosperity.

To reach their development goals, countries will need sound policies and adequate financing. But they will also need to improve delivery: how they implement policies on the ground to get results.

Increasingly, countries are looking to the World Bank Group for support in tackling delivery challenges. They tell us they have record numbers of children in school, but tests show that far too many can’t read or write by the fifth grade. They tell us plans for new sanitation plants, or new roads, or new bridges have been approved, but years later they still are not completed. These are delivery failures, and for many countries, they’re the greatest obstacle to development progress.

That’s why we are working with countries and partners to build what we are calling a science of delivery for development. As it matures, this new field will provide frontline development practitioners with knowledge, tools, and support networks. It will connect them to peers around the world who can help them problem-solve in real time. One recent example: Engineers modernizing power grids in the Republic of Georgia received advice from colleagues in Chile who had solved similar challenges.

By systematically enabling these connections, the science of delivery will multiply the impact of expert problem-solvers inside and outside the World Bank Group: These are the people who are on the front lines figuring out ways to bring solar power to a half-million Mongolian nomads; or helping Costa Rican villagers rebuild after an earthquake; or crafting a finance package that can bring a struggling railroad line in East Africa back to life.

In advancing the emerging field of delivery science, we will help our partners learn from one another and maximize the impact of every dollar spent to end poverty and promote shared prosperity.

Conclusion: What Kind of World Will We Leave to our Children?

In closing, let me note that this Friday marks 1,000 days until the end of 2015, the deadline for achieving all eight Millennium Development Goals. Progress on the MDGs has been impressive, but it remains uneven across populations and countries. We must use these next 1,000 days to move with much greater urgency to improve the lives of children and their families.

While we ramp up, we must also focus on what comes next, and how we can maintain an unrelenting focus for the years ahead. With our partners, the World Bank Group is engaged in framing a bold post-2015 agenda. In fact, this weekend I will be in Madrid meeting with the leaders of all the United Nations agencies under the leadership of Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. We will focus specifically on how we can work together as a multilateral system to accelerate progress in the last 1000 days.

But we all know that the challenges in front of us are enormous and progress is never inevitable . I am reminded of this when I think back to a moment during the African-American civil rights movement exactly 50 years ago this month.

In April 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King was arrested in Birmingham, Alabama, for leading a wave of mass protests designed to force local authorities to speed up desegregation reforms. Many moderate white religious leaders, people who considered themselves allies of the civil rights struggle, disapproved of what they called King’s “extremist” tactics. The day of Dr. King’s arrest, a group of moderate clergymen published a letter in the Birmingham News in which they argued that all thoughtful people knew African-Americans would eventually gain their rights, but that King had acted in ways that were “unwise and untimely” in trying to force change before the time was ripe.

In his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Dr. King responded that the attitude of the white moderates reflected a “tragic misconception” that time would “inevitably” bring progress. King wrote, and I quote: “Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men [and women].” End quote.

Injustice will not vanish “inevitably.” Injustice, said Dr. King, must be “rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action” spurred by “the urgency of the moment.”

As we set goals for our organization, goals for our collective effort to better serve the poor and vulnerable, we should reflect on Dr. King’s example.

We set goals precisely because nothing is inevitable. We set goals to challenge external obstacles—but also to defy our own inertia. We set goals to keep ourselves alert to the “urgency of the moment,” to push constantly beyond our own limits. We set goals to keep ourselves from falling into either fatalism or complacency—both deadly enemies of the poor.

We set goals so that, every day, every hour, we can ensure that our actions are aligned with our deepest values—those we can affirm without shame before the judgment of history.

If we act today, if we work relentlessly toward these goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, we have the opportunity to create a world for our children which is defined not by stark inequities but by soaring opportunities. A sustainable world where all households have access to clean energy. A world where everyone has enough to eat. A world where no one dies from preventable diseases.

A world free of poverty.

It is the world we all want for ourselves, for our children, our grandchildren, and all future generations.

As Dr. King said, ""the time is always ripe to do right."" The opportunity is squarely in front of us. We can and we must seize the arc of history and bend it toward justice.

98,98,Drought Sri Lanka,Caribbean: Barbados's garden attractions - Telegraph - Telegraph.co.uk,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/caribbean/barbados/articles/Caribbean-Barbadoss-garden-attractions/,"One story goes that the first people to glimpse Barbados were Spanish traders, sailing to Brazil. They gave it the Spanish name for “bearded ones” because they saw an island densely wooded with the native banyan or bearded fig trees (Ficus citrifolia), so-named for their thick hanging roots.

How different from our first view of Barbados today, I thought, slumped crossly in a taxi from the airport to my hotel. The tired chorus line of tropical horticulture was all there along the roadside: savagely pruned bougainvillea, garishly splattered crotons, and municipal displays on every roundabout of castor-oil plants and coleus. Standard fare, from Bali to Florida, Mauritius to Barbados.

But once I had arrived at Cobblers Cove and had a soothing drink, my eyes began to open to the charms of the place. This comfortable British-owned hotel has a somewhat Fifties retro quality that makes it ideal for a trip focused on heritage rather than the beach - the lounge is stuffed with photo albums of the original house and gardens, evoking the west coast high life for which it is famous.

The villas are set within a densely planted garden: an example of what has been dubbed “tropical Cotswolds.” Lots of different plants are organised into wavy borders, and shrubs are clipped into tight shapes. So far so Home Counties. But the surroundings ooze a bodacious lushness. All those plants that, in British offices, would wilt on filing cabinets, are on a mission here to grow as huge and green as possible.

Even though Barbados tends to sell itself on beaches, rum punches and swimming with turtles, it has a rich horticultural tradition. It is, after all, a country of fertile soils and a long history of growing sugar cane. From plantation houses of the late 1600s, to Oliver Messel mansions dating from the chic Sixties and Seventies, to more recent public landscape gardens, the island has a range of horticultural hotspots. For this reason, Cobblers Cove is now offering a garden tour package, as owner Hugh Godsal explains:

“We want to attract the kind of guest who wants more than sea, sand and sun. Barbados has an amazing competitive advantage against so many locations. Places like the Maldives and the Seychelles look lovely in photos but, aside from the beach, there is absolutely nothing to do. Most people I know say that such destinations are great the first time, but by the end of a week they are beginning to feel bored. Hardly any go back to the same resort.

“The British in particular are garden-obsessed. What a perfect holiday to mix visits to special and very different gardens, with being pampered in a five-star beachfront hotel.”

I had set myself the independent challenge of finding enough gardens of interest to keep me occupied for four days. (A challenge I later came to regret, as I hardly saw the beach.) At the end of my stay, my impression of Barbados as an environmental burned-out case, dressed up with croton and bouganvillea cliches, had been shot down. The sun, sand and rum punch side of life is there. But if you’ve been to Barbados before and you’d like to see something different, or if you approach travel with just a little curiosity about local traditions and culture, there are gardens here – and gardeners – that will unlock the human history and the natural wonders of the island.

A key contact was Russell Corrie, owner of Nature Care, a garden centre and design business. He builds gardens for the rich and famous and his knowledge of both the natural and social history of Barbados was a huge help - although if you see all the gardens on this list in four days, as we did, you may feel you need another holiday.

Hunte’s Garden and Nursery

As proof that the Bajans take these things seriously, the island’s top-rated attraction on Trip Advisor is a garden owned by Anthony Hunte, a native Bajan whose English ancestors arrived in the 1630s, as indentured servants. The garden is in the centre of the island, about five kilometres from the east coast. Just inside the iron gates, I come across Anthony removing a dead leaf. A huge palm frond has fallen and it takes Anthony and a helper to carry it to the compost heap.

Following on his heels, I soon detect his masterstroke in creating this garden. It is in a sinkhole about 150 feet deep and 500 ft across, a geological curiosity formed by a massive landslip. Hunte took over the site in 1997 and spent two years making a garden in the crater before he opened to the public.

The atmosphere is one of controlled, primitive exuberance. “We aim to stay just one step ahead of the vegetation,” Anthony explains. Plants cascade down the slopes - gingers, aralias, coleus, impatiens and taro, and gather in waist-high drifts at the bottom.

The sides of the giant bowl are terraced with coral stone walls and intricate pathways. Some lead to dead-ends: a fountain shrine, or an overlook with a stone seat. It is a magical and atmospheric place.

The reward for toiling slowly back to the top is the chance to explore Anthony’s nursery and the picturesquely ruined outbuildings he has turned into a home. He joins guests on the verandah: the perfect spot to sip a lemonade and look out over the crater. Now in his seventies (check), Hunte has the air of a slightly mischievous bon viveur, but he is Bajan to the core. “I took up gardening in my twenties,” he told me. “I learned from my grandmother, who always grew plants for church fairs.”

With collections of family pictures and spoof mementoes, a piano concerto tinkling in the background, this is a warm and highly individual welcome that helps to explain why the garden is such a hit. Flora and Foxy, two fluffy little rescue dogs, follow Anthony everywhere. He assures me they can take visitors on a garden tour themselves, should he be unavailable.

Andromeda Botanical Garden

Iris Bannochie (1914 –1988) is renowned for her botanical knowledge (she won the RHS Veitch medal, its highest accolade for plantsmanship) but is mostly remembered by locals for her eccentricities (and liking for a drink). She made this garden at Bathsheba, on the east coast, on land that had been in her family since 1740. The site is littered with huge boulders; it is named after the Greek legend of Andromeda, a maiden who was chained to a rock. Iris donated the garden to the Barbados National Trust after her death.

Bathsheba, on the east coast of Barbados

Iris travelled the world, always looking out for new plants. More than 1,200 species are represented in the garden; about 75 per cent of them, and 90 per cent of the palms, were introduced to Barbados by her.

As I wander around, it is the sea views and the trees that really strike me. Near the entrance is a huge schleffera, with octopus-like fruits that attract flocks of native yellow breasts. Further along is a common screwpine (Pandanus utilis), a variegated form from Sri Lanka, once used in basket-making. I’ve noticed it lining the roadsides, usually ragged and forlorn. Here it spreads out, supported by a mass of prop roots, and makes a firework explosion of stripy foliage.

There are beautiful breadfruit trees, introduced by Captain Bligh (of 'Bounty’ fame) to feed the slaves, or so legend has it. And the fish poison tree (Barringtonia asiatica), which is bat- and moth-pollinated. The seeds are traditionally ground up and used to stun fish in freshwater streams. Everywhere a climber (Petrea volubilis) from central America scrambles about, with flowers in purple or white. It is known locally as sandpaper plant because the rough leaves were once used to smooth furniture.

Andromeda is still a centre of learning. Gardeners from the Eden Project in Cornwall are arriving soon to begin a classification project. There are also plans to start a native garden: the forests were cut down over 250 years ago to clear land for sugar cane, which explains why the famous bearded fig is now a rarity, even at Andromeda.

Fisher Pond House

While waiting for John Chandler to answer the bell I admire a fine pair of tree ferns flanking the door of his elegant plantation house. South American macaws squawk in the garden, and glittering chandeliers hang in reception. There’s a whiff of glamour in the air.

I soon learn why. John was a good friend of the late Colin Tennant, owner of Mustique. They got to know each other because John used to own the Ocean View hotel, a stopover where anyone (who was anyone) would shack up in luxury for a night or two en route to that most exclusive of islands. He gave up the hotel and moved to Fisher Pond House 16 years ago, but his reputation still draws the great and good for open-house lunches during high season.

The garden is organised as a gallery of spacious rooms. Theatrically decayed statues and fountains bought at local auctions pop up in strategic places. The old driveway is now a paved promenade flanked by John’s “English” borders: a riot of busy Lizzies and petunias mingled with gloriosa vine, roses and hibiscus.

John’s ethos is typified by a curlicued iron umbrella stand, which once belonged to Randolph Hearst: an accessory for the vines dangling over the portico. Coral stone walls and terraces ripple out from the house. Lunch is served against a background of frog croaks and birdsong, rather than breaking waves. Book in advance.

Bentham’s House

Helen Knighton’s home is a place of dedicated plantsmanship. She’s a personality most British gardeners would recognise - a small nursery owner with encyclopedic plant knowledge and firm opinions, generous with her advice (she runs a blog, My Rustic Bajan Garden) and her plants.

An old plantation house, Bentham’s majors in waterlilies and anything else that Helen is currently interested in. Between polytunnels, shade houses and borders, this adds up to a lot of plants; she seems to have grown everything.

Noticeable are the raised concrete ponds filled with colourful waterlilies. The 2ft-high walls keep out frogs, which are not the quiet sort we are used to: “At night it sounded as though someone was mowing the grass,” says Helen.

In this plot, giant plants rub shoulders with experiments and collections. The driveway is dominated by an enormous tamarind tree with ferns growing in the folds of its trunk. Beside this, in a pot, sits an anthurium from the Amazon, like a houseplant prop from Honey I Shrunk the Kids. In another spot is one of the best Bismarckii palms I’ve ever seen.

I notice a bronze-leaved ground cover with mauve flowers. “Martinique Kofia,” she says. “It’s not green, so not popular with clients,” she adds with a sigh.

Sugarcane fields in south west Barbados

Windblown, St Philip

The organisation that draws all these different gardens and gardeners together is the Barbados Horticultural Society (BHS), which wins gold at Chelsea Flower Show every year.

Orson Daisley, a retired police officer, will be its president in 2013. He and his wife Madeline are based at the appropriately named Windblown on the south coast, away from the tourist hotspots and not an easy place to garden. They have to deal with a keen salt wind, sandy thin soil and only 40 inches of rainfall a year. This is a niche for a different plant palette from the lush inland look. They have created an immaculate garden, using drought-tolerant Mediterranean plants. It will be on the BHS open gardens tour this season, an annual event (see box) and big weekend in the social calendar, along with the BHS show, also in January.

The Daisleys only moved in six years ago (having worked in Bermuda for many years), but lost no time getting to grips with the garden. A system for collecting rainwater was a must, and Orson planted a windbreak oleander hedge with a groundcover of variegated zeezee plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia, familiar to us as a tough houseplant) as a salt-tolerant barrier. It has done a quick job of sheltering the garden.

As with many gardening marriages, the couple have separate areas. Orson claims the vegetable garden, while Madeline has colonised sunny corners with her prize-winning collection of cacti and succulents. She has sculpted mini desertscapes, using variegated crown of thorns, sansieveras, and desert roses with their bulbous trunks.
